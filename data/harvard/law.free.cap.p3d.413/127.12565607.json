After a full evidentiary hearing, the district court, on its own motion, entered a temporary custody modification order rather than a final order. The temporary order was, in effect, a trial co-parenting plan that would become permanent after seven months unless either parent first requested a new hearing to establish that it was \"unworkable.\" Father filed such a motion, and the district court held a second evidentiary hearing, after which the district court entered a final order granting primary custody of the children to Father. The district court also held Appellant, Amy Womack (Mother), in contempt of court for violating terms of the initial temporary order. Mother appeals both decisions. Although we find that the district court abused its discretion when it entered the temporary custody order, we affirm the district court's permanent custody modification. However, we reverse the contempt finding against Mother and remand Mother's contempt motion against Father to the district\n   court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b62] Mother presents two issues, which we rephrase as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1.

Did the trial court erroneously hold Mother in contempt and factor that contempt into its decision to modify custody?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Temporary Order\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b63] In April 2009, after a five-year marriage and the birth of two children, Mother and Father divorced on stipulated terms granting Mother the primary care, custody, and control of the children subject to reasonable visitation by Father. Mother states that \"that was the last time the parties agreed upon anything\" and the formidable record of contentious post-decree litigation corroborates this assertion. In March 2015, Father filed a Verified Petition to Modify Custody, Visitation and Child Support. After approximately nine months of discovery and competing pretrial motions, the district court held a 2\u00bd-day hearing in January 2016. At the hearing, the court heard the testimony of five lay witnesses and four expert witnesses, and received approximately 175 exhibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b64] Father sought primary custody of the children, alleging, among other things, that Mother was systematically alienating the children from him\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and suffered from a drinking problem. To support his allegation of alienation, Father introduced numerous emails, text messages, and audio recordings documenting Mother's behavior. Among many examples, Mother told or texted Father: \"I'm going to tell the kids that you don't want to see them ... [and] that you're choosing your girlfriend over them\"; \"I do not like [your girlfriend] and will make sure the kids don't either\"; \"I'll make sure the kids know you're choosing the b**** over them.\" Additionally, Mother would not allow the children to take their stuffed animals to Father's home and, during Father's visitation time, Mother texted pictures of herself with the stuffed animals to the children with the message \"Puppy and Lamby miss you ... [w]e want to have a playdate with you.\" Father also presented evidence that Mother, while insisting that Father contact the children only via the daughter's cell phone, blocked his phone number on that phone-thus explaining why the children were not answering his calls. To support his allegation that Mother had a drinking problem, Father presented Mother's bank records showing regular alcohol purchases, financed by either child support payments or her retirement savings, and Mother's own testimony that she had been arrested three times for DWUI. Father had recently remarried and believed that his new, blended family offered a stable support system for the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b65] Mother, on the other hand, sought to keep primary custody of the children and to reduce Father's visitation time with the children, alleging that Father was a controlling, abusive, and dangerous person who became interested in becoming the primary custodial parent only after Mother sought an increase in child support. Mother denied that she had a drinking problem. Mother admitted that she had engaged in alienating behavior but, with ongoing therapy, she was \"taking steps to change some of these behaviors.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b66] Approximately four weeks after the hearing, the district court issued a \"Temporary Order for Modification of Visitation\" (the Temporary Order). The district court found four material changes of circumstances: Mother's diagnosis of breast cancer ; Mother's unemployment during cancer treatment; Father's remarriage that brought step-siblings into his home; and-\"the biggest material change in circumstances\"-Mother's behaviors that were \"likely to result in\" alienating the children from their Father. The district court found that Father also engaged in alienating behavior, and \"this is a\n   close call.\" The district court stated: \"With all the instability the children have experienced in the past few years, the Court is reluctant to add to [the children's] burden by transferring primary custody away [from Mother],\" yet \"[a]t the same time, if the relationship between [Father] and the children is actually being threatened, the Court may not have any other options.\" Ultimately, the court decided that, although Mother's behavior was \"likely to result in\" harm, the harm had not yet resulted (the children had not rejected Father), and the court could not justify awarding custody to Father at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b67] The district court therefore determined that \"the most appropriate solution at this time\" was a temporary one (the court's \"last effort to help the parties co-parent their children\"). Under the Temporary Order, the parents would continue to share time equally with the children and Mother would continue to be the primary custodial parent, but, in order to minimize conflict, the court changed the visitation schedule to reduce the number of exchanges. The order would remain in place for over seven months until October 2016, at which time it would become final-unless, prior to that date, either party requested a hearing to \"establish that this custody arrangement is unworkable.\" At such a hearing, if the parties were \"unable to agree that this arrangement is in the best interests of the children,\" or if \"parental alienation continues to occur,\" the court would enter a \"final order\" which would \"determine[ ] the long-term custody of the children\" and \"likely decrease the visitation of one of the parties.\" The district court also found that \"quite possibly\" Mother had an alcohol problem that \"may have been a significant factor in exacerbating the confrontations between the parties.\" For this reason, the district court also ordered Mother \"not to consume any alcohol when the children are in her custody.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Final Order\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b68] Five months later, Father requested a hearing pursuant to the Temporary Order. There followed approximately 30 pretrial filings by the parties, including contempt motions from each party alleging various violations of the district court's orders. In March 2017-more than one year after entering the Temporary Order and nearly two years after Father filed the initial petition-the district court held a second hearing on Father's petition for modification. The parties presented 10 witnesses and introduced approximately 46 exhibits. Along with witness testimony, Father presented new audio recordings and photographs evidencing Mother's continued attempts to alienate the children from Father and her alcohol consumption in the presence of the children. Father's expert witness testified that, due to Mother's alienation, the children (now ages 9 and 12) had begun to reject Father. On these grounds, Father requested primary custody of the children and a substantial period of no contact between Mother and the children. Mother denied that the children were rejecting Father, denied consuming alcohol while the children were in her care, and contended that Father had violated various terms of the Temporary Order. Mother requested the court to limit Father's visitation to alternating weekends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b69] Approximately one month later, the district court issued its Decision and Order Modifying Custody (the Final Order). The district court stated that it had intended the Temporary Order to be a \"message\" or a \"signal\" to Mother \"that her alienating and controlling behaviors would not be tolerated,\" and Mother \"did not heed that warning.\" The court found a material change in circumstances since the entry of the Temporary Order: the likelihood of harm to the children due to Mother's alienating behavior had \"switched from potential to palpable\"-in other words, the children were now rejecting Father. After considering the factors provided by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2020-2-201\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 20-2-201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), the district court granted primary custody of the children to Father and reduced Mother's visitation. The district court also found Mother to be in contempt of the court's Temporary Order due to her consumption of alcohol in the presence of the children and her continued alienating behavior. Mother timely appealed the district court's modification of custody and its finding of contempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. Did the trial court erroneously issue a temporary order instead of a final order following an evidentiary hearing on the merits of the case?\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b610] Mother alleges that the district court erred by entering a temporary custody modification order after a full evidentiary hearing. As a result of the court's error, she argues, the Temporary Order: (1) constituted a final judgment, precluding subsequent adjudication of the same issues under the doctrine of res judicata; and (2) created a modification procedure that denied her due process when the district court held a second hearing to permanently modify the custody of the children. We will first consider whether the district court improperly issued the Temporary Order. We will then address whether the transgression resulted in a final judgment, precluding a subsequent adjudication of the same issues under res judicata, or a violation of due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.

This temporary order is the Court's last effort to help the parties co-parent their children, and is believed to be in the best interests of the children.

She filed motions for equal allocation of time, to allow telephonic testimony, for sequestration of witnesses, for in camera interview of the children, to strike one of Father's witnesses, to strike Father's audio recordings of Mother and the children, and to strike Father's exhibits. Approximately six weeks before the hearing, she filed her witness and exhibit list, along with pretrial disclosures. She filed expert disclosures more than three months before the hearing. Father also filed Rule 26 disclosures and supplemental disclosures. At the hearing, Mother presented 5 witnesses and introduced 31 exhibits. In sum, Mother had a meaningful opportunity to prepare and to be heard.

The district court issued an order to show cause upon Mother's motion and set the hearing to take place at the same time as the modification hearing. Father filed two contempt motions which alleged various violations of the Temporary Order, including Mother's continued alienating behavior and her consumption of alcohol while the children were in her custody. The district court did not issue an order to show cause upon either of Father's motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   [\u00b627] The parties presented evidence that related to their contempt motions at the second hearing. The court admitted copies of\n   Mother's unreimbursed bills for counseling and flu shots. Mother's counsel cross-examined Father on the bills, and Father admitted that he had not reimbursed Mother, but testified that his refusal to do so was justified. Father presented a witness who testified that he had observed Mother at a Laramie hotel ordering and drinking wine with the children present, which was corroborated by photographs. Mother testified that the wine was non-alcoholic. However, the hotel's food-and-beverage manager later testified that the hotel did not serve non-alcoholic wine. Father also presented substantial evidence of Mother's continued alienating behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   [\u00b628] In the Final Order, the district court found that Mother was drinking wine \"which was NOT non-alcoholic, in the presence of her children in willful violation of the\n   <em>\n    Temporary Order\n   </em>\n   .\" The court also found that Mother \"has continued her alienating behaviors.\" The district court factored these findings into its decision to hold Mother in contempt of court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.

For this reason, we find that the district court abused its discretion and reverse its contempt holding against Mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   [\u00b631] Mother suggests that the district court modified custody of the children to penalize her contempt.

It is difficult to untangle the competing contempt motions, as the court resolved Father's motion by denying Mother the relief she requested in her motion (even though Father's motion did not request this relief). The record shows that the district court received ample evidence of Father's refusal to reimburse Mother's expenses and specifically ordered Father not to pay those expenses (effectively ordering Mother to pay the expenses). However, the court based its ruling on Mother's contempt-which we now reverse. We therefore remand Mother's contempt motion to the district court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C.

Therefore, we will review the district court's consideration of Mother's alcohol use and alienating behavior in its decision to modify custody and visitation. Because custody and visitation are committed to the sound discretion of the trial court, we review the district court's decision for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ransom v.

Stat. Ann. \u00a7 20-2-201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (LexisNexis 2017). The court found that Mother's alcohol use impaired her fitness as a parent under \u00a7 20-2-201(a)(iii) and demonstrated a lack of mental ability to care for the children under \u00a7 20-2-201(a)(ix). The court found that Mother's continued alienating behavior undermined the quality of the children's relationship with Father under \u00a7 20-2-201(a)(i) ; demonstrated that she was unwilling to accept all responsibilities of parenting under \u00a7 20-2-201(a)(iv) ; interfered with Father's communication and interaction with the children under \u00a7 20-2-201(a)(vi) ; disrespected Father's rights and responsibilities under \u00a7 20-2-201(a)(vii) ; exhibited a lack of mental ability to care for the children under \u00a7 20-2-201(a)(ix) ; and jeopardized the long-term well-being of the children under \u00a7 20-2-201(a)(x) (other factors). The district court's analysis was thorough and sound. In light of the clear evidence of Mother's consumption of alcohol while the children were in her custody and her continued alienation of the children from Father, and the reasonable placement of such behaviors within the enumerated factors of \u00a7 20-2-201(a), we find that the court did not abuse its discretion when it considered such conduct in its decision to modify custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   [\u00b635] While the district court abused its discretion by issuing an ongoing temporary\n   order that improperly extended the pendency of the custody modification proceeding, it did not result in a final order barring further adjudication of the issues under the doctrine of res judicata or create a procedure that denied due process to Mother. Additionally, it was within the sound discretion of the district court to factor Mother's consumption of alcohol in the presence of the children and alienation of the children from Father into its decision to modify custody. However, the district court abused its discretion when it held Mother in contempt of court and improperly factored Mother's contempt into her motion against Father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   [\u00b636] We affirm the district court's modification of custody. We reverse the district court's contempt holding against Mother and remand Mother's contempt motion against Father for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   FOX, J., delivers the opinion of the Court; BURKE, C.J., files a concurring in part and dissenting in part opinion, in which KAUTZ, J., joins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   BURKE, Chief Justice, concurring in part and dissenting in part, in which KAUTZ, Justice, joins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   [\u00b637] I concur in that part of the majority opinion affirming the district court's decision. I write separately for two reasons. First, I do not find it appropriate or necessary to consider Appellant's complaints about the temporary order. Second, I take exception to the majority's conclusion that the district court abused its discretion in entering the temporary order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   [\u00b638] The district court's temporary order granted both parties the opportunity to request a hearing if either of them determined that the custody arrangement was not workable or not in the best interests of the children. Appellant now contends that, under the facts presented, it was not appropriate to enter a temporary order at all. However, she did not present this argument to the district court or otherwise object to the temporary order at any time prior to entry of the final order. Rather, she raised her objection to the temporary order only after she disagreed with the final order which placed custody with Appellee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   [\u00b639] As the majority recognizes, \"We generally do not consider issues not presented to the district court unless they are so fundamental they must be considered, or if they concern matters of jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Tracy v.

In\n   <em>\n    Tracy\n   </em>\n   , we reviewed the procedure involved in granting a temporary order because that issue affects many temporary custody proceedings. In contrast, Appellant's arguments are entirely dependent on the unique facts of this case. The issues raised now are not so fundamental that they should be reviewed by this Court. If Appellant had concerns, she should have brought them to the attention of the district court. Her failure to do so should preclude our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   [\u00b640] Further, even if the court's issuance of a\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   temporary order could be deemed so fundamental that it must be considered, I would find no abuse of discretion in the court's approach. From my perspective, the court should be commended for its efforts in fashioning a remedy that was in the best interests of the children. It explained its reasoning in a comprehensive ten-page order. We should defer to that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   [\u00b641] We have long recognized that \"Judicial discretion is a composite of many things, among which are conclusions drawn from objective criteria; it means exercising sound judgment with regard to what is right under the circumstances and without doing so arbitrarily or capriciously.\"\n   <em>\n    Jensen v.

But, we are not dealing with \"some case.\" We are reviewing the best interest determination that was made in this case. Here, the district court determined that a temporary order was appropriate to promote stability for the children. In its order, the court first outlined the changes that had occurred since the original divorce decree:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   Plaintiff was diagnosed and treated for breast cancer. Plaintiff was unemployed for more than a year as she underwent treatment for her breast cancer. Defendant has been in serious romantic relationships, has remarried, and the children now have several new step-siblings. In addition, there have been a number of instances of parental alienation that have occurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   It then addressed the question presented and, in doing so, specifically expressed concerns about the instability that the children had been experiencing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   The Court has been primarily asked to determine whether a modification of custody would be in the best interests of the children. In particular, Defendant asks this court to modify custody and place the children in his primary care. The children are currently placed with the Plaintiff, who has been their primary caregiver for their entire lives. With all the instability the children have experienced in the past few years, the Court is reluctant to add to their burden by transferring primary custody away [from] the Plaintiff. At the same time, if the relationship between Defendant and the children is actually being threatened, the Court may not have any other options. Both parties have presented their arguments well and this is a close call.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   The Court is very aware that most child custody cases involve some degree of parental alienation. This alienation is a natural result of the high tensions and emotional turmoil involved in a custody dispute. A problem arises, however, when one parent is specifically exacerbating the situation and actively manipulating feelings of ill-will between a parent and child. Whether or not Plaintiff intended to engage in parental alienation, there is no doubt that Plaintiff's behaviors meet the benchmarks of alienation. On the other hand, it is very likely that Plaintiff may have simply been reacting out of a fear that she might \"lose\" her kids, that the kids will like Defendant and his new wife, and enjoy spending time with them rather than with her. Even if that is so, Plaintiff's behavior has unnecessarily created additional stress on the children, and her behavior is inexcusable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The court elaborated on its concerns about parental alienation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   Defendant has had the difficult task of showing how Plaintiff's behaviors caused a material change in circumstances affecting the children. Due to the nature of parental alienation, however, Defendant is only able to show an increased likelihood of harm in the future. Without a palpable harm or change at the present time, it is difficult to justify a modification of custody from one parent to the other. This is especially true, since the children presently have a good relationship with both parents. On the other hand, at the point where Plaintiff has successfully alienated the children from the Defendant, it is far too late for the Court to intercede.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   It also recognized that, in the past, guidance from the court had been beneficial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   It is apparent to the Court, that absent the parties' misbehavior, the parties are both very good parents to their children. It is very much in the children's best interests that they continue to have frequent contact with both of their parents. The Court has observed that the parties are better able to co-parent whenever the Court has provided more specific guidance. The added guidance has helped to minimize contact between the parties and increase the parties['] understanding of what is expected of them. In fact, many of the incidents of parental alienation and major\n   discord between the parties occurred between 2011 and 2014. The parties' more recent history suggests that many of these problems have been dissipated to some extent, and that there is a good chance that the parties can successfully cooperate for the well-being of their children.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Ultimately, the court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   After careful consideration, the Court has determined that the most appropriate solution at this time is to order that the parties must temporarily co-parent the children, with Plaintiff continuing as the designated primary or custodial parent of the children. Each parent will have the children for alternating two week periods. The parties reside in close proximity to each other, and this will not present a burden on the children. Defendant has the financial means to provide separate clothing and necessities for the children, so that the children are not required to constantly move all their belongings from home to home. The children will be able to attend the same school and continue their lives with minimal interruption. This will allow the children time to adjust to living with their new step-siblings and step-mom. At the same time, they will continue to have much of the stability that Plaintiff has provided the children. In addition, this will further decrease the extent that the parties are forced to interact with each other, by limiting the number of exchanges that occur.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   [\u00b643] Our standard of review for finding an abuse of discretion is, appropriately, a high one. Here, the district court clearly made a decision that it considered to be in the best interests of the children. That decision was made in furtherance of promoting stability for the children. The court's reasoning is sound and the decision cannot be considered arbitrary or capricious. I would conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Parental alienation, as defined by the district court, \"generally means a child in a divorce situation unjustifiably rejects one parent based on negative influence from the other parent.\" This accords with the definition offered by Father's expert witness.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    This is not to say that anytime a fundamental right is at issue, we will review it regardless of whether it was raised below.
