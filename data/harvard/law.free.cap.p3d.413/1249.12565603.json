Dominguez asked the superior court to remand the charge for redetermination, arguing the prosecutor violated his due-process rights by failing to properly instruct the grand jury on premeditation. The superior court denied the motion. We accept jurisdiction of Dominguez's petition for special action and grant relief insofar as we hold that when a grand jury is considering a first-degree murder charge, the prosecutor may not instruct the jury on \"premeditation\" by simply reciting the statutory definition of that term. Instead, due process requires the prosecutor to instruct the jury as the supreme court mandated in\n   <em>\n    State v.

At the outset of the grand jury proceeding that day, the prosecutor instructed the grand jury as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   This is the investigation of Edgar A. Dominguez. This investigation involves alleged first degree murder and aggravated assault, both of which occurred on or about May 1st of 2017 in Maricopa County, Arizona.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   To assist you in determining whether or not probable cause exists in this matter, the following statutes may be appropriate: ARS Section 13-105, 13-1105, 13-1101, 13-1203, and 13-1204.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Each of these statutes has been previously read to the grand jury panel with all members present according to Maricopa County attorney records on February 6th of 2017.

He argued the Arizona Supreme Court ruled in\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   that due process barred the use in a first-degree murder trial of a jury instruction that merely recites the\n   definition of \"premeditation\" in Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") section 13-1101 (2018).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court in that case held the superior court erred by instructing the jury using the statutory definition because that definition could mislead juries by \"needlessly emphasiz[ing] the rapidity with which reflection may occur.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"732477\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/204/471/#p479\">\n    204 Ariz. at 479, \u00b6 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"732477\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/204/471/#p479\">\n    65 P.3d 420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Further, when the grand jury is about to hear evidence on a first-degree murder charge and the prosecutor asks the jurors whether they want to have any statutes reread or clarified, when it comes to the term \"premeditation,\" the prosecutor may not simply refer the jurors to the statutory definition, but must refer them to the expanded and clarified\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 14 In its response to Dominguez's petition for special action, the State asserted for the first time that when the grand jury that indicted Dominguez first convened on February 6, 2017, the prosecutor did indeed provide the grand jurors with a definition of \"premeditation\" that satisfied\n   <em>\n    Thompson's\n   </em>\n   mandate. Dominguez disputes that the instruction satisfied the due-process concerns that\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   addressed. The superior court has not had an opportunity to consider that issue because that court was not presented with a transcript of the February 6 proceeding in connection with the motion to remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 15 Additionally, the transcript of the beginning of the May 10 proceeding at which the grand jury indicted Dominguez shows that the prosecutor referred the grand jury to a handful of statutes, including \u00a7 13-1101, without mentioning any expanded and clarified definition of \"premeditation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   Although the transcript reflects that the prosecutor reminded the grand jurors that they had received written copies of the relevant statutes, including \u00a7 13-1101, the transcript does not reflect whether the grand jurors also were given written copies of any clarification pertaining to \"premeditation\" that the prosecutor provided to the grand jury when it first convened. Accordingly, on this record alone, we are unable to determine whether the prosecutor properly complied with\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    O'Meara.

Instead, to avoid the constitutional infirmities in the statutory definition, the prosecutor must give the grand jury an expanded and clarified definition of \"premeditation\" as set out in\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   . We remand this matter to the superior court so that it can determine whether the instructions the prosecutor gave to the grand jury that indicted Dominguez complied with\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    O'Meara\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Absent material revision after the relevant date, we cite a statute's most current version.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Upon deciding to exercise our discretion, we issued an order accepting jurisdiction and granting partial relief to Dominguez, advising that an opinion would follow.
