The mailed notice gives the voter additional time to sign the ballot declaration or to provide a new signature to the auditor. The same Washington statute directs the county auditor to telephone such voters if they do not respond to mailed notice. At the conclusion of a Moses Lake School District bond election, Grant County Auditor Michelle Jaderlund mailed notice to such defective signature voters but did not call voters who failed to respond to the mailing. The petitioners, six Moses Lake School District voters, ask us to invalidate the election. Based on the distinction between directory and mandatory duties, the doctrine of substantial compliance, and other election challenge principles, we deny the request and affirm the superior court's dismissal of this election challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 2 On February 14, 2017, Moses Lake School District held a special election that sought approval of a $135 million bond measure. The bonds intended to raise funds for a new elementary school and new high school. We do not know the publicity given to the election in the Moses Lake vicinity. We do not know if the Valentine's Day ballot contained any candidate races or other measure elections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 3 One hundred twenty-six ballots submitted for the bond measure contained either a mismatched signature or no signature. A mismatched signature occurs when the Grant County auditor determines the signature on the ballot envelope looks dissimilar to the voter's signature on file with the auditor's elections division. Pursuant to law, Grant County Auditor Michele Jaderlund mailed a letter and a correction form to each voter who failed to sign the ballot envelope. The letter requested that the voter sign the form so that election authorities could include his or her vote in the election's tally. The Grant County auditor also mailed a letter to voters with mismatched signatures, which letter directed the voter to journey to the auditor's office to update his or her signature so that election officials would include his or her vote in the bond measure's count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 4 Ninety-five residents rectified their ballot signatures and the Grant County auditor included their votes when tabulating results in the Moses Lake School District bond election. Thirty-one voters did not respond to Michele Jaderlund's letters. The record does not indicate that the postal service returned any of the auditor's letters as undeliverable. The auditor did not attempt to make telephone contact with the thirty-one voters who failed to cure their ballots. Of the thirty-one voters, twenty-four had telephone numbers on file with the auditor. We will refer to these twenty-four electors as the \"uncalled voters\" throughout the opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 5 The Moses Lake School District bond measure required a sixty percent vote for passage. 5,678 votes favored the bond measure and 3,781 votes opposed the measure. Under this count, a supermajority of 60.03 percent voted in favor, with the measure passing by two votes. Obviously, the uncalled voters could have changed the outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 6 On February 24, 2017, the Grant County auditor certified the ballot outcome. Also on February 24, the Grant County Canvassing Board certified the passage of the measure. During the February 24 canvass, the canvassing board rejected all thirty-one ballots, for which the auditor received no response from her letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   PROCEDURE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 7 On March 8, 2017, six registered voters filed this election contest petition in superior court. The petitioners claim that Grant County Auditor Michele Jaderlund engaged in\n   misconduct by having failed to telephone the twenty-four voters as directed by Washington statute. The petitioners seek annulment of the Moses Lake School District bond measure election. Each petitioner signed and filed an affidavit, with the petition, that informed the court of the basis for the election contest and declared him or her to be a registered voter within the Moses Lake School District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 8 On March 9, the Grant County Canvassing Board conducted a mandatory recount because of the closeness of the vote. The recount did not change the result, and, on March 10, the canvassing board certified the outcome a second time. The board did not seek corrected votes from the thirty-one voters whose ballots the auditor did not count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 9 The record does not reflect how the thirty-one voters, whose votes the Grant County auditor did not count, had voted or would have voted. The parties stipulated that contacting the thirty-one voters during the course of this litigation would be inappropriate and that the thirty-one rejected ballots could no longer be counted or opened. The parties also stipulated that the superior court should not speculate as to how the uncalled voters would vote.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 10 Grant County Auditor Michele Jaderlund filed a motion to dismiss the six voters' election contest petition. Thereafter, the court allowed seven registered voters to intervene in support of the auditor's motion. The intervenors then sought to dismiss the petition as untimely filed. The trial court ruled that the petitioners timely filed their petition, but ruled in favor of the Grant County auditor on the merits. We agree with both of the trial court's rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   LAW AND ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Statute of Limitations\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 11 On appeal, Grant County Auditor Michele Jaderlund and the intervenors renew the argument that petitioners untimely filed the election contest petition. A statute demands that an election contest be filed within ten days of the election's certification. The auditor and the intervenors contend that the ten-day period commenced on February 24, when the Grant County Canvassing Board first certified the passage of the measure, rather than March 10, when the canvassing board recertified the outcome. The petitioners filed their challenge on March 8. We disagree and hold that petitioners timely filed the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 12 RCW 29A.68.020 permits a registered voter to challenge in superior court the certification of the result of an election on any measure. The statute directs, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   All election contests must proceed under RCW 29A.68.011 or 29A.68.013.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In turn, RCW 29A.68.013 declares, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   An affidavit of an elector under this subsection shall be filed with the appropriate court no later than ten days following the official certification of the primary or election ...\n   <em>\n    or, in the case of a recount, ten days after the official certification of the amended abstract\n   </em>\n   as provided in RCW 29A.64.061.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Note that the statute refers to the affidavit signed by the elector challenger rather than a petition as ending the running of the ten days. Language throughout chapter 29A.68 RCW hints that only an affidavit need be filed, and no petition is necessary to initiate an election challenge. RCW 29A.68.011, .013, .020, .030, and .040.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 13 The Grant County auditor and the intervenors assert that the February 24 date controls the timeliness of the suit because the petitioners challenge the original certification, not the recount. They note that Washington law requires a recount of only those ballots actually tabulated in the initial count.\n   <em>\n    In re Election Contest Filed by Coday\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3893212\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/156/485/#p489\">\n    156 Wash.2d 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 489,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20P.3d%20809\">\n    130 P.3d 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006) ;\n   <em>\n    McDonald v. Reed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"875597\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/153/201/\">\n    153 Wash.2d 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=103%20P.3d%20722\">\n    103 P.3d 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). Also, a voter may not cure a missing or mismatched signature for purposes of counting the ballot in a recount. RCW 29A.60.165(3). Therefore, the conduct of Grant County Auditor Michele Jaderlund, challenged by the petitioners, occurred by the time of the original canvassing board certification and the recount lacks relevance to the challenge. The challengers do not challenge\n   the recount process. The board first certified the results on February 24, and the challengers filed the petition on March 8, twelve days later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 14 We generally give effect to a statute's plain meaning.\n   <em>\n    State v. Ervin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4010698\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/169/815/#p820\">\n    169 Wash.2d 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 820,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=239%20P.3d%20354\">\n    239 P.3d 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). RCW 29A.68.013 does not qualify the language that the affidavit must be filed within ten days of the recount. The statute does not direct the challenger to file the affidavit, regardless of a recount, within ten days of the first certification of the election if the petitioner only challenges conduct of an election official occurring before the first certification and only relevant to the first certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 15 Sound reason lies behind always allowing the petitioner to file the affidavit within ten days of the recount regardless of the nature of the challenge. The recount could change the result of the election and moot any challenge even if the challenge concerns conduct before the original certification. We note that petitioners filed their affidavits on March 8, two days before the recount, which date of filing clashes with waiting until recount results. Nevertheless, our analysis remains the same. RCW 29A.68.013 does not disregard early filing. Petitioners timely filed their affidavits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Election Irregularity\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 16 We now reach the merits of petitioners' challenge. Grant County Auditor Michelle Jaderlund received, as part of the Moses Lake School District bond measure, unsigned ballot envelopes and signed envelopes that failed to match the signatures of the voters in the auditor's register. RCW 29A.60.165 imposes obligations on the auditor on receiving such flawed ballots. RCW 29A.60.165(1) prescribes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   If the voter neglects to sign the ballot declaration, the auditor shall notify the voter by first-class mail and advise the voter of the correct procedures for completing the unsigned declaration. If the ballot is received within three business days of the final meeting of the canvassing board, or the voter has been notified by first-class mail and has not responded at least three business days before the final meeting of the canvassing board, then the auditor\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   attempt to notify the voter by telephone, using the voter registration record information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (Emphasis added.) In turn, RCW 29A.60.165(2)(a) demands:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   If the handwriting of the signature on a ballot declaration is not the same as the handwriting of the signature on the registration file, the auditor shall notify the voter by first-class mail, enclosing a copy of the declaration, and advise the voter of\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   the correct procedures for updating his or her signature on the voter registration file. If the ballot is received within three business days of the final meeting of the canvassing board, or the voter has been notified by first-class mail and has not responded at least three business days before the final meeting of the canvassing board, then the auditor\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   attempt to notify the voter by telephone, using the voter registration record information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Note that RCW 29A.60.165 mandates that the county auditor, when receiving either a mismatched or missing signature, must call the voter if the voter does not timely respond to notice by mail. The parties in our appeal agree that Grant County Auditor Michelle Jaderlund failed to make the phone calls despite having the phone numbers of twenty-four Moses Lake School District voters who failed to respond to the mailed notice of a flawed ballot signature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 17 RCW 29A.60.165 inserts the verb \"shall\" before the obligation to call, which word is presumptively imperative and operates to create a duty, rather than to confer discretion.\n   <em>\n    In re Parental Rights to K.J.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12452154\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/187/592/#p601\">\n    187 Wash.2d 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 601,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=387%20P.3d%201072\">\n    387 P.3d 1072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). Nevertheless, RCW 29A.60.165 does not expressly void the election if the auditor neglects one of her duties. RCW 29A.60.165 specifies no remedy to impose if the auditor omits the phone calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 18 Petitioners claim that the Grant County auditor's failure to telephone voters constitutes misconduct. RCW 29A.68.020 declares:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Any of the following causes may be asserted by a registered voter ... to challenge certification of the result of an election on any measure:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (1) For\n   <em>\n    misconduct\n   </em>\n   on the part of any election officer involved therein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Michelle Jaderlund requests that we not focus on whether her neglect constituted misconduct. Therefore, we assume, without deciding, that her neglect of duty comprised \"misconduct\" for purposes of RCW 29A.68.020. No cases construe what constitutes \"misconduct\" for purposes of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 19 Although RCW 29A.68.020 permits the bringing of a challenge on grounds of misconduct, the statute fails to expressly identify a basis on which the challenge will be successful. The statute may imply a successful challenge and the overturning of a vote on the showing of an election officer's misconduct. Case law, however, imposes restrictions on the ability to overturn election results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 20 Petitioners contend that RCW 29A.68.050 demands annulment of the vote if the auditor engages in misconduct. RCW 29A.68.050 describes the hearing for an election contest and reads, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   The court shall meet at the time and place designated to determine such contested election by the rules of law and evidence governing the determination of questions of law and fact, so far as the same may be applicable, and may dismiss the proceedings if the statement of the cause or causes of contest is insufficient, or for want of prosecution. After hearing the proofs and allegations of the parties, the court shall pronounce judgment in the premises, either confirming or annulling and setting aside such election, according to the law and right of the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We disagree that the statute demands voiding of the vote solely on proof of misconduct. The \"law and right of the case\" dictates a more extensive analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 21 Many Washington judicial decisions, particularly older dense decisions, address challenges to elections on the basis of election irregularities. The Washington Supreme Court has announced at least four nonexclusive principles, tests, or standards to apply when determining whether to overturn an election based on an irregularity. First, the court will affirm an election if the election officer violated a directory, rather than a mandatory, duty. Second, the court will not interfere in an election if the election officer substantially complied with a statutory duty. Third, the court will uphold an election unless the challenger can show that the irregularity likely led to a different result in the election. Fourth, and perhaps related to principle three, the court will validate an election, despite a variance from the terms of the statute, if the election was fair and sufficient electors participated in the election so that the election, as held, constituted a reliable expression of popular opinion. Sometimes, a court applies more than one standard in a decision. Nevertheless, the differing standards could lead to contrary outcomes in the same case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 22 We are unable to synthesize the four tests of election invalidity so we address each test separately. We invite our Supreme Court to integrate the standards into a unifying principle. We append to our opinion a list of Washington election decisions in which a voter challenges an election result because of an irregularity in the election process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 23 We first discuss mandatory versus directory duties with regard to election notice statutes. Washington follows the settled rule that the formalities of giving notice, although prescribed by statute, are merely directory, unless the statute declares that ignoring the formalities voids the election.\n   <em>\n    School Dist. 81 v.

The auditor received no return envelopes. Thus, all uncalled voters received actual notice of the defect and the need to perform some act in order to validate their vote.

The courts reasoned that the informal methods of notice assured all voters of the time, place, and subject of an election and weighed the informal notice as helping to satisfy substantial compliance with the notice statute. We recognize that the February 14, 2017 vote was not for a general election, and we do not know the extent of publicity or if the ballot contained another election. Nevertheless, all uncalled voters knew of the election since they voted. The uncalled voters also knew of the deficiency in his or her ballot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 36 In a passage that may intermingle the directory rule with the substantial compliance test, one Washington decision states the rule as: when a statute is directory, as opposed to mandatory, the statute is substantially complied with when an attempt has been made to comply with the statute.\n   <em>\n    School Dist.

Three votes could have changed the outcome. Nevertheless, we have no evidence that any of the uncalled voters would have corrected the signature if called, and, upon a correction, would have voted against the bond measure. Therefore, we cannot conclude that calling the voters would likely have altered the election result. For this additional reason, we affirm the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 39 The petitioners stipulated that the trial court should not speculate or attempt to determine how the results of the election would have been different if the Grant County auditor had attempted to notify voters by telephone.

We question our ability to apply this principle since we do not know the amount of publicity circulated in Moses Lake concerning the bond measure.

To bolster this argument, the petitioners observe that the auditor relies on preelection notice requirements, while this appeal concerns a post-election defect. Nevertheless, petitioners forward no decision that distinguishes, for purposes of election law, between preelection errors and post-election errors. Anyway, the uncalled voters had ample opportunity to vote and to correct their error. Ninety-five of the voters who forgot to sign the ballot envelope or whose signature mismatched the registered signature responded to the mailing. We have no facts of any of the uncalled voters encountering obstacles in correcting their incomplete ballot.
