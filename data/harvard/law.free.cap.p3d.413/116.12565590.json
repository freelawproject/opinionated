The motion to suppress Mr. Hardman's blood alcohol content is an issue that would likely be dispositive because a ruling in Mr. Hardman's favor would compel dismissal of the charges by suppressing essential evidence. A remand for further\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearings, however, could lead to a variety of outcomes, most of which would entail further proceedings without necessarily disposing of the case. We have said that the entire plea is invalid if it contains a non-dispositive issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8189973\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/197/1273/\">\n    2008 WY 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8189973\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/197/1273/\">\n    197 P.3d at 1280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
