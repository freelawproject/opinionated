Martinez was in confinement after pleading guilty to one count of first degree child rape. He argues that the ISRB does not have authority to prohibit him from entering into a geographical area as a condition of community custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 We hold that the ISRB has authority to prohibit an offender from entering into a geographical area as a condition of community custody under the circumstances of this case. However, we also hold that the condition as applied to Martinez unconstitutionally infringes on his right to travel because it does not include a clear process for requesting modification of the condition in light of changed circumstances. Consequently, we grant the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 On August 8, 2006, Martinez\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   pled guilty to one count of first degree child rape based on sexual contact he had with his nine year old nephew in May 2005 in Thurston County. The superior court entered a lifetime no-contact order prohibiting Martinez from contacting his victim. On September 27, Martinez was granted a Special Sex Offender Sentencing Alternative (SSOSA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 On September 21, 2009, Martinez's SSOSA was revoked \"after four separate violation processes,\" and he was placed in the custody of the Department of Corrections (DOC). Br. of Resp't at 64, Att. F; Br. of Resp't at 93, Att. I. The sentencing court did not require Martinez to remain within or outside a specified geographical boundary as a condition of community custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 RCW 9.95.420(1)(a) grants the ISRB authority to release a convicted sex offender based on predictions of sexual dangerousness. Specifically, under RCW 9.95.420(3)(a), the ISRB\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   shall order the offender released, under such affirmative and other conditions as the board determines appropriate, unless the board determines by a preponderance of the evidence that, despite such conditions, it is more likely than not that the offender will commit sex offenses if released.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   RCW 9.95.420(2) requires the ISRB to impose the conditions and instructions provided for in former RCW 9.94A.704 (2014), if the ISRB determines that an offender is suitable for community custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 On June 14, 2014, after holding a hearing, the ISRB determined that Martinez was suitable for release and directed the preparation of an Offender Release Plan (ORP). On April 17, 2015, Kristi Busch, a hearings investigator, prepared a report based on Martinez's proposed ORP and recommended that the ISRB require Martinez to \"not enter Thurston County\" without prior approval. Br. of Resp't at 102, Att. L. Busch noted in her report that the victim liaison assigned to Martinez's case had community concerns related to Thurston County. Martinez's ORP contained comments from his counselor that \"[Martinez] cannot [be] release[d] to his County of Origin due to Victim Concerns.\" Br. of Resp't at 106, Att. L.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 On April 30, 2015, the ISRB approved Martinez's ORP, and he was released to community custody on June 4. As a condition of community custody, the ISRB required Martinez to \"not enter Thurston County without prior written approval of [his] CCO [community corrections officer] and the ISRB.\" Br. of Resp't at 115, Att. O.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 In early 2016, Martinez's counsel contacted CCO Steven Pyka to request a change to Martinez's condition of community custody barring him from entering Thurston County. Martinez requested the change because he wanted to live with his parents and work for their pest control business in Thurston County. Martinez also anticipated that his parents would be able to assist him with his mental conditions, including several learning disorders and Asperger's Syndrome. Pyka informed Martinez's counsel that a change to his community custody condition \"would never happen,\" and that \"[t]he Board would have to approve that request.\" Reply Br. of Pet'r at 1. Martinez's counsel then contacted the ISRB, which told counsel that a request to modify conditions of community custody \"must come from the CCO.\" Reply Br. of Pet'r at 1. Martinez's counsel again contacted Pyka, but Pyka responded that \"he would not start this process.\" Reply Br. of Pet'r at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 On June 6, 2016, Martinez filed a motion to modify his conditions of community custody in Thurston County Superior Court. Martinez argued that the ISRB did not have authority under former RCW 9.94A.704 to prohibit him from entering a particular geographical area as a condition of community custody. On June 29, the superior court transferred Martinez's motion to modify to our court for consideration as a personal restraint petition (PRP). On February 2, 2017, we issued an order stating that the issues raised in the PRP were not frivolous and transferred the PRP to a panel for further consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   I. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 To obtain relief through a PRP, a petitioner must generally \"establish that a constitutional error has resulted in actual and substantial prejudice, or that a nonconstitutional error has resulted in a fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Pers. Restraint of Isadore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"428141\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/151/294/#p298\">\n    151 Wash.2d 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 298,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20P.3d%20390\">\n    88 P.3d 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). The Supreme Court has explained that \"[t]hese threshold requirements are justified by the court's interest in finality, economy, and integrity of the trial process and by the fact that the petitioner has already had an opportunity for judicial review.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . However, if a petitioner did not have an opportunity for prior judicial review, then the heightened threshold requirements applicable to PRPs do not apply, and he need only demonstrate that he is restrained under RAP 16.4(b) and that the restraint is unlawful under RAP 16.4(c).\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 299,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20P.3d%20390\">\n    88 P.3d 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Martinez has not had a prior opportunity for judicial review of his allegedly improper condition of community custody. Therefore, he must establish that (1) he is restrained and (2) his restraint is unlawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11 A petitioner is under a restraint if he or she has limited freedom because of a court decision in a civil or criminal proceeding, the petitioner is confined, the petitioner is subject to immediate confinement, or the petitioner is under some other disability resulting from a judgment or sentence in a criminal case. RAP 16.4(b). The condition forbidding Martinez from entering Thurston County limits his freedom and therefore places him under restraint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12 Under RAP 16.4(c), a restraint is unlawful if it falls into one of the categories listed in that rule. Of these, the one relevant to this appeal is RAP 16.4(c)(6) : \"the conditions or manner of the restraint of petitioner are in violation of the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution or laws of the State of Washington.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II. AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE GEOGRAPHICAL RESTRICTIONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 13 The ISRB argues that it may require Martinez to \"not enter Thurston County without prior written approval of [his] CCO and the ISRB,\" as a condition of community custody under former RCW 9.94A.704(3)(b) and RCW 9.95.420(3). Br. of Resp't at 12; Br. of Resp't at 115, Att. O. We agree that the ISRB has the authority to impose this condition under RCW 9.95.420(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Principles of Statutory Construction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 14 Although the State claims our review is for an abuse of discretion, we review a question of statutory interpretation de novo as a question of law.\n   <em>\n    Bostain v.

However, former RCW 9.94A.703(3)(a) (2009) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (3) .... As part of any term of community custody, the court may order an offender to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (a) Remain within, or outside of, a specified geographical boundary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In this subsection the legislature expressly authorizes a court to order an offender to remain outside an area, as well as within an area. This is one of the related statutory provisions we may consider in determining plain meaning.\n   <em>\n    Bostain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3592816\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/159/700/#p708\">\n    159 Wash.2d at 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=153%20P.3d%20846\">\n    153 P.3d 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Against this backdrop, the ISRB's proposed interpretation of former RCW 9.94A.704(3)(b) would require us to either add words to that statute, or render the distinction between \"[r]emain [ing] within, or outside of\" an area as articulated in former RCW 9.94A.703(3)(a) meaningless. Therefore, we hold that former RCW 9.94A.704(3)(b) does not authorize the ISRB to require an offender to remain outside of a particular geographic boundary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    RCW 9.95.420(3)(b)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 17 RCW 9.95.420(3)(b) states, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (b) .... The [ISRB] shall order the offender released, under such affirmative and other conditions as the [ISRB] determines appropriate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 18 From the plain language of this statute, the ISRB is authorized to impose \"other conditions as the [ISRB] determines appropriate,\" when releasing an offender. When adequately supported by the evidence, a condition requiring an offender to remain outside a county in which the victim resides or is present, for example, may be \"appropriate\" in carrying out the ISRB's authority. Therefore, we hold that RCW 9.95.420(3) authorizes the ISRB to require an offender to remain outside of a particular geographic boundary if appropriate under governing legal standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   III. RIGHT TO TRAVEL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 19 Although we hold that the ISRB has authority to require an offender to remain outside a geographic boundary, such authority is subject to constitutional limitations, including the right to travel. While we generally limit our discussion to the issues raised by the parties, we have \"the authority to determine whether a matter is properly before the court, to perform those acts which are proper to secure fair and orderly review, and to waive the rules of appellate procedure when necessary to 'serve the ends of justice.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

We have previously noted that \"[a]t a minimum, dumping convicts on a city, county, or state neighbor is bound to raise public policy concerns,\" and \"[a]t the most, banishment orders encroach on an individual's constitutional right to travel, which includes the right to travel within a state.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The order banishing Martinez from Thurston County thus has a clear potential to infringe Martinez's constitutional right to travel.

We held that the order banishing Schimelpfenig was overly broad and not narrowly tailored to serve the State's interests, reasoning:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   There is no evidence in the record that Schimelpfenig ever posed a threat to [the victim's] family or that he has desired continued contact with them when he is released. There also is no evidence that the [victim's] family frequents so much of the 1,917 square miles of Grays Harbor County as to justify a countywide ban. Moreover, the record suggests that Schimelpfenig has some form of mental disability and, as a result of this disability, he has lived with his family in Grays Harbor County for his entire life. Banning him for life from residing in the county is therefore likely to heavily burden his family and be counterproductive to rehabilitation. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   The facts of this case suggest that a more narrowly-tailored restriction would satisfactorily protect the [victim's] family from being reminded of their loss.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 230,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20P.3d%20338\">\n    115 P.3d 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 24 In the present case, Martinez's victim continued to reside in Thurston County after Martinez's crime.

The record shows that the ISRB was concerned about permitting Martinez to live in Thurston County because \"there are victim issues in that area.\" Br. of Resp't at 95, Att. I. Martinez asserts that his victim now lives in Texas. DOC has not submitted any evidence suggesting that Martinez's victim does not currently reside in Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 25 If Martinez's victim no longer resides in Thurston County, then the rationale for precluding Martinez from entering that county, that there may be concerns regarding his potential contact with his victim, has thoroughly evaporated. Similarly, if Martinez's victim no longer resides or is no longer present in Thurston County, the five principles from\n   <em>\n    Schimelpfenig\n   </em>\n   would strongly indicate that banning Martinez from Thurston County violates his right to travel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 26 The ISRB argues that our analysis in\n   <em>\n    Schimelpfenig\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the\n   present case because \"the [ISRB]'s condition [prohibiting Martinez from entering Thurston County] is subject to modification in the event of changed circumstances.\" Br. of Resp't at 18. However, the evidence submitted by Martinez shows that he does not have a readily available means to modify his community custody conditions. According to Martinez's attorney, the ISRB would not consider Martinez's request to change his community custody conditions unless the CCO initiated the process, and the CCO refused to even consider Martinez's request. Reply to Response to PRP, Decl. of Richard Woodrow, at 1. The ISRB has not submitted any evidence showing that Martinez has a clear means to request a modification of his conditions of community custody.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 27 Based on the evidence before us, Martinez has no readily available means of modifying his conditions of community custody, even when the justification for a condition ceases to exist. Rather, it appears that Martinez is entirely dependent on the discretion of his CCO, who may flatly refuse to initiate the community custody modification procedure with impunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 28 In the absence of a readily available means to modify his conditions, Martinez is effectively subject to a lifetime ban from Thurston County, even if changing circumstances remove any basis for prohibiting his presence in that county. On its face, as well as under the five\n   <em>\n    Schimelpfenig\n   </em>\n   principles, this violates Martinez's right to travel recognized by\n   <em>\n    Shapiro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Eggert\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Schimelpfenig.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 29 To preserve Martinez's right to travel, the ISRB must afford him a reasonable and readily available means of showing that his ban from Thurston County is no longer warranted under the factual circumstances. Without that, the ISRB's condition of community custody prohibiting Martinez from entering Thurston County violates his constitutional right to travel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 30 We grant Martinez's PRP, strike the condition of community custody prohibiting Martinez from entering Thurston County, and remand to the ISRB to reevaluate Martinez's conditions of community custody. At a minimum, the ISRB should hold a hearing that affords both parties a reasonable opportunity to present evidence and reasons why Martinez should or should not be barred from traveling to Thurston County. If reinstatement of the ban is sought, the ISRB shall evaluate the request under the\n   <em>\n    Schimelpfenig\n   </em>\n   principles discussed in this opinion and may reinstate the ban only if it is shown to be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Worswick, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Maxa, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    The record notes that Greg Martinez is also known as Greg Tower.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Of similar effect is RAP 12.1(b), which states, \"If the appellate court concludes that an issue which is not set forth in the briefs should be considered to properly decide a case, the court may notify the parties and give them an opportunity to present written argument on the issue raised by the court.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    We decline to accept the supplemental exhibits filed by the ISRB after oral argument in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
