RCW 48.01.030 imposes a duty of good faith on all persons engaged in the business of insurance, including individual adjusters. And the CPA does not require that a contractual relationship exist between the parties. Thus, we hold that an individual insurance adjuster may be liable for bad faith and CPA violations. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 Keodalah and a motorcyclist collided in April 2007. After Keodalah stopped at a stop sign and began to cross the street in his truck, a motorcyclist struck him. The collision killed the motorcyclist and injured Keodalah. Keodalah had purchased auto insurance from Allstate Insurance Company. Keodalah's insurance policy provided underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage. The motorcyclist was uninsured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 The Seattle Police Department (SPD) investigated the collision. The SPD determined the motorcyclist was traveling between 70 and 74 m.p.h. in a 30 m.p.h. zone. SPD reviewed keodalah's cell phone records. They showed that Keodalah was not using his cell phone at the time of the collision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Allstate also investigated the collision. Allstate interviewed several witnesses who said the motorcyclist was traveling faster than the speed limit, had proceeded between cars in both lanes, and had \"cheated\" at the intersection. Allstate hired an accident reconstruction firm, Traffic Collision Analysis Inc. (TCA), to analyze the collision. TCA found that Keodalah stopped at the stop sign, the motorcyclist was traveling at a minimum of 60 m.p.h., and the motorcyclist's \" 'excessive speed' \" caused the collision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Keodalah asked Allstate to pay him the limit of his UIM policy, $25,000. But Allstate refused. It offered $1,600 to settle the claim based on an assessment that Keodalah was\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   70 percent at fault. After Keodalah asked Allstate to explain its evaluation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Allstate increased its offer to $5,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Keodalah sued Allstate, asserting a UIM claim. Allstate designated Smith as its CR 30(b)(6) representative. Although Allstate possessed both the SPD report and TCA analysis, Smith claimed that Keodalah had run the stop sign and had been on his cell phone. Smith later admitted, however, that Keodalah had not run the stop sign and had not been on his cell phone. Before trial, Allstate offered Keodalah $15,000 to settle the claim. Keodalah refused and again requested the $25,000 policy limit. The case proceeded to a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 At trial, Allstate contended that Keodalah was 70 percent at fault. The jury determined the motorcyclist to be 100 percent at fault and awarded Keodalah $108,868.20 for his injuries, lost wages, and medical expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Keodalah filed a second lawsuit against Allstate and included claims against Smith. These included IFCA violations, insurance bad faith, and CPA violations. Allstate and Smith moved to dismiss the complaint under CR 12(b)(6). The trial court granted the motion in part. It dismissed Keodalah's claims against Smith and certified the case for discretionary review under RAP 2.3(b)(4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 This court granted discretionary review of the three issues: (1) whether IFCA creates a private cause of action for violation of a regulation, (2) whether an individual insurance adjuster may be liable for bad faith, and (3) whether an individual insurance adjuster may be liable for violation of the CPA. Later, our Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Perez-Crisantos v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   which forecloses Keodalah's IFCA claim. We now decide the other two issues involving bad faith and the CPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 The two issues before this court present unresolved legal questions on which courts have divided.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   We review legal questions de novo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Bad Faith\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 First, we must decide whether insureds may bring bad faith claims against individual insurance adjusters. RCW 48.01.030 imposes a duty of good faith on \"all persons\" involved in insurance, including the insurer and its representatives.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The business of insurance is one affected by the public interest, requiring that all persons be actuated by good faith, abstain from deception, and practice honesty and equity in all insurance matters. Upon the insurer, the insured, their providers, and their representatives rests the duty of preserving inviolate the integrity of insurance.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A person who violates this duty may be liable for the tort of bad faith.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   RCW 48.01.070 defines \"person\" as \"any individual, company, insurer, association, organization, reciprocal or interinsurance exchange, partnership, business trust, or corporation.\" Smith was engaged in the business of insurance and was acting as an Allstate representative. Thus, under the plain language of the statute, she had the duty to act in good faith. And she can be sued for breaching this duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b612 Division Three used this analysis in\n   <em>\n    Merriman v. American Guarantee &amp; Liability Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Merriman\n   </em>\n   interpreted the insurance bad faith statute to permit claims against corporate insurance adjusters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court reasoned,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   RCW 48.01.030 unambiguously applies to \"[t]he business of insurance,\" imposing requirements on \"all persons,\" and rests the duty of preserving inviolate the integrity of insurance on, among others, \"[the] representatives\" of the insurer. \"Person\" is defined by RCW 48.01.070 to mean \"any individual, company, insurer, association, organization, reciprocal or interinsurance exchange, partnership, business trust, or corporation.\" As an adjuster contracted by American Guarantee to act as its claims administrator, York was, at all relevant times, a \"person\" engaged in \"the business\n   of insurance\" and a representative of American Guarantee.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b613 In\n   <em>\n    Lease Crutcher Lewis WA, LLC v. National Union Fire Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   a federal district court judge applied a similar analysis. The\n   <em>\n    Lease\n   </em>\n   court reasoned,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   The insurance code of Washington applies to \"all insurance transactions ... and all persons having to do therewith....\" [ RCW 48.01.020 ]. \"Persons\" is defined to include corporations such as AIG Domestic Claims. RCW 48.01.070. More importantly, the legislature has expressly imposed an obligation of good faith on those who represent insurers and insureds.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Lease\n   </em>\n   went on to observe that the plaintiff alleged that the corporate adjuster \"acted on behalf of and with authority from\" the insurer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b614 Smith attempts to distinguish our case. She correctly notes that it involves an individual insurance adjuster while\n   <em>\n    Merriman\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lease\n   </em>\n   involved third-party companies adjusting claims. We do not find this distinction significant. Both\n   <em>\n    Merriman\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lease\n   </em>\n   relied on the broad statutory definition of \"person\" to decide that corporate adjusters owe a duty of good faith. The code's broad definition of \"person\" includes both individuals and corporations and does not make any distinction between the duties they owe. Nothing in the statute limits the duty of good faith to corporate insurance adjusters or relieves individual insurance adjusters from this duty. The duty of good faith applies equally to individuals and corporations acting as insurance adjusters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b615 Smith relies on\n   <em>\n    Garoutte v. American Family Mutual Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   There, a different federal district court judge reached a different conclusion.\n   <em>\n    Garoutte\n   </em>\n   does not persuade us.\n   <em>\n    Garoutte\n   </em>\n   specifically relied on the following sentence: \"Upon the insurer, the insured, their providers, and their representatives rests the duty of preserving inviolate the integrity of insurance.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court stated that \"the text of this sentence makes clear that it does not create a cause of action against representatives of insurance companies; otherwise, it would also create a cause of action for bad faith against \" 'the insured.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   But Washington courts have expressly stated that the statute does impose a duty of good faith on both the insureds and the insurer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Garoutte\n   </em>\n   also found the distinction between a corporate adjuster and individual employee adjuster significant. But the court did not explain this significance and merely stated that\n   <em>\n    Lease\n   </em>\n   \"explicitly confined its reasoning to the duties of third-party corporate entities, not to individuals directly employed by insurers.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Lease\n   </em>\n   stated that it need not decide \"whether [ RCW 48.01.030 ] gives rise to a bad faith claim against individuals directly employed by the insurer.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   But\n   the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Lease\n   </em>\n   applies equally to claims against individuals.\n   <em>\n    Lease\n   </em>\n   determined that insurance adjusters are representatives, who owe a duty of good faith under RCW 48.01.030.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Just as corporate insurance adjusters are representatives, so too are individual employee insurance adjusters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b616 Smith urges us to use the Washington Administrative Code (WAC) to interpret the relevant statutory language. She contends that the regulations apply only to \"insurers\" and if the legislature had meant the duty of good faith to apply to employees it could have said so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree that the regulations focus on insurers. But the insurance code is broader and expressly applies to \"all persons\" having to do with insurance transactions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, the regulations specifically state, \"This regulation is not exclusive, and acts performed, whether or not specified herein, may also be deemed to be violations of specific provisions of the insurance code or other regulations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the regulations do not purport to alter the plain meaning of RCW 48.01.030. And they could not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b617 Finally, Smith asserts that she cannot be liable because she was acting within the scope of her employment. She relies on\n   <em>\n    Annechino v. Worthy\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the proposition that an employee is personally liable to a third party only when that agent owes a duty to the third party.\n   <em>\n    Annechino\n   </em>\n   does not support Smith's position because, as explained above, she did owe a duty to Keodalah. RCW 48.01.030 imposed a duty of good faith on Smith, not just on her employer. Smith cannot avoid personal liability for bad faith on the basis of her employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b618 In sum, we agree with Division Three's decision in\n   <em>\n    Merriman\n   </em>\n   and further hold that RCW 48.01.030 imposes a duty of good faith on corporate and individual insurance adjusters alike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    CPA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b619 Next, we consider whether Smith can be liable for a violation of the CPA. The CPA prohibits \"[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   The CPA serves to deter unfair or deceptive acts or practices, protect the public, and foster fair and honest competition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The legislature has stated that the CPA is to be \"liberally construed [so] that its beneficial purposes may be served.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b620 The Supreme Court described the elements of a CPA claim in\n   <em>\n    Hangman Ridge Training Stables, Inc., v. Safeco Title Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   To prevail on a CPA claim, a plaintiff must show (1) an unfair or deceptive act or practice, (2) that act or practice occurs in trade or commerce, (3) a public interest impact, (4) injury to the plaintiff in his or her business or property, and (5) a causal link between the unfair or deceptive act and the injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b621 Smith claims that this court has added a sixth element to the five\n   <em>\n    Hangman Ridge\n   </em>\n   elements: the parties must have a contractual relationship. She relies on this court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    International Ultimate, Inc., v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    International Ultimate\n   </em>\n   stated, without supporting authority, that \"[t]o be liable under the CPA, there must be a contractual relationship between the parties.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    International Ultimate\n   </em>\n   then determined that an insured could not sue an insurer's adjuster because \"the CPA does not contemplate suits against employees of insurers.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   But\n   <em>\n    International Ultimate\n   </em>\n   is inconsistent with the Washington Supreme Court's more recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Panag v. Farmers Insurance Co. of Washington\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Panag\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court declined to add a sixth element to the\n   <em>\n    Hangman Ridge\n   </em>\n   test that would require proof of a consumer transaction between the parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court reasoned that requiring a consumer relationship is inconsistent with the plain language of the CPA and undermines the purposes it serves.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   The CPA itself, the purposes for which it was enacted, and our cases do not support the argument that a CPA claim must be predicated on an underlying consumer or business transaction. The CPA allows\n   <em>\n    \"[a]ny person\n   </em>\n   who is injured in his or her business or property by a violation\" of the act to bring a CPA claim. RCW 19.86.090 (emphasis added). Nothing in this language requires that the plaintiff must be a consumer or in a business relationship with the actor.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We cannot reconcile\n   <em>\n    International Ultimate\n   </em>\n   with\n   <em>\n    Panag\n   </em>\n   .

In this case, the statute is unambiguous: both the insurer and its representative must act in good faith toward the insured.

The issue is inapposite, however, because the regulations do not, in fact, contradict the statutory mandate. Although the administrative agency has chosen to focus its regulations on the conduct of insurers, at least one regulation expressly governs the conduct of an insurer's agent (WAC 284-30-350(2) ). In addition, the regulations are not exclusive: \"acts performed, whether or not specified herein, may also be deemed to be violations of specific provisions of the insurance code or other regulations.\" WAC 284-30-310. Thus, the regulations do not preclude a finding that an adjuster must act in good faith pursuant to the clear mandate of RCW 48.01.030.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    <em>\n     Lease\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%203444762\">\n     2009 WL 3444762\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *2 (distinguishing\n    <em>\n     Rice\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%202487975\">\n     2005 WL 2487975\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"26\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4024630\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/175/630/#p638\">\n     175 Wash.2d 630\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 638,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=290%20P.3d%20126\">\n     290 P.3d 126\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2012) (\"[A]n agent is subject to tort liability to a third party harmed by the agent's conduct only when the agent's conduct breaches a duty that the agent owes to the third party.\" (quoting Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 7.02) (Am.
