The driver held a valid Wyoming driver's license even though she had monocular vision, a glass eye, and could not have passed the eye exam, which was administered by an employee of the Wyoming Department of Transportation (WYDOT). The child's parents sued the WYDOT, the City of Riverton, Fremont County School District No. 25, and various employees of those governmental entities, asserting claims for wrongful death, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and loss of parental consortium (on behalf of the child's siblings). The claims against the school district and its employees were dismissed and Appellants do not appeal that decision.

Sophia's mother, Ryann Archer, and her sister, OA, arrived at the scene while witnesses were performing CPR and before police officers had arrived. Sophia Archer suffered numerous injuries and likely died at the scene. Sandra Pennock received a driver's license from the WYDOT after successfully completing an eye exam, which it would have been impossible for her to pass in light of her monocular vision and glass eye. The WYDOT issued a handicapped vehicle identification to Ms. Pennock in 2015, two months before the accident, which noted her severe visual or audio handicap.

Stat. Ann \u00a7\u00a7 1-39-101 through 1-39-121 (LexisNexis 2017). First, they contend, the actions of the WYDOT and the City fall under the exception to governmental immunity for operation of public utilities at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%201-39-108\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 1-39-108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Archers further argue that immunity is waived by the WYDOT because the eye exam service is also available through private parties. With respect to both the WYDOT and the City, the Archers contend that the \"insurance coverage exception\" to governmental immunity at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%201-39-118\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 1-39-118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(i)\"may waive immunity.\" Finally, the Archers argue that strict application of governmental immunity is simply unconscionable. We will address the latter argument first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b67] In 1978, this Court abolished the doctrine of municipal immunity and declared that \"[h]enceforth, the rule is liability and the exception is immunity ....\"\n   <em>\n    Oroz v. Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs of Carbon Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10467351\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/575/1155/#p1158\">\n    575 P.2d 1155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1158 (Wyo. 1978). In response, in 1979, the Wyoming legislature enacted the WGCA, recognizing the \"inherently unfair and inequitable results which occur in the strict application of the doctrine of governmental immunity,\" yet seeking \"to balance the respective equities between persons injured by governmental actions and the taxpayers of the state of Wyoming whose revenues are utilized by governmental entities on behalf of those taxpayers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%201-39-102\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 1-39-102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). That balance was struck by a general grant of immunity to \"a governmental entity and its public employees while acting within the scope of duties ...\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     except\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   as provided by W.S. 1-39-105 through 1-39-112.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%201-39-104\">\n    Wyo.

Now that the legislature has determined by statute how these equities should be balanced, it is the job of the courts to apply those statutes to the facts before them. The Archers suggest that this Court should decide, as we did in\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Just like the eye examination discussed above, the provision of a marked street crossing is not of the same genre as the public utilities listed in \u00a7 1-39-108. In\n   <em>\n    Sponsel\n   </em>\n   , we held that \"providing [ ] traffic control devices on county highways is not a public service for which immunity has been waived by the WGCA.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8992784\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/126/105/\">\n    2006 WY 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8992784\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/126/105/\">\n    126 P.3d at 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We fail to see any meaningful distinction between providing traffic control devices and providing marked street crossings. Neither is subject to the \u00a7 1-39-108 waiver of immunity. We also find, as the\n   <em>\n    Sponsel\n   </em>\n   court did, that if there were any waiver of immunity, it would be obviated by the language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%201-39-120\">\n    Wyo.
