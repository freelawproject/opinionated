Spence argues he is entitled to a jury trial because, if convicted of all three charges, the aggregate sentence could potentially exceed six months. Because we conclude that misdemeanor assault is not a jury-eligible offense, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 The relevant facts are not in dispute. Spence was charged in justice court with three counts of assault against three victims arising from a single incident. He filed a motion requesting a jury trial, which the court denied. He then filed a complaint for special action in superior court. Spence argued he was entitled to a jury trial because the \"potential maximum sentence\" he could receive was eighteen months if he were convicted of all three offenses and the court ordered the sentences to be served consecutively. The state responded that Spence was not entitled to a jury trial because it had avowed it would not seek any jail time, and the justice court had stated, on the record, it would impose no more than six months of incarceration. The superior court accepted jurisdiction but denied relief \"[f]or those reasons stated in the State's Response to Petition for Special Action.\" We have jurisdiction of Spence's appeal pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1) and 12-2101(A)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz.

When the superior court accepts jurisdiction of a special action but denies relief, we review for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Merlina v.
