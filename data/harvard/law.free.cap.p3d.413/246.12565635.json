Cook (father). We affirm in part,\n   reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 Mother and father divorced in 2006. At that time, the court named mother the primary residential parent for the parties' two children but allowed the parties to determine their own \"liberal parenting time\" schedule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 Six years later, mother moved to stop father's parenting time, asserting that he had not seen the children in more than two years and had no interest in seeing them. Father responded that mother had denied him parenting time, and he requested a more formal parenting time schedule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 Eventually the parties stipulated to, and the court adopted, a parenting time arrangement. As now relevant, the parties agreed that father (1) would have parenting time every Wednesday from after school until 7:00 p.m. and (2) \"shall be entitled to have Thanksgiving this year [2013] with the children from 10:00 a.m. on Thursday until taking the children to school on the following Monday morning.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 Father later filed a verified motion and affidavit for contempt, requesting remedial contempt sanctions for mother's noncompliance with the two above-mentioned portions of their stipulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following reflects how the contempt motion proceeded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 The advisement hearing occurred on March 3, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 The parties appeared for the contempt hearing on May 19, 2014, but agreed to set it over until September 22, 2014, so that they could participate in a settlement meeting. The parties also agreed that mother would contact a therapist, and the court ordered her to start therapy within thirty days.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 On September 22, the contempt hearing was set over to October 6, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 The magistrate began the contempt hearing on October 6 and finished it on November 3, 2014, when she found mother in remedial contempt and ordered her to pay father's attorney fees. The magistrate further ordered that mother could purge the contempt by allowing father to have the children during their 2014 Thanksgiving break.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 Sentencing occurred on January 28, 2015, at which time the court ordered mother to pay father's $4926.25 in attorney fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 6 Mother timely filed a C.R.M. 7 petition challenging the magistrate's orders. The district court adopted the magistrate's orders on review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II. Applicable Legal Principles\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 7 C.R.C.P. 107 provides the authority under which courts are to conduct contempt proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Marriage of Nussbeck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11628348\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/974/493/#p498\">\n    974 P.2d 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 498 (Colo. 1999). Remedial sanctions for contempt must be supported by findings of fact establishing that the contemnor (1) did not comply with a lawful order of the court; (2) knew of the order; and (3) had the present ability to comply with the order.\n   <em>\n    In re Marriage of Cyr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210272\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/186/88/#p92\">\n    186 P.3d 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 92 (Colo.

Sua Sponte Reconsideration of Sanctions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 9 Mother first contends that the magistrate improperly reconsidered the May 19 order when, on November 3, she changed the nature of the sanctions imposed. We reject this contention because no sanctions were imposed until November 3, when the magistrate\n   found mother guilty of remedial contempt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wright v.

Court\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4570300\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/colo/192/553/#p555\">\n    192 Colo. 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 555,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4570300\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/colo/192/553/#p555\">\n    561 P.2d 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 17 (1977) (finding of contempt must precede imposition of sanctions).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 10 We acknowledge that the magistrate entered an order on May 19 requiring mother to engage in therapy. However, the record reveals that the magistrate simply adopted the parties' stipulation concerning the same; the order was not imposed to force mother's compliance with the parenting time stipulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   C.R.C.P. 107(a)(5) (defining remedial sanctions).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   IV. Evidence and Findings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 11 Mother's second, third, and fifth contentions challenge the evidence presented at the contempt and sentencing hearings, the weight placed on that evidence by the magistrate, and the findings and inferences the magistrate made in her orders. We do not disturb the orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 12 A party seeking review of a magistrate's order has the burden to provide the reviewing court with a record justifying the rejection or modification of that order.\n   <em>\n    In re Marriage of Rivera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9234416\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/91/464/#p466\">\n    91 P.3d 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 466 (Colo.

Where the appellant fails to provide such a transcript, the reviewing court must presume that the record supports the judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   C.R.M. 7(a)(9) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Marriage of Beatty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6983562\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/279/1225/\">\n    2012 COA 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6983562\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/279/1225/\">\n    279 P.3d 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 14 Here, the transcripts from the contempt and sentencing hearings are in the appellate record. However, mother did not provide them to the district court when she sought review of the magistrate's orders under C.R.M. 7(a). Consequently, we confine our review of mother's arguments to the record considered by the district court, which did not include any transcripts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rivera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9234416\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/91/464/#p466\">\n    91 P.3d at 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 15 Without reviewing the transcripts, we are unable to evaluate the evidence to determine whether it sufficiently supports the magistrate's orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   C.R.M. 7(a)(9) ;\n   <em>\n    G.E.R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6986259\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/264/637/#p638\">\n    264 P.3d at 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To the contrary, we must presume that the record supports the magistrate's orders that mother failed to comply with the parties' stipulation and was, therefore, in remedial contempt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   C.R.M. 7(a)(9) ;\n   <em>\n    Beatty\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 10 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

Willfulness is not a requirement for finding remedial contempt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cyr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210272\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/186/88/#p92\">\n    186 P.3d at 91-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   V. Order as to Compliance with Parenting Time\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 17 We agree with mother's fourth contention that the magistrate exceeded her authority when she ordered mother\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   to remove all privileges for up to a month for the children if they do not comply with her instruction to go to [father]'s home. This means no TV, no cable, no music, no friends, no cell phone, no I-pads, no computers, unless the parenting time is exercised with the [father]. Each violation of failure to attend parenting time will result in a one month restriction of these items for the children by [m]other.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We therefore strike these three sentences from paragraph 9 of the magistrate's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 18 Contrary to father's assertion, mother properly preserved this claim in her petition for district court review.

In Colorado, parenting orders are comprehensively governed by the Colorado Uniform Dissolution of Marriage Act, sections 14-10-101 to - 133, C.R.S. 2016, but the majority does not cite and I am unaware of any statutory authority supporting the proposition that a custodial parent has a legal obligation to discipline her child in order to ensure that the child complies with a parenting order in favor of the non-custodial parent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 47 Recognizing that enforcement of parenting time orders may require a variety of tools, the General Assembly enacted section 14-10-129.5. After finding that a parent has violated a parenting time order, the statute authorizes the court to do any of the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   \u2022 modify the existing order concerning the allocation of parental responsibilities, \u00a7 14-10-129.5(2)(b) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   \u2022 require either or both parents to attend a parental education program at the expense of the non-complying parent, \u00a7 14-10-129.5(2)(b.3) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   \u2022 require the parties to participate in family counseling at the expense of the non-complying parent, \u00a7 14-10-129.5(2)(b.7) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   \u2022 require the violator to post bond or security to ensure future compliance, \u00a7 14-10-129.5(2)(c) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   \u2022 require make-up time, \u00a7 14-10-129.5(2)(d) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   \u2022 impose a fine or jail sentence, \u00a7 14-10-129.5(2)(e) ; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   \u2022 enter \"[a]ny other order that may promote the best interests of the child or children involved,\" \u00a7 14-10-129.5(2)(h).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 48 But nowhere does the statute expressly (or in my view, implicitly) authorize a court to order a parent to impose specific discipline on her child to force the child to engage in unwanted parenting time with the non-custodial parent. Nor does allowing the parent, rather than the court, to choose the specific discipline solve the problems, for the reasons I discussed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 49 To the extent that the majority relies on the \"catch-all\" provision of section 14-10-129.5(2)(h) to support its assumption that mother may be required to impose discipline, that reliance runs squarely into, and in my view violates,\n   <em>\n    Troxel\n   </em>\n   .
