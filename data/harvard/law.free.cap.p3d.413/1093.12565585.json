Sess. Laws ch. 40, \u00a7 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   [\u00b64] As the above provisions reflect, the 2014 legislation did not designate the state treasurer as a member of the oversight group, nor did it provide that the state treasurer's approval was required for contracts related to the capitol restoration project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   [\u00b65] In February 2016, the Office of the Attorney General for the State of Wyoming issued a formal opinion addressing the question of the treasurer's role under Article 3, \u00a7 31 in the capitol restoration project. Wyo. Atty. Gen. Op. 2016-001,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20870371\">\n    2016 WL 870371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Feb. 2, 2016). In the opinion, the attorney general's office concluded that Article 3, \u00a7 31 did not require the treasurer's approval of capitol restoration project contracts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. The opinion stated, however, that Article 3, \u00a7 31 did not bar the legislature from passing statutes providing for treasurer participation in the process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   [\u00b66] In May of 2016, Gordon filed a complaint asserting that the legislation was illegal on its face because it violated Article 3, \u00a7 31 of the Wyoming Constitution, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   All stationary, printing, paper, fuel and lights used in the legislature and other departments of government shall be furnished, and the printing and binding of the laws, journals and department reports and other printing and binding, and\n   <em>\n    the repairing and furnishing the halls and rooms used for the meeting of the legislature and its committees shall be performed under contract\n   </em>\n   , to be given to the lowest responsible bidder, below such maximum price and under such regulations as may be prescribed by law. No member or officer of any department of the government shall be in any way interested in any such contract; and\n   <em>\n    all such contracts shall be subject to the approval of the governor and state treasurer\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Wyo. Const. Art. 3, \u00a7 31 (emphasis added). Gordon argued that the legislation violated this provision because it did not provide for the state treasurer's approval of contracts for the capitol restoration project, which involved \"repairing and furnishing the halls and rooms used for the meeting of the legislature and its committees.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   [\u00b67] Gordon further asserted that the legislation violated Article 2, \u00a7 1 of the Wyoming Constitution, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   The powers of the government of this state are divided into three distinct departments: The legislative, executive and judicial, and no person or collection of persons charged with the exercise of powers properly belonging to one of these departments shall exercise any powers properly belonging to either of the others, except as in this\n   constitution expressly directed or permitted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Wyo. Const. Art. 2, \u00a7 1. Gordon argued that this provision prohibited the legislature from enacting legislation that usurped or ignored the state treasurer's express power to approve contracts for repairing and furnishing the portions of the state capitol used for meetings of the legislature and its committees. He sought judgment declaring the legislation to be unconstitutional and entry of a permanent injunction prohibiting the oversight group from entering into contracts for the capitol restoration project without his approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   [\u00b68] The State filed an answer denying Gordon's claims. Gordon then filed a motion for partial summary judgment, contending that as a matter of law the capitol restoration legislation facially violated Article 3, \u00a7 31 because it authorized the oversight group and the governor to enter into contracts for repairing rooms used by the legislature and its committees without the treasurer's approval. He further argued that as a matter of law the legislation on its face violated the separation of powers provision contained in Article 2, \u00a7 1 because it empowered the legislature to exercise powers properly belonging to the treasurer as a member of the executive branch. Gordon also filed a motion for certification of the issues raised in his partial summary judgment to this Court, contending that it was in the best interest of the public, the Court, and the parties for the matter to be resolved as expeditiously as possible, and that certifying the case would hasten its resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   [\u00b69] In response to Gordon's partial summary judgment motion, the State argued that it should be denied\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   because Gordon had not established that the requirements of Article 3, \u00a7 31 applied to the capitol restoration project; Gordon had not established that the capitol restoration project legislation facially violated Article 3, \u00a7 31 ; and the legislation did not violate the separation of powers provision found in Article 2, \u00a7 1. With regard to Gordon's motion to certify, the State contended it should be denied because he had not established that certifying the questions of law \"may be determinative\" of the case nor had he established a lack of controlling precedent as required by W.R.A.P. 11.01. The district court heard arguments on the motions in December of 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   [\u00b610] In early 2017, while the motions were pending in district court, the legislature amended the capitol restoration legislation in pertinent part as follows:\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    \u00a7 9-5-111.

The district court held that Gordon failed to establish that the capitol restoration legislation violated the constitution on its face or that the work being done on the project was the type of repair work contemplated by the framers when they adopted Article 3, \u00a7 31.

The State urges this Court not to consider this issue, arguing that Gordon has not shown that the capitol restoration legislation conflicts with the contract approval clause found in Article 3, \u00a7 31, a showing the State asserts he must make to succeed on his facial challenge. It argues that if we decide the case on this basis, there would be no need to decide whether the capitol restoration project involves \"repairing and furnishing the halls and rooms used for the meeting of the legislature and its committees\" as those words were used by the framers. The State is correct that a ruling that the capitol restoration legislation does not conflict with Article 3, \u00a7 31 would be dispositive. Therefore, we begin our discussion with that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a.

Given that silence, the State argues, the legislation does not prohibit the treasurer from approving those contracts. Because the treasurer's approval is not prohibited, the State contends, the legislation is not in conflict with Article 3, \u00a7 31 and is not unconstitutional on its face.

The plain language of the capitol restoration legislation indicates that the legislature intended the project to move forward without treasurer approval of contracts relating to the project. Section 9-5-112(b) provides for approval of design alternatives by the oversight group and the governor; \u00a7 9-5-112(e) allows the expenditure of funds on the project upon approval of plans by a majority of the oversight group and the governor; \u00a7 9-5-112(f) authorizes the state construction department to expend funds to implement the restoration project and allows change orders upon approval of a majority of the legislative members of the oversight group and the governor; \u00a7 9-5-113(a)(i) mandates that the state construction department is the primary fiscal and contracting agent for the project; and \u00a7 9-5-113(a)(ii) places the design and construction of the project under the direction and control of the governor. These provisions as written allow the project to be designed, implemented, constructed and paid for by persons and/or entities other than the state treasurer. They allow the project to proceed in all respects without the treasurer's approval. The legislation is not, therefore, silent as to the treasurer's contract approval as the State asserts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   [\u00b616] Additionally, the issue in\n   <em>\n    Pisano\n   </em>\n   was whether, in enacting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%207-13-402\">\n    Wyo.

We are not aware of any cases, and the State cites none, extending the principles espoused there beyond the scope of legislation that arguably prohibits judicial review. Obviously, the legislation in this case does not involve judicial review or the policy favoring it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   [\u00b621] Additionally, in\n   <em>\n    Pisano\n   </em>\n   the Court concluded that the plain language of \u00a7 7-13-402(f) showed that the legislature intended to preclude judicial review of the conduct of parole board hearings, not of parole board decisions themselves.\n   <em>\n    Pisano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10374931\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/835/1136/#p1140\">\n    835 P.2d at 1139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that context, the Court held that the exemption of the Board's hearing procedures from the statute did not evidence an intent to preclude judicial review of parole board decisions. In contrast, the plain language of the capitol restoration legislation expresses that the legislature intended the project to move forward without treasurer approval of contracts relating to the project. As we said in \u00b615 above, \u00a7\u00a7 9-5-112(b), (e) and (f) and 9-5-113(a)(i) and (ii) established a comprehensive scheme to design, implement, construct and pay for the project without state treasurer approval of any part of it. We conclude the exemption of the treasurer's contract approval authority from the capitol restoration legislation evidences an intent to preclude it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   [\u00b622] The State attempted to draw a distinction between the authority vested in these provisions and the contract approval authority granted in Article 3, \u00a7 31. According to this argument, the authority to approve the design and plans referenced in \u00a7 9-5-112(b) and (e), respectively, are different than the authority to approve contracts, as\n   are the authority to expend funds ( \u00a7 9-5-112(f) ) and control the design and construction of the project ( \u00a7 9-5-113(a)(ii) ). Similarly, designating the state construction department as the primary contracting agent is distinct from the treasurer's contract approval authority. Under the State's theory, the authority the legislature gave to others in the capitol restoration statutes does not take away from the treasurer's contract approval authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   [\u00b623] The State's argument defies common sense. Rather than preserving the treasurer's constitutional authority, the legislature has effectively given it away by assigning authority and control over the capitol restoration project to others. Unlike the Court's conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Pisano\n   </em>\n   , we conclude the statutory silence as to the treasurer's responsibility for approving capitol restoration contracts, together with the express statutory authorization given to others to effectuate the project, evidences an intent by the legislature to exclude the treasurer from exercising his constitutional duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   [\u00b624] In addition, if there were any doubt as to the legislature's intent under the original capitol improvements legislation, the 2017 amendments removed it. As noted above, the amendment made the state treasurer a member of the capitol restoration committee.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%209-5-111\">\n    Wyo.

The State cites three rules of constitutional interpretation in support of its assertion. First, the State references the rule that constitutional provisions limiting legislative power are to be strictly interpreted.

One example of this intent appears in Article 3, \u00a7 31's requirement that the state treasurer approve contracts for repairing and furnishing legislative areas, thereby providing a check on the legislature's efforts to provide for itself. That the framers sought to constrain legislative power does not mean, however, that Article 3, \u00a7 31 can reasonably be read to mean \"routine\" repairs. This interpretation would require inserting the word \"routine\" into the text of Article 3, \u00a7 31.

It was in that context that the Court said provisions restricting legislative power are to be strictly construed. Because the provision granting judicial power gave the district courts broad authority in all cases, and the statute at issue gave effect to judicial authority in the context of trust funds, the Court concluded the statute was not unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   [\u00b642] In\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , the Court considered the constitutionality of legislation abolishing two of the nine Wyoming judicial districts existing at the time and transferring certain counties to other judicial districts. The legislation was challenged as a violation of Article 5, \u00a7 21, which gave the legislature the authority to increase the number of districts and judges, but said nothing about decreasing the number. Those challenging the statute argued that by giving the legislature the power to increase the number of judicial districts and judges in Article 5, \u00a7 21, the framers by implication intended to prohibit the legislature from decreasing the number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   [\u00b643] In that context, the Court cited the principle that constitutional restrictions on legislative power are not to be enlarged by construction beyond their terms.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8514621\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wyo/47/216/\">\n    34 P.2d at 18-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the Court upheld the statute, finding that two other constitutional provisions gave the legislature clear authority not only to increase the number of districts, but to decrease the number established by preceding legislatures. The Court referenced Article 5, \u00a7 19, which provided that \"[u]ntil otherwise provided by law,\" the state was to be divided into three judicial\n   districts each with one district judge, and Article 5, \u00a7 20, which specified what counties were within each district \"[u]ntil otherwise provided by law.\" Read\n   <em>\n    in pari materia\n   </em>\n   with these provisions, which clearly authorized legislative action, the Court concluded that Article 5, \u00a7 21 could not be interpreted to mean that the framers intended to prohibit the legislature from decreasing the number of judicial districts or judges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8514621\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wyo/47/216/\">\n    34 P.2d at 20-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   [\u00b644] In both\n   <em>\n    Durrin's\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , the Court looked to relevant constitutional provisions, and based upon those provisions, found the challenged legislation constitutional. In reaching that result, the Court interpreted constitutional provisions expressly or arguably limiting legislative power so as not to interfere with the other constitutional provisions expressly granting broad powers, to the judiciary in\n   <em>\n    Durrin's\n   </em>\n   and to the legislature in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   . The principles the Court relied on in those cases are not applicable here, where only one constitutional provision which expressly grants power to the state treasurer is at issue. This is not a case of interpreting one constitutional provision expressly, or arguably limiting legislative power in light of other constitutional provisions granting broad powers to the legislature or another branch of government.

As we concluded in \u00b6\u00b631-33 above, when the words plainly expressed in Article 3, \u00a7 31 are given the meaning they had at the time our constitution was ratified, it is clear the drafters intended to require the state treasurer's approval of all contracts for restoring or renovating and furnishing the buildings or parts of buildings used for meetings of the legislature and its committees.

The current capitol restoration project involves renovation and furnishing of buildings and portions of buildings used by the legislature and its committees, and therefore, the treasurer's approval of at least some of the work contemplated by the statute was required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   [\u00b650] The State contends that interpreting the capitol restoration legislation as allowing the project to go forward without the treasurer's approval runs afoul of the principle that this Court should never interpret a statute as unconstitutional when it can, in any possible way, be reconciled with the constitution, citing\n   <em>\n    Hanson v.

The State also references the principle that we will not presume the legislature intended to enact a law in violation of the constitution.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 397. In\n   <em>\n    Hanson\n   </em>\n   , the challenged legislation authorized cities and towns to borrow money and issue bonds for airport purposes \"in any amount not exceeding at any one time, four per cent\" of the assessed value of the city or town.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 394. The challengers asserted that the statute violated Article 16, \u00a7 5 of the state constitution, which prohibited cities and towns from creating indebtedness exceeding two percent of the assessed value of the taxable property in the city or town. Applying the principles of statutory interpretation referenced above, the Court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   It is, we think, clear that ... the legislature ... intended to authorize cities or towns to increase their bonded indebtedness beyond the limitation of 1 per centum of the assessed valuation of such city or town as permitted by [statute]. Through some oversight, the lawmaking body fixed that increase at a figure which runs counter to the mandatory requirements of [ Article 16, \u00a7 5 ] of the Wyoming Constitution. Reading the controlling constitutional limitation clause in conjunction with the ... statute, and under the authorities above reviewed, but one conclusion would appear possible, viz., that [the challenged statute] ... authorized the bonded indebtedness for airport purposes only to the extent of two (2%) per centum of the town's assessed valuation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 401-02.

Article 3, \u00a7 31 expressly requires the treasurer's approval of contracts for repairing and furnishing areas used by the legislature. The capitol restoration legislation assigns all aspects of the project to the governor and other officials and groups created by the legislature.

An overview of the project shows that it involves much more than the \"halls and rooms of the legislature.\" To mention a few:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   \u2022 There are major life safety issues at the capitol, including a lack of smoke alarms, smoke evacuation systems, and fire suppression systems. The building is not ADA compliant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   \u2022 The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems are outdated and need to be replaced, as is also true of the elevators, which will not accommodate a gurney to remove an unconscious or injured employee, visitor, or official. The entire capitol building electrical system is obsolete, hazardous and in need of replacement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   \u2022 There are insufficient and inadequate restrooms without adequate ADA accessibility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   \u2022 The office space for the executive branch officials is fragmented and separates those who need to interact frequently.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   \u2022 There are exterior problems, including cracks in the rotunda, dents, tears and punctures in metal surfaces across the exterior of the dome, and water infiltration, which in turn has led to moisture damage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n   \u2022 Because the executive and legislative branch have had to vacate the capitol and the Hershler building, alternative space for them has had to be purchased or rented.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n   \u2022 Meeting rooms will be used by the executive branch when the legislature is not in session or holding hearings in them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   [\u00b661] The breadth of the project means that our conclusion that the capitol restoration legislation violates Article 2, \u00a7 1 and Article 3, \u00a7 31 of the Wyoming Constitution does not mean that treasurer approval was or will be required for all work on the project. Because Article 3, \u00a7 31 is limited to contracts for repairing and furnishing only certain legislative areas, the treasurer's approval is not needed for restoring areas used by the governor or other elected officials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   [\u00b662] We remand the case so that the parties and the district court can wrestle with the appropriate scope of the treasurer's approval power. Although, as we have held, portions of the legislation are facially invalid in light of the treasurer's narrow constitutional check on the legislature's ability to spend on its own halls and rooms, there is still a role for fact-finding with regard to the scope of that narrow power in relation to the work contemplated by the legislation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   [\u00b663] We recognize the breathtaking magnitude of the capitol restoration project, and the incredible burden its necessity has placed on the legislature and the executive branch, as well as the people of this state. The legislation we review in this opinion appears to be an honest effort to render that Herculean endeavor possible. Requiring the treasurer's approval for certain aspects of the project adds a layer of complication which would in all likelihood be unheard of in private projects of similar magnitude. However, as the United States Supreme Court observed with\n   regard to choices made by the Founders in the United States Constitution:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   The choices we discern as having been made in the Constitutional Convention impose burdens on governmental processes that often seem clumsy, inefficient, even unworkable, but those hard choices were consciously made by men who had lived under a form of government that permitted arbitrary governmental acts to go unchecked. There is no support in the Constitution or decisions of this Court for the proposition that the cumbersomeness and delays often encountered in complying with explicit Constitutional standards may be avoided, either by the Congress or by the President. With all the obvious flaws of delay, untidiness, and potential for abuse, we have not yet found a better way to preserve freedom than by making the exercise of power subject to the carefully crafted restraints spelled out in the Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <em>\n    I.N.S. v.

In\n   <em>\n    Pisano\n   </em>\n   , the \"presumption of reviewability\" drove our analysis. Similarly, in this case, the presumption of constitutionality should drive the analysis. The majority does not apply that presumption. In the absence of a specific statutory provision transferring constitutional authority from the treasurer to others, the statute should be presumed constitutional. There is no specific provision in the challenged legislation and the majority has not identified any specific provision transferring that authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   [\u00b674] The majority points to the 2017 legislative amendment in an attempt to bolster its conclusion that \"the exemption of the treasurer's contract approval authority from the capitol restoration legislation evidences an intent to preclude it.\" According to the majority, \"if there were any doubt as to the legislature's intent under the original capitol improvements legislation, the 2017 amendments removed it.\" I disagree. The 2017 amendment had nothing to do with the treasurer's constitutional approval authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   [\u00b675] In the 2017 amendment, the legislature opted to add the treasurer as a member of the capitol restoration oversight group.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%209-5-111\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 9-5-111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(v). Again, eschewing any attempt to apply the presumption of constitutionality, the majority concludes, \"[T]he clear impact of the amendment was to allow the treasurer a vote, but to deprive him of the right to approve repairs and furnishings to the halls and rooms of the legislature.\" In reaching that conclusion, the majority improperly blurs the distinction between the treasurer's constitutional approval authority under Article 3, Section 31 and the statutory approval authority provided in the challenged legislation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   [\u00b676] The 2017 amendment did not diminish the treasurer's constitutional authority. It made no mention of that authority. That authority remains intact. Instead, the amendment increased the treasurer's ability to have input on the project. As a member of the capitol restoration oversight group, the treasurer now has a voice and a vote on nearly every aspect of the entire project. This is a far cry from the treasurer's very limited approval authority set forth in Article 3, Section 31.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   [\u00b677] Long ago, in\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. State Publishing Co. v. Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2295694\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/23/44/\">\n    23 Mont. 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=57%20P.%20449\">\n    57 P. 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1899), the Montana Supreme Court recognized the distinction between constitutional approval authority and statutory approval authority and had no difficulty concluding that the presence of statutory approval authority does not negate the continued viability of constitutional approval authority. Addressing a claim involving application of a provision of the Montana Constitution that was nearly identical to the language in Article 3, Section 31, the Court said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-182\">\n   It may be unfortunate that the governor was made a member of this board whose duty it is to let these contracts. It puts him in a position where he can refuse to approve the action of a majority of the board of which he is a member, and thus put his veto upon proceedings in which he takes part. Nevertheless his duty as a member of this board in relation to these contracts is statutory, while his duty in approving or disapproving the action of the board is constitutional.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=57%20P.%20449\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=57%20P.%20449\">\n    57 P. at 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Montana Supreme Court reached that conclusion in a case that did not involve a facial challenge. In other words, they reached it without applying any presumption in favor of constitutionality. Surely, with the application of the appropriate standard of review, we must reach the same conclusion. Constitutional approval authority and statutory approval authority can co-exist. Legislation granting statutory approval authority to other persons or entities does not undermine constitutional approval authority. It merely adds another layer of approval that must be obtained. The treasurer's approval authority under Article 3, Section 31 remains intact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   [\u00b678] The decisions of the Montana Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   and in\n   <em>\n    Hogan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2294141\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/22/384/\">\n    22 Mont. 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=56%20P.%20818\">\n    56 P. 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a companion case cited by the majority, illustrate another important\n   point. Denial of a facial challenge does not equate to the absence of a remedy. In the Montana cases, for example, the Court determined that the contract at issue was not enforceable without the requisite consent. Here, however, Appellant has not challenged the validity of any specific contract. He has only asserted a facial challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   [\u00b679] In conclusion, I would reemphasize the heavy burden that must be satisfied to sustain a facial challenge. The majority recognizes that burden and gives a nod to\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its analysis, however, the majority has ignored that standard and our precedent. Proper application of that precedent leads inexorably to the conclusion that the challenged legislation does not transfer the approval authority of the treasurer under Article 3, Section 31 to any other person or entity. The treasurer's constitutional approval authority remains intact. Appellant has failed to sustain his facial challenge to the constitutionality of the Capitol Repair Legislation. I would affirm the district court's order denying that challenge.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-206\">\n    The full scope of that approval authority is not at issue in this appeal. The constitutional provision does not explicitly provide that the treasurer \"must approve\" all such contracts. It states that such contracts \"shall be subject to the approval of the ... treasurer.\" The State contends that the constitutional provision merely requires that the treasurer be provided the opportunity to approve or reject the pertinent contracts. The State also contends that the approval may be explicit or implied. There are also potential questions pertaining to the basis for any decision rejecting pertinent contracts. For example, does Article 3, Section 31 provide the treasurer with unfettered veto power over such contracts, or is the treasurer's approval authority restricted in some way? Does the treasurer have approval authority of all contracts that touch in any way on the repairing and furnishing of legislative halls and rooms, or is the approval authority limited to only those portions of a contract that address those aspects of the project?\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-207\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    majority opinion \u00b6\u00b6 60\u221261.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-208\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    majority opinion, footnote 10.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
