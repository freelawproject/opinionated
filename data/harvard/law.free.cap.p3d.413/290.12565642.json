We answer both of these questions \"no\" and conclude that the statute requires the department to inquire about Indian heritage in each new proceeding. Therefore, we reverse the judgment and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. Prior Case\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 2 In September 2013, the Chaffee County Department of Social Services (the Department) initiated a dependency and neglect proceeding involving five-year-old Tr.D. The shelter order stated, \"The Respondents deny that their child, [Tr.D.] is a member of or eligible for membership in an Indian tribe.\" The petition stated, \"The Department of Human Services has questioned the child's parents and has determined the child is not an Indian child.\" The petition was later withdrawn, and the case was successfully closed in September 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II. Current Case\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 3 In February 2015, the Department initiated another dependency and neglect proceeding concerning now six-year-old Tr.D. and six-month-old A.D. after M.D. (father) and T.D. (mother) were arrested on drug charges. The children were placed in foster care because of continued concern about the parents' drug use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 The children were adjudicated dependent and neglected, and treatment plans were developed for both parents. Father's treatment plan required him to (1) find ways to manage pain that did not include the use of controlled substances; (2) abstain from using illegal, prescribed, or nonprescribed controlled substances and live a substance-free lifestyle that would not put the children at risk; (3) maintain a relationship with the children through weekly visitation; and (4) provide a safe and stable living environment that would be suitable for the children. Mother's treatment plan was identical to father's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 Both parents struggled. Despite visitation schedule changes to accommodate their needs, both parents often arrived late, and a number of visits were cancelled due to tardiness. They lost their right to unsupervised visits after testing positive for opiates during a visit, and they failed to maintain consistent employment, housing, and contact information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 Most significantly, neither could overcome addiction. Both parents delayed beginning outpatient treatment, and their participation in that treatment was described as \"sporadic at best.\" They were slow to begin drug testing, missed required tests, and on more than one occasion manipulated the test results. In December 2015, the trial court ordered them to complete inpatient drug treatment. Father began an inpatient program but failed to complete it. Mother completed her inpatient program in February 2016, but she tested positive for opiates only a few days after discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 Based on this record, the Department filed a petition to terminate parental rights. The petition stated that \"the subject children are NOT Indian Children pursuant to the Indian Child Welfare Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201903\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4).\" No evidence concerning ICWA was elicited at the termination hearing. After the hearing, the trial court issued a written order terminating parental rights. The order found, \"The provisions of I.C.W.A. do not apply to this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   III. Indian Child Welfare Act\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 Mother contends the record fails to support the court's ICWA finding because the Department never asked about possible Indian heritage during the proceedings and, therefore, failed to satisfy its \"continuing inquiry\" duty under \u00a7 19-1-126(1)(a). She argues that the court's reliance on the Department's deficient inquiry is a material error because the applicability of ICWA affects the conduct of the case and the standard of proof to be met before termination of parental rights can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9 The Department responds that the ICWA issue was resolved with respect to Tr.D. in the prior case. It argues that the trial court satisfied the requirements of ICWA in this case by taking judicial notice of its ICWA finding in the prior case. It reasons that because A.D. is a full sibling of Tr.D., the court's previous finding that Tr.D. was not an Indian child must also apply to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 We conclude that \u00a7 19-1-126(1)(a), when considered with the relevant federal guidelines and the purposes of ICWA, required the Department to conduct new inquiries in this case to determine whether the children were Indian children. Because no evidence in the record shows that any inquiries occurred, we agree with mother that the court's order finding ICWA inapplicable is not supported by the record and that further proceedings are required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A.

Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 16 We begin with the observation that the Department specifically acknowledged its \u00a7 19-1-126(1)(a) obligation to make\n   <em>\n    continuing\n   </em>\n   inquiries \"as to any possible Indian heritage of any of the children\" in the dependency and neglect petition. However, it has not directed our attention to any evidence of such continuing inquiries, and it does not argue on appeal that such inquiries occurred. Indeed, because the court made no findings to support its conclusion that ICWA did not apply, we are unable to determine what evidence the court considered in reaching its conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 17 The Department suggests that the court may have relied on its finding that ICWA did not apply in the previous case to support its conclusion that ICWA did not apply here, and it argues that such reliance satisfied ICWA requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In Interest of C.A.B.L.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994738\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/221/433/#p442\">\n    221 P.3d 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 442 (Colo.App.2009) (permitting a trial court to take judicial notice of its own records and adopt factual findings from a previous case as long as the previous case involved the same parties and the same issue);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   CRE 201(b) (court may take judicial notice of facts not subject to reasonable dispute). However, nothing in \u00a7 19-1-126, ICWA, or the 2015 Guidelines permits a court to make ICWA findings by taking judicial notice of prior proceedings. In fact, the 2016 regulations and guidelines now explicitly prohibit a court from doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 18 Even assuming, without deciding, that the trial court could consider its findings and orders in the prior case to determine whether the children who are the subjects of this case are Indian children-and we note that the trial court did not indicate that it had done so-we conclude that the findings and orders from the prior case\n   <em>\n    alone\n   </em>\n   are insufficient to support the trial court's conclusion that ICWA does not apply in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 19 Records from the prior case show that the Department inquired into Tr.D.'s possible Indian heritage, and that mother and father believed, for reasons not stated in the record, that the child was not a member of or eligible for membership in any Indian tribe. Possibly, mother and father were unaware of any Indian heritage in their families. Alternatively, they may have been aware of some Indian heritage, but they may have believed that the child could not meet the criteria for membership in the identified possible tribe(s). Or they may have had other reasons for their belief that the child could not, or should not, be identified as an Indian child. The record in this case shows no renewal inquiries. Yet it reveals the active participation of grandparents with the Department, who may have had pertinent information concerning Indian heritage that was unknown to the parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 20 We agree that in determining whether ICWA applies to the current proceeding, the court could properly consider a finding that, in 2013, mother and father denied that Tr.D. was an Indian child. However, the trial court could not rely\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   upon that prior finding to determine that ICWA does not apply here. To do so would fail to give effect to \u00a7 19-1-126(1)(a), which obligates the Department to make continuing inquiries into a child's Indian heritage before determining whether the child is an Indian child. Such continuing inquiries are necessary to ensure that any determination is not based on information that may be outdated and incorrect.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    People in Interest of T.M.W.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7332185\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/208/272/#p275\">\n    208 P.3d 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 275 (Colo.App.2009) (stating that a court may not rely on notice that was given to a tribe concerning a sibling to determine whether another child is an Indian child because, even if the siblings have the same parents, the tribe is free to change its enrollment criteria at any point).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 21 In the absence of findings by the trial court, we are unable to determine the basis for the court's conclusion that ICWA does not apply to this case. Nor are we able to satisfy ourselves that the information that the court relied upon in reaching its conclusion was obtained as the result of the Department's \"continuing inquiries\" into the children's Indian heritage and eligibility for\n   tribal membership, as contemplated by \u00a7 19-1-126(1)(a), rather than outdated and possibly inaccurate information. The Department does not argue that this absence of information is harmless; it acknowledges that a \"remand for the purpose of making any necessary additional inquiries\" could be ordered. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the judgment must be reversed and remanded to the trial court for additional findings and further proceedings if needed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People in Interest of A.G.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6986206\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/264/615/#p621\">\n    264 P.3d 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 621 (Colo.App.2010) (stating that an order may be set aside if the court's findings do not demonstrate compliance with statutory requirements and the appellate court cannot determine the basis for the order),\n   <em>\n    rev'd in part and vacated in part on other grounds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6986279\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/262/646/\">\n    262 P.3d 646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Colo.2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 22 Accordingly, on remand the Department must make the inquiries required by \u00a7 19-1-126(1)(a). If those inquiries reveal possible Indian heritage, then the Department must comply with the statute's notice requirements. If the inquiries reveal no possible Indian heritage, then the trial court may enter its termination order based on its prior findings and the evidence adduced from the Department's inquiries. Because it is possible that no ICWA notice will be required, and that, even if notice is required, no tribe will determine that the children are eligible for tribal membership, we also address the remaining issues raised by mother and father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   IV. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 23 Mother contends that the trial court erred in finding that the statutory grounds for terminating her parental rights under \u00a7 19-3-604(1)(c), C.R.S. 2016, were established by clear and convincing evidence. Specifically, she argues that she was progressing in her substance abuse treatment, she was able to maintain employment, she interacted well with the children, she complied with most of the requirements of her treatment plan, and she would have been able to complete the other requirements within a reasonable time. She contends the record does not support the trial court's finding that her conduct or condition will not change within a reasonable time. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 24 Under \u00a7 19-3-604(1)(c), the legal relationship between a parent and his or her child may be terminated if the child has been adjudicated dependent or neglected and the court finds, based on clear and convincing evidence, that the parent did not reasonably comply with a treatment plan approved by the court or that the treatment plan has been unsuccessful, that the parent is unfit, and that the parent's conduct or condition is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 25 When a proceeding involves children under the age of six, reasonable or successful compliance with a treatment plan cannot be found if \"[t]he parent exhibits the same problems addressed in the treatment plan without adequate improvement\" and remains unable to meet the children's needs. \u00a7 19-3-604(1)(c)(I)(B) ;\n   <em>\n    People in Interest of J.A.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8326444\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/160/257/#p260\">\n    160 P.3d 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 260 (Colo.App.2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 26 In determining whether a parent's conduct or condition is unlikely to change within a reasonable time, the trial court may consider whether any change has occurred during the pendency of the dependency and neglect proceeding, the parent's social history, and the chronic or long-term nature of the parent's conduct or condition.\n   <em>\n    K.D. v.

Among other things, the record shows that mother did not complete a substance abuse assessment until June 2015, two months after adoption of her treatment plan and four months after the children's initial removal. She attempted outpatient substance abuse therapy, but attended less than fifty percent of the sessions and was terminated for poor attendance. She eventually completed an inpatient program, but relapsed almost immediately thereafter. Her employment was sporadic, and she incurred criminal charges during the case. She and father were often late for visits or cancelled them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 30 The record, therefore, amply supports the trial court's findings and conclusions, and we will not disturb them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   V. Reasonable Efforts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 31 Father contends that the record does not support the trial court's finding that reasonable efforts were made to avoid the removal of the children from their home and to promote reunification of the family, as required by \u00a7 19-3-100.5, C.R.S. 2016. He argues that the Department's opposition to changing venue from Chaffee County, which does not have a Family Intensive Drug Court (FITC), to Fremont County, which has an FITC program, represents a failure to make reasonable efforts. More specifically, he argues that the dispute over whether venue should be changed delayed his ability to participate in an FITC program \"when [he was] motivated to engage in treatment.\" He reasons \"[r]easonable efforts require[d] more than providing adequate services, they require[d] providing such services at the right time.\" We perceive no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 32 The state must make reasonable efforts to prevent out-of-home placement of an abused or neglected child and to reunite the family. \u00a7\u00a7 19-1-103(89), 19-3-100.5(1), C.R.S. 2016;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People in Interest of S.M.A.M.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8364796\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/172/958/#p963\">\n    172 P.3d 958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 963 (Colo.App.2007). Such reasonable efforts must include screening, assessments, the development of an appropriate treatment plan, the provision of information and referrals to available public and private assistance resources, placement services, and visitation services, all as determined necessary and appropriate in a particular case. \u00a7 19-3-208(2)(b), C.R.S. 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 33 In July 2015, mother requested a transfer of venue to Fremont County, where she and father lived. She conceded they both had significant substance abuse issues and needed the intensity of Fremont County's FITC program. The Department and the guardian ad litem opposed the motion, in part due to concerns that the children would be transferred to a different foster home. The Department consulted with Fremont County's Department of Human Services and learned that if venue was changed, such a transfer was likely. Additionally, the Department considered the parents' admission into the FITC program \"questionable,\" in part because the eligibility criteria precluded the use of a \"prescribed inhibitor\" such as Suboxone, which the Department believed father had been prescribed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 34 The court observed that Fremont County had offered to collaborate with Chaffee County to provide FITC services to mother and father, minus the court oversight, while Chaffee County retained jurisdiction over the case. The court proposed holding the motion in abeyance while mother and father sought FITC services. Father agreed with this proposal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 35 Soon afterward, a Fremont County supervisor attempted to arrange a meeting with mother and father so that she could discuss the program, have them sign the necessary papers, and start scheduling appointments. However, mother and father repeatedly rescheduled this initial meeting and then failed to appear. They never took advantage of the opportunity to receive FITC services. And the record does not reflect any effort by father to seek a ruling on the outstanding motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 36 We conclude that father waived his right to raise this issue on appeal when he expressly agreed to hold the motion to change venue in abeyance, and thereafter failed to seek a ruling from the court. Accordingly, we will not consider it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People in Interest of N.A.T.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8424591\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/134/535/#p537\">\n    134 P.3d 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 537 (Colo.App.2006) (stating that where mother did not\n   object to the allocation of parental responsibilities to father during the hearing before the juvenile court, instead agreeing that the disposition was in the child's best interests, the appellate court would not consider her contention on appeal that the allocation was not in the child's best interests).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   VI. Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 37 The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for the Department to conduct inquiries into the children's possible Indian heritage. If such inquiries reveal possible Indian heritage, then the Department must comply with the notice provisions of \u00a7 19-1-126 and ICWA, and the court must conduct further proceedings as necessary. If the inquiries reveal no possible Indian heritage, or if, after any required notice, no tribe has determined that the children are eligible for tribal membership, then the court may enter its termination order based on its prior findings and the evidence adduced from the Department's inquiries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   JUDGE HAWTHORNE and JUDGE ASHBY concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    The guidelines issued in December 2016, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Guidelines for Implementing the Indian Child Welfare Act (Dec. 2016), https://perma.cc/3TCH-8HQM (2016 Guidelines), require a court to inquire about ICWA's applicability even if a party fails to assert that ICWA may apply. 2016 Guidelines at 11.
