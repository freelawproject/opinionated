At issue is whether the Taxpayers engaged in taxable retail sales of medical marijuana between 2011 and 2014. First, the Taxpayers argue that GCC and TCC were not engaged in \"retail sales.\" Second, the Taxpayers argue that the transactions were exempt from sales tax under either the prescription drug or medicine of botanical origin exemptions. We hold that as a matter of law, the Taxpayers engaged in retail sales that were not tax exempt. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. BACKGROUND: COMMUNITY GARDEN OPERATIONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 The Taxpayers are businesses involved with community gardens established under former RCW 69.51A.085 (2011). Former RCW 69.51A.085(1) provided that \"[q]ualifying patients may create and participate in collective gardens for the purpose of producing, processing, transporting, and delivering cannabis for medical use subject to\" enumerated conditions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   RX admits that it sold products containing medical marijuana to collective garden members. GCC and TCC deny involvement with such sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 GCC's and TCC's community garden formation agreements provided that \"members\" of the collective garden would acquire and supply resources to produce, process, and share medical marijuana. The agreements also provided that the\n   <em>\n    members would establish\n   </em>\n   a \"management entity which will direct and oversee the day to day operations of the Collective Garden for the benefit of its members.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 83, 288. A maximum of 10 members who were qualified to obtain medical marijuana under ch. 69.51A RCW could participate in a collective garden at any one time. And each garden's formation agreement provided that the garden would have 3 \"permanent\" members and 7 memberships reserved for nonpermanent members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 GCC and TCC submitted substantively identical declarations describing the nature of their medical marijuana business operations. The declarations assert that GCC and TCC provide \"management services\" to community gardens pursuant to \"management agreements.\" CP at 77, 282. Under the management agreements, GCC and TCC staffed each garden's \"meeting place\" during \"regular hours,\" controlled access to the facility so only members could obtain medical marijuana, maintained membership applications and resignations, verified and confirmed that members were authorized to obtain medical marijuana, maintained records, and produced reports of the management company's expenditures made on behalf of the garden. CP at 77, 282. The offices that GCC and TCC operated\n   were locations where \"the participating patient members access\" the medical marijuana and \"make the ongoing contributions necessary to keep a supply of medicine for the participating patient members.\" CP at 78, 283.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 To obtain medical marijuana at the collective gardens' meeting places, patients authorized to obtain medical marijuana approached an attendant at a window and furnished valid documentation. GCC and TCC management company employees and garden members staffed the window. Once staff confirmed the valid documentation, the prospective member signed a membership agreement and completed a membership application. Members of the collective garden could select from various marijuana products and then make \"an appropriate contribution to the garden\" for the marijuana selections. CP at 80, 285.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 GCC and TCC provided \"menus\" containing descriptions of marijuana products and associated prices for specific amounts of each product. Most people contributed money in exchange for the medical marijuana products. Other types of contributions included assisting members in making selections, contributing hardware, and providing labor at the grow site or processing facility. GCC and TCC declared gross income of tens of thousands of dollars per month for medical marijuana sales during the relevant taxing period on their excise tax returns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 After selecting their medical marijuana and making their \"contribution,\" nonpermanent members were required to \"formally resign their membership.\" CP at 79, 284. Any person seeking medical marijuana at the collective gardens, whether new or returning, needed to complete this process each time so that others could become nonpermanent members and obtain marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II. PROCEDURAL FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 The DOR notified the Taxpayers that medical marijuana sales are subject to sales tax. The Taxpayers paid the taxes for transactions that occurred between 2011 and 2014. Then they requested refunds. The DOR denied the refund requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 The Taxpayers then filed actions for tax refunds under RCW 82.32.180. The superior court consolidated the three refund actions. The Taxpayers and the DOR filed cross motions for summary judgment. The superior court granted summary judgment to the DOR and denied summary judgment to the Taxpayers. The Taxpayers appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   I.

To obtain medical marijuana at the collective gardens' meeting places, authorized patients approached an attendant at a window, which was\n   <em>\n    staffed by \"either\" GCC and TCC employees or garden member volunteers\n   </em>\n   , and furnished valid documentation required to obtain medical marijuana. Once staff or volunteers verified the documentation, the prospective member signed a membership\n   agreement and completed a membership application, selected from various medical marijuana products, and made \"an appropriate contribution to the garden.\" CP at 80, 285. Most patients contributed money in exchange for their medical marijuana products based on \"menus\" containing descriptions of marijuana products and associated prices for specific amounts of each product. Upon leaving the store, the patient resigned his or her membership. These undisputed facts show that the transaction had the characteristics of commercial retail sales. GCC and TCC also declared gross income of tens of thousands of dollars per month for medical marijuana sales during the relevant taxing period on their excise tax returns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b626 Based on these undisputed facts, GCC and TCC managed and staffed facilities where individuals made monetary \"contributions\" for medical marijuana based on specific prices. The Taxpayers staffed the front desk and managed daily operations at the meeting places. They received monetary contributions in exchange for medical marijuana. The transfer of medical marijuana to members in exchange for money or other valuable consideration is a sale of personal property, which constitutes a \"retail sale.\" Former RCW 82.04.040(1) ; RCW 82.04.050(1)(a). As such, the undisputed facts establish that GCC and TCC engaged in retail sales of marijuana. Former RCW 82.04.040(1) ; RCW 82.04.050(1)(a).

To qualify for medical marijuana, a person\n   must be diagnosed with a terminal or debilitating condition, which includes conditions \"unrelieved by standard medical treatments or medications.\" Former RCW 69.51A.010(6)(b) (2010).

In fact, \"naturopathic medicines\" provides that \"[c]ontrolled substances are limited to codeine and testosterone products that are contained in Schedules III, IV, and V in chapter 69.50 RCW.\" RCW 18.36A.020(10). Marijuana, as a schedule I controlled substance, is not a \"naturopathic medicine\" and thus does not qualify as a \"medicine[ ] ... used in the treatment of an individual by a [naturopath.]\" RCW 82.08.0283(1)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b648 The Taxpayers argue that the definitions under ch. 18.36A RCW are not related to the tax exemption for medicines of botanical origin. However, as stated above, the tax exemption explicitly states that medicines utilized only \"in the treatment of an individual by a person licensed under chapter 18.36A RCW\" are tax exempt. RCW 82.08.0283(1)(b). Thus, ch. 18.36 RCW is explicitly incorporated, and we may properly refer to its provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b649 Medical marijuana is not a naturopathic medicine because it is not a \"[m]edicine[ ] of mineral, animal, and botanical origin prescribed, administered, dispensed, or used in the treatment of an individual by a person licensed under chapter 18.36A RCW.\" RCW 82.08.0283(1)(b). As such, the superior court did not err when it concluded as a matter of law that medical marijuana does not qualify for the naturopathic tax exemption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RCW 82.08.0283(1)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b650 We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   BJORGEN, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   SUTTON, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    In 2015, the legislature enacted comprehensive reform concerning the regulation of medical marijuana in Washington.
