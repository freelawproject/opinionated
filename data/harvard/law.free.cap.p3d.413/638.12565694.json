Mr. and Mrs. Fleig were married on June 4, 1992. During most of their marriage, Mr. and Mrs. Fleig kept their property and bank accounts separate and each paid a portion of household bills out of their respective accounts. On April 17, 2015, Mr. Fleig drove Mrs. Fleig to the Credit Union and they met with Tammy Walker, a teller at the Credit Union. Mr. Fleig told Ms. Walker that he wanted to add Mrs. Fleig to his checking account. Mr. and Mrs. Fleig signed a new signature card for the account. The signature card contained two boxes, one providing for joint ownership with rights of survivorship and one providing for joint ownership without rights of survivorship. Both boxes were left blank. The signature card also stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   I/We agree that the changes on this Card amend the previously signed Account Card and are subject to the terms and conditions of the Membership and Account Agreement, Truth-in-Savings Disclosure, Funds Availability Policy Disclosure, if applicable, and to any amendment the Credit Union makes from time to time which are incorporated herein. I/We acknowledge receipt of a copy of the agreements and disclosures applicable to the accounts and services requested.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ms. Walker gave Mr. and Mrs. Fleig a copy of the Credit Union's Membership and Account Agreement. The Membership and Account Agreement provided that \"[u]nless otherwise stated on the Account Card ... a joint account includes rights of survivorship. This means that when one (1) owner dies, all sums in the account will pass to the surviving owner(s).\" Neither of the Fleigs read the Membership and Account Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b64] On July 15, 2015, Mr. Fleig died, leaving behind Mrs. Fleig, two sons from a previous marriage, and a considerable amount of money in the checking account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b65] Mr. Fleig's sons, Timothy L. Fleig and Michael J. Fleig, are the co-personal representatives of his estate. They filed a lawsuit on behalf of the estate against Mrs. Fleig and the Credit Union, asserting several causes of action, including a claim for declaratory judgment regarding ownership of the checking account, the only claim relevant to this appeal. Mrs. Fleig and the Credit Union filed motions for summary judgment. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the estate on the question of ownership of the checking account, concluding that the signature card did not create rights of survivorship, that the account was held by Mr. and Mrs. Fleig as tenants in common, and that 50 percent of the account proceeds passed to the estate and 50 percent passed to Mrs. Fleig. Mrs. Fleig timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b66] The sole issue before us is whether the district court properly concluded that Mr. and Mrs. Fleig owned the checking account as tenants in common and therefore properly granted summary judgment in favor of Mr. Fleig's estate.

The contract between Mr. and Mrs. Fleig and the Credit Union consisted of the signature card and the documents incorporated by reference, including the Membership and Account Agreement. While the signature card provides no indication whether the account provides rights of survivorship, the Membership and Account Agreement states: \"Unless otherwise stated on the Account Card ... a joint account includes rights of survivorship. This means that when one (1) owner dies, all sums in the account will pass to the surviving owner(s).\" Reading the contract as a whole, we conclude that the contract terms are clear and unambiguous: the account includes rights of survivorship. The failure to check the box regarding the right of survivorship did not create an obscure or double meaning making the contract ambiguous where the Membership and Account Agreement provided for rights of survivorship when not otherwise stated on the signature card.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whitney Holding Corp. v.

There is nothing in the record to indicate that Mr. Fleig was not capable of reading or understanding the Membership and Account Agreement or that he was not fully functioning at the time he and Mrs. Fleig created the joint account. In fact, Ms. Walker testified that Mr. Fleig \"seemed coherent and did not appear confused about what he was requesting,\" and that neither Mr. or Mrs. Fleig made \"any statements which led [her] to believe [Mrs. Fleig] was exerting any sort of pressure\" on Mr. Fleig to change the ownership of the account. Further, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Mrs. Fleig on the estate's claim that Mr. Fleig was the subject of undue influence of Mrs. Fleig. The estate did not appeal that conclusion and is bound by it here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b612] The estate also argues that because the Membership and Account Agreement was not read or signed by Mr. or Mrs. Fleig, we should disregard the language contained in the Membership and Account Agreement. The failure to read the Membership and Account Agreement does not render it void or non-binding. \"One who signs a contract generally cannot avoid it on the ground that he did not attend to its terms, or did not read it, or supposed that it was different in its terms, or that he took someone's word as to what it contained.\"\n   <em>\n    Estate of Dahlke ex rel.

Epperley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10454268\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/592/714/#p718\">\n    592 P.2d 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 718 (Wyo. 1979) ), and we explained that \"in the absence of a clear manifestation, on the face of the instrument, of the intention to create a right of survivorship in the account,\" a joint tenancy will not be presumed.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . We concluded that the treasury bill language failed to manifest an intention to create a joint tenancy with a right of survivorship.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 115.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   [\u00b616] In\n   <em>\n    Wartell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10465716\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/580/1142/#p1144\">\n    580 P.2d at 1143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a father and son executed a signature card, which stated that all funds in the checking account \"are, and shall be our joint property and owned by us as joint tenants, with right of survivorship, and not as tenants in common; and upon the death of either of us, any balance in said account shall become the absolute property of the survivor.\" The bank argued that because only the father had the right to sign checks on the account, the language on the signature card could not create a joint tenancy, and thus, after the father's death, the son was not entitled to the proceeds in the account.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10465716\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/580/1142/#p1144\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10465716\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/580/1142/#p1144\">\n    at 1144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We rejected that argument, holding that the terms of the contract with the bank were \"plain and unambiguous\" and expressed the parties' intent to create a joint tenancy with right of survivorship.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1145-46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   [\u00b617] Neither of these cases stands for the proposition that we can only look to the face of the signature card to determine whether the parties intended to create rights of survivorship. Nevertheless, the district court relied upon\n   <em>\n    Oatts\n   </em>\n   to conclude that there was no manifestation on the face of the signature card of any intention to create a right of survivorship and, as a result, a tenancy in common was created. The district court, however, ignored the language contained in the Membership and Account Agreement, which, as we have explained, formed part of the contract between Mr. and Mrs. Fleig and the Credit Union.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [\u00b618] The contract language at issue here is similar to the language in\n   <em>\n    Wartell\n   </em>\n   . While that language did not appear on the signature card, it did form part of the contract between the Credit Union and Mr. and Mrs. Fleig. The language is plain and unambiguous and, therefore, illustrates the parties' intent to create a joint tenancy with right of survivorship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   [\u00b619] After our de novo review of the undisputed facts, we find that the district court should have granted summary judgment in\n   favor of Mrs. Fleig on the question of whether she had a right of survivorship in the checking account. The signature card incorporated the Membership and Account Agreement by reference; accordingly, both documents formed the contract between Mr. and Mrs. Fleig and the Credit Union, and unambiguously expressed the intent that joint accounts have rights of survivorship. Mrs. Fleig has a right of survivorship in the checking account. Reversed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    The estate argues that Mrs. Fleig waived any argument as to application of contract law because she did not raise it below. \"There are few rules more firmly settled in Wyoming jurisprudence than the rule that this court does not consider for the first time on appeal issues that were neither raised in, nor argued to, the trial court.\"\n    <em>\n     Oatts v.

In this case, however, the estate raised the issue of the meaning of the signature card in its claim for declaratory judgment, thus raising the question of contract interpretation in the district court and here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
