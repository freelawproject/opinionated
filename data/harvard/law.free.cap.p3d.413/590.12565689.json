The City enacted ordinances in 2013 enabling the rezone. In 2014, the Central Puget Sound Growth Management Hearings Board (the Board) issued an order of invalidity (2014 order) and remanded the ordinances to the City. In 2015, Heritage and the City published a supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS) and the City adopted new ordinances for the rezone. In 2016, the Board issued an order finding continuing noncompliance (2016 order). Heritage directly appeals the Board's 2016 order. Finding no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    The Property\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 2 Heritage owns approximately 43 acres of undeveloped land (the Property) split into five parcels near the City's eastern boundary. The Property is located within the Skykomish River drainage basin and floodplain, and is bordered by State Route 2 to the south and a steep hillside to the north. The Property regularly floods, and can experience up to 8 feet of flooding during a 100-year flood event. The City's regulations and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 1999 Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) adopted by the City state that the Property is in a 500-year floodplain. Preliminary 2007 FIRMs place the Property within a 100-year floodplain, although the City and FEMA have not adopted these maps.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 The Skykomish River valley is bordered by several ridges. The Property is located primarily on the valley floor and extends up an adjacent slope between 60 and 250 feet. The northern portion of the Property\n   and adjoining properties are classified by the United States Department of Agriculture as severe erosion hazard areas. A geological report noted several recent landslides and evidence of slope failure under a home and its associated property at the top of the northwest section of the slope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 An oxbow slough designated as a Type 1 stream runs through the Property and connects to the Skykomish River. The slough is designated as an urban conservancy, and supports listed threatened and endangered species of fish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 The Property contains category two and category three wetlands, which are critical areas protected under the Monroe Municipal Code (MMC). The Property also contains a native growth protection area (NGPA). The NGPA and the City's critical area regulations limit the presently developable area of the Property to approximately 11.3 acres.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 The Property is currently zoned as limited open space (LOS). LOS zoning allows \"at a minimum level of development, one dwelling unit per five acres,\" with commercial or more intensive uses only allowed as conditional uses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 In July 2010, Heritage and East Monroe Economic Development Group, LLC submitted an application to amend the City's comprehensive plan and rezone the Property from LOS to general commercial (GC). GC zoning would allow for more intensive development, with the final environmental impact statement (FEIS) proposing \"a mixture of commercial development, including retail and restaurant development.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2012, the City issued a final phased environmental impact statement (FPEIS) and adopted Ordinance 018/2012 to amend its comprehensive plan to rezone the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 Lowell Anderson, a resident of the City, challenged the FPEIS and Ordinance 018/2012 before the Monroe Hearing Examiner. The hearing examiner concluded that the FPEIS was inadequate as a matter of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Monroe City Council repealed Ordinance 018/2012 and re-docketed the Property for comprehensive plan review in 2013. Anderson's challenges to the FPEIS and ordinance were dismissed as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 Heritage hired PACE Engineering, Inc. to perform environmental impact analyses to support the rezone. In September 2013, the City, as lead agency under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA), chapter 43.21 C RCW, issued a FEIS for the rezone. The FEIS offered three alternative development plans to Heritage's proposed reclassification: (1) an LOS alternative, including a fitness facility, daycare, and church; (2) a GC alternative, including retail and restaurants; and (3) a mixed use commercial, including professional offices, a medical center, and residential development.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 Anderson again challenged the FEIS before the City's hearing examiner, arguing that the FEIS did not adequately consider and analyze the Property's present use or the environmental impacts of the reclassification. The hearing examiner upheld the adequacy of the FEIS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 In December 2013, the Monroe City Council adopted Ordinance 022/2013 to amend the comprehensive plan and Ordinance 024/2013 to reclassify the Property from LOS to GC (together, 2013 ordinances). Brandi Blair, Matthew Blair, Brett Blair, James Blair, Anderson, Douglas Hamar, and Chad McCammon challenged the 2013 ordinances before the Board in several petitions for review. The petitions were consolidated before the Board.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 In August 2014, the Board issued its final decision and order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The 2014 order found that the FEIS was inadequate under SEPA because it did not properly inform decision-makers of the impacts of the rezone. The Board concluded that the continuing validity of the 2013 ordinances would interfere\n   with the Growth Management Act's (GMA), chapter 36.70A RCW, goal of protecting the environment. The Board remanded the 2013 ordinances to the City and entered a determination of invalidity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13 The City did not appeal the Board's 2014 order. Heritage intervened as a compliance participant to assist the City with complying with the Board's 2014 order. In August 2015, the City, Heritage, and PACE issued a draft SEIS. The draft SEIS incorporated the 2013 FEIS by reference and included appendices with expert reports examining the conditions of the Property's wetlands and habitats, the impacts of fill and compensatory flood storage, and the Property's topography and landslide hazards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14 In September 2015, PACE presented the draft SEIS to the Monroe Planning Commission. The planning commission voted six to one against recommending that the City move forward with the reclassification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15 In October 2015, PACE and the City's SEPA official presented the draft SEIS to the Monroe City Council. On\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   November 2, 2015, the City released the final SEIS. On November 24, 2015, the Monroe City Council voted four to three to adopt Ordinances 015/2015 and 016/2015 (2015 ordinances), which allowed the rezone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 16 The Board held a compliance hearing and, in April 2016, issued an order finding continuing noncompliance (2016 order). The Board found that the SEIS used a true no-action development alternative. But it also found that the SEIS failed to provide an impartial assessment or sufficient discussion of the probable environmental consequences of the reclassification, properly analyze the foreseeable adverse environmental impacts on the entire Property, and provide a reasonably thorough analysis of significant aspects of the possible environmental consequences. The Board concluded that the 2015 ordinances would substantially interfere with GMA's goal of protecting the environment. The Board remanded the 2015 ordinances to the City and entered a determination of invalidity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 17 Heritage applied for direct review of the Board's decision and sought discretionary review by this court. The Snohomish Superior Court, having heard no objection from the Board, certified the case for direct review by this court. On August 8, 2016, a commissioner of this court granted discretionary review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Scope of 2016 Order\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 18 Heritage argues that the Board\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   improperly expanded the scope of its review in its 2016 order to include issues that had been dismissed by the 2014 order. But Heritage cites only to the concurring opinion of the Board's\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   2016 order, which criticized Heritage's failure to provide a new transportation analysis despite the 2014 order's determination that the City's traffic conclusions were not credible. Heritage has not demonstrated that the concurring opinion required additional actions or reargument of the issue before the Board. We reject Heritage's argument and conclude that the Board did not improperly expand the 2016 order's scope of review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Review Framework\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Board Review of Local Planning Actions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 19 The Board \"is charged with adjudicating GMA compliance and invalidating noncompliant plans and development regulations.\"\n   <em>\n    Lewis County v.

The City has not adopted the 2007 FIRMs. Based on the 1999 FIRMs that have been adopted by the City, the Property is in a 500-year floodplain. The MMC does not require compensatory storage for fill activities in a 500-year floodplain. Because the City still considered the Property to be in a 500-year floodplain, the current MMC did not require mitigation through compensatory storage following cut and fill activities on the Property.

Heritage's argument relies on the same assumption that future project actions, such as construction of commercial development, would be required to perform mitigation actions, such as compensatory storage for fill activities. For the reasons stated above, the SEIS's reliance on the requirement of compensatory storage as a mitigation measure is misplaced because the MMC does not currently mandate such mitigation actions.

But Heritage's claims of legal error are without merit. The SEIS clearly erred when it failed to analyze the possible adverse environmental impacts of the maximum possible development of the rezone by relying on its existing regulations. Similarly, the SEIS clearly erred when it failed to provide a reasonably thorough discussion of the probable environmental impacts by assuming that the City's regulations would limit the developable area of the Property. The SEIS also clearly erred when it based its fill, compensatory flood storage, and habitat enhancement conclusions on the inaccurate assumption that the Property was located in a 100-year floodplain under the MMC. Thus, the Board did not demonstrate insufficient deference to the City's planning actions when it properly concluded that the SEIS contained clear legal errors.

For example, as discussed above, the SEIS failed to analyze the adverse environmental impacts that would result from the entire rezoned Property being developed, and mistakenly assumed that the MMC would require future projects to include compensatory storage as mitigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b6 66 The Board concluded that the SEIS was inadequate under SEPA, such that the 2015 ordinances would still substantially interfere with the GMA's goal of protecting the environment. Therefore, the Board's finding of invalidity was based in part on Heritage's failure to meet its burden of showing that its remedial actions had cured the defects identified by the Board. We conclude that the 2016 order did not invalidate the 2015 ordinances on the basis of SEPA alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 67 Heritage argues that the Board erred by not including sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law specifically related to the GMA in its 2016 order. The Board must \"[i]nclude[ ] in the final order a determination, supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law, that the continued validity of part or parts of the plan or regulation would substantially interfere with the fulfillment of the goals of [the GMA].\" RCW 36.70A.302(1)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b6 68 Here, in its 2016 order, the Board provided numerous findings of fact and conclusions of law relating to the SEIS. These findings of fact and conclusions of law supported its ultimate determination that the SEIS was inadequate under SEPA, and thus the 2015 ordinances would substantially interfere with the GMA's goal of protecting the environment.

The Board's 2016 order included numerous findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting its determination of invalidity.
