A jury found Anderson guilty of bail jumping but did not return a verdict on the stolen property charge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Anderson argues that the trial court's to convict instruction for bail jumping was constitutionally inadequate because it did not name possession of stolen property as the underlying crime. Because identifying the underlying crime by name is not an element of bail jumping, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 In January 2016, the police received information that a front loader had been stolen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 After an investigation, the State charged Anderson with one count of possession of stolen property in the first degree for the front loader. The court arraigned Anderson. He posted bail and the court ordered him to appear for a pretrial hearing on April 11, 2016. Anderson failed to appear on April 11, but he appeared the next day. The State filed an amended information adding one count of bail jumping. The case proceeded to a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 At trial, the court instructed the jury on both counts. Relevant to this appeal, the court provided the following to convict instruction for bail jumping:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   To convict the defendant, Britt Anderson, of the crime of Bail Jumping in count 2 of Cause No. 16-1-00216-9, each of the following elements of the crime must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (1) That on or about April 11, 2016, the defendant failed to appear before a court;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (2) That the defendant was charged with a class B or C felony;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (3) That the defendant had been released by court order or admitted to bail with knowledge of the requirement of a subsequent personal appearance before that court; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (4) That the acts occurred in the State of Washington.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   If you find from the evidence that each of these elements has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, then it will be your duty to return a verdict of guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   On the other hand, if, after weighing all of the evidence, you have a reasonable doubt as to any one of these elements, then it will be your duty to return a verdict of not guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Clerk's Papers (CP) at 83 (Instr. 21). The court also instructed the jury that possession of stolen property in the first degree was a class B felony. Anderson did not object to the jury instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b65 The jury found Anderson guilty of bail jumping and he appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b66 Anderson argues that the court's to convict instruction is fatally flawed because it did not specify the underlying crime for the bail jump charge, and it did not identify the underlying crime by name which is an essential element of bail jumping. He also argues the instruction violated his right to due process because it permitted the jury to find him guilty of bail jumping based on being charged with \"a class B or class C felony\" rather than for a specific underlying crime.

THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY INSTRUCTED THE JURY ON BAIL JUMPING\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b68 Anderson's bail jumping arose from his failure to appear in court as ordered. Any person who, after being released on bail with knowledge of the next court date, fails to appear at the required date and time is guilty of bail jumping. RCW 9A.76.170(1). The classification of a bail jumping charge is based on the penalty classification of the underlying crime. RCW 9A.76.170(3). Here, because Anderson failed to appear in a matter relating to a class B felony, the State charged him with bail jumping as a class C felony.
