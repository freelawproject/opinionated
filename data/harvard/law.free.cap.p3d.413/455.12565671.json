On November 7, 2014, Lindquist filed a motion to dismiss, asserting the affirmative defense of entrapment. On April 13, 2015, the District Court denied Lindquist's motion to dismiss for entrapment as a matter of law, holding that the record reflected conflicting facts as to the origination of criminal intent and Lindquist's state of mind that made submitting the issue of entrapment to a jury proper. On February 23, 2016, following two trial continuances, Lindquist reached a plea agreement with the State and pled guilty. On July 5, 2016, the District Court sentenced Lindquist to the Department of Corrections for twenty-five years with twenty years suspended and designated him as a Tier 1 sexual offender. Lindquist timely appeals the District Court's denial of his motion to dismiss on the grounds of entrapment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   \u00b67 The denial of a pretrial motion to dismiss in a criminal case is a question of law, we review for correctness.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Lindquist asserts the criminal intent to engage in prostitution originated in the mind of the Task Force when it placed the Ad on Backpage.com. He maintains he was merely curious about the Ad and did not intend to engage in sex with a minor evidenced by the fact that he went to the motel room without money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   \u00b612 The State counters that Lindquist fails to show the record contains no conflicting facts regarding entrapment as a matter of law, and the District Court correctly determined the issue should be submitted to a jury. The State maintains Lindquist cannot prove that criminal intent originated with the Task Force, that he lacked criminal intent to commit the offense, or that the Task Force induced him into committing a crime he had no intention of committing, thus failing to establish entrapment as a matter of law. The State asserts the idea to purchase sex from the Backpage.com Ad originated with Lindquist as evinced by his series of actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   \u00b613 The District Court determined conflicting facts existed regarding two of the three elements of entrapment as a matter of law, and that the issue of entrapment should be submitted to the jury. The District Court noted conflicting facts concerning: (a) whether the criminal design originated with the Task Force or Lindquist and (b) whether Lindquist's actions could lead a jury to conclude he was merely curious with no intent to commit a crime or that he was induced by law enforcement to commit a crime he had no intention to commit.

The Task Force's Ad on Backpage.com merely provided Lindquist the opportunity to commit a criminal act by soliciting a prostitute. It is not as if the Task Force called Lindquist. Lindquist then made\n   several additional affirmative decisions from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the idea to engage in the criminal behavior originated in his mind. After reading the Backpage.com Ad, Lindquist dialed the contact information. After learning that the prospective sex workers were ages twelve and fifteen, Lindquist arranged a meeting at a Great Falls motel. In the motel room, he proceeded to negotiate for a half-hour of\n   \"regular sex\" with a fifteen-year-old girl. After indicating that he did not bring cash with him, Lindquist retrieved $160 from an ATM, returned to the room, and paid the UC $160 cash to have sex with a minor. Given these facts, Lindquist's entrapment defense would have been a tough sell to a jury, much less warranting dismissal as a matter of law. The District Court did not err when it denied Lindquist's motion to dismiss based on the affirmative defense of entrapment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   \u00b615 The District Court correctly denied Lindquist's motion to dismiss based on the affirmative defense of entrapment as a matter of law.
