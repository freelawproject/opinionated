Adhering to our decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Magana,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12453153\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/197/189/\">\n    197 Wash.

Mr. Alcocer has two biological children with the stepdaughter's mother, who also has two other children from a previous relationship. The record reflects that the victim was twelve years of age. The ages of the other children are not revealed in the record, although it is likely that his biological children are younger than the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 The court imposed a standard range sentence of 27 months in prison, followed by 36 months of community supervision during which he must be evaluated and, if necessary, undergo treatment for sexual deviancy. In addition to typical conditions of supervision, the court imposed the following \"other conditions\" of community custody:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \u2022 Have no contact with minors under the age of 18 without prior approval from his supervising Community Corrections Officer and/or his sex offender treatment provider.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 Obtain a sexual deviancy evaluation, at your own expense, and follow through with recommended treatment if directed by your community corrections officer or therapist;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 Submit to a polygraph and/or plethysmograph testing upon the request of your\n   therapist and/or community corrections officer, at your own expense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 Shall not use or possess any pornographic materials, to include magazines, internet sites, and videos.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 Have absolutely no contact with the victim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Clerk's Papers at 96.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 4 Mr. Alcocer timely appealed to this court, challenging three of the \"other conditions\" of his community custody. A panel considered the case without oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 5 Mr. Alcocer challenges the possession of pornographic materials restriction, the plethysmograph requirement, and the restriction on his contact with minors. We address those contentions in the order listed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Possession of Pornographic Materials\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 6 Mr. Alcocer challenges this condition on the basis that it is unconstitutionally vague and that it was unrelated to his crime. We agree with the former contention, but not the latter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 7 This initial contention involves an issue that has been settled long enough that it should not be recurring. Appellant argues, and respondent agrees, that the possession of \"pornography\" condition is unconstitutionally vague. We also agree.\n   <em>\n    State v.

We remand for the court to change the restriction to limit use or possession of materials depicting \"sexually explicit conduct\" as defined in RCW 9.68A.011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 8 Mr. Alcocer, however, also argues that sexually explicit material was not involved in his offenses and should not, therefore, be a crime-related prohibition in his case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Although acknowledging our decision in\n   <em>\n    Magana\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   he urges that we recede from it because the decision (allegedly) conflicts with the legislature's narrow definition of crime-related prohibitions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 9 Crime-related prohibitions are orders directly related to \"the circumstances of the crime.\" RCW 9.94A.030(10). Determining whether a relationship exists between the crime and the condition \"will always be subjective, and such issues have traditionally been left to the discretion of the sentencing judge.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Having reconsidered the issue at his request, we adhere to that position.\n   <em>\n    Magana\n   </em>\n   did not create a new condition of community custody; it simply recognized the trial court's discretionary authority to impose the restriction when deemed necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 12 Written or visual depictions of sexually explicit conduct do not enjoy robust First Amendment protections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   U.S. Const. amend. I ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ginsberg v.

Such depictions have no overriding artistic or scholarly value. Instead, they consist of \"material intended to stimulate, arouse, or the like.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gnirke,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341340\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/775/1155/\">\n    775 F.3d 1155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2015). An individual who has been convicted of a sex offense has demonstrated an inability to control sexual stimulation and arousal. Accordingly, the State has a legitimate interest in restricting access to sexually explicit content in an effort to reduce recidivism. In addition, the sexual activity portrayed in pornography typically fails to model realistic behavior or affirmative consent by equal partners. The simple fact of a sex offense conviction is indicative of a defendant's manifest inability to process the complex messages sent by pornography in a healthy and legal manner. Just as the State has an interest in restricting access to explicit pornography by minors,\n   <em>\n    see Ginsberg,\n   </em>\n   so too does it have a legitimate interest in restricting access to those convicted of sex offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 13 Accordingly, we believe it is not manifestly unreasonable for trial judges to restrict access to sexually explicit materials for those convicted of sex offenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by imposing this condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Plethysmograph Requirement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 14 The remaining issues are controlled by settled law and need only briefly be discussed. Plethysmograph testing may be used only for sexual deviancy treatment and may not be used for monitoring.\n   <em>\n    State v. Riles,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"812848\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/135/326/#p342\">\n    135 Wash.2d 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 342-46,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=957%20P.2d%20655\">\n    957 P.2d 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998) ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although we appreciate the clear and succinct language used by the trial court to alert Mr. Alcocer to his obligation to undergo polygraph or plethysmograph testing upon direction of supervising authorities, combining those directives in this instance could be read as improperly authorizing the community corrections officer to require plethysmograph testing. That is an improper use of the monitoring authority given to the community corrections officer.\n   <em>\n    Riles,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"812848\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/135/326/#p342\">\n    135 Wash.2d at 344-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=957%20P.2d%20655\">\n    957 P.2d 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 15 Upon remand, the court should clarify that the plethysmograph should only be used at the direction of the sexual deviancy evaluator and/or treatment provider.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Contact with Minors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 16 Mr. Alcocer also contends that the no contact with minors provision improperly limits his contact with his own biological children. However, he did not challenge the provision in the trial court and the record does not support the allegation since we cannot tell the ages of his two children. Although it is likely that they are younger than the victim, that is not a foregone conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 17 However, since the case is being remanded for other reasons, Mr. Alcocer is free to raise this issue before the trial court. Limitations on contact with one's own children must be imposed sensitively with respect for the offender's constitutional right to parent and are subject to strict review.\n   <em>\n    In re Pers.
