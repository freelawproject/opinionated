Emerald also contends the Ordinance is either expressly or impliedly preempted by chapter 69.50 RCW. We uphold the Ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 2 On November 6, 2012, Washington voters approved Initiative 502 (I-502). LAWS OF 2013, ch. 3. The expressed purposes of I-502 included allowing law enforcement to \"focus on violent and property crimes,\" generating \"new state and local tax revenue for education, health care, research, and substance abuse prevention,\" and taking \"marijuana out of the hands of illegal drug organizations.\" Initiative 502, LAWS OF 2013, ch. 3, \u00a7 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 The legislature subsequently codified I-502 within Washington's Uniform Controlled Substances Act (UCSA).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Former ch. 69.50 RCW (2014). As amended, the\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   UCSA legalized\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the limited production, processing, and sale of recreational marijuana to persons twenty-one years and older. Former RCW 69.50.360 (2014). It also created a regulatory state licensing system through the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board (Board). Former RCW 69.50.325 -.369 (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 The Board adopted rules governing marijuana sales. Former ch. 314-55 WAC (2014) (adopted pursuant to statutory authority provided at RCW 69.50.345 ). In October 2013, the Board established the application requirements for marijuana retailer licenses. Former WAC 314-55-015 to - 050, - 079, - 081 (2014). After determining the maximum number of stores per county, the Board held a lottery for licenses from prospective retailers. Former WAC 314-55-081(1) (2014). Before granting any license, the Board conducted mandatory background checks, including any history of administrative violations. Former WAC 314-55-020(3) (2014). Cities, counties, or other authorities could object to a business receiving a license. Former WAC 314-55-020(1), - 050(9) (2014). However, the final decision to issue a retail license remained with the Board. Former WAC 314-55-050 (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 In January 2014, at the Board's request, the Attorney General's Office (AGO) issued an opinion regarding the authority of local governments to ban marijuana businesses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The AGO opinion analyzed both field and conflict preemption, and opined that state law did not preempt local government action in this area. According to the AGO, local governments retained the authority to enact local bans on marijuana sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 On May 27, 2014, Clark County (County) passed an Ordinance, which banned, as applicable here, the retail sale of recreational marijuana within unincorporated Clark County. Clark County Code (CCC) 40.260.115.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   It forbade the sale of retail recreational marijuana so long as the federal government listed marijuana as a controlled substance. CCC 40.260.115(B)(4). It did not do the same for medical marijuana. CCC 40.260.115(B)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 Notwithstanding the Ordinance, Emerald applied to the Board for a retail license to sell marijuana in the unincorporated area of Clark County. The County objected. RCW 69.50.331(7)(b). Nonetheless, in September 2014, the Board issued Emerald's license for the retail sale of recreational marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II. PROCEDURAL FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A. Cowlitz County Proceeding\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 8 Emerald challenged the Ordinance and sought declaratory and injunctive relief in Cowlitz County Superior Court. Emerald argued that the UCSA preempted the Ordinance. Emerald and the County filed cross motions for summary judgment on the preemption issue. The AGO intervened on behalf of the County. In December 2014, the superior court ruled that the UCSA did not preempt the Ordinance. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the County and the AGO. This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   B. Clark County Proceeding\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 9 With the 2014 appeal stayed, Emerald moved ahead with development plans. In\n   September 2015, Emerald applied for a building permit to make improvements to the retail space it rented in a commercial building in the County. Emerald described the proposed use as \" 'General retail .... Business will sell novelties, crafts, collectibles, and general merchandise.' \" CP (49395-1) at 24. On December 2, 2015, the County issued Emerald a building permit authorizing the planned improvements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 10 Emerald then began Board-licensed retail sales of marijuana in the County in December 2015. By January 2016, the County became aware of Emerald's activities and ordered Emerald to cease all sales of marijuana and marijuana products. The County also revoked Emerald's building permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 11 Emerald appealed to the Clark County Hearing Examiner (Examiner), who ruled in favor of the County. The Examiner found that Emerald sold marijuana in violation of the General Commercial Zoning District, and had obtained its building permit based on a misrepresentation. Pursuant to the Land Use Petition Act (LUPA),\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Emerald appealed to the Clark County Superior Court, which affirmed the Examiner. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   STATE LAW DOES NOT PREEMPT THE ORDINANCE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 12 Emerald's consolidated appeal asserts a single assignment of error involving preemption, i.e. that the \"trial court erred in finding that [the Ordinance] does not irreconcilably conflict with state law.\" Br. of Appellant at 2. Specifically, Emerald argues that the Ordinance violates article XI, section 11 of the Washington Constitution because it irreconcilably conflicts with the UCSA. In addition, Emerald contends that the Ordinance is either expressly or impliedly preempted by I-502 and the UCSA. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A. Legal Principles\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 13 We review \"an order granting summary judgment de novo, engaging in the same inquiry as the trial court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Weden v.

Summary judgment is proper if \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" CR 56(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 14 Emerald argues the Ordinance is preempted by state law and thus unconstitutional.

Constitutional preemption challenges are reviewed de novo.\n   <em>\n    Watson v.

County Police Powers Under the Washington Constitution\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 15 In Washington, local governments wield significant regulatory powers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   WASH. CONST . art. XI, \u00a7 11. They derive from Article XI, section 11 which states, \"Any county, city, town or township may make and enforce within its limits all such local police, sanitary and other regulations as are not in conflict with general laws.\" This provision, known as \"home rule,\" presumes that local governments are autonomous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Watson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=189%20Wash.%202d%20149\">\n    189 Wash.2d at 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=401%20P.3d%201\">\n    401 P.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The scope of [a county's] police power is broad, encompassing all those measures which bear a reasonable and substantial relation to promotion of the general welfare of the people.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Initiative 502, LAWS OF 2013, ch. 3, \u00a7 1. There is no evidence of legislative intent to regulate the location of retail stores within counties. Rather, the UCSA requires the Board to set a maximum number of retail licenses for each county, not to regulate the specific location of each store. RCW 69.50.345. The Board's own regulations clarify that retail licenses do not supersede local law, including local zoning authority. WAC 314-55-020(15).

As amended, the language of RCW 69.50.540 establishes new revenue sharing guidelines:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   (i) ... [T]he legislature must appropriate an amount equal to thirty percent of all marijuana excise taxes deposited into the general fund ... for distribution to counties, cities, and towns as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   (A) Thirty percent must be distributed to counties, cities, and towns where licensed marijuana retailers are physically located ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   (B) Seventy percent must be distributed to counties, cities, and towns ratably on a per capita basis.

Thirty percent of the tax revenue is earmarked for the jurisdictions where retail stores are physically located, returning a share of locally generated taxes to the cities and towns. RCW 69.50.540(2)(g)(i)(A). Seventy percent is distributed to counties, cities, and towns on a per capita basis, even if there are no retail locations operating within the jurisdiction. RCW 69.50.540(2)(g)(i)(B). This amendment particularly benefits counties, which receive sixty percent of this distribution based on their proportional population. These financial carrots, however, are accompanied by a stick: \"[f]unds may only be distributed to jurisdictions that do not prohibit the siting of any state licensed marijuana producer, processor, or retailer.\" RCW 69.50.540(2)(g)(i)(B). Thus, local jurisdictions that allow retail sales receive a share of tax revenues. Jurisdictions that ban marijuana sales do not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 39 By expressly contemplating that local jurisdictions can \"prohibit the siting of any state licensed marijuana ... retailer[,]\" the UCSA acknowledges that local governments retain zoning authority over retail locations.

Instead, the revenue sharing mechanism created by RCW 69.50.540(2)(g)(i) uses financial incentives to encourage local governments to allow marijuana sales. This cooperative approach is consistent with the legislature's expressed intent to enter into a \"partnership with local jurisdictions\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   regarding marijuana policy, and strongly suggests the legislature intended to preserve the right of local governments to ban retail stores.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   3.
