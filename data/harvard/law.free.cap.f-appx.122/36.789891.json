A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude Abdullah-Malik has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, as to all the appeals, we deny certificates of appealability and dismiss the appeals.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b69-10\"> This court lacks jurisdiction to directly review a magistrate judge\u2019s order absent consent. Accordingly, No. 04-7316, in which Abdullah-Malik seeks to appeal the magistrate judge's order denying his motion to amend, is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
