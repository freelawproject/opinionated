We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Williams v. Farrior, </em>No. CA-03-519-1 (E.D.Va. Sept. 20, 2004). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
