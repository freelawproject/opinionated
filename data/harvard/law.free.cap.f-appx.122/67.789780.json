Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Bougha fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Having failed to qualify for asylum, Bougha cannot meet the higher standard to qualify for withholding of removal. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999); <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-25\">Bougha further asserts that he was denied due process at the asylum hearing because the Immigration Court did not provide him with a competent and reliable interpreter. We reject this claim because Bougha fails to show that he was prejudiced by the alleged error. <em>See Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 320 (4th Cir.2002). Fi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>nally, we uphold the IJ\u2019s finding that Bougha failed to establish that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to Cameroon. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
