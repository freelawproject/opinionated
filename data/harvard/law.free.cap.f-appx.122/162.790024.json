Magee argues that prison officer Powe interfered with his constitutional right of access to the courts by failing to timely mail his state postconviction application.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-16\">Magee\u2019s arguments on appeal address only Powe\u2019s alleged violation of Magee\u2019s right of access to the courts. Magee has not addressed the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to amend his complaint to add Powe as a defendant. Thus, he has abandoned any challenge to that ruling on appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Because Powe was not a defendant in the suit, Magee\u2019s arguments regarding Powe\u2019s denial of his rights are not relevant to the disposition of this appeal. The district court did not err in determining that Magee\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-21\">Magee\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is thus DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-22\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Magee\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim and the dismissal of the instant appeal as frivolous count as two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Ma-gee is cautioned that once he accumulates three strikes, he will not be permitted to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-23\">Magee\u2019s motion for an appointment of counsel on appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-24\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b194-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
