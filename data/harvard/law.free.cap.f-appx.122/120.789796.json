The papers were destroyed pursuant to a prison policy limiting the amount of legal materials an inmate could keep in prison storage. The district court denied Phillips\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Phillips challenges the district court\u2019s determination that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). To establish good faith, Phillips must show that his appeal involves legal points which are arguable on their merits and not frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Phillips contends that the district court erred by failing to state reasons for its certification decision and asserts that he was denied his right of access to the courts because the destruction of his legal materials prevented him from meeting the deadline to file a petition for a writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court. Because Phillips has not shown that he would have raised a nonfrivolous issue if he had been able to file a timely petition for writ of certiorari, he has not established actual injury. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351-52, 355, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996); <em>Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Accordingly, we uphold the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issues. Phillip\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Phillip\u2019s complaint as frivolous and this dismissal both count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Phillips is warned that if he accumulates a third strike, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">\n<em>IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b152-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
