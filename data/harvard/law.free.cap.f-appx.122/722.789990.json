Lab.Code Ann. \u00a7 21.00-21.128. Ernst appeals the district court\u2019s award of $1,125.65 in internal copying costs and cost of a video taped deposition of one of the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-18\">Ernst first improperly argues that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rachid v. Jack in the Box, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 305 (5th Cir.2004), should alter the outcome of the appeal on the merits of her discrimination claim, which this court has already heard. Because this Court has affirmed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for Sunbelt, however, 108 Fed.Appx. 911 (5th Cir.2004), that issue is not before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-19\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-20\">We review a district court\u2019s award of costs to the prevailing party for abuse of discretion. <em>Fogleman v. ARAMCO, </em>920 F.2d 278 (5th Cir.1991). Ernst argues that the district court abused its discretion when it awarded Sunbelt $1,125.65 in internal copying costs after finding that Sunbelt\u2019s internal copying costs \u201cnecessarily resulted from the litigation\u201d as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920. We find that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it made the factual finding based upon Sunbelt\u2019s affidavit, that Sunbelt\u2019s internal copying costs \u201cnecessarily resulted from the litigation.\u201d Further, we hold that allowing Sunbelt to recover $.20 per page was not an abuse of discretion, particularly in light of 5th Cir. R. 39.1, which permits recoverable reproduction costs of up to $.25 per page.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-21\">Second, Ernst argues that the award of the cost of a videotape copy of Beck\u2019s deposition was an abuse of discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>tion because 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920 only allows the successful party to recover for paper, but not video depositions. <em>Mota v. University of Texas Houston Health Science Center, </em>261 F.3d 512 (5th Cir.2001). However, Ernst did not present that argument before the district court. Not only did Ernst not cite any legal authority, she also did not mention the distinction between paper and video copies in her objections to Sunbelt\u2019s bill of costs. Because Ernst therefore did not raise the argument before the district court \u201cto such a degree that the district court [had] an opportunity to rule on it,\u201d it is not properly before this court on appeal. <em>F.D.I.C. v. Mijalis, </em>15 F.3d 1314, 1327 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b755-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
