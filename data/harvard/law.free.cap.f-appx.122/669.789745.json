See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b701-26\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b701-27\">In these consolidated appeals, George Chambers seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s orders denying relief on his motion filed under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651 (2000), construed as a successive motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), and his motion for relief from judgment filed under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-28\">A certificate of appealability is required in order to appeal these orders. <em>See Jones v. Braxton, </em>392 F.3d 683, 688 (4th Cir. 2004); <em>Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 367-70 (4th Cir.2004). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Chambers has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Because Chambers\u2019s motion under Rule 60(b) asserted a new claim and did not merely allege a defect in the collateral process, it constituted a successive \u00a7 2255 motion rather than a true Rule 60(b) motion. <em>See United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 205 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 995, 124 S.Ct. 496, 157 L.Ed.2d 395 (2003). In accordance with <em>Winestock, </em>we construe Chambers\u2019s notice of appeal and informal brief as an application for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Id. </em>at 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">A movant seeking authorization to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion must show either: (1) a new rule of constitutional law, previously unavailable, made retroactive by the Supreme Court to cases on collateral review; or (2) newly discovered evidence that would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(C), 2255 \u00b6 8 (2000). Chambers\u2019s claims do not satisfy either of these conditions. We therefore deny Chambers authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
