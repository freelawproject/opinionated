Reaves appeals from the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to defendants and dismissing his complaint <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> in which he alleged violations of the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution, as applied through the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1971, 1973, 1973c (2000)), and the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Glover v. South Carolina Democratic Party, </em>No. CA-04-2171-4-25 (D.S.C. Sept. 3, 2004). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b115-17\"> Five other plaintiffs were named in the complaint. Rev. Reaves is the only plaintiff who appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
