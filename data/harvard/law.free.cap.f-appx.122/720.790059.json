He argues that the district court erred in denying him a reduction in his offense level for a mitigating role in the offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. Flores has not shown that the district court clearly erred in determining that he was not entitled to a reduction in his offense level for a mitigating role in the offense as he was carrying a large amount (58 kilograms) of marijuana and as a courier he was an \u201cindispensable part of drug dealing networks.\u201d <em>See United States v. Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d 135, 138 (5th Cir. 1989); <em>see also United States v. Rojas, </em>868 F.2d 1409, 1409-10 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-19\">Flores argues that the district court erred in departing upward based on improper factors and that the district court\u2019s failure to give further written reasons for its upward departure was plain error. The district court based its decision to depart upward on factors which were authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b) and the Sentencing Guidelines, including Flores\u2019s extensive criminal background and his propensity to recidivism. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.3, 5K2.0; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b); <em>see also United States v. Milton, </em>147 F.3d 414, 420-21 (5th Cir.1998). Flores has three juvenile convictions which were not included in his criminal history score; he admitted to being part of a dangerous gang, the \u201cTri-City Bombers\u201d; his criminal activity continued over the next six years and became progressively more violent; and he committed the instant offense within three months of his release from jail for the injury to a child offense. <em>See United States v. Winters, </em>105 F.3d 200, 205 (5th Cir.1997). Moreover, Flores has not shown that the district court\u2019s written reasons were insufficient under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) or that the district court\u2019s failure to provide further written reasons constituted plain error. <em>See United States v. Ravitch, </em>128 F.3d 865, 869 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Flores also argues that the district court\u2019s upward departure was improper in view of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Flores\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1003, 160 L.Ed.2d 1006 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">Flores argues that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952 and 960 are unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Flores\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir.2000). <em>Slaughter </em>applies by analogy to the instant case because the statutes at issue are similar in structure and content. One panel of this court may not overrule another. <em>See United States v. Fowler, </em>216 F.3d 459, 461 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 960, 121 S.Ct. 387, 148 L.Ed.2d 298 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b753-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined, that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
