Mitchell argued that the district court lacked sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>ject-matter jurisdiction because such an offense is not a \u201cfederal crime.\u201d The district court concluded that Mitchell\u2019s petition was in the nature of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and that Mitchell had not satisfied the \u201csavings clause\u201d of that statute. <em>See Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). The district court dismissed Mitchell\u2019s petition as an unauthorized successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Although Mitchell may proceed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 if he demonstrates that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 was \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d under the latter statute\u2019s \u201csavings clause,\u201d Mitchell has not made such a showing. Mitchell\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), also demonstrates that his claims could have been raised either on direct appeal or in a prior 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion; Mitchell was not convicted until 2001. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir .2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">This appeal is without arguable merit and, therefore, it is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Additionally, Mitchell has previously filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition challenging his indictment and conviction. <em>Mitchell v. Wendt, </em>95 Fed.Appx. 557 (5th Cir.2004) (unpublished) (affirming dismissal of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition). Mitchell is warned that any future frivolous pleadings under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 challenging this conviction will invite the imposition of sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b198-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
