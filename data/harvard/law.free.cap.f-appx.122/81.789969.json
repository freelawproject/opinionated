R. Bankr.P. 8009. We vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-30\">Broadnax\u2019s appeal was docketed in the district court on June 8, 2004. On June 15, 2004, Broadnax filed a \u201cRequest to Amend Appeal Brief Filed on 5/20/04\u201d, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>along with an \u201cAmended Appeal Brief.\u201d On July 19, the district court denied Broadnax\u2019s motion. On August 5, the district court dismissed Broadnax\u2019s appeal for failure to file a brief in accordance with Rule 8009. Broadnax noted a timely appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">We find that Broadnax\u2019s \u201cAmended Appeal Brief,\u201d filed within the requisite fifteen days after her appeal was docketed <em>(see </em>Fed. R. Bankr.P. 8009), should have been considered as her appeal brief. Although Broadnax\u2019s motion references an original appeal brief filed on May 20, 2004, that brief is not in the record. Broadnax may have been confused or the brief may have been lost. In the absence of an original brief, Broadnax\u2019s amended brief should have been accepted as her brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Even if Broadnax had filed no brief at all, the district court\u2019s dismissal of her appeal was an abuse of discretion. Rule 8009 provides that an appellant must serve and file a brief within fifteen days after entry of the appeal on the docket. Accordingly, Broadnax\u2019s brief was due by June 23, 2004. However, adherence to Rule 8009 is non-jurisdictional. <em>See </em>Bankr.R. 8001(a) (providing that an appellant\u2019s failure to \u201ctake any step other than the timely filing of a notice of appeal does not affect the validity of the appeal, but is ground only for such action as the district court ... deems appropriate, which may include dismissal of the appeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The district court thus has the discretion to dismiss an appeal if the appellant fails to comply with the procedural requirements of the bankruptcy rules, including failing to meet the time limits for filing an appeal brief. To determine whether to dismiss a bankruptcy appeal for failure to timely file a brief, the district court must exercise its discretion under Bankruptcy Rule 8001(a). <em>In re SPR Corp., </em>45 F.3d 70, 74 (4th Cir.1995). In applying Rule 8001(a), the district court must take one of the four steps outlined in <em>In re Serra Builders, Inc., </em>970 F.2d 1309 (4th Cir. 1992). Specifically, the court must: \u201c(1) make a finding of bad faith or negligence; (2) give the appellant notice and an opportunity to explain the delay; (3) consider whether the delay had any possible prejudicial effect on the other parties; or (4) indicate that it considered the impact of the sanction and available alternatives,\u201d keeping in mind that dismissal is a \u201charsh sanction which the district court must not impose lightly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1311. Proper application of the <em>Serra Builders </em>test requires the court to consider and balance all relevant factors. <em>SPR Corp., </em>45 F.3d at 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">Here, the district court failed to consider any of these factors. The district court\u2019s failure to exercise its discretion in accordance with <em>Serra Builders </em>and <em>SPR Corp. </em>amounts to an abuse of its discretion. <em>See James v. Jacobson, </em>6 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.1993) (stating that abuse of discretion may occur by failure to exercise discretion, failure to take into account judicially recognized factors constraining exercise of discretion, or erroneous factual or legal premises).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order dismissing Broadnax\u2019s appeal and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We deny Broadnax\u2019s motion for sanctions and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
