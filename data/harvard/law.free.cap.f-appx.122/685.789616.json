He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. Mandamus is a drastic remedy, to be granted only in extraordinary circumstances. <em>In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826 (4th Cir.1987). We note that the district court recently issued an order denying Kokoski\u2019s recusal motion, rendering this portion of Kokoski\u2019s mandamus petition moot. Moreover, because there has been recent significant action in the district court, we find no undue delay. Accordingly, we deny Kokoski\u2019s petition for writ of mandamus. We grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-20\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
