Parties are accorded sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal when the United States is a party, Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (I960)). The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on May 16, 2003. The notice of appeal was filed, at the earliest, on September 8, 2004. Because Myles failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we deny Myles\u2019 motion to expand the record and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
