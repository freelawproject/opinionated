Wright argues that he is entitled to copies of transcripts and records from his state court criminal case under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, and the Texas Open Records Act, Texas Gov\u2019t Code Ann. \u00a7 552.001, et seq. Wright asserts that Texas Gov\u2019t Code Ann. \u00a7 552.028, which allows Texas agencies to refuse requests for records from prisoners, is unconstitutional. Wright additionally contends that the district court misconstrued his complaint and considered claims that he did not raise.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-17\">Wright is not entitled to copies of the transcripts and records under the Freedom of Information Act because it applies to federal agencies, not state agencies. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. He is not entitled to copies of the transcripts and records under the Texas Open Records Act because it contains a provision allowing state agencies to refuse requests for documents from prisoners. <em>See </em>Texas Gov\u2019t Code Ann. \u00a7 552.028; <em>Hickman v. Moya, </em>976 S.W.2d 360, 361 (Tex.Ct.App.1998). Furthermore, Wright \u201cdoes not have a federally-protected right to a free copy of his transcript or other court records merely to search for possible error in order to file a petition for collateral relief at some future date.\u201d <em>Colbert v. Beto, </em>439 F.2d 1130, 1131 (5th Cir.1971); <em>see also Bonner v. Henderson, </em>517 F.2d 135, 136 (5th Cir. 1975). Accordingly, Wright\u2019s claim that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>Texas Gov\u2019t Code Ann. \u00a7 552.028 is unconstitutional is without merit. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Wright additionally argues that he did not bring the remainder of the claims that the district court considered. He has not shown that the district court committed reversible error by doing this, however, because he has not shown that he was prejudiced by the dismissal of claims that he did not bring. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Wright\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th C\u00ede. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). We warn Wright that if he accumulates three \u201cstrikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Wright should review any pending appeals and withdraw any that are frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; STRIKE WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b757-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
