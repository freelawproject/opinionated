Green appeals the district court\u2019s judgment granting the defendants\u2019 motion for sanctions and dismissing Green\u2019s claims for want of prosecution. On appeal, Green argues the merits of his underlying claims but fails to provide any legal arguments or authority challenging the district court\u2019s determinations to grant defendants\u2019 motion for sanctions and to dismiss his claims for failure to prosecute. Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Because Green fails to address the district court\u2019s basis for dismissing his claims, he has abandoned these issues. <em>See Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 224-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-22\">The district court judgment is AFFIRMED. Green\u2019s motions for leave to file a supplemental brief, to enjoin ongoing fiduciary violations, to take notice of post-judgment data from another federal agency, relating to appellant\u2019s motion to enjoin fiduciary violations, and to borrow certain records from archives are DENIED. All of Green\u2019s motions are DENIED. Appellees\u2019 amended motion for sanctions and an injunction is DENIED. However, Green is WARNED that any future frivolous appeals filed by him or on his behalf will invite the imposition of sanctions. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>should therefore review any pending appeals to ensure that they do not raise arguments that are frivolous.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b825-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
