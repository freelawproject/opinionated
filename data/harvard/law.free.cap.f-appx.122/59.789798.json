The district court dismissed the motion without prejudice for failure to exhaust state court remedies. This order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that the district court\u2019s assessment of his constitutional claims is debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, 252 </em>F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">The record demonstrates that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the motion as Lester failed to obtain prefiling authorization from this court to file it.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Lester\u2019s failure to obtain prefiling authorization to file the \u00a7 2254 petition in the first instance precludes granting a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b92-8\"> Another district judge had dismissed Lester's earlier \u00a7 2254 petition as barred by the statute of limitations, and this court denied a certificate of appealability and dismissed the appeal. <em>Lester v. South Carolina, </em>57 Fed. Appx. 156 (4th Cir.2003) (unpublished). The district judge\u2019s order in that case expressly stated that the petition was denied with prejudice, but the judgment stated that dismissal was without prejudice. In light of the reasoning underlying the district court\u2019s dismissal, we conclude that the earlier action was dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
