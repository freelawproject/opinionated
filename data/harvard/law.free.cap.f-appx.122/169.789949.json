Moore asserts that he did not understand the consequences of his plea, and the error affected his substantial rights. Moore argues that the district court\u2019s nunc pro tunc order that accepted his plea adjudged him guilty of an offense on which he had not been arraigned and to which he did not plead guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">We must examine the basis of our jurisdiction on our own motion if necessary. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). A motion for reconsideration in a criminal case is timely if filed within the time prescribed for noticing an appeal under Fed. R.App. P. 4(b). <em>United States v. Brewer, </em>60 F.3d 1142, 1143 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">Moore\u2019s amended judgment on re-senteneing was entered on February 17, 2004. As the district court determined, if Moore\u2019s motion to dismiss the 1999 order is construed as a motion for reconsideration of a criminal judgment, Moore had until March 2, 2004, to timely file the motion. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(l)(i); <em>Brewer, </em>60 F.3d at 1143. Moore filed the motion on March 5, 2004. As the district court correctly observed, the motion was not timely filed, and the district court was without jurisdiction to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-15\">The district court\u2019s nunc pro tunc order corrected a clerical error. Rule 36, Fed. R.CrimP., provides that the district court \u201cmay at any time correct a clerical error in a judgment, order, or other part of the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-16\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of Moore\u2019s motion to dismiss the 1999 order and the district court\u2019s Nunc Pro Tunc Order Accepting Guilty Plea are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b202-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
