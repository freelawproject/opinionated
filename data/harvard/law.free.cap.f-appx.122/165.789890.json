Taylor argues that he is entitled to a downward departure based on the alleged improper assessment of criminal history points for a DWI conviction. In support of his argument, Taylor cites to <em>Dretke v. Haley, </em>541 U.S. 386, 124 S.Ct. 1847, 1853, \u25a0 \u2014 \u25a0 L.Ed.2d -,-(2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">Taylor has not met his burden of showing that he meets the requirements for filing a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition under the \u201csavings clause\u201d provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. He has neither pointed to a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that he may have been imprisoned for conduct that was not prohibited by law nor shown that his claims were foreclosed by circuit law at the time of his conviction, appeal, or first 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Reyes-Requena v.
