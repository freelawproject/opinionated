Under \u00a7 4246, if, after a hearing, a district court determines by clear and convincing evidence that a person is suffering from a mental disease or defect that would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to the property of another, the court shall commit the person to the custody of the Attorney General. Once committed, an individual may periodically move for a hearing under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4247(h) (2000) to determine whether the committed person should be discharged from commitment under \u00a7 4246. To obtain his release from commitment, the district court must find by a preponderance of the evidence that the committed person has recovered <em>from </em>his mental disease or defect to such an extent that his release would no longer pose a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to the property of another. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4246(e) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-26\">This court will overturn a district court\u2019s finding that a substantial risk of harm exists only if the finding is clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Cox, </em>964 F.2d 1431, 1433 (4th Cir.1992). A finding is clearly erroneous when \u201cthe reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Faulconer v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>748 F.2d 890, 895 (4th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">We have thoroughly reviewed the materials submitted by the parties in this matter and conclude that the district court\u2019s determination that Hicks still meets the requirements for commitment under \u00a7 4246 was not clearly erroneous. We therefore affirm the order of the district court continuing Hicks\u2019 commitment under \u00a7 4246. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
