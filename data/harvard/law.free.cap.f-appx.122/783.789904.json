We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">We essentially agree with the analysis given by the district court, and can find no error of law or abuse of discretion that would warrant overturning the order. So long as the district court hearing the limitation action \u201csatisfies itself that a vessel owner\u2019s right to seek limitation will be protected, the decision to dissolve the injunction is well within the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Lewis &amp; Clark Marine, Inc., </em>531 U.S. 438, 454, 121 S.Ct. 993, 148 L.Ed.2d 931 (2001). While <em>Lewis </em>did not involve the precise issue pending before us, we believe that the essential purpose of the Act in these circumstances- \u2014 to limit FKM\u2019s liability to the value of the limitation fund \u2014 was preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">Perhaps one party or the other has engaged in forum shopping, and perhaps one court or the other should entertain a motion for intra-district transfer, but that issue is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b816-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
