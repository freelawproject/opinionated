As to his asylum application, Pirmuhammad seeks to challenge the BIA\u2019s determination that his application was untimely under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2). This court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that Pirmuhammad\u2019s asylum application was untimely. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Pirmuhammad argues that the BIA erred in denying his application for withholding of removal. He contends that the several death threats he received while living in the Sindh province of Pakistan constitute past persecution. \u201c[Pjersecution requires more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, unaccompanied by any physical punishment, infliction of harm, or significant deprivation of liberty.\u201d <em>Eduard v. </em>Ashcroft, 379 F.3d 182, 187 n. 4 (5th Cir. 2004) (quotation omitted). According to his testimony, Pirmuhammad was never physically abused, detained, or interrogated by police. He has failed to show that he was subject to past persecution. <em>See id.; Abdel-Masieh v. INS, </em>73 F.3d 579, 583-84 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Because Pirmuhammad failed to establish past persecution, he must show that it is more likely than not that he will suffer persecution in the future. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2). Relying on documentary evidence, he argues that members of the MQM party face continuing danger in Pakistan.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Pirmuhammad testified that he was able to avoid threats and persecution from 1994 to 1998 by moving to small villages in the Sindh province. The documentary evidence shows that MQM party members such as Pirmuhammad can safely relocate to other provinces. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Pirmuhammad has not met his burden to establish an entitlement to withholding of removal. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906 (5th Cir.2002); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2), (3)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">Pirmuhammad does not brief the BIA\u2019s denial of relief under the CAT. Accordingly, he has waived the claim. <em>See Rodriguez v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 408, 414 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">Pirmuhammad\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b164-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
