TorresRiasco challenges the IJ\u2019s finding that he failed to meet any of the three requirements for cancellation of removal. This court reviews only the BIA\u2019s decision except to the extent that the IJ\u2019s decision influenced the decision of the BIA. <em>See Beltran-Resendez v. INS, </em>207 F.3d 284, 286 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). Accordingly, because the BIA\u2019s decision rested solely upon the hardship requirement, the other requirements for cancellation of removal are not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">Because this case involves the granting of relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b), the jurisdictional bar of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) is implicated. <em>See Garcia-Melendez v. Ashcroft, </em>351 F.3d 657, 661 (5th Cir.2003). The jurisdiction-stripping provision eliminates jurisdiction over those decisions that involve the exercise of discretion. <em>Mireles-Valdez v. Ashcroft, </em>349 F.3d 213, 216 (5th Cir.2003). The IJ\u2019s determination that Torres-Riasco\u2019s spouse and child would not suffer an \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d if Torres-Riasco were removed to Colombia involved the exercise of discretion. <em>Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir. 2004). Therefore, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination on hardship. The respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction is GRANTED, and Torres-Riasco\u2019s petition is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b203-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
