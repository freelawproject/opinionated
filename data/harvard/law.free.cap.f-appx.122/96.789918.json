We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">In May 1995, Allen purchased a 1995 Fleetwood Manufactured Home. In so doing, Allen gave Green Tree a security interest in the manufactured home. Thereafter, in September 1997, Allen filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code. In July 1999, Allen and Green Tree submitted an Agreed Order valuing the manufactured home at $27,000. In her Chapter 13 Plan, Allen was to pay Green Tree the $27,000 secured value in full. Based on the Chapter 13 Trustee\u2019s Final Report and Account, Allen paid on Green Tree\u2019s secured claim $8,080.30 in principal and $3,356.13 in interest. Thus, Allen failed to pay Green Tree\u2019s secured claim in full at the time Allen\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy case was closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-16\">The decision to grant relief from the automatic stay is within the discretion of the bankruptcy judge, and on appeal is subject to review under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Matter of Mendoza, </em>111 F.3d 1264, 1266 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-17\">Upon completion by the debtor of all payments due under a confirmed plan, the court is to grant a Chapter 13 debtor discharge from all debts with certain exceptions specified in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1328(a). Such a discharge operates as an injunction against the commencement or continuation of any action to collect, recover, or offset any discharged debt as a personal liability of the debtor. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-18\">Liens do not survive bankruptcy where the debt is provided for in the plan and paid in full. <em>In re Echevarria, </em>212 B.R. 26, 28 (Bankr.D.P.R.1997). However, where the debt is not paid in full, a secured creditor\u2019s hen is not extinguished. <em>In re Stovall, </em>256 B.R. 490, 493-94 (Bankr. N.D.Ill.1999). As Green Tree\u2019s claim was not paid in full, Green Tree\u2019s hen has passed through Allen\u2019s bankruptcy unaffected and has not been extinguished by Allen\u2019s Chapter 13 discharge. Therefore, the district court properly concludes that the bankruptcy court\u2019s order lifting the automatic stay was not an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the opinion of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b129-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
