Graham appeals the district court\u2019s judgment affirming the Social Security Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny disability benefits. He argues that the determination by the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) that he did not meet or equal the criteria of any impairments listed in Appendix 1, 20 C.F.R. Part 404 was not supported by substantial evidence. Graham contends that he met the requirements for establishing the affective disorder of depression under 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 12.04. We have reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 briefs and conclude that ALJ\u2019s determination that Graham\u2019s depression did not meet or equal the criteria of any impairments listed in Appendix 1, 20 C.F.R. Part 404 is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Anthony v. Sullivan, </em>954 F.2d 289, 292 (5th Cir.1992); <em>Villa v. Sullivan, </em>895 F.2d 1019, 1021-22 (5th Cir.1990). The ALJ was not required to give precedence to subjective evidence over objective evidence which showed that Graham\u2019s depression was not disabling. <em>Anthony, </em>954 F.2d at 295-96. Further, no doctor testified that Graham was disabled as a result of his alleged depression. <em>Vaughan v. Shalala, </em>58 F.3d 129, 131 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-15\">Moreover, Graham\u2019s testimony regarding his daily activities was inconsistent with his claimed limitations. <em>Reyes v. Sullivan, </em>915 F.2d 151, 154-155 (5th Cir.1990). Finally, medical records showed that Graham was prescribed Wellbutrin and that he was responding well to the medication. <em>See Johnson v. Bowen, </em>864 F.2d 340, 348 (5th Cir.1988). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b137-11\"> Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
