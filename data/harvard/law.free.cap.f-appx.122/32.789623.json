Doane was sentenced on September 17, 2004, to forty-one months imprisonment to be followed by three years of supervised release. The district court also specified an alternative sentence of thirteen months imprisonment pursuant to this Court\u2019s recommendation in <em>United States v. Hammoud, </em>378 F.3d 426 (4th Cir.2004) (order), <em>opinion issued by </em>381 F.3d 316, 353-54 (4th Cir.2004) (en banc), <em>cert. granted and judgment vacat</em>ed,, \u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1051, 160 L.Ed.2d 997 (2005) (No. 04-193).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Doane appealed, challenging the constitutionality of the federal sentencing scheme in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). The case was held in abeyance pending decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). That opinion has now issued, and applies the Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Blakely </em>to the federal sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">Doane now moves for an expedited remand of this case to the district court to implement the alternative sentence previously announced by the district court. Counsel notes that Doane has already served more time than the district court set forth in the alternative sentence. We grant Doane\u2019s motion for remand to allow the district court to reconsider Doane\u2019s sentence in light of the <em>Booker </em>decision and <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>396 F.3d 374, 378-379 (4th Cir.2005) (No. 03-4172) (discussing post <em>-Booker </em>sentencing). Doane states that the sentencing issue is the only one he would pursue on appeal. Therefore, we affirm his conviction, vacate the sentence imposed by the district court, and remand for reconsideration of the sentence. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
