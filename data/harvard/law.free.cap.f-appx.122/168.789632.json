He argues that the district court erred in its determination that his \u00a7 2241 petition did not warrant application of the \u00a7 2255 savings clause. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Laury contends that \u201che was charged with a crime that was not a crime\u201d and is therefore innocent of the offense of conviction. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-20\">Laury has not carried his burden of demonstrating that \u00a7 2255 relief would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). Although he cites <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995), he has not shown that his claim was foreclosed by circuit law when he filed his first motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-21\">Laury\u2019s motion for leave to file a supplemental exhibit is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-22\">Laury\u2019s Fed. R.App. P. 28(j) letter to this court fails to satisfy the requirements of Rule 28(j) as it does not indicate how the claim or the cited cases affect or enhance the arguments set forth in his brief. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b200-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
