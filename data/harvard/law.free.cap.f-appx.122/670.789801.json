Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Stewart v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 587, 595 (4th Cir.1999). Such motions are especially disfavored \u201cin a deportation proceeding, where, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>Doherty, </em>502 U.S. at 323, 112 S.Ct. 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Tchakounte argues the Board should have reopened her proceeding under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h)\u2014(iii) (2004). We have reviewed the administrative record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We also deny the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
