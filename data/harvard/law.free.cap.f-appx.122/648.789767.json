Because we find no merit to Brown\u2019s argument on appeal, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Brown asserts, as he did before the district court, that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), invalidated the entire Sentencing Reform Act and therefore the district court did not have authority to impose or revoke any term of supervised release. In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Supreme Court applied the <em>Blakely </em>decision to the federal sentencing guidelines and concluded that the Sixth Amendment is violated when a district court imposes a sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines that is greater than a sentence based solely upon facts found by the jury. <em>Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. at ---, 125 S.Ct. at 752-56. Rather than totally invalidating the Guidelines, however, the Court held that the Guidelines are no longer binding on the district courts, but are advisory only. To effectuate this remedy, the Court severed two provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1), requiring sentencing courts to impose a sentence within the guideline range, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e), setting forth standards of review on appeal). Sentencing courts are now required to consider the applicable guideline range, but may \u201ctailor the sentence in light of other statutory concerns .... \u201d <em>Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 125 S.Ct. at 757.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-13\">We conclude that <em>Booker </em>provides Brown no grounds for relief. First, contrary to Brown\u2019s argument, the Supreme Court did not totally invalidate the Sentencing Reform Act, but in fact left the great majority of the Act\u2019s provisions intact and legally effective. <em>Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 125 S.Ct. at 764 (\u201cThe remainder of the Act \u2018function[s] independently.\u2019 \u201d). More specifically, the provision of the Act that governs supervised release, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583 (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2004), was not affected by <em>Booker. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. at ---, 125 S.Ct. at 764-68. Finally, the change effected by <em>Booker </em>\u2014 making the Sentencing Guidelines merely advisory \u2014 was not a change in the manner in which the Guidelines were applied to revocations of supervised release <em>pre-Booker. See United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642 (4th Cir.1995) (\u201cChapter 7\u2019s policy statements are now and have always been non-binding, advisory guides to district courts in supervised release revocation proceedings.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-16\">We accordingly affirm the order of the district court revoking Brown\u2019s supervised release and imposing a term of eighteen months of imprisonment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
