Long-standing principles of insurance law, public policy and fundamental fairness require liberal construction of comprehensive general liability insurance policies. <em>(Doyle v Allstate Ins.

No coverage is provided to Meyers since the Dennison complaint did not allege an \"advertising injury\u201d as that term is defined in the Zurich policy. <em>(Bretton v Mutual of Omaha Ins.

Zurich also had no duty to defend Meyers because the Zurich policy only obligates Zurich to defend suits seeking money damages, and the Dennison administrative action was solely for injunctive relief. <em>(Doyle v Allstate Ins.

Meyers &amp; Sons Corp. commenced this declaratory judgment action against its insurer, defendant Zurich American Insurance Group, alleging that Meyers has been named defendant in a proceeding before the International Trade Commission (ITC) accusing it of causing an \"advertising injury\u201d. It contends that Zurich is obliged to provide it with a defense against the claim. The question on appeal is whether the complaint before the ITC alleged \"advertising injury\u201d within the meaning of plaintiff's general comprehensive liability insurance policy thus obligating Zurich to provide Meyers with a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Under the policy Zurich promised to defend any suit against Meyers \"seeking damages\u201d on account of \"advertising injury\u201d arising out of Meyers\u2019 \"advertising activities\u201d. The relevant clauses state:</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">\"The Company will pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of * * * <em>advertising injury </em>to which this insurance applies, sustained by any person or organization and arising out of the conduct of the named insured\u2019s business * * * and the Company shall have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such injury</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">\" <em>!'Advertising Injury \u2019 </em>means injury arising out of an offense committed during the policy period <em>occurring in the course of named insured\u2019s advertising activities, </em>if such injury arises out of libel, slander, defamation, violation of right of privacy, piracy, unfair competition or infringement of copyright, title, or slogan\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">On May 7, 1986, Dennison Manufacturing Company filed a complaint with the United States International Trade Commission pursuant to the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 USC \u00a7 1337) alleging that several companies, including Meyers, engaged in \"unlawful manufacture, importation and sale of patented plastic fasteners\u201d infringing upon Dennison\u2019s patents. With respect to Meyers, Dennison alleged specifically that it ordered and received plastic fasteners from a Meyers price list which were found to have been manufactured by processes protected by one or more of Dennison\u2019s patents. Dennison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>requested the Commission to immediately investigate the allegations and conduct a hearing on them. The relief sought was an exclusion order banning further importation of the infringing products and directing Meyers to cease and desist selling any infringing products previously imported into the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">On June 13, 1986 the ITC served a notice of investigation on Meyers informing it that a complaint had been filed alleging \"unfair methods of competition and unfair acts in the importation [and sale] of certain plastic fasteners into the United States\u201d. The notice, described the \"Scope of Investigation\u201d as limited to determining whether an unlawful importation or sale of plastic fasteners occurred, thus infringing several Dennison patents. After receiving the notice, Meyers requested Zurich to provide a defense to the proceeding basing its claim on the advertising injury coverage provided in its comprehensive general liability policy. When Zurich refused to do so Meyers commenced this declaratory judgment action and moved for summary judgment. Zurich filed a similar motion seeking a declaration that it had no duty to defend Meyers because the allegations in the Dennison complaint before the ITC arose out of illegal importation and selling of products in violation of certain patents, not out of Meyers\u2019 advertising activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Supreme Court granted Zurich summary judgment, declaring that the complaint did not allege false or misleading advertising and, therefore, was not within the scope of the policy. The court held further that Zurich was not obligated to defend Meyers because the ITC proceeding was limited to injunctive relief and did not seek money damages. The Appellate Division affirmed, without opinion, and we granted leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The duty of a liability insurer to defend an action brought against an insured is determined by the allegations in the complaint <em>(see, Servidone Constr. Corp. v Security Ins. Co., </em>64 <em>NY2d </em>419, 424). If the facts alleged raise a reasonable possibility that the insured may be held liable for some act or omission covered by the policy, then the insurer must defend <em>(see, Ruder &amp; Finn v Seaboard Sur. Co., </em>52 NY2d 663, 669-670). If no such possibility is raised, no duty to defend is owed under the policy. Accordingly, upon a motion such as this the court\u2019s duty is to compare the allegations of the complaint to the terms of the policy to determine whether a duty to defend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>exists <em>(see, Technicon Elecs. Corp. v American Home Assur. Co., </em>74 NY2d 66, 73). In construing the policy the court must examine \"the entire contract to determine its purpose and effect and the apparent intent of the parties\u201d <em>(see, Murray Oil Prods. v Royal Exch. Assur. Co., </em>21 NY2d 440, 445).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Under the \"advertising injury\u201d language of this policy, a claim due to injury from \"libel, slander, defamation, violation of right of privacy, piracy, unfair competition or infringement of copyright, title or slogan\u201d must also \"aris[e] out of an offense * * * occurring in the course of named insured\u2019s advertising activities.\u201d Thus, to trigger Zurich\u2019s duty to defend, the claimed injury must both arise out of an offense occurring in the course of the insured\u2019s \"advertising activities\u201d and constitute one of the enumerated offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Meyers claims that the charge of \"unfair competition\u201d in Dennison\u2019s complaint requires Zurich to provide a defense under the \"advertising injury\u201d provisions of the policy. However, an examination of Dennison\u2019s 47-page complaint indicates that it alleges injury arising out of thq manufacture, importation and sale in the United States of plastic fasteners which infringe Dennison\u2019s patents. The \"Summary of Complaint\u201d, found at the beginning of the pleading, states that it is the \"importations\u201d of these goods which constitute the acts of \"unfair competition\u201d and give rise to the injury. The body of the complaint alleges harm arising out of the \"importation\u201d and \"sale\u201d of products which infringed upon patents owned by Dennison, not injury arising out of Meyers\u2019 \"advertising activities\u201d. The complaint concludes with a \"Prayer for Relief\u2019 focusing on the illegal manufacture and sale of infringing products and seeking an order enjoining these activities without reference to preventing any type of false, misleading or injurious advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Dennison\u2019s complaint was similarly interpreted in ITC\u2019s \"Notice of Investigation\u201d summarizing the claim served upon Meyers. It states that Dennison\u2019s complaint \"alleges unfair methods of competition and unfair acts in the <em>importation </em>of certain plastic fasteners * * * by reason of alleged manufacture abroad by a process which, if practiced in the United States, would <em>infringe </em>[several United States patents]\u201d (emphasis added). It is clear that the policy, when read in context, does not cover acts of \"unfair competition\u201d arising out of the illegal manufacturing, importation and sale of goods in violation of another\u2019s patent rights and that the activity Dennison complains of is not one covered under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Meyers also contends that the price list it circulated to its customers constituted \"advertising activity\u201d and therefore brings the complaint within the policy\u2019s coverage. The price list, which was attached to Dennison\u2019s complaint, merely enumerates the price and size of the various fasteners, however, and makes no false, misleading or deceptive claims that the product is unique. The complaint does not allege harm based upon use of the price list and it appears to have been submitted solely as evidence that Meyers was selling the infringing product, a necessary element of proof in a complaint filed with the ITC under the Tariff Act <em>(see, </em>19 CFR 210.20 [a] <em>[9] </em>[vii]).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">We have considered plaintiff\u2019s remaining contention that Zurich is estopped from disclaiming because of prior unrelated litigation and find it without merit. Having decided that the complaint before the ITC did not constitute a claim for \"advertising injury\u201d, we need not rule on the additional contention asserted by defendant that no coverage exists because the proceeding is not one seeking \"damages\u201d under the terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Kaye, Alexander, Ti-tone, Hancock, Jr., and Bellacosa concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
