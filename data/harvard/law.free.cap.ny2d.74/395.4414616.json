It is well settled that under the Taylor Law PERB has exclusive, nondelegable jurisdiction to consider and determine improper practice charges. <em>(Matter of West Irondequoit Teachers Assn. v Helsby, </em>35 NY2d 46; <em>Matter of City of Albany v Helsby, </em>29 NY2d 433; <em>Matter of Incorporated Vil. of Lynbrook v New York State Pub.

II. PERB\u2019s application of the Taylor Law to Education Law \u00a7 3602 (27) was rational and in accord with its statutory authority. <em>(Matter of West Irondequoit Teachers Assn. v Helsby, </em>35 NY2d 46; <em>Matter of Incorporated Vil. of Lynbrook v New York State Pub.

Civil Service Law \u00a7 201 (12) and \u00a7 204-a preclude PERB from finding that a legislative body\u2019s decision to apply or not apply for intergo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>vernmental financial aid is a mandatory subject of negotiations. II. In enacting the Excellence in Teaching (EIT) law, the Legislature intended to preserve the school board\u2019s legislative prerogative to apply or not apply for State aid. <em>(Matter of Town of Mamaroneck PBA v New York State Pub.

III. PERB\u2019s decision is affected by an error of law because it is based upon the inaccurate assumption that only members of the teachers\u2019 bargaining unit may be eligible for EIT aid. <em>(Matter of Schneider v Ambach, </em>135 AD2d 284.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b476-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b476-6\">Hancock, Jr., J.</author>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Under Education Law \u00a7 3602 (27), a school district may, upon application, become eligible to receive an apportionment of Excellence in Teaching (EIT) aid, to be used solely to improve teachers\u2019 salaries. The question in this appeal is whether a school district may be compelled pursuant to the Taylor Law (Civil Service Law art 14) to bargain with the teachers\u2019 union over its decision whether to make such application. Stated another way, is a school district\u2019s decision whether to apply for EIT funds a proper subject for mandatory bargaining so as to make the refusal to bargain the proper basis for an improper practice charge under Civil Service Law \u00a7 209-a (1) (d)? We agree with the Appellate Division that the answer to this question is \"No\u201d. Accordingly, there should be an affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">In April 1986, the Legislature enacted the Excellence in Teaching program as part of the aid to localities budget bill, thereby providing State funds to supplement the salaries of eligible employees of local school districts (Education Law \u00a7 1950 [15] [a]; \u00a7 3602 [27]; L 1986, ch 53, \u00a7\u00a7 20, 49). Under regulations adopted by the Commissioner to implement the EIT program, as directed by the Legislature (\u00a7 3602 [27] [f]), a school district may become eligible for EIT funds upon making an application through its board of education (8 NYCRR 175.35). The regulations specify that any EIT salary increases must be added to the teachers\u2019 regular salaries for the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>pose of computing their fringe benefits (8 NYCRR 175.35 [e] [4]). But the regulations expressly forbid any expenditure of the EIT moneys for these additional fringe costs (8 NYCRR 175.35 [e] [5]), thus making it necessary for the board to fund the additional fringe costs from other sources.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">On September 9, 1986, the Board of Education of petitioner Elmira City School District (the district) voted not to apply for EIT funds. It is undisputed that the Board\u2019s decision rested on the fact that acceptance of EIT funds would result in the district having to pay, over a two-year period, approximately $100,000 for additional Social Security taxes, retirement system assessment and other attendant \"fringe benefits\u201d, which would be in addition to any benefits provided for in the parties\u2019 existing collective bargaining agreement effective July 1, 1985 through June 30, 1990. On September 10, respondent teachers\u2019 association (the association) demanded that the district negotiate its decision. On September 17, the district refused and the association filed an improper practice charge with respondent Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) based upon the refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">After the parties waived a hearing before PERB, the matter was submitted on a stipulated record to an Administrative Law Judge who held that the district had violated Civil Service Law \u00a7 209-a (1) (d) by refusing to negotiate. PERB affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision and ordered that the district \"forthwith negotiate [its decision] in good faith\u201d whether to apply for EIT funds for the 1986-1987 school year, and for subsequent school - years, as well, upon the association\u2019s demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The district commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding seeking to annul PERB\u2019S determination. Upon transfer from Supreme Court pursuant to CPLR 7804 (g), the Appellate Division, with two Justices dissenting, annulled the determination and granted the petition. Both the majority and dissent noted that Education Law \u00a7 3602 (27) expressly provides that a school district must separately negotiate decisions concerning the <em>distribution </em>of EIT funds, but makes no provision concerning a school district\u2019s duty to negotiate a decision to <em>apply </em>for EIT funds. From the omission of such direction in the statute, the majority concluded that a duty to negotiate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>the application decision \"should not [be] read into\u201d Education Law \u00a7 3602 (27) because \"when the Legislature was considering the extent to which negotiations over EIT funds would be required, it could have extended the duty to negotiate to the application decision if it had so intended\u201d (144 AD2d 35, 39). The dissenters took the position that PERB\u2019s determination that the application decision was subject to mandatory bargaining was rational because such a decision affects the terms and conditions of employment. Finding nothing in the statute directly prohibiting mandatory bargaining, the dissenters concluded that the determination should be upheld. We agree with the Appellate Division majority that the EIT application decision is not a subject of mandatory bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The question before us is this: did the Legislature intend that a district\u2019s decision over whether to apply for EIT funds should be subject to mandatory bargaining? We hold that it did not.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> From our analysis of Education Law \u00a7 3602 (27), we conclude that a school district\u2019s decision on whether to make such application is one which the Legislature intended should be left to the school board\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nothing in subdivision (27) purports to make it mandatory for a school district to apply for EIT funds. On the contrary, subdivision (27) provides that <em>\"upon application </em>a school district <em>shall be eligible </em>for an excellence in teaching apportionment\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">That the Legislature intended to establish a program where the application decision would not be subject to mandatory negotiation is reflected in the statutorily required implementing regulations (8 NYCRR 175.35; <em>see, </em>Education Law \u00a7 3602 [27] [f]) which specifically provide that the application is to be made by the <em>board of education (see, </em>8 NYCRR 175.35 [b]), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>legislative body,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> whose approval would be required to make any agreement binding <em>(see, </em>Civil Service Law \u00a7 201 [12]; \u00a7 204-a [1]; see <em>generally, </em>8 NYCRR 175.35 [c]).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">PERB and the association, however, purport to find in Education Law \u00a7 3602 (27) a legislative intent that collective negotiations be required over the EIT application decision as well as the decision on distribution of EIT funds which have been sought and obtained. They rely on the last sentence in subdivision 27 (a) which states: \"In school districts where the teachers are represented by certified or recognized employee organizations, <em>all salary increases funded pursuant to this subdivision shall be determined by separate collective negotiations </em>conducted pursuant to the provisions and procedures of article fourteen of the civil service law, notwithstanding the existence of a negotiated agreement between a school district and a certified or recognized employee organization.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The language of this provision, however, does not support their position.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The evident purpose of this provision in paragraph (a) is not only to mandate collective negotiations over the distribution of EIT funds, but to remove any impediment to such negotiations which might otherwise result where, as here, an ongoing collective bargaining agreement between the district and the union exists. By providing that the EIT negotiations be <em>separate, </em>the provision obviates any possible conflict between the EIT salary distribution negotiations and an existing collective bargaining agreement. Moreover, because the statute specifically provides for collective negotiations only over <em>EIT salary distribution decisions, </em>the inference may be drawn from the failure to require negotiations over <em>EIT application decisions </em>that the Legislature intended that such negotiations not be required <em>(see generally, </em>McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 240).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">To adopt the position urged by PERB and the association\u2014 that because the EIT program implicates teachers\u2019 salaries application decisions are necessarily a subject for bargaining\u2014 would frustrate the intent of this statute and its implementing regulations that the board of education be the decision-making body and that negotiations over its application decisions not be mandatory. We do not suggest that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number><em>may not voluntarily </em>bargain over EIT funding, subject, of course, to the board\u2019s right to disapprove any agreement reached from the process <em>(see, </em>Civil Service Law \u00a7 201 [12]; \u00a7 204-a [1]). We simply hold that the legislative intent is that the district <em>not be compelled </em>to bargain over the board\u2019s application decision. PERB\u2019s contrary construction of Education Law \u00a7 3602 (27) does not support a different result. Where \" 'the question is one of pure statutory reading and analysis, dependent only on accurate apprehension of legislative intent\u2019, [PERB\u2019s] interpretations need not be accorded * * * deference\u201d <em>(Matter of Town of Mamaroneck PBA v New York State Pub.

Co., </em>49 NY2d 451, 459]).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Accordingly, because the decision whether to apply for EIT funds cannot be the subject of mandatory bargaining, the Appellate Division judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b477-8\">. Indeed, any expenditure of an EIT grant-in-aid made in contravention of this mandate may be disallowed and deducted from the district\u2019s next State aid payment (8 NYCRR 175.35 [e] [5]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b478-8\">. It is undisputed that EIT funds <em>which have been obtained </em>for increased teachers\u2019 salaries under Education Law \u00a7 3602 (27) must be the subject of collective bargaining. Indeed, the statute specifically provides that \"all salary increases funded pursuant to [subd 27] shall be determined by separate collective negotiations conducted pursuant to the provisions and procedures of article fourteen of the civil service law\u201d (Education Law \u00a7 3602 [27]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b478-9\">. Indeed, both the ALJ and PERB, in affirming the AU\u2019s decision, acknowledged that the EIT \"legislation vests districts with discretion to apply for the funds\u201d (ALJ decision, at 9; <em>see, </em>PERB decision, at 7-8). Neither the association nor PERB contends that a school district could be compelled either by an arbitrator or by a court to make an application for EIT funding under this statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b479-8\">. Civil Service Law \u00a7 201 (11) provides that \"the term 'legislative body of the government,\u2019 in the case of school districts, means the board of education, board of trustees or sole trustee, as the case may be.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b480-6\">Bellacosa, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5R\">(dissenting). I would reverse the order of the Appellate Division essentially for the reasons stated in the dissent by Justice Howard A. Levine and would thus confirm the determination by PERB that the Elmira City School District\u2019s application for Excellence in Teaching Apportionment Program funds under Education Law \u00a7 3602 (27) is a mandatory subject of collective bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The court is unanimous that the Taylor Law imposes a broad obligation upon public employers to bargain with employees over the terms and conditions of their employment. The majority, as I understand it, also agrees that once a school district applies for Excellence in Teaching funds, the distribution is a term and condition of teachers\u2019 employment \u2014salaries. Our difference of view relates to the threshold decision to apply for Excellence in Teaching funds at all, the majority concluding that it is not subject to collective bargaining, because the Legislature has manifested the requisite \"plain and clear\u201d intention to exclude this decision from the ambit of the Taylor Law <em>(Syracuse Teachers Assn. v Board of Educ., </em>35 NY2d 743, 744).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Our view is that the purpose of the Excellence in Teaching legislation is to improve the quality of teaching and education throughout the State by affecting the terms and conditions of teachers\u2019 employment with the financial inducement of additional compensation. Inasmuch as this compensation matter directly and inherently affects the terms and conditions of employment, a subject of mandatory collective bargaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>(Civil Service Law \u00a7 208 [2]), it is unavailing that the pertinent Excellence in Teaching statute does not itself explicitly mandate collective bargaining for the \"application\u201d phase of all school boards participating in and acquiring the State\u2019s grants of money. The statute, after all, does not explicitly <em>exclude </em>mandatory collective bargaining as to the \"application\u201d phase. Indeed, it expressly mandates separate collective bargaining as to the \"distribution\u201d among teachers of the funds so received. Thus, the interpretation reposing in the school boards the unilateral power to apply for Excellence in Teaching funds saps of all its juice the mandatory collective bargaining enactment on \"distribution\u201d of such funds to qualified teachers. Depriving a statute of its meaning in this way \u2014 where the exclusion from the operation of the Taylor Law is not \"plain and clear\u201d <em>(Syracuse Teachers Assn. v Board of Educ., </em>35 NY2d 743, <em>supra) </em>\u2014 is not sound statutory construction and would frustrate the central legislative intent of the Excellence in Teaching program. \"[A] statutory construction which results 'in the nullification of one part [of the statute] by another, is not permissible\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v Kates, </em>77 AD2d 417, 418, <em>affd </em>53 NY2d 591, citing <em>Matter of Albano v Kirby, </em>36 NY2d 526, 530).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Appellant teachers\u2019 association invites the court to take judicial notice of an uncontradicted public statistical compilation that 683 out of 698 (98%) of the school boards throughout the State are now participating in the Excellence in Teaching program. Thus, the Legislature may wish to consider making explicit the mandatory and, thus, uniform, application and participation in this significant public policy program \u2014 if that was its intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent and vote to reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Simons, Alexander and Titone concur with Judge Hancock, Jr.; Judge Bellacosa dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion in which Judge Kaye concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
