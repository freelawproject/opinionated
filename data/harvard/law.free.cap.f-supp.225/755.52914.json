It is what is commonly known as a Class One, irregular route, common carrier operating in the Pacific Northwest and California. Its principal place of business is Portland, although it has offices and facilities in Seattle, Washington, Medford, Oregon, and Crescent City, Redding and San Pablo, California. It operates from 250 to 275 trucks and trailers, mostly flatbeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-18\">Pursuant to the authority granted by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 304(c) and 312(a), the Commission, on its own motion, instituted an investigation to determine whether plaintiff had been transporting commodities not authorized by its certificates, in violation of \u00a7 306(a) of the Act. A hearing was held before a Commission examiner. Following the hearing, the examiner found that the plaintiff was transporting certain of the above commodities without authority.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Exceptions to the recommended report and order were filed by the plaintiff and another carrier, Ace Lines, Inc., the latter being permitted to intervene. On September 27, 1962, the Commission issued its report and order finding that the transportation of the above mentioned commodities, with the exception of wood veneers, were not authorized by plaintiff\u2019s certificates, but that the commodity description \u201cconstruction materials\u201d does, under certain conditions, authorize the transportation of electric cable, transformers and regulators. An order was entered requiring plaintiff to cease and desist from the unauthorized transportation. 91 M.C.C. 267. Petitions for reconsideration were denied by the Commission, acting as an appellate division, on April 8, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>A few guide lines will be of assistance in arriving at a proper conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">The fact that the Commission may have reached a different conclusion than that recommended by its examiner is of no importance. The Commission has a legal duty to arrive at its own conclusion. Federal Radio Commission v. Nelson Bros. Bond &amp; Mortgage Co., 289 U.S. 266, 53 S.Ct. 627, 77 L.Ed. 1166 (1933); Baltimore &amp; Ohio Ry. Co. v. United States, 298 U.S. 349, 56 S.Ct. 797, 80 L.Ed. 1209 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Courts are not concerned with the soundness of the Commission\u2019s reasoning or with the wisdom of its decisions. Virginian Railway v. United States, 272 U.S. 658, 47 S.Ct. 222, 71 L.Ed. 463 (1926); Sims Motor Transport Lines v. United States, (N.D.Ill.1959), 183 F.Supp. 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">The proper interpretation and meaning of the application under a given state of facts, and the effect thereof under the protection of the \u201cgrandfather\u201d clause, has been reserved for the Commission. Noble v. United States, 319 U.S. 88, 63 S.Ct. 950, 87 L.Ed. 1277 (1943). The construction of a \u201cgrandfather\u201d permit by the Commission is controlling on the Courts. Dart Transit Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, D.C.Minn., 110 F.Supp. 876, aff\u2019d 345 U.S. 980, 73 S.Ct. 1138, 97 L.Ed. 1344.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">In general, the scope of transportation permitted by a certificate is for the Commission, and will not be overturned by the Courts, unless arbitrary or clearly erroneous. Nelson, Inc. v. United States, 355 U.S. 554, 78 S.Ct. 496, 2 L.Ed.2d 484 (1958); Simpson v. United States (S.D.Ia.1961), 200 F.Supp. 372, aff\u2019d 369 U.S. 526, 82 S.Ct. 954, 8 L.Ed.2d 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">The judicial function is exhausted when it is found that there is a rational basis for the conclusions reached by the administrative body. Mississippi Valley Barge Line Co. v. United States, 292 U.S. 282, 54 S.Ct. 692, 78 L.Ed. 1260 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-13\"> On the other hand, it is well recognized that the Commission does not have power to change or modify a motor carrier\u2019s certificate under the guise of interpretive action. Nelson, Inc. v. United States, supra, nor can the order of the Commission be upheld if it is clearly erroneous as that phrase is used in the Nelson decision. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1009(e) invalidates the order if it is either (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law; or (2) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege or immunity; or (3) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory rights; or (4) without observance of procedure required by law; and (5) unsupported by substantial evidence in any case . . . reviewed on the record of an agency hearing provided by statute . . . Ace Lines, Inc. v. United States, (S.D.Iowa, 1960) 197 F.Supp. 591; Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway v. United States, 361 U.S. 173, 80 S.Ct. 229, 4 L.Ed.2d 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-16\">A principal contention of the\u2019 plaintiff is that the final phrase in the\u2019 commodity description \u2014 \u201cand other commodities of similar nature\u201d grants plaintiff authority to transport, in addition to-building materials and heavy machinery, the specified list of commodities and. \u201cother commodities of a similar nature\u201d to building materials and heavy machinery. Under this construction, which, it claims to be proper, the plaintiff argues-that it may transport such items as. cable, veneers, transformers and regulators on the theory that, although they do not technically fall within the term, \u201cbuilding materials\u201d or \u201cheavy machinery\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> they are \u201cof a similar nature\u201d' to building materials and heavy machinery. The answer of the Commission to this contention is entirely consistent, with logic and common sense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>Manifestly, this conclusion of the Commission, with all of its expertise on the subject, is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">On this point, plaintiff argues that the Commission\u2019s interpretation narrows the grant of the authority to which it was entitled by reason of its \u201cgrandfather\u201d operations and which its \u201cgrandfather\u201d certificates was intended to cover.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">If this is a fact, plaintiff should petition the Commission to re-open the \u201cgrandfather\u201d proceeding. Nelson, Inc. v. United States, supra. That plaintiff recognizes this doctrine, as taught in Nelson, is demonstrated by the fact that plaintiff filed a petition to re-open the proceedings in which two of its other certificates were issued, in order to show that it was entitled to a larger grant than indicated on the face of its certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"adq-dedup-0\">Another thrust of plaintiff\u2019s argument is that the certificate should be treated as authorizing a complete \u201cheavy hauling\u201d service. By this method, it would justify its past transportation of electric cable, which it readily concedes cannot be classified as \u201cmachinery\u201d. Again the Commission, in its wisdom, found no merit in this contention.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The conelusion of the Commission is adequately supported by Hove Truck Lines v. Eldon Miller, Inc., 63 M.C.C. 753, 756 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-12\">As another alternative, the plaintiff urges that \u201cmachinery\u201d includes any type of mechanical apparatus or device and that \u201ctransformers\u201d and \u201cregulators\u201d should be so treated. The Commission interpreted the term \u201cmachinery\u201d, as used in the certificate issued by it, to embrace only mechanical devices which have not, through manufacturing or assembling processes, been transformed into a new and different object, which is itself considered to be a separate and distinct commodity. Under such an interpretation a commodity such as automobiles, airplanes, refrigerators, and farm tractors are not authorized by a certificate permitting the transportation of \u201cmachinery\u201d, and that restrictive interpretation of \u201cmachinery\u201d has received the approval of the courts as early as 1948. Black v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 167 F.2d 825 (5 Cir. 1948), cert. den. 335 U.S. 818, 69 S.Ct. 40, 93 L. Ed. 373; Converse v. United States, 109 F.Supp. 807 (N.D.Calif.1953); Clarke Transport Co. Extension \u2014 Farm Tractors, 62 M.C.C. 555 (1954). Such an interpretation had been placed on \u201cmachinery\u201d long prior to the time plaintiff commenced the hauling of cable, transformers and regulators. In line with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>above decisions, the Commission decided that transformers and regulators did not fall within the description \u201cmachinery\u201d, but on the other hand, such articles should be considered as \u201celectrical\u201d appliances, equipment and parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Plaintiff attacks the Commission\u2019s employment of the \u201cintended use test\u201d, in connection with the construction of plaintiff's certificates. That such a test may be used by the Commission is no longer open to question. Nelson, Inc. v. United States, supra; Converse v. United States, supra, (mining and construction materials, equipment and supplies) ; Ace Lines, Inc. v. United States, 197 F.Supp. 591 (S.D.Ia.1960) (building materials). Likewise, the Commission\u2019s outline of the circumstances under which plaintiff may accept a shipment, without investigating to ascertain the actual intended use of the commodities, was a valid exercise of the Commission\u2019s discretion. The Commission, in issuing this order, was within its statutory power and authority. On this question, the Commission decided that commodities which were ordinarily used as \u201cbuilding materials\u201d or \u201cconstruction materials\u201d (i. e. commodities on the so called \u201cbuilding material list\u201d established by the Commission in descriptions of motor carrier\u2019s certificate, 61 M.C.C. 209) may be accepted for shipment by the plaintiff without making any investigation as to the actual intended use thereof, provided that plaintiff does not have knowledge that another use is intended. On the other hand, where the shipment is destined to a type of consignee which does not normally use building or construction materials, as so defined, the carrier is deemed to have notice that another use is probably intended and cannot accept the shipment, unless subsequent investigation reveals the commodities to be within the scope of its authority. We conclude that the Commission in making this order did not go beyond the scope of its statutory authority. Ace Lines, Inc. v. United States, supra, relied on by the plaintiff, does not support its position. The position of the Commission has judicial support. Pierce Auto Freight Lines v. Converse, 54 M.C.C. 447 (1952) sustained Converse v. United States, supra, Contractors Transit, Inc. \u2014 Investigation and Revocation, 78 M.C.C. 347 (1958). The-decision in Ace Lines, Inc. v. United States, supra, was thoroughly analyzed' and discussed by the Commission at the time of making its decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> United Transport, Inc. v. United States (W.D.Okl.1962), 214 F.Supp. 34, and Refrigerated Transport Co. v. United States. (N.D.Ga.1963), 214 F.Supp. 536, are of no help to plaintiff. They did not involve-the intended use test.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">Plaintiff concedes that the principles of laches and estoppel cannot be-asserted against the Commission. Sims. Motor Transport, Inc. v. United States. (N.D.Ill.1959), 183 F.Supp. 113, 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">We have carefully considered the other points and contentions made-by plaintiff. The rulings of the Commission thereon were neither arbitrary nor-capricious. The Commission\u2019s findings, on each point raised by plaintiff, are supported by substantial evidence. To consider the weight of that evidence or the soundness of the reasoning by which the Commission reached its conclusions, is. outside the province of this Court. In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>terstate Commerce Commission v. Union Pacific Railway Co., 222 U.S. 541, 547, 32 S.Ct. 108, 56 L.Ed. 308; Virginian Railway Co. v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">The order of the Commission is affirmed and the complaint hereby dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b805-19\">. The examiner concluded that plaintiff\u2019s \u201cheavy machinery\u201d authority authorized transportation of transformers, regulators and electric cable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b806-9\">. An alternative contention is that the named commodities actually fall within one of those terms, will be discussed later.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b806-17\">. The final description remaining for consideration under which respondent contends that it may transport the-involved &lt; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>cables, veneers, transformers and regulators, is the italicized portion of the following description: \u201cbuilding materials and fyeavy machinery, including heavy steel girders, steel pipe, boilers, water works supplies and plumbing goods, eement, cast stone, wooden pipe and tanks (set up or knocked down), and fabricated steel reinforcing bars, <em>and other commodities of similar nature.\u201d </em>Obviously, all of the commodities listed following \u201cbuilding materials and heavy machinery,\u201d in-eluding \u201cother commodities of similar nature,\u201d must be either building materials or heavy machinery, and since, as we have stated above, none of the involved commodities now under consideration are either building materials or heavy machinery, respondent may not transport them under the italicized part of the above description.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"adz-dedup-0\">. \u201c * * * Respondent\u2019s contentions that the term \u2018heavy machinery\u2019 refers to a complete heavy hauling service is without merit. Although \u2018heavy machinery\u2019 and \u2018commodities the transportation of which, because of size and weight, require the use of special equipment\u2019 have both been referred to as commodity descriptions of \u2018heavy haulers\u2019 and although it has been found, in proceedings in which modification of \u2018grandfather\u2019 authority was sought and granted, that a carrier authorized to transport only \u2018heavy machinery\u2019 should have been, and would for the future be, authorized to perform a complete heavy hauling service, the two commodity descriptions under consideration are not synonymous. They are analogous, but any commodity transported under the description \u2018heavy machinery\u2019 must bo machinery. * * * \u201d See Dayton Transportation Corp.
