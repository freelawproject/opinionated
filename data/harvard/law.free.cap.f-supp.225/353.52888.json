The wall is the State constitutional requirement that an applicant for registration \u201cunderstand and give a reasonable interpretation of any section\u201d of the Constitutions of Louisiana or of the United States. It is not the only wall of its kind, but since the Supreme Court\u2019s demolishment of the white primary, the interpretation test has been the highest, best-guarded, most effective barrier to Negro voting in Louisiana.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>When a Louisiana citizen seeks to register, the Parish Registrar of Voters may ask the applicant to interpret the provision, \u201cThe Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal, and each of the judges * * may also in aid of their respective jurisdictions, original, appellate, or supervisory, issue writs of mandamus, certiorari, prohibition, quo warranto, and all other needful writs\u201d. Or, the registrar may ask the applicant to interpret a less technical but more difficult provision, constitutionally, such as, \u201cEvery person has the natural right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark><em> </em>In giving this test, the registrar selects the constitutional section and he must be satisfied with the explanation. In many parishes the registrar is not easily satisfied with constitutional interpretations from Negro applicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">We hold: this wall, built to bar Negroes from access to the franchise, must come down. The understanding clause or interpretation test is <em>not </em>a literacy requirement. It has no rational relation to measuring the ability of an elector to read and write. It is a test of an elector\u2019s ability to interpret the Louisiana and United States Constitutions. Considering this law in its historical setting and considering too the actual operation and inescapable effect of the law, it is evident that the test is a sophisticated scheme to disfranchise Negroes. The test is unconstitutional as written and as administered.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The United States brings this action against the State of Louisiana and the directors and members of the Louisiana Board of Registration. In Section 601(b) of the Civil Rights Act Congress specifically authorizes such a suit. When an official of the State or of a subdivision of the State is found to have discriminated against United States citizens in violation of 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1971(a), \u201cthe act or practice shall also be deemed that of the State and the State may be joined as a party defendant\u201d. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1971 (c). See United States v. Alabama, 1960, 362 U.S. 602, 80 S.Ct. 924, 4 L.Ed. 982; United States v. Dogan, 5 Cir. 1963, 314 F.2d 767, 771; Kennedy v. Lynd, 5 Cir., 1962, 306 F.2d 222, 228, cert. den\u2019d 1963, 371 U.S. 952, 83 S.Ct. 507, 9 L.Ed.2d 500; United States v. Atkins, 5 Cir. 1963, 323 F.2d 733. Section 601 is clearly appropriate legislation under the Fifteenth Amendment, to say nothing of other sources of constitutional authority, and in United States v. Fox, E.D.La. 1962, 211 F.Supp. 25, <em>appeal pending, </em>the court summarily rejected the State\u2019s attack on the constitutionality of the section. See also United States v. Raines, 1960, 362 U.S. 17, 80 S.Ct. 519, 4 L.Ed.2d 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">Independently of Section 601(b), \u201cThe obligations which [United States] is under to promote the interests of all and to prevent the wrongdoing of one resulting in injury to the general welfare, is often of itself sufficient to give it a standing in court\u201d. In re Debs, 1894, 158 U.S. 564, 15 S.Ct. 900, 39 L.Ed. 1092. When the alleged wrongdoing is based on a State law which is contrary to the superior authority of the United States Constitution, the Nation, as well as the aggrieved individuals, is injured. In such a conflict with the State the power of the Nation to protect itself and to go into its own courts to prevent the States from destroying federally protected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>rights of citizens derived from the Constitution would seem to be implicit in the Supremacy Clause and inherent in our federal system.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">When a private litigant invokes the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, he must be able to show that State action is involved in the denial of his rights. Anomalously, he cannot sue the State, but must sue agents of the State on the theory that if the act to be enforced is unconstitutional, it is not the act of the State. Ex parte Young, 1908, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714. This necessary fiction to accommodate the Eleventh Amendment provides no basis for any argument that the State cannot be made a party to this action. Here, no private litigant but the Nation itself is attacking the constitutionality of the laws of Louisiana. Louisiana therefore is the real party at interest and a proper party defendant. The Eleventh Amendment has no application to an action brought by the United States in its sovereign capacity. Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, 1934, 292 U.S. 313, 329, 54 S.Ct. 745, 78 L.Ed. 1282.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The State and its agent, the Board of Registration, have the power and duty to prescribe rules and regulations governing the administration of voter qualification laws in Louisiana.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Board has the power to remove at will any Parish Registrar of Voters.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">The court has jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1971, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1345, and 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2281. Since the suit challenges the validity of provisions of the State Constitution and certain statutes and presents substantial constitutional questions, it is a proper case to be heard by a three-judge court. 28 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 2281.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-14\">Under the Constitution- of Louisiana, registration, which is a prerequisite to voting in any election, is conducted in each parish by a registrar of voters. La.Const. Art. VIII, \u00a7 1(b). Except in Orleans Parish, the registrar is appointed by the police jury or other governing body of the parish. La.Const. Art. VIII, \u00a7 18; L.S.A.-R.S. 18:1.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Permanent registration is mandatory for parishes containing a municipal corporation of more than 100,000 population, and optional for other parishes.

There is no license for the loose statement that in our constitutional system the qualification of voters is \u201cexclusively\u201d committed to the States. See, for example, Darby v. Daniel, S.D.Miss. 1958, 168 F.Supp. 170, 176. More accurately, the States, under Article 1, Section 2 of the Constitution and the Seventeenth Amendment, are free to establish voting qualifications \u2014 only if the qualifications do not transgress the United States Constitution. Ex parte Clarke, 1879, 100 U.S. 399, 25 L.Ed. 715; Lassiter v. Northampton County Bd. of Elections, 1959, 360 U.S. 45, 79 S.Ct. 985, 3 L.Ed.2d 1072. The books are filled with examples of state election laws and practices found to transgress constitutional guaranties. Guinn v. United States, 1915, 238 U.S. 347, 35 S.Ct. 926, 59 L.Ed. 1340; Lane v. Wilson, 1938, 307 U.S. 268, 59 S.Ct. 872, 83 L.Ed. 1281; United States v. Classic, 1941, 313 U.S. 299, 61 S.Ct. 1031, 85 L.Ed. 1368; Davis v. Schnell, 1949, S.D.Ala., 81 F.Supp. 872, aff\u2019d 336 U.S. 933, 69 S.Ct. 749, 93 L.Ed. 1093. In <em>United States v. Classic, </em>a \u201cLouisiana\u201d case, the Supreme Court, in sustaining federal indictments against state election officials for falsely certifying returns in a <em>congressional </em>election, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-10\">\u201cWhile, in a loose sense, the right to vote for representatives in Congress is sometimes spoken of as a right derived from the states, [citations omitted] this statement is true only in the sense that the states are authorized by the Constitution, to legislate on the subject as provided by \u00a7 2 of Art. I, to the extent that Congress has not restricted state action by the exercise of its powers to regulate elections under \u00a7 4 and its more general power under Article I, \u00a7 8, clause 18 of the Constitution \u2018to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers.\u2019 See Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. 371 [25 L.Ed. 717]; Ex parte Yar-brough, supra, [110 U.S. 651], 663, 664 [4 S.Ct. 152, 158, 28 L.Ed. 274] * # * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">In ex parte Yarbrough, 1884, 110 U.S. 651, 663, 4 S.Ct. 152, 158, 28 L.Ed. 274, cited in <em>Classic, </em>the court stated: \u201c[I]t is not true * * * that electors for members of Congress owe their right to vote to the State law in any sense which makes the exercise of the right to depend exclusively on the law of the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-14\">B. Three provisions of the United States Constitution deny plenary and exclusive power to the States to determine voting requirements and give special protection to a citizen against discrimination in the electoral process. Two are mandates expressly prohibiting discriminatory state action. The third is an affirmative grant of power to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-15\">The first and most important is the Fifteenth Amendment. It is clearly and simply expressed: \u201cThe right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>or by any State <em>on account </em>of race, color, or previous condition of servitude\u201d. Uncomplicated by phrases freighted with history back to Magna Carta, the Fifteenth Amendment imposes on courts the unshirkable duty of inquiring into legislative purpose and striking down a fair-seeming law that, \u201con account of race\u201d, is in fact a discriminatory device to deprive Negroes of their vote. \u201cThe Fifteenth Amendment * * * clearly shows that the right of suffrage was considered to be of supreme importance to the national government, and was not intended to be left within the exclusive control of the States.\u201d Ex parte Yar-brough, 1884, 110 U.S. 651, 4 S.Ct. 152, 28 L.Ed. 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Second, the Fourteenth Amendment, primarily by the \u201cequal protection\u201d clause, prohibits discriminatory voting qualifications. Nixon v. Herndon, 1924, 273 U.S. 536, 47 S.Ct. 446, 71 L. Ed. 759. As the Supreme Court stated in another context, however: Although this is \u201ca more explicit safeguard of prohibited unfairness than \u2018due process of law.\u2019 * * * discrimination may be so unjustifiable as to be violative of due proe-ess. * * * Liberty under law extends to the full range of conduct which the individual is free to pursue, and it cannot be restricted except for a proper governmental objective.\u201d Bolling v. Sharpe, 1954, 347 U.S. 497, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">Third, Article 1, Section 4 of the Constitution empowers Congress to \u201cmake or alter\u201d the \u201c [t] imes, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives * * * prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Such Congressional authority extends to registration, a phase of the electoral process unknown to the Founding Fathers but today a critical, inseparable part of the electoral process which must necessarily concern the United States, since registration to vote covers voting in federal as well as in state elections.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Ex parte Siebold, 1880, 100 U.S. 371, 25 L.Ed. 717 the Supreme Court relied on Article 1, Section 4, in sustaining a statute providing, among other things, for federal registrars, supervisors, in registration offices. See also In re Supervisors of Election, C.C.Ohio 1878, 23 Fed. Cas. 430 (No. 13628). In United States v. Manning, W.D.La.1963, 215 F.Supp. 272, 277, this Court upheld the registration provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1960: \u201c[N]othing in the language or history of the Tenth Amendment gives the State exclusive sovereignty over the election processes against the Federal government\u2019s otherwise constitutional exercise of a power.\u201d See McColloch v. Maryland, 1819, 4 Wheat. 316, 17 U.S. 316, 4 L.Ed. 579 and United States v. Darby, 1941, 312 U.S. 100, 124, 61 S.Ct. 451, 85 L.Ed. 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d clause, Article 1, Section 8, Clause 18, gives Congress full authority to legislate under Article 1, Section 4 (or any other constitutional grant of power); the Fourteenth Amendment, Section 5, specifically grants power to Congress to pass \u201cappropriate legislation\u201d to prevent the denial of equal protection of the laws: the Fifteenth Amendment, Section 2, specifically grants power to Congress to pass \u201cappropriate legislation\u201d to guarantee that the right to vote shall not be abridged on account of race. Ex parte Virginia, 1879, 100 U.S. 339, 25 L.Ed. 676, makes it clear that the \u201cappropriate legislation\u201d clause of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments is as broad as the \u201cnecessary and proper clause\u201d, as construed in McCulloch v. Maryland, 1899, 4 Wheat. 316, 17 U.S. 316, 4 L.Ed. 579. The Supremacy Clause, Article VI, subordinates any conflicting state legislation to congressional legislation. The totality of implied powers these sections grant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Congress are full authority for Congress to enact the Civil Rights Act or other appropriate legislation to regulate elections (including registration) under Article 1, Section 4, and to protect the integrity of the electoral process under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. United States v. Classic, 1941, 313 U.S. 299, 61 S.Ct. 1031, 85 L.Ed. 1368; Burroughs v. United States, 1934, 290 U.S. 534, 54 S.Ct. 287, 78 L.Ed. 484; Ex parte Yarbrough, 1884, 110 U.S. 651, 663, 4 S.Ct. 152, 28 L.Ed. 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">C. \u201cIt is said [more often in the past than in recent years, we interpolate] that when the meaning of language is plain we are not to resort to evidence in order to raise doubts. That is rather an axiom of experience than a rule of law, and does not preclude consideration of persuasive evidence if its exists\u201d. Boston Sand and Gravel Co. v. United States, 1928, 278 U.S. 41, 48, 49 S.Ct. 52, 53, 73 L.Ed. 170 (Holmes, J.) \u201cOf course one begins with the words of a statute to ascertain its meaning, but one does not end with them\u201d. Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Ins. Co. v. United States, 1956, 352 U. S. 128, 138, 77 S.Ct. 186, 191, 1 L.Ed.2d 189 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">In going beyond the verbal surface of the Louisiana interpretation test, we have sought to eschew inquiry into motive. A federal court\u2019s proper-respect for the State and the judiciary\u2019s due regard for the legislative process, among other reasons, compel this restraint. Candor compels the admission however that in this case the line between the <em>motive </em>of the lawmakers and the <em>purpose </em>of law is blurred. Blur or not, the court cannot, on the one hand, carry out its judicial function of giving effect to legislative intent, or, on the other hand, invalidate the law under a reasonable construction fair to the framers, without first determining the purpose of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">As we see it, <em>purpose </em>carries the meaning of Coke\u2019s \u201ctrue reason\u201d for the law in the light of the situation at which it is aimed. Heydon\u2019s Case, 3 Co.Rep. 7a, 7b, 76 Eng.Rep. 637 (1584). \u201c[L]aws are not abstract propositions. They are expressions of policy arising out of specific situations and addressed to the attainment of particular ends. * * * And so the bottom problem is: What is below the surface of the words and yet fairly a part of them ?\u201d Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Col.L.Rev. 527, 533 (1947). Purpose then, or the \u201ctrue reason\u201d for the law, determined as objectively as possible, is an essential part of the context within which a law must be read, if the Court is to appraise fairly the validity of the law. Llewellyn stated this well:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-11\">\u201cIf a statute is to make sense, it must be read in the light of some assumed purpose. A statute merely declaring a rule, with no purpose or objective, is nonsense. * * * [When there are] ideas consciously before the draftsmen, the committee, the legislature, * * * talk of \u2018intent\u2019 is reasonably realistic; committee reports, legislative debate, historical knowledge of contemporary thinking or campaigning which points up the evil or the goal can have significance.\u201d Llewellyn, The Common Law Tradition 374 (1960).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZH\">See also N.A.A.C.P. v. Button, 1963, 371 U.S. 415, 83 S.Ct. 328, 9 L.Ed.2d 405; Jordan v. Hutcheson, 4 Cir. 1963, 323 F.2d 597; Howell, Legislative Motive and Legislative Purpose in the Invalidation of a Civil Rights Statute, 47 Va.L.Rev. 439 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-13\">To Louisianians familiar with the history of their state, it must seem an exercise in futility for the Court to labor the proof of the true reason for the understanding or interpretation test. However, two decisions by three-judge courts in this circuit put a high premium on the Court\u2019s ascertaining the true reason for the test. These are Davis v. Schnell, S.D.Ala.1949, 81 F.Supp. 872, aff\u2019d mem. 1949, 336 U.S. 933, 69 S.Ct. 749, 93 L.Ed. 1093, and Darby v. Daniel, S.D.Miss. 1958, 168 F.Supp. 170. In <em>Davis v. Schnell, </em>the court, in holding the Alabama understanding clause unconstitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>tional, based its decision, in good part, on the discriminatory purpose of the law as evidenced by its history. The Court, in <em>Darby v. Daniel, </em>held the Mississippi understanding clause constitutional and distinguished <em>Davis v. Schnell, </em>in part because the plaintiff had failed to show that Mississippi\u2019s understanding clause was intended to discriminate against Negroes.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">D. It is not unusual for courts to look beyond the face of a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">A court may find that a law non-discriminatory on its face is discrimina-torily administered. \u201cThough the law itself be fair on its face and impartial in appearance, yet, if it is applied and administered by public authority with an evil eye and unequal hand, so as practically to make unjust and illegal discrimi-nations between persons of similar circumstances, material to their rights, the denial of equal justice is still within the prohibition of the Constitution.\u201d Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 1886, 118 U.S. 356, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The legislative purpose and inevitable effect of a law non-discriminatory on its face may be decisive in determining the unconstitutionality of the law. In Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 1960, 364 U.S. 339, 81 S.Ct. 125, 5 L.Ed.2d 110, the Supreme Court had before it an Alabama statute which changed the shape of Tus-keegee \u201cfrom a square to an uncouth twenty-eight-sided figure.\u201d No one has ever doubted that a state legislature has the power to determine municipal boundaries, and a long line of cases, going back to Luther v. Borden, 1849, 7 How. 1, 12 L.Ed. 581, and continuing through Cole-grove v. Green, 1946, 328 U.S. 549, 66 S.Ct. 1198, 90 L.Ed. 1432, strongly argued for the conclusion that gerrymandering of election districts was a \u201cpolitical\u201d problem. In holding the law unconstitutional under the Fifteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court based the decision on the statutory objective and the effect of removing from Tuskee-gee all save four or five of its 400 Negro voters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-7\">\u201cWhen a State exercises power wholly within the domain of state interest, it is insulated from federal judicial review. But such insulation is not carried over when state power is used as an instrument for circumventing a federally protected right. This principle has had many applications. It has long been recognized in cases which have prohibited a State from exploiting a power acknowledged to be absolute in an isolated context to justify the imposition of an \u2018unconstitutional condition.\u2019 What the Court has said in those cases is equally applicable here, viz., that \u2018Acts generally lawful may become unlawful when done to accomplish an unlawful end, United States v. Reading Co., 226 U.S. 324, 357 [33 S.Ct. 90, 57 L.Ed. 243], and a constitutional power cannot be used by way of condition to attain an unconstitutional result.\u2019 Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Foster, 247 U.S. 105, 114 [38 S.Ct. 438, [439], 62 L.Ed. 1006, 1 A.L.R. 1278].\u201d 364 U.S. at 347-348, 81 S.Ct. at 130, 5 L.Ed.2d 110.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">In Grosjean v. American Press Co., 1936, 297 U.S. 233, 56 S.Ct. 444, 80 L.Ed. 660, a Louisiana law appeared to be simply a graduated tax on newspaper and theatre advertising. Underneath the surface, as the evidence showed, was the legislative purpose to punish New Orleans newspapers for criticism of Governor Huey Long. With nothing in the statute to show the object of the tax and little in the record to show how it was generated, or how it worked, the Supreme Court went beyond appearances and struck down the tax as in effect an abridgment of First Amendment freedom of the press in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Cases too numerous to cite sustain taxation of newspapers. As the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-10\">\u201c[The tax] is bad because, <em>in the light of its history and of its present setting, </em>it is seen to be a deliberate and calculated device in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>guise of a tax to limit the circulation of information to which the public is entitled in virtue of the constitutional guarantees.\u201d 297 U.S. at 250, 56 S.Ct. at 449, 80 L.Ed. 660.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In this case, too, we must go into the \u201chistory\u201d and \u201cpresent setting\u201d of a law non-discriminatory on its face. In doing so, we bear in mind a maxim quoted appropriately in this circuit many times in recent years, a maxim from one of the Supreme Court decisions outlawing the Oklahoma grandfather clause: \u201c[The Constitution] nullifies sophisticated as well as simple-minded modes of discrimination. It hits onerous procedural requirements which effectively handicap exercise of the franchise by the colored race although the abstract right to vote may remain unrestricted as to race.\u201d Lane v. Wilson, 1939, 307 U.S. 268, 275, 59 S.Ct. 872, 876, 83 L. Ed. 1281.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">To obtain some necessary pages of history, more valuable than volumes of logic, as Holmes has said, we sacrifice brevity.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">The Louisiana interpretation test and its current variant, the citizenship test, are best understood as the latest, but perhaps not final, members of a long, logically connected series of socio-political events. These are rooted in the State\u2019s historic policy and the dominant white citizens\u2019 firm determination to maintain white supremacy in state and local government by denying to Negroes the right to vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">A. There was, of course, no problem in colonial and territorial times; the <em>Codes Noir, </em>from the 1724 Code to Act 33 of the Territorial Legislature of 1806, disfranchised Negroes. Louisiana became a state in 1812. Its first Constitution set the pattern. It limited the franchise to \u201cfree white male citizen[s]\u201d who had paid state taxes or purchased land from the United States within six months prior to the election. For thirty-three years this constitutional limitation kept the ballot chiefly in the hands of landowners and merchants, disfranchised two-thirds of the electorate, and favored New Orleans and the southern parishes over the rest of the State. The Constitution of 1845, in many respects a progressive and broadly democratic document, did away with the tax-paying qualification for voters and established universal suffrage for free white males, regardless of wealth and literacy, but limited the vote to citizens of the United States who had resided in Louisiana for two years, and barred the vote to paupers and men in military service. The next Constitution, adopted in 1852, broadened the suffrage qualifications by lowering the state residential requirement to one year, and introduced registration of voters, a progressive step many years in advance of most states. This Constitution required registration for Orleans Parish and made it optional with the legislature for the other parishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">Thus, from the <em>Code Noir </em>of 1724 until 1864, the organic law of the state ordained that only free white males could vote or hold office. This was in a state where there were thousands of free men of color. Many of these were well educated and owned slaves. Except for suffrage, they possessed the civil and legal rights of white citizens.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>The Constitutional Convention of 1864 was the first convention in Louisiana to consider Negro suffrage. During the federal occupation of New Orleans, General N. P. Banks, Commander of the Gulf Department, at the direction of President Lincoln, ordered an election of delegates to a constitutional convention. Negroes could not vote for the delegates and were not represented in the Convention. It was attended by delegates from the federally occupied part of the State only: Orleans and eighteen southern parishes which recognized Michael Hahn as Governor. (Henry W. Allen was the Confederate Governor for the rest of the State.) The Constitution of 1864 abolished slavery and provided for free public schools for all children between six and eighteen years, regardless of race, but retained the previous limitation of suffrage to white males. In the early stages of the convention a strong sentiment existed against granting suffrage to the Negroes, and the delegates actually adopted a resolution declaring that the legislature should never pass a law authorizing Negroes to vote.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Later in the session, the delegates established a voting qualification, without amending the suffrage ordinance restricting the vote to white males. This was based on an intelligence test, in the interest of permitting Negro suffrage. The resolution in question authorized the legislature \u201cto pass laws extending suffrage to such other persons, citizens of the United States, as by military service, by taxation to support the Government, or by intellectual fitness, may be deemed entitled thereto.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The word \u201cNegro\u201d was not contained in the resolution as proposed in the Convention or in the ordinance as adopted and, at the time, which was before the adoption of the Civil War Amendments, it was generally thought that Negroes were not citizens. Nonetheless, in the debates over the resolution a number of delegates denounced it as a \u201cnigger resolution\u201d, and at least one delegate stalked out of the Convention in protest against Negroes being allowed to vote.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">The Constitution of 1864 required the registration of <em>all </em>voters in the State. In 1867 the State Board of Registration, making its first report, showed 45,189 white and 84,527 Negro registrants. The male population of voting age in Louisiana in 1860 was 94,711 whites and 92,502 Negroes.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">Racial relations in Louisiana deteriorated rapidly. In the fall of 1865 the Democrats in Louisiana adopted resolutions \u201cthat this is a Government of white people, made and to be perpetuated for the exclusive benefit of the white race\u201d, and declared the Constitution of 1864 a creature of fraud.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Radical Republi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>cans, refusing to recognize the existing Democratic Government in Louisiana and adopting the Sumner theory that Louisiana was reduced to the status of a territory and as such was entitled to a territorial delegate to Congress, met in convention and called an election for November 6, 1865, to elect a delegate. Henry Clay Warmoth, later Governor, generally regarded in Louisiana histories as a carpetbagger, was elected as the delegate \u2014 without opposition.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In that election, such as it was, for the first time in the history of the State, Negroes voted freely.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Ominous events progressively increased the friction between the races in the years between the Constitutions of 1864 and 1868. In 1864, relatively peacefully, the Free State Party attempted to establish a government \u201cresponsive to loyal white people; the demobilized Confederates, an administration which would restore Louisiana to its ante-bellum condition, except that peonage would replace slavery\u201d.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> By 1865 Confederate veterans had returned in number and in an orderly election that year defeated the Free Staters and gained control of the legislature, mainly by opposing Negro suffrage.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The legislature and police juries promptly enacted new Black Codes which reduced the Negro to a \u201ccondition which lay between peonage and serfdom\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and intensified the activities of Republicans and Northern radicals for Negro suffrage. July 30, 1866, a bloody riot took place in New Orleans at Mechanics Institute. This \u201cmassacre\u201d was provoked, it has been said, by \u201cthe attempt of some irresponsible white radicals to transfer the franchise from Confederate veterans to freed men\u201d.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In 1867 the Louisiana legislature rejected the Fourteenth Amendment. \u201cThere followed, as night the day, military reconstruction.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-15\">In 1868 General Philip H. Sheridan, Commander of the Fifth Military District of Louisiana and Texas, called a constitutional convention to meet the conditions Congress imposed on the former States of the Confederacy: suffrage regardless of race and ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. In the election of delegates to the convention, Confederate veterans and Democratic officeholders were barred from the polls. This was the first and last Louisiana constitutional convention to which Negro delegates were admitted; the president of the convention and forty-nine of the ninety-eight delegates were Negroes. In the 1868 Constitution Negroes finally received the right to vote and to hold office. This Constitution disfranchised all persons who had participated directly or indirectly in the War<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> on the Confeder<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>ate side and, pouring salt on open wounds, required, as a condition to voting, a certificate from Confederate soldiers and Democratic officeholders that \u201cthe late rebellion\u201d was \u201cmorally and politically wrong\u201d.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The Constitution of 1868 desegregated the schools, adopted the bill of rights, rejected a literacy test, and prohibited discrimination in public conveyances and places of public accommodation. This was all \u201cthat Avas needed to strengthen the determination of Southern whites to establish white supremacy, at whatever cost. The Constitution of 1868, therefore, instead of closing the breach between whites and blacks, served only to widen it.\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AqT\">As a result of the disfranchisement of many former Confederate soldiers and the enfranchisement of Negroes, the 1868 election resulted in the election of War-moth as Governor, and of Oscar J. Dunn, a Negro ex-slave, as Lieutenant Governor. Between 1868 and 1896, a number of Negroes held high office in the State: two congressmen, six high state officials, thirty-two state senators, ninety-five state representatives, and one United States Senator, who was not seated;<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> P. B. S. Pinchback served briefly as Governor.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">The years from 1864 to 1876 in Louisiana were years of violence and disorder, notwithstanding the presence of federal troops during these years. In 1873 at Colfax, Grant Parish, fifty-nine Negroes and two white persons were killed.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> After the Colfax riot additional federal troops were sent to Louisiana and stationed at various points to aid officials in keeping order. Louisiana became an armed camp. In 1874 six white Republican officeholders of Red River Parish were killed, after they had surrendered and had agreed to leave the State.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Elections were a farce, since \u201cGovernor [Kellogg] appointed the registrars, and through them returned his friends to the legislature\u201d; \u201cpoliticians bribed legislators for party and parish favors, and business men and corporations bribed the politicians for economic privileges\u201d. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number><footnotemark>27</footnotemark> During most of the years between 1866 and 1877 there were two governors and two legislatures. The Republican governors and their elected associates were maintained in office only by the Returning Board and federal troops, Representative white citizens considered it a civic duty<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> to belong first to The Knights of the White Camelia, a secret organization equivalent to the Ku Klux Klan in other states, and, later, to join the White League, a statewide organization which openly advocated white supremacy <footnotemark>29</footnotemark> in a published platform. September 14, 1874, the Crescent City (New Orleans) White League, which was organized militarily, led by influential citizens, successfully fought a pitched battle in New Orleans against 8000 of Kellogg\u2019s Negro militia, 1000 Metropolitan Police<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> under General Longstreet, and several hundred federal troops. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>White League took over complete control of the City, then the Capitol of Louisiana, and established in the Statehouse Acting Governor Penn and, later, Governor McEnery. President Grant came to the rescue with sufficient troops to support Governor Kellogg\u2019s regime, and the White Leaguers returned to their homes without incident. Some years later, Liberty Place Monument was erected to the memory of the sixteen members of the White League who were killed. September 14 is still officially celebrated annually in New Orleans with public ceremonies as the day the tide turned in Louisiana against the Negroes, carpetbaggers, and scalawags who had been in control of state and local government.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">The Battle at Liberty Place had an important effect on the election of 1876 when the \u201cRedeemers\u201d, the White Democrats under Francis T. Nicholls, defeated the Negro Republican candidate, S. B. Packard. Throughout the State, and especially in New Orleans, armed members of the White League policed the election. Governor Nicholls, who ran as the White League\u2019s choice but who had also promised Negroes the continued enjoyment of their constitutional privileges, managed to attract enough Negro ballots to win by a substantial, if contested, vote. Governor Kellogg\u2019s Returning Board and, later, the Republican Legislature, declared S. B. Packard elected. Nicholls and Packard were each inaugurated. January 9, 1877, the White League numbering 6000, marched on the Cabildo in New Orleans, where Packard\u2019s troops were stationed. The troops surrendered. President Grant, unwilling to take sides because of the pending Hayes-Tilden controversy, ordered the status quo preserved. For four months armed White Leaguers patrolled the streets of New Orleans.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">Louisiana was the last of the Southern States to be freed from carpetbag government. In April 1877 President Hayes, as part of the Hayes-Tilden compromise, removed federal troops from Louisiana and recognized the Nicholls administration as the legal government of the state.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> These events foreshadowed the \u201clily white\u201d primary, marked the emergence of the Democratic party in the south as \u201cthe institutionalized incarnation of the will to White Supremacy,\u201d <footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and led inexorably to the \u201cgrandfather\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>clause, the understanding or interpretation test, and the tricky registration application form as techniques to avoid another Reconstruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">In 1879, with the State firmly in the control of the White League, another Constitution was adopted. \u201cIts chief objectives apparently, were to put \u2018white supremacy\u2019 back on a firm foundation and bring to an end the oppressive taxation, excessive public spending, and corrupt administration that had plagued the people for a decade.\u201d <footnotemark>35</footnotemark> This was before the understanding clause was invented. The solution for the Negro problem devised by the Convention was to transfer powers to the Governor from the legislature and the police juries (county commissioners).<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The public accommodations section and most of the provisions in the 1868 Constitution favorable to Negroes were eliminated, but the Constitution of 1879 did not restrict the Negro\u2019s right to vote. This may have been because of fear of another federal intervention or because the Negro-White unification movement under General Beauregard had collapsed.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Article 188 of that Constitution provided, \u201cNo qualification of any kind for suffrage or office, nor any restraint upon the same, on account of race, color or previous condition shall be made by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-14\">In the eighties and until 1898 Negroes in Louisiana continued to vote and to have their vote solicited by all parties. This is not surprising. In 1888 there were 127,923 Negro voters and 126,884 white voters on the registration rolls in' Louisiana; <footnotemark>38</footnotemark> the population of the state was about fifty per cent Negro.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-15\">In the election of 1892, the Louisiana Lottery issue split both parties. Murphy J. Foster, a Democrat, was the successful candidate for governor, but the Negro vote was a decisive factor in Governor Foster\u2019s favor in many parishes, a disquieting circumstance necessarily regarded as a mixed blessing. In a four-man race, the Democrats polled only 79,-388 votes against a total of 98,647 cast for the Republicans and the newly organized people\u2019s Populist party.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The next election, in 1896, was the turning point that led directly to the disfranchisement of the Negro in Louisiana. In that election, Governor Foster, running for reelection, defeated John N. Pharr, the choice of a Fusion party of \u201cNational\u201d (Lily white) Republicans, Regular (Radi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>cal) Republicans, Populists, and sugar-growers dissatisfied with low tariffs of 1894. It was a bitterly fought election.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> \u201cThe main issue * * * was the problem of Negro suffrage.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Again the Negro vote was decisive in many parishes. Again, Poster, who ran \u25a0on a \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d platform, had his heaviest majority in parishes where the Negro registration was the heavi\u2022est.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">At this point, the handwriting on the wall could be read as easily in Louisiana as it was read earlier in Mississippi: something had to be done about Negro Suffrage. Local issues or national issues could split the Democratic party wide open, giving the Negroes the balance of power. And the political ecology of Louisiana made factionalism inevitable. In Louisiana, as in Mississippi and Alabama, there were, and still are, fundamental social and economic differences between the areas controlled by a plantation economy and the areas controlled by a small farm economy. Two potent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>additional facts of political life aggravate divisiveness in Louisiana: (1) North Louisiana is solidly Protestant, South Louisiana predominantly Catholic; (2) New Orleans and the rest of the State are like oil and water. See Fen-ton and Vines, Negro Registration in Louisiana, 51 Am.Pol.Sc.Rev. 704 (1957). By 1898, the moral as well as dollar-and-cents costs of buying victory at the polls were finally more than the purchasers were willing to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Promptly after the important election of 1896, Governor Foster requested the Legislature to call a constitutional convention. <em>Former Governor </em>Nicholls, then Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Louisiana, called the Convention to order February 8, 1898. Judge Thomas-J. Semmes, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the Convention and a former president of the American Bar Association, described the purpose of the-Convention: <em>\u201cWe </em>[meet] here to establish the supremacy of the white race,, and the white race constitutes the Democratic party of this State.\u201d <footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The Convention of 1898 \u201cinterpreted its mandate-from the 'people' to be, to disfranchise-as many Negroes and as few whites as-possible.\u201d <footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">The understanding clause, invented by Mississippi a few years before as an alternative to a literacy test, was strongly advocated by many of the delegates.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> After considerable debate, however, <em>\u201cper</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number><em>suaded that the understanding clause was \u2018based on fraud\u2019, </em>the Louisiana Convention rejected it and invented the \u2018grandfather clause\u2019 \u201d.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Under Article 197 of the 1898 Constitution,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> in order to register, an applicant had to meet educational and property qualifications \u2014 unless exempted by the \u201cgrandfather\u201d clause. The educational test required the applicant to be able to read and write and demonstrate the ability to do so by filling out the application form without assistance. The property test required the applicant to own property assessed at $300 and to have paid the taxes due on the property.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The grandfather clause exempted persons entitled to vote on or before January 1, 1867, or the son or grandson of such person.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> A similar provision exempted immigrants who came to this country after January 1,1867. At the time, forty per cent of the registered voters in Louisiana were illiterate and most of the Negroes could not meet the property requirement. The result was disfranchisement of almost all of the Negro voters and of some twenty to thirty thousand white voters.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Alc\u00e9e Fortier, one of Louisiana\u2019s most respected historians, writing in 1904, succinctly stated the legislative purpose of the grandfather clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-8\">\u201cThe purpose of this section, known as the \u2018Grandfather Clause\u2019 was to allow many honorable and intelligent but illiterate white men to retain the right of suffrage, and the purpose of the educational or property qualification was to disfranchise the ignorant negroes who had been a menace to the civilization of the State since the adoption of the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\u201d 4 For-tier, History of Louisiana 235.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">On accepting the chair as President of the Convention, Ernest B. Kruttschnitt, a leading lawyer in New Orleans and a veteran of the White League, did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>mince his words: \u201cWe have here no political antagonism and I am called upon to preside over what is little more than a family meeting of the Democratic Party of the State of Louisiana. * * * We are all aware that this Convention has been called * * * principally to deal with one question * * * to eliminate from the electorate the mass of corrupt and illiterate voters who have during the last quarter century degraded our politics.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The Convention voted that no ordinance should be considered until the report of the Committee on Suffrage and Election was finally acted upon by the Convention. Near the end of the Convention, President Kruttchnitt announced :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-4\">\u201cWe have not been free; we have not drafted the exact Constitution we should like to have drafted; otherwise we should have inscribed in it, if I know the popular sentiment of the State, Universal White Manhood Suffrage, and the exclusion from the suffrage of every man with a trade of African blood in his veins. * * * What care I whether it be more or less ridiculous- or not? Doesn\u2019t it meet the case? Doesn\u2019t it let the white man vote, \u00e1nd doesn\u2019t it stop the negro from Voting, and isn\u2019t that what we came here for ?\u201d <footnotemark>52</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">In his message to the legislature, Governor Foster was able to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">\u201cThe white supremacy for which we have so long struggled at the cost of so much precious blood and treasure, is now crystallized into the Constitution as a fundamental part and parcel of that organic instrument, and that, too, by no subterfuge or other evasions. With this great principle thus firmly imbedded in the Constitution, and honestly enforced, there need be no longer any fear as to the honesty and purity of our future elections.\u201d <footnotemark>53</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-15\">Following the example of Mississippi,, with respect to its 1890 Constitution,. Louisiana did not submit the 1898 Constitution to the vote of the people.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-16\">To make the disfranchisement effective, the legislature directed a complete-new registration of all voters. Registration rolls before and after adoption of the-Constitution show the prompt effect the-grandfather clause had on Negro voters..</p>\n<p id=\"b422-17\">January 1,1897 March 17, 1900-\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b422-18\">Number of Negro Voters 130,344 5,320</p>\n<p id=\"b422-19\">Number of White Voters 164,088 125,437</p>\n<p id=\"b422-20\">The drop in Negro registration continued, so that by 1910 only 730 or less-than 0.5 per cent of the adult male Negroes were registered. In the sixty parishes then in existence, there were no-Negroes registered in twenty-seven parishes and only one Negro registered in; each of another nine parishes. Only ten-parishes had more than ten Negro registered voters each. By 1918, when there \u25a0 were sixty-four parishes, thirty-seven, parishes had no Negroes registered. Eight other parishes had only a single Negro on the voter registration rolls.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark>' \u201cWith the adoption of the Constitution of 1898, Louisiana became in fact and. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>practice a white man\u2019s state as far as its politics went.\u201d <footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The 1913 Constitution did not change the suffrage provisions of the 1898 Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">In 1915, in <em>Guinn v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court declared the Oklahoma grandfather clause unconstitutional. Chief Justice Edward Douglass White, of Louisiana, who fought with \u201cLouisiana\u2019s Own\u201d at the Battle of Liberty Place<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> and was the campaign manager for Governor Nicholls in 1888, wrote the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Against this background, a constitutional convention was called in 1921. Although there were several good reasons for Louisiana to revise its constitution, it was well understood, as reported in the New Orleans Times-Picayune: \u201cRevision of the suffrage provision [was] necessary because the United States Supreme Court [had] declared the famous \u2018grandfather clause\u2019 invalid. * * * Already several substitutes have been proposed, among them the \u2018understanding clause\u2019 from Mississippi * * * and the plan of Ex-Governor R. G. Pleasant to confine the right of suffrage to those who inhabited the earth North of the twentieth degree of North, latitude prior to October 12, 1492, when Columbus discovered America. The purpose of his plan is to shut out the Negro.\u201d <footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-20\">We are handicapped in studying the legislative history of the Constitution of 1921 because, at the request of Ruffin G. Pleasant, the former Governor, who was Chairman of the Committee on Suffrage and Elections, the Committee met in secrecy and no minutes were kept of any discussion or debate. The newspaper accounts of the proceedings, the next best evidence,<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> quote Gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>ernor Pleasant as saying that this was because \u201cthere might be one subject coming up for discussion which we would not care to have preserved. * * * \u201d <footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Suffrage was \u201ca delicate question\u201d and the members preferred \u201cnot to debate it in the open.\u201d <footnotemark>61</footnotemark> No one failed to hear and heed the thunder of the silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">The Committee first considered and rejected Governor Pleasant\u2019s \u201cChristopher Columbus\u201d proposal.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> The plan finally agreed upon was the plan rejected in 1898 because of its \u201cimmorality\u201d \u2014 Mississippi\u2019s understanding clause, the interpretation test. In reporting the proposal, newspapers of the period consistently referred to it as the Mississippi \u201cunderstanding\u201d clause, quoting Mr. C. E. Hardin of Vernon Parish and Judge Phillip S. Pugh of Arcadia Parish,<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> and described it as a \u201csubstitute\u201d or \u201creplacement\u201d for the illegal grandfather clause.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> For example, a news report of the Times-Picayune characterized the plan as, \u201cAn. or dinance designed to plug the hole shot through the suffrage provision when the United States Supreme Court declared the famous \u2018grandfather\u2019 clause invalid\u201d. The Negro community had no trouble recognizing the purpose of the test. A large delegation of Negro leaders from New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Shreveport, and the parishes appeared before the committee to plead in vain for the franchise, and for more educational facilities.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> \u201cThe Convention [also] placed the power to remove any registrar in the State in the hands of an <em>ex officio </em>board of registration composed of the governor, lieutenant governor, and speaker, a majority of whom were more likely to be white men. Should any registrar show a tendency to administer the new registration tests too liberally, or otherwise to conduct his office in a manner displeasing to the administration, the state board could remove him at will.\u201d <footnotemark>66</footnotemark> When the Committee on Suffrage and Elections finally agreed on the interpretation test, the Baton Rouge Times accurately reported:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-12\">\u201cThe grandfather clause is eliminated and there is substituted an understanding and good character clause. * * * \u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">As Professor Powell said in his study of Louisiana constitutions for the Louisiana Law Institute, \u201cIn justice to the Convention, it must be said that even its bitterest critics could not deny that the Negroes were almost completely disfranchised.\u201d <footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>B. As an historical fact, and as appears from the evidence, the interpretation test was rarely, if ever, applied until the early fifties. It was not needed. The Democratic white primary made registration futile for Negroes.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> The Democratic State Central Committee, acting under authority granted to it by the State, restricted all candidates and voters in the Democratic Party primary elections for state officers to white persons.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> \u201c[D]ebarment from the nominating process is in effect disfranchisement. Denial of the privilege of participating in primaries also means, essentially, ineligibility to party membership in general and excludes the negro from all party proceedings such as mass meetings, conventions, or caucuses of voters in the precinct and from delegate conventions in larger areas, to say nothing of party offices and candidacies in the party primaries.\u201d Weeks, The White Primary, 8 Miss.L.J. 135, 136 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The white primary not only effectively kept Negroes from voting in the only election that had any significance in the Louisiana electoral process but it also correspondingly depressed Negro registration to insignificantly low numbers. During the period from 1921 to 1946 Negro registration was never in excess of one per cent of the total registered voters, although the Negro population of the state then constituted about one-third of the potential voters. In 1942 only 957 Negroes were registered to vote in Louisiana and no Negroes were registered in fifty-one of the sixty-four parishes of Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-11\">In 1944, white primaries, even those conducted by a political party and not by the State, were declared unconstitutional. Smith v. Allwright, 1944, 321 U.S. 649, 64 S.Ct. 757, 88 L.Ed. 987.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> After the demise of the white primary, Negro registration in Louisiana rapidly increased, rising from 1,029 in 1944 to 7,561 in 1946, to 22,576 in 1948, and to 120,000 in 1952.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> In 1956 there were 161,410 Negro voters, 15 per cent of the total registered vote in Louisiana, the highest percentage of Negro voters in any state in the southeastern region of the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-12\">The decline and fall of the white primary, the return of Negro soldiers from World War II, the intensified tempo of activity in Negro organizations after the School Segregation Cases in 1954, and the civil rights explosion all worked toward increasing Negro interest in voting. These and correlative factors made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>it imperative for parish registrars in Louisiana to utilize the interpretation test, if the State intended to maintain its policy of segregation, historically indissolubly bound with disfranchisement of Negroes.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">C. Immediately following the School Segregation Cases, two strong organizations dedicated to maintaining segregation in Louisiana were established, one by the legislature and one by private persons with official blessing. These two organizations have an important place in the history of the interpretation test. In our study, we see these organizations crossing and recrossing, publicizing and promoting the purpose and function of the test and how best to use it in order to prevent Negro participation in tke electoral process. First, in 1954, the Louisiana legislature created a Joint Legislative Committee \u201cto provide ways and means whereby our existing social order shall be preserved and our institutions and ways of life * * * maintained.\u201d This was to be accomplished by a program \u201cto maintain segregation of the races in all phases of our life in accordance with the customs, traditions, and laws of our State.\u201d <footnotemark>73</footnotemark> This Committee became known as the \u201cSegregation Committee\u201d. Its chairman was .William M. Rainach, State Senator from Claiborne Parish where there are more Negroes than white persons.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> Its counsel was William M. Shaw, also from Claiborne Parish. Second, at about the same time or before, Senator Rainach and Mr. Shaw and others organized and incorporated the Association of Citizens Councils of Louisiana to \u201cprotect and preserve by all legal means, our historical Southern Social Institutions in all of their aspects.\u201d <footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Senator Rainach was the first president of the Citizens Councils. Mr. Shaw was its first secretary. Senator Rainach and Mr. Shaw organized local councils and spearheaded the operations of the Segregation Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">In 1956, the Association of Citizens\u20191 Councils published a pamphlet, prepared by Mr. Shaw and Senator Rainach, entitled, \u201cVoter Qualification Laws in Louisiana \u2014 The Key to Victory in the Segregation Struggle.\u201d The pamphlet advocated a two-step program. First, the registration rolls should be purged of \u201cthe great numbers of unqualified voters who have been illegally registered\u201d, and who \u201cinvariably vote in blocks and constitute a menace to the community.\u201d Second, registrars should strictly enforce the interpretation test. The pamphlet concludes, \u201cThe whole purpose of our registration laws is to prevent the registration of ignorant, \u2018bloc\u2019 voters * * * \u201d The foreword of the pamphlet makes clear who is referred to by the term \u201cbloc\u201d voter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">\u201cThe Communists and the NAACP plan to register and vote every colored person of age in the South * * *. They are not concerned with whether or not the colored bloc is registered in accordance with law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">No stress, no strain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-11\">\u201cIf our laws are intelligently and fairly administered, they will accomplish our purpose automatically.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">The \u201cKey to Victory\u201d is subtitled, \u201cA Manual of Procedure for Registrars of Voters, Police Jurors and Citizens Councils.\u201d The booklet was the principal topic of discussion at State-sponsored meetings-on voter registration attended by registrars and other public officials and was distributed to all persons attending such meetings. The State of Louisiana distributed it to parish registrars, with instructions to follow closely its purpose and intent. Senator Rainach and Mr. Shaw in their dual role as legislative and Citizens\u2019 Council leaders were clothed with State authority as they traveled: about the State urging and even demand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>ing that the registrars adopt their program.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Carrying out the first phase of the program, local Citizens Councils and their members conducted extensive purges, .principally in 1956-58 in eight parishes -throughout the state,<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> under the provisions of the challenge statute, Louisiana R.S. 18:133 (1950) LS\u00c1. The evidence \u00a1shows that primarily Negroes were removed from the rolls, although a few \u25a0whites were also purged in a token effort to maintain an air of nondiscriminatory treatment. Most registrars cooperated fully with Citizens Council members in conducting the purges when requested to do so. Innumerable white persons whose registration cards showed \u2022deficiencies similar to those of the Negroes were not purged. One registrar \u25a0said in her deposition that in her parish \u25a0the Citizen Council members conducting the purges corrected the errors they made <em>\u25a0on their own registration </em>applications, <em>while at the same time challenging Negroes for similar mistakes. </em>Many purges were for failure to take the interpretation test, <em>even though that test had not been administered at the time \u00f3f the registrant\u2019s application. </em>When contested in federal court, these purges were found to be illegal deprivations of the Negroes\u2019 constitutional rights. United States v. McElveen, 1960, E.D.La., 180 F. 'Supp. 10, modified sub nom. United States v. Thomas, 1960, 362 U.S. 58, 80 S.Ct. 612, 4 L.Ed.2d 535; United States v. Association of Citizens Councils of Louisiana, et al., 1961, W.D.La., 196 F. Supp. 908; United States v. Wilder, 1963, W.D.La., 222 F.Supp. 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">In late 1958 and early 1959 the Segregation Committee and the State Board of Registration jointly sponsored meetings in each congressional district. Registrars were required to attend; sheriffs, police jurors, and other parochial officials, and officers of citizens councils also attended the meetings. At these meetings the Citizens Council\u2019s \u201cKey to Victory\u201d was officially distributed to the registrars. Senator Rainach, at that time still Chairman of the Segregation Committee and President of the Association of Citizens Council, was the chairman at these meetings. Mr. Shaw, at that time was still counsel for the Segregation Committee and still counsel for the Association. They led these meetings, vigorously emphasizing the importance of maintaining segregation.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">Senator Rainach would tell the registrars, \u201cThe fight for school integration in the South has shifted * * * to a fight for the voters of the Negro masses * * \u201d He pointed out to the registrars that during the Reconstruction Period, when Negroes were permitted to vote, the public schools of Louisiana were integrated, and that, with the Negroes representing 32 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>per cent of the population of the state, the Negroes could easily do again what they did during the Reconstruction Era, if they should become registered to vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">According to Senator Rainach, \u201cIn 1897, our forefathers in Louisiana started a program of voter qualification law enforcement, knowing that such a program would provide the solution to their problems.\u201d The present voter qualification laws \u201care adequate to solve our present problems * * * \u201d Senator Rainach stressed that \u201cregistrars have become critically important officials * * * they have become the focal point of the solution to our problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Mr. Shaw would explain the registrar\u2019s part. The <em>\u201ckey to the solution of our whole problem lies in the interpretation of the Constitution,\u201d Mr. Shaw told the registrars. </em>He urged the registrars to require applicants to interpret the constitution and provided them with 25 test cards to be used for this purpose. Mr. Shaw instructed the registrars:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">\u201c[T]he constitutional test and their ability to understand the duties and responsibilities under a republican form of government, which is another one of the tests, is basically a test of a person\u2019s understanding, which is native intelligence in that you can educate a fool, but you\u2019d still have nothing but an educated fool when you get through, and he wouldn\u2019t be able to qualify. And therefore, <em>if they were correctly and fairly administered </em>\u2014 that\u2019s the key to the whole thing \u2014 directed fairly \u2014 then it will amount to a test of ability, of a person\u2019s understanding, which is native ability. It is not education. Education can merely refine native understanding. If you have no native understanding to start out with, it can\u2019t be refined.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Mr. Shaw also told the registrars:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEm\">\u201cConstitutional tests are a test of native intelligence and not \u2018book learning\u2019. Experience teaches that most of our own white people have this native intelligence while most Negroes do not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">Mrs. Mary C. Flournoy, former Registrar of Winn Parish, gives us some indication of the meaning of \u201ccorrectly and fairly administer [ing]\u201d the test. She stated that Senator Rainach, while he was Chairman of the Segregation Committee, told her to discriminate on account of race in processing applications:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-11\">\u201cRainach told me if * * # I can\u2019t fail them [Negro applicants] any other way, I could pull those Constitution reading cards on them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-12\">\u201c * * * Rainach wanted me to pull those hard cards on colored people.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-13\">D. The Louisiana <em>Codes Noir </em>of Colonial times and the Black Codes of the eighteen sixties; the pre-Civil War denial of the vote to Negroes, even to wealthy and educated free men of color; the ebb and flow of Negro rights in the Constitutions of 1864 and 1868; the 1879 transfer of political power from police juries and the legislature to the Governor; the close election of 1892 and the 1896 victory for white supremacy; the grandfather clause and the complicated registration application form in the Constitution of 1898; the invalidity of the grandfather clause and the consequent resort to Mississippi\u2019s understanding and interpretation clause; the effectiveness of the white primary as a means of disfranchising Negroes; the invalidity of the white primary and the consequent need to revive enforcement of the interpretation test; the White League and the Citizens\u2019 Councils; the Black League and the N.A.A.C.P.; the Battle of Liberty Place in 1874 and the Ouachita voting purge of 1956 \u2014 these are all related members of a series, all reactions to the same dynamics that produced the interpretation test and speak eloquently of its purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-14\">In sum, the interpretation test is another grandfather clause. Its purpose is rooted in the same history. It has the same objective the delegates to the Constitutional Convention of 1898 envisaged for the grandfather clause. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>is capable of producing the same effective disfranchisement of Negroes today that the grandfather clause produced sixty-five years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">y.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Having determined the true reason for the interpretation test in its historical setting, we turn from <em>why </em>to <em>how </em>the test is used as a discriminatory device.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">There are two reasons for a court to consider how a law is administered. The obvious reason is that any regulatory statute may be administered unfairly. If so, the court may enjoin the unfair acts without passing on the validity of the statute. But there is another reason. Just how a law is actually used by those charged with administering it is a proper guide to the purpose of the law and its necessary effect. Here, we find massive evidence that the registrars discriminated against Negroes not as isolated or accidental or unpredictable acts of unfairness by particular individuals, but as a matter of state policy in a pattern based on the regular, consistent, predictable unequal application of the test. This is the inescapable effect of a subjective requirement such as an understanding or interpretation test barren of standards and safeguards, the administration of which rests in the uncontrolled discretion of a registrar.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">The United States introduced a great mass of evidence in the record, but with commendable diligence made it digestible by well-prepared indices and well-organized summaries. The evidence of discriminatory application of the interpretation test is especially well documented and supported by testimony with respect</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">to the following parishes: Plaquemines, East Feliciana, Webster, Bienville, Bed Biver, Jackson, and Ouachita.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">A. First of all, a Louisiana registrar has the power to use or not to use the interpretation test. The parties to this case stipulated that the test had never been used in the four largest parishes of the state, Caddo, Jefferson, East Baton Bouge, and Orleans. These parishes have almost forty per cent of the total number of registered voters in the State. The United States introduced evidence that the interpretation test was used in twenty-one parishes.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> No mention was made of the other thirty-nine parishes in the state. The evidence shows that the test was seldom, if ever, applied anywhere in Louisiana before 1954 <footnotemark>78</footnotemark> because, as previously pointed out, until the white primary was invalidated there was no need for the test. This means that the <em>majority of Louisiana voters now registered under the permanent registration law have never taken the test.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-14\">In the twenty-one parishes where it has been shown that the interpretation test has been used, as of December 31, 1962, only 8.6 per cent of the adult Negroes were registered as against 66.1 per cent of the adult white persons registered. Before the interpretation test was put into use, a total of 25,361 Negroes were registered in the twenty-one parishes using the test. By August 31, 1962, total Negro registration in these parishes was 10,351. During the same period, white registration was not discernibly affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-15\">B. The decision to enforce the interpretation test more than thirty years after its adoption was accompanied, in almost every parish where the test has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>been used, by a wholesale purge of Negro voters or by periodic registration so that Negro voters were required to re-register <em>after </em>the test came into use. Citizens Council members challenged the registration of large numbers of Negro voters on the ground that they had not satisfied all of the requirements of the Louisiana voter qualification laws at the time they registered. Actually, the challenged Negroes had satisfied all the requirements imposed by the registrar <em>at the time </em>they registered. White voters had registered under the same standards and procedures as the Negroes and their registrations suffered from the same alleged deficiencies as the Negroes who were purged. In at least two parishes, Ouachita and East Feliciana, one ground for challenging Negroes was that they had not interpreted or were not able to interpret a constitutional section, even though the test had not been used in either parish before the purge.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">In most parishes where there was a purge, since the Negroes were unable to gain reinstatement in the manner prescribed by Louisiana law, they were required to re-register. And to do so they had to pass the interpretation test. The white voters, not having been challenged, in effect were exempted from the test. The discrimination brought about by the purge and the use of the interpretation test was frozen into the system in parishes such as Bienville, DeSoto, Jackson, Ouachita and Rapides, which have permanent registration. In parishes using periodic registration the purges had a deterrent effect on Negro registration which is still felt.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">C. The registrar\u2019s whim alone determines which applicants will be tested. The Constitution merely states that applicants \u201cshall <em>be able to </em>understand and give a reasonable interpretation\u201d of a section of a constitution. Some registrars, for example, those in LaSalle, Lincoln, and Webster parishes, have interpreted this to mean that the applicant need not actually interpret the constitution, only that he have the ability to do so. The State Board of Registration maintained at one time that the correct interpretation was that the applicant must demonstrate his ability in all cases. It has, however, changed its understanding or interpretation of this very section of the Constitution. After the institution of this suit, the Board prescribed another test, instructing registrars to cease requiring an interpretation. The change in the interpretation given the interpretation-test provision of the Constitution by the State agency charged with enforcing it and the wide variety of interpretations adopted by the registrars reaffirm the impossibility of achieving objective standards for an interpretation of the Constitution acceptable to the State. Pity the applicant asked to interpret the interpretation test!</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">D. The Louisiana Constitution contains 443 sections, as against 56 sections in the United States Constitution, and is the longest and the most detailed of all state constitutions. The printed copy published by the State, unannotated, contains 600 pages, not counting an index of 140 pages. The evidence clearly demonstrates great abuses in the selection of sections of the constitutions to be interpreted. Some registrars have favorite sections which they apparently use regardless of an applicant\u2019s race. Some open a volume containing the United States and Louisiana Constitutions and, like soothsayers seeking divine help from the random flight of birds, require an applicant to interpret the section on the page where the book opens. The Segregation Committee distributed to registrars sets of twenty-four cards, each containing three sections of the Constitution with instructions that they be used in administering the interpretation test. The Registrar of Ouachita Parish used a set of test cards containing sections chosen by the Citizens\u2019 Council. The Registrar of Plaquemines used cards and an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>swers prepared by Mr. Leander Perez, District Attorney for the Parish.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">It is evident from the record that frequently the choice of difficult sections has made it impossible for many Negro applicants to pass. White applicants were more often given easy sections, many of which could be answered by short, stock phrases such as \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d, \u201cfreedom of religion\u201d, \u201cStates\u2019 rights\u201d, and so on. Negro applicants, on the other hand, were given parts of the Louisiana Constitution such as Article VII, \u00a7 41; Article X, \u00a7 1, \u00a7 16; Article XIV, \u00a7 23, \u00a7 24.2.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">E. As in the selection process, gross abuses of discretion appear in the evaluation of the interpretations. One rejected Negro applicant stated that the registrar \u201csaid what I was saying was right, but it wasn\u2019t like she wanted me to say it\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Most of the interpretation tests have been administered orally, thus precluding the use of written records as a check on what the registrar accepted as reasonable interpretations. Nevertheless, the record shows that interpretations far less responsive to the constitutional text selected have been accepted from whites than from Negroes. Compounding this with the fact that Negroes were often given more difficult sections to interpret, the bias in favor of the whites becomes readily apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Some parishes administered written examinations and kept records of the questions asked and the responses accepted. In these examinations the registrar usually employed one or more of several sets of cards containing selected sections of the Constitution and a space for the applicant\u2019s interpretation of it. Even the most cursory glance at the records in these parishes underscores the heavy burden under which Negro applicants were laboring. In one set of cards, there is great disparity in the difficulty of the questions asked. This enables the registrar to select cards with simple sections for white applicants and difficult cards for Negroes. There is unmistakable evidence that many white applicants were shown cards with sample answers on them. Some applicants admitted this, and there is even an instance of a white <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>applicant having, by mistake, signed the sample answer card. Negroes were not allowed to see the acceptable answers, let alone copy them. Similarly, the pattern of the answers indicates that the registrars often told white applicants the currently acceptable answers. The phraseology of almost every answer in one parish changed right along with the registrar\u2019s change in the wording of the acceptable answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Registrars were easily satisfied with answers from white voters. In one instance \u201cFRDUM FOOF SPETGH\u201d was an acceptable response to the request to interpret Article 1, \u00a7 3 of the Louisiana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">On the other hand, the record shows that Negroes whose application forms and answers indicate that they are highly qualified by literacy standards and have a high degree of intelligence have been turned down although they had given a reasonable interpretation of fairly technical clauses of the constitution. For example the Louisiana Constitution, Article X, \u00a7 16 provides: \u201cRolling stock operated in this State, the owners of which have no domicile therein, shall be assessed by the Louisiana Tax Commission, and shall be taxed for State purposes only, at a rate not to exceed forty mills on the dollar assessed value.\u201d The rejected interpretation was: \u201cMy understanding is that it means if the owner of which does not have residence within the State, his rolling stock shall be taxed not to exceed forty mills on the dollar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">In another instance the registrar rejected the following interpretation of the Search and Seizure provision of the Fourth Amendment: \u201c[Njobody can just go into a person\u2019s house and take their belongings without a warrant from the law, and it had to specify in this warrant what they were to search and seize.\u201d Another rejected interpretation of the same Amendment by a Negro applicant was: \u201cTo search you would have to get an authorized authority to read a warrant.\u201d The Louisiana Constitution Article I, \u00a7 5 provides: \u201cThe people have the right peaceably to assemble.\u201d A registrar rejected the following interpretation: \u201cThat one may assemble or belong to any group, club, or organization he chooses as long as it is within the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">Each of these incidents <em>could </em>conceivably be an isolated event, indicating personal dereliction by one registrar, regrettable, but basically trivial in the general administration of the interpretation test. However, the great number of these and other examples, illustrative of a conscious decision, show conclusively that the discriminatory acts were not isolated or accidental or peculiar to the individual registrar but were part of a pervasive pattern and practice of disfranchisement by discriminatory use of the interpretation test.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">The State does not deny that unlimited discretion is vested in the registrars by the laws of Louisiana, but argues that officials must act reasonably and that their decisions are subject to review by district courts. Louisiana, however, provides no effective method whereby arbitrary and capricious action by registrars of voters may be prevented or redressed. Unreviewable discretion was built into the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-12\">The State Board of Registration recently recognized the arbitrary nature of the test, and, as indicated earlier in this opinion, abandoned its general use after the institution of this suit. However, the Constitution and statutes of Louisiana still require the use of the understanding and interpretation test. And registrars have not entirely abandoned it, despite the institution of the new test. For example, as late as April 1963 the Webster registrar was using the interpretation test because, as she explained, \u201cit\u2019s still on the books\u201d; sometimes she gave the citizenship test and sometimes the interpretation test. Voters registering now could be challenged and purged in the future for not taking the interpretation test \u2014 should history repeat itself. This is exactly what happened in the middle and late nineteen-fifties.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>F. The statistics demonstrate strikingly the effect of resurrection of the interpretation test. A report of the Louisiana Sovereignty Committee, December 14, 1960, boasts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\">\u201cWe would like to call your attention to the fact that, during this four year period of time, from 1956 until 1960, 81,214 colored people became of voting age, when the registration figures of colored people actually declined 2,377. Going further during this four year period, we had 114,-529 white people who became of voting age and, during this four year period of time, the white registration increased 96,620.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The State of Louisiana accomplished its purpose in the parishes where the constitutional interpretation test was used.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> In those twenty-one parishes, registration of white persons between 1956 and December 31, 1960, increased from 161,069 to 162,427; registration of Negroes decreased from 25,361 to 10,256.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">We have considered the true reason for the test, how the test was in fact used to accomplish its purpose, and its necessary effect. Now, we apply the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">No one doubts the broad scope of the State\u2019s power to fix reasonable, nondiseriminatory qualifications for voting consistent with the Constitution. Thus, a literacy test bears a reasonable relation to a governmental objective and, if it does not perpetuate past discrimination, is a permissible requirement. \u201c [I]n our society * * * a State might conclude that only those who are literate should exercise the franchise.\u201d Lassiter v. Northampton County Bd. of Elections, 1959, 360 U.S. 45, 52, 79 S.Ct. 985, 990, 3 L.Ed.2d 1072. Since Louisiana has the highest illiteracy rate in the nation, the State has even more reason than most states to use a literacy test as a spur to improve the level of the electorate. <em>But the understanding clause, which is an interpretation test of the constitutions, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number><em>must not be confused with a literacy test or the two treated as peers. </em>Under Louisiana law, any literacy qualification is met by the requirement that the applicant read to the registrar the Preamble of the United States Constitution. In fact, an applicant need write the Preamble only <em>in his </em>mother tongue, through the dictation of an interpreter if he cannot speak, read, or write English. La.Const. Art. VIII, \u00a7 1(c). For good measure, ability to fill out an application form is an additional test of literacy. Moreover, under another statute and provision of the State Constitution, until 1960 <em>all of the time Louisiana had an interpretation test it allowed illiterates to vote?</em><footnotemark><em>82</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(LSA-R.S. 18:36). In November 1962 the State carried 37,365 illiterates on the registration rolls.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">We do not have before us a test having a rational relation with the proper governmental objective of giving the vote only to qualified persons. Despite assurances by state officials at the meetings of the registrars that this test measures \u201conly native intelligence\", the truth of the matter is that there is nothing in native intelligence that will enable those untutored in constitutional law to give a reasonable interpretation of a highly technical document containing such legal concepts as, for example, venue, due process, the requisites of a criminal indictment, appellate court jurisdiction, and jurisdictional amount. Whatever name the State elects to give to the test, it is not a test of intelligence or citizenship when it enables a registrar to flunk eight Negro school teachers while passing eight illiterate white persons.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">As it is administered and as it was designed to be administered, the Louisiana understanding and interpretation test bears no relation to reasonable voting requirements. If a registrar should require an applicant to interpret Article X of the Louisiana Constitution dealing with the distribution between State and parish of <em>ad valorem </em>severance taxes on sulphur on the one hand and oil and gas on the other hand, we would find it impossible to hold that an interpretation of this provision served a rational governmental interest in withholding the suffrage from unqualified voters. Short of a government of philosopher-kings,\u2014 and no one has ever described Louisiana government in such terms \u2014 there is just no correlation between an ability to interpret <em>any </em>section of the Louisiana Constitution a registrar may thrust at an applicant for registration and a legitimate State interest in an informed electorate.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The ugly intractable truth is, the nexus is with unlawful discrimination. The ineradicable vice vitiating any relation to a legitimate governmental objective is the raw power vested in the registrar. The unrestricted power which makes the registrars\u2019 discriminatory and arbitrary conduct possible comes from the words \u201cunderstand\u201d and \u201cinterpretation.\" \u201cUnderstand\u201d and \u201cinterpretation\" are words without definite meaning in the law. Their purposive ambiguity is the key to the true reason for the test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">\u201cThe terms \u2018read\u2019, \u2018speak\u2019 and \u2018write\u2019, unlike the words \u2018understand\u2019 and \u2018explain\u2019 have considerable objective content, and the quan-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>turn of administrative decision that could be employed within the framework of such terminology would seem to be negligible. In contrast, * * * in both Louisiana and Mississippi [a would-be] voter is required to give a \u2018reasonable interpretation\u2019 of the Constitution of the United States. The language employed in these tests is similar to that of the Alabama literacy amendment and, because of its vagueness, would appear equally censurable.\u201d Note, 49 Col.L.Rev. 1144, 1146 (1949).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The understanding and interpretation of anything is an intimately subjective process. A communication of that understanding is itself subject to the understanding or interpretation of the listener or reader. Even in an atmosphere of mutual cooperation and good will, it is often very difficult for one person to know that the other actually understands what is being said or done. As appears from the evidence, however, in many registration offices in Louisiana the relation between the Registrar and Negro applicants can hardly be described as mutually cooperative. As Senator Rainach and Mr. Shaw, officers of the State of Louisiana, candidly described it, the registration office in Louisiana is \u201cthe front line of the battle\u201d to retain a segregated society.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Without help from Senator Rainach or Mr. Shaw \u2014 the customs of generations, the mores of the community, the exposure of the individual to segregation from the cradle make it difficult, if not impossible, for a registrar to evaluate objectively what is necessarily a subjective test. We are sensible of the registrar\u2019s difficulties \u2014he must live with his friends \u2014 but we must recognize that his predilections weight the scales against Negroes and hinder fair administration of an interpretation test or a citizenship test. When neither the Constitution nor the statutes prescribe any standards for the administration of the test, the net result is full latitude for calculated, purposeful discrimination and even for unthinking, purposeless discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">In Davis v. Schnell, S.D.Ala.1949, 81 F.Supp. 872, aff\u2019d memo. 1949, 336 U.S. 933, 69 S.Ct. 749, 93 L.Ed. 1093, a three-judge court (Circuit Judge McCord and District Judges Mullins and McDuffie) had before it the Boswell Amendment to the Alabama Constitution. The Court held (as we do in the case before us) that the test was invalid on its face and invalid as administered.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">The Boswell amendment, adopted in 1946, permitted registration only of persons who could \u201cunderstand and explain\u201d any article of the Federal Constitution. The Court dealt at length with the meaning of the word \u201cunderstand\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-10\">\u201cAs pointed out, \u2018understand\u2019 may mean to interpret. [Louisiana uses both words.] This meaning requires an exceedingly high, if not impossible, standard. The distinguished Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States have frequently disagreed in their interpretations of various articles of the Constitution. We learn from history that many of the makers of the Constitution did not understand its provisions; many of them understood and believed that its provisions gave the. Supreme Court no power to declare an act of Congress unconstitutional. An understanding or explanation given by the Supreme Court a few years ago as to the meaning of the commerce clause does not apply today. Among our most learned judges there are at least four different understandings and explanations of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution as to whether it made the first eight Amendments applicable to state action. Such a rigorous standard * * * illustrates the completeness with which any individual or group of prospective electors, whether white or Negro, may be deprived of the right of franchise by boards of registrars inclined to apply this one of the innumerable meanings of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>an indefinite phrase. * * * \u201d 81 F.Supp. at 877-878.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-4\"><em>Davis v. Schnell </em>was heard shortly after the adoption of the amendment. The Court was concerned therefore with only a few examples of arbitrary action and concentrated its discussion on the inherent potential for discriminatory and arbitrary administration. The Court held that the understanding clause violated the Fourteenth Amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">\u201cTo state it more plainly, the board has the right to reject one applicant and accept another, depending solely upon whether it likes or dislikes the understanding and explanation offered. To state it even more plainly, the board, by the use of the words \u2018understand and explain,\u2019 is given the arbitrary power to accept or reject any prospective elector that may apply, or, to use the language of Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 366, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 1069, 30 L.Ed. 220, these words \u2018actually do confer, not a discretion to be exercised upon a consideration of the circumstances of each case, but a naked and arbitrary power to give or withhold consent ***_\u00bb*#* <em>Such arbitrary power amounts to a denial of the equal protection of the law within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution </em>* * * \u201d 81 F.Supp. at 878.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The Court also held that both the legislative purpose and the administration of the test violated the Fifteenth Amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">\u201cIt, thus, clearly appears that [the Boswell] Amendment was intended to be, and is being used for the purpose of discriminating against applicants for the franchise on the basis of race or color. Therefore, we are necessarily brought to the conclusion that the Amendment to the Constitution of Alabama, <em>both in its object and the manner of its administration, is unconstitutional, because it violates the Fifteenth Amendment. While it is true that there is no mention of race or color in the Boswell Amendment, this does not save it.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">Referring to <em>Davis v. Schnell, in Las-siter v. Northampton Election Board </em>the Supreme Court has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-11\">\u201cIn <em>Davis v. Schnell </em>* * * the test was the citizen\u2019s ability to \u2018understand and explain\u2019 an article of the Federal Constitution. The legislative setting of that provision and the great discretion it vested in the registrar made clear that a literacy requirement was merely a device to make racial discrimination easy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-12\">The Fifth Circuit has recently applied the <em>Davis v. Schnell </em>rationale in an action by the United States under 42 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1971(c) against the Board of Registrars of Dallas County, Alabama. United States v. Atkins, 1963, 5 Cir., 323 F.2d 733. In that case the district court held that the prior Board had discriminated against Negroes, the current Board had not. Section 181 of the Alabama Constitution provides that the boards of registrars, in determining the qualifications of applicants, use a questionnaire so worded that the answers would give information necessary or proper to enable the boards to pass upon the qualifications of the applicants. The predecessor section to Section 181 was \u201cthe understand and explain\u201d clause struck down in <em>Davis v. Schnell. </em>There was \u201cno set standard for the \u2018grading\u2019 of questionnaires.\u201d The Court of Appeals held that \u201cthis is precisely the sort of practice condemned in <em>Davis v. Schnell\u201d </em>and granted an injunction against the current Board rejecting applicants for errors or omissions in the questionnaire until they presented to the court a \u201cdefinite set of standards\u201d which would meet the approval of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">The State of Louisiana itself, through its authorized legal advisory agency, the Louisiana Law Institute,<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> has questioned the constitutionality of the interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>test. Act 52 of the L.ouisiana legislature of 1946 directed the Louisiana Law Institute to prepare a draft or \u201cprojet of a Constitution for the State of Louisiana\u201d. In 1954 the work was completed and circulated by the State.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> After a thorough study of the law, the Institute concluded that if the provisions of the Louisiana Constitution establishing an understanding and interpretation test were attacked in court, \u201cCertainly if the same charges could be successfully made concerning the Louisiana provisions [as were made in <em>Davis v. Schnelt], </em>they would be unconstitutional.\u201d <footnotemark>86</footnotemark> The Reporter commented that \u201calthough discrimination in administration was found [in Davis v. Schnell], the lower court * * * declared the provision unconstitutional <em>on its face because it furnished no test or standard to control </em>administrative discretion\u201d. The Institute summarized its position as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-12\">\u201c1. The Institute in deleting these qualifications was influenced by the following considerations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-13\">a. The doubtful constitutionality of the present provisions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-14\">b. The arbitrary power they give to registrars of voters, since no objective criteria are provided; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-15\">c. The authority given the legislature under the Pro jet to require additional educational qualifications.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>In <em>Darby v. </em>Daniel, S.D.Miss.1958, 168 F.Supp. 170, a three-judge court (Circuit Judge Cameron and District Judges Mize and Clayton) distinguished the Boswell Amendment from a Mississippi provision requiring voters to \u201cunderstand * * * and give a reasonable interpretation\u201d of \u201cany section of the Constitution\u201d of Mississippi. The <em>Darby </em>Court found that, unlike the Boswell Amendment, the Mississippi understanding test did not grant arbitrary power and that there was no evidence of its having been used arbitrarily. In <em>Darby </em>the Court declared that it could find no legislative purpose to discriminate and no proof showing racial discrimination.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> Both are present in the instant case. But <em>Darby\u2019s </em>actual narrow holding was only that the plaintiff was not qualified and had not exhausted his state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">We cannot see any substantial difference between \u201cunderstand and explain\u201d (the Boswell Amendment) and \u201cunderstand * * * and give a reasonable interpretation\u201d. As pointed out earlier, the Mississippi understanding clause is the same test the Louisiana delegates to the Constitutional Convention of 1898 could not stomach, which was swallowed without gagging by the stronger-stomached delegates to the Convention of 1921.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> The dicta in <em>Darby v. Daniel </em>must yield to the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Davis v. Schnell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">If it may be said that <em>Trudeau v. Barnes, </em>5 Cir. 1933, 65 F.2d 563, upholds the validity of the Louisiana interpretation test, that decision is no longer the law, in the light of <em>Davis v. Schnell </em>and the more recent cases. The <em>Trudeau </em>court, in 1933, was unable to find that the interpretation test was adopted for the purpose of disfranchising the Negro. However, in <em>Trudeau </em>there were important circumstances, not present here, which the court was compelled to consider in reaching a decision. (1) The case was an action at law against the registrar for damages. (2) The case was decided on a motion to dismiss, so that the Court did not have the benefit of evidence of a discriminatory purpose and proof of the discriminatory effect of the interpretation test. (3) At the time the ease was decided, the law required the plaintiff to exhaust his administrative remedy. By express provision in the Civil Rights Act, it is no longer necessary for a plaintiff to exhaust state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">Each registrar in Louisiana is the sole judge of whether to apply the interpretation test or not to apply it and whether an applicant qualifies. The judgment is made without guidance, without standards, without limitations imposed by law; the judgment is necessarily subjective. Thus the right to vote depends more upon the caprice of the registrar than upon the possession of measurable qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">A year after the Convention of 1898 rejected the Mississippi understanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>clause, Thomas J. Kernan, an outstanding Louisiana lawyer and one of the delegates to the convention, pegged the understanding and interpretation test about as well as it could be pegged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">\u201cThe \u2018understanding clause\u2019 was objectionable for many reasons * *. The adoption of such a plan would have negatived the idea of a return to \u2018purer methods, wiser laws\u2019 in the matter of elections, which, in Louisiana, had grown to be a demand, second in importance only to that for the elimination of the negro from the electorate. <em>This \u2018understanding clause\u2019 fixes no standard of qualification for the franchise. </em>It is left to the discretion of the registration officer to select any one of the numerous articles of the Constitution as the test of the voter\u2019s \u2018understanding; \u2019 and <em>there are, therefore, as many different tests as there are articles in the Constitution. This arbitrary power, lodged with the registration officer, practically places his decision beyond the pale of judicial review; and he can enfranchise or disfranchise voters at his own sweet mil and pleasure without let or hindrance. </em>As long as registration officers are mere men, endowed with the same qualities only as their fellow mortals, it will always be unsafe to intrust them with such absolute power. The Convention, in my opinion, acted wisely in refusing to adopt the \u2018understanding clause,\u2019.\u201d Kernan, The Constitutional Convention of 1898 and Its Work, Proc. La.Bar Ass\u2019n for 1899, 54, 59.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-6\"> The orderly society our Constitution establishes does not permit one man to have uncontrolled power over his fellow citizens. When the State clothes a registrar with omnipotence in deciding the qualifications of voters, it has enacted \u201cnot a law, but an attempt to make the arbiter in such a case a law in himself.\u201d City of New Orleans v. Palmisano, 1920, 146 La. 518, 83 So. 789, 791. See also State v. Chisesi, 1937, 187 La. 675, 175 So. 453; City of New Orleans v. Levy, 1957, 233 La. 844, 98 So.2d 210; Banjavich v. Louisiana Licensing Bd. for Marine Divers, 1959, 237 La. 467, 111 So.2d 505. When a State constitution gives raw power to a registrar to grant, or to withhold registration as he sees fit, the constitution violates both the due process and the equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">Yick Wo v. Hopkins firmly established the principle that the unequal enforcement of a law will render the results of the enforcement void. In Yick Wo, convictions were overturned without a declaration that the ordinance itself was invalid, assuming possible nondiscriminatory enforcement. But the doctrine of nondiscriminatory enforcement of a lawr has never been limited to nullifying the effects of the law. Indeed, a Maryland case, extensively quoted in Yick Wo, concerned the invalidation of an ordinance granting unrestrained power to the city government to issue permits for boilers. Baltimore, etc. v. Radecke, 49 Md. 217. City of New Orleans v. Palmisano.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">In sum, some laws may never win constitutional approbation, because they have no rational relation to a legitimate governmental objective and because the unrestrained discretion without standards, they grant an officeholder makes them incurably subjective, unreasonable, and incapable of equal enforcement. The understanding and interpretation test is such a law.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> Although the vote-abridging purpose and effect of the test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>render it <em>per se </em>invalid under the Fifteenth Amendment, it is also <em>per se </em>invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment. The vices cannot be cured by an injunction enjoining its unfair application. The necessary relief, therefore, is to declare the test invalid and enjoin its enforcement in Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">We come now to consideration of the new citizenship test.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">By resolution of August 3, 1962, in compliance with Act 62 of 1962,<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> the State Board of Registration adopted a voter-qualification test, apparently tailored to fit this case should the interpretation test be held unconstitutional. The resolution and the statute do not, and could not, affect the constitutionality of the interpretation test. That test is still the law of the State; so there is no question of mootness. The new requirement rests on an understanding and interpretation of the Constitution of the United States as a whole. The statute requires the Board to prepare \u201can objective test of citizenship\u201d. The Board in its resolution of August third directed the registrars to use the new test, pointing out that Louisiana law prescribes as one of the qualifications for registration that the applicant \u201cshall be of good character, and shall understand the duties and obligations of citizenship under a republican form of government\u201d. This qualification has been in the Constitution, unimplemented, since 1898.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">The Board\u2019s \u201cInstructions to registrars\u201d require an applicant to draw one of ten cards. Each card has six multiple-choice questions, four of which the applicant must answer correctly. There are a total of forty-three different questions in various combinations. This test is considerably more difficult than the \u201ctests\u201d administered to white applicants in the past, in that it requires a comprehension of the theory of the American system of government and a knowledge of specific constitutional provisions.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> The sort of answers shown by the evidence to have been accepted in the past from white applicants would be unacceptable now under a fair administration of the test. Considering Louisiana\u2019s unhappy position as the State with the highest rate of illiteracy and the lowest percentage of citizens with a high school education, the citizenship test can be regarded as a step forward only by those in favor of a severely limited representative government of guardians elected by a small, elite electorate.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>It is no small constitutional problem to define \u201ca republican form of government\u201d and determine if the Board\u2019s new test measures fairly an applicant\u2019s understanding of the \u201cduties and obligations of citizenship under a republican form of government.\u201d The Supreme Court had trouble defining a \u201crepublican form of government\u201d, or so it seemed to say.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> We reserve judgment therefore on the constitutionality of the new examination. Although we need not pass on the constitutionality of the \u201ccitizenship test\u201d itself, we must consider the constitutional effect of this new action on those who have been discriminated against in the past. The object of this suit is not only to prevent future injustices but to rectify past injustices.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">In the twenty-one parishes which used the interpretation test, there are few Negroes registered. In all of the parishes this is a result of the policy of initially registering as many white persons and as few Negroes as possible. In some of the parishes it is also a result of past discrimination in purging the rolls of Negro but not white registrants, as a first step; and, as a second step, preventing the re-registration of Negroes (but not white applicants) by an arbitrary administration of the interpretation test. Moreover, we cannot overlook the inhibiting effect of discriminatory registration practices on Negroes everywhere in Louisiana who would otherwise have tried to register.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">A major change in the standards of voting qualifications is usually followed by a general re-registration of all voters. This practice prevents previously registered voters, who are unacceptable under the new standards, from remaining on the rolls while those with equal or superior qualifications are denied suffrage. Thus, complete re-registration was used in 1898 to wipe clean the rolls and prevent the re-registration of Negroes under the new standards. Similarly, when the qualifications were formally altered in 1921, the State required the re-registration of all voters. Except in the parishes with periodic registration, there has been no complete re-registration since the interpretation test was resurrected in the middle fifties. In no parish has there been re-registration since the introduction of the new test. Of course, general re-registration would in large measure destroy the continuing usefulness of the past discriminations designed to keep Negroes off of the registration rolls. Yet the new test, or any other procedure more demanding than those previously applied to the white applicants, will have the effect of perpetuating the differences created by the discriminatory practices of the past; most of the potential white voters are on the rolls but few if any of the potential Negro voters are on the rolls. As in <em>Gomillion v. Lightfoot </em>and <em>Lane v. Wilson, </em>the necessary effect of the new law, regardless of its fair facade, is built-in unconstitutional discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The cessation of prior discriminatory practices cannot justify the imposition of new and onerous requirements, theoretically applicable to all, but practically affecting primarily those who bore the brunt of previous discrimination. An appropriate remedy therefore should undo the results of past discrimination as well as prevent future inequality of treatment. A court of equity is not powerless to eradicate the effects of former discrimination. If it were, the State could seal into permanent existence the injustices of the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">A good example of the principle that the abolition of one variety of discrimination does not justify the imposition of another is <em>Lane v.' Wilson. </em>After the Supreme Court in <em>Guinn </em>struck the grandfather clause from the Oklahoma <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Constitution, Oklahoma required all qualified persons not registered at a time when that clause was in effect to register within twelve days or be permanently disenfranchised. Most of the eligible whites were already registered but most eligible Negroes were not. In declaring unconstitutional the second Oklahoma attempt to bar Negroes from the ballot box, the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-4\">\u201cExemption from this onerous provision was enjoyed by all who had registered in 1914. But this registration was held under the statute which was condemned in the Guinn case. Unfair discrimination was thus retained by automatically granting voting privileges for life to the white citizens whom the constitutional \u2018grandfather clause\u2019 had sheltered while subjecting colored citizens to a new burden.\u201d 307 U.S. 276, 59 S.Ct. 876, 83 L.Ed. 1281.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">In <em>Guinn </em>and <em>Lane </em>no past wrongdoing could be imputed to the State because denial of the suffrage to Negroes was legal before 1866 \u2014 the \u201cfreezing\u201d date. The instant case cries louder for relief because the citizenship tests freeze the results of past <em>illegal </em>practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Recently, in Mississippi, a sheriff, as an ex-officio poll tax collector, had instituted a new policy requiring that individuals paying the poll tax for the first time see him personally. He maintained two offices and was seldom at either office. Speaking for the Fifth Circuit, Judge Bootle, sitting by designation, declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxI\">\u201cThis new policy, while purporting to apply to Negroes and whites indiscriminately, actually operates to the disadvantage of Negroes on account of their race, as did the previous instruction. Substantially all of the 5,099 white persons of voting age who were liable to pay a poll tax have been permitted to do so while not one of the County\u2019s 6,483 Negroes of voting age has been listed as paying the tax. Obviously a blanket requirement that all persons who have never paid the poll tax before, that being a relatively small percentage of white people and all Negroes, who now desire to pay their poll tax for the first time must see the Sheriff personally operates unequally and discriminatorily against the Negroes. * * * Sheriff Do-gan\u2019s new instructions by necessary result re-creates and perpetuates the very discrimination which prevailed under his former instructions and practices.\u201d United States v. Dogan, 1963, 5 Cir. 314 F.2d 767.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">In United States v. Atkins, 1963, 5 Cir., 323 F.2d 733, the Court of Appeals for this Circuit, recently quoted Dogan with approval on freezing although it declined to apply the principle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">\u201cWe do not dispute the power of the federal courts to invoke the freezing principle to give relief when necessary. It has been used before in voting cases. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">Insofar as freezing is concerned, <em>Atkins </em>is distinguishable from the instant case on the facts and on the relief sought. In <em>Atkins, </em>the Court of Appeals noted that (1) it would be feasible to purge the registration lists in Dallas County of \u201cthose persons proved by the appellant to have been registered by a procedure which does not meet the minimal requirements of State law\u201d; (2) \u201c[t]he procedure of the Registrars which would have the greatest freezing effect was the practice of not allowing rejected applicants to reapply\u201d, a practice the district court has now eliminated; (3) \u201cother [discriminatory] practices soon will be eliminated\u201d ; (4) \u201cThe only remaining freezing effect could come as a result of differences of practices allowable within the zone of permissible interpretation of Alabama law\u201d, but \u201c[w]here * * * or how strictly the Board will interpret Alabama law, is yet to be determined\u201d. In <em>Atkins, </em>the United States asked the Court to order the Board of Registrars \u201cto register Negroes in the future who possess the qualifications required of whites during the period 1952-1960\u201d. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>The Court objected to making \"a permanent fixture in Dallas County\u201d of practices violative of state law. Here, as will be developed later in the opinion, the relief does not have such an effect and is restricted in its application. Moreover, <em>Atkins </em>was a \u201cpattern and practice\u201d case under Section 1971 in which the district court held that the current Board of Registrars had not discriminated against Negroes, a finding undisturbed by the Court of Appeals. Finally, in <em>Atkins, </em>the question was whether a Board of Registrars should be required to violate a <em>valid </em>state law in the future because predecessor boards of that county had violated the <em>same </em>law in the past; here, the issue as to the citizenship test is whether a state may raise the standards for registration by enacting a new law which has the inevitable effect of freezing discrimination under an <em>unconstitutional </em>prior law. <em>A fortiori, Lane v. Wilson </em>squarely covers the case before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">In United States v. Lynd, 5 Cir. 1962, 301 F.2d 818, cert. den\u2019d, 1963, 371 U.S. 893, 83 S.Ct. 187, 9 L.Ed.2d 125, the Court entered a temporary injunction, pending appeal, restraining a Registrar from</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">\u201c * * * failing or refusing to give to Negro applicants the same privileges as to reviewing their application forms at the time they are filled out and advising Negro applicants of such omissions as appear on their forms as they are now <em>or heretofore have given to white </em>applicants under similar circumstances * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">After this injunction pending appeal was issued, the Mississippi Legislature amended Section 3213 of the Mississippi Code to make mandatory the requirement that applicants fill out their application form without assistance. The amendment adds the requirement that no application can be approved or applicant registered unless all the blanks on the form are \u201cproperly and responsively\u201d filled out by the applicant. July 15,1963, the Court extended the injunction, pending further proceedings in the District Court, and held the defendant in civil contempt. The Court\u2019s two orders of July 15, 1963, restrained the defendant in precisely the same language as that quoted above. \u00bf</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">Again, in United States v. Penton, M.D.Ala.1962, 212 F.Supp. 193 the district court found that while prior to February 1961, the Board of Registrars of Montgomery County, Alabama, had not required perfection in completing the application form, as of that date \u201cthe Board raised the standard to require a perfect application.\u201d 212 F.Supp. at 197. During the earlier period the Board had used the application form \u201cas a tricky examination or test\u201d for Negroes only, and \u201c[i]f a Negro applicant failed to meet the standard required of him, he was denied registration regardless of whether the error or omission on the form was formal, technical, or inconsequential.\u201d White applicants, unlike Negroes, had been assisted in manifold ways. With respect to past and future Negro applicants, Judge Johnson applied \u201cstandards consistent with past practices.\u201d Id. at 200 of 212 F.Supp. <em>He enjoined the defendants \u201cfrom using </em>* * * <em>different and more stringent qualification requirements for registration </em>* * * <em>than </em>* * * <em>[those} used by the Board </em>* * <em>since at least January 1, 1956.\u201d </em>United States v. Penton, (M.D.Ala., 1962), 212 F.Supp. 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-12\">Ross v. Dyer, 5 Cir. 1962, 312 F.2d 191, presented an analogous situation. The Court had before it the brother-and-sister rule of the Houston public school system, a long-standing rule requiring a child to attend the school which his older siblings attended. The rule was one \u201cof long standing applied to white and Negroes alike\u201d. This Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-13\">\u201cOn the basis of the evidence which showed it to be a rule of long standing applied to white and Negroes alike, the District Judge in his memorandum opinion reasoned that \u2018the colored plaintiffs do not seek the same treatment as is afforded white <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>students, to which they are entitled; in fact, they seek a different, and superior, treatment, by reason of their race. The law does not grant them this.\u2019 But we think that logic alone is insufficient to overcome the practical effect of this rule which as to some Negro families perpetuates a segregated system despite the plain purpose of the stair-step plan to ameliorate it. That it applies equally to white and Negro overlooks the fact that as to one group, <em>compulsory attendance at certain schools has been the result of unconstitutional discrimination. The purpose of the court decree is to eradicate that unconstitutional deprivation of equal protection, no matter how felt or manifested.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">In insisting that registrars not apply now to Negroes a difficult test which was never applied to white registrants, there is no more compulsion of state officials to violate state law here than there was in <em>Yick Wo. </em>Enforcement of the citizenship test at this point would be just as discriminatory against Negroes as enforcement of the San Francisco licensing ordinance directed against Chinese laundrymen would have been in <em>Yick Wo. </em>The validity of the ordinance requiring a license for a laundry operated in a wooden building could be asserted only after a relicensing of all laundries on a nondiscriminatory basis. Allowing white laundrymen who had been favored in the past to remain licensed would have perpetuated the discrimination. Thus, although the application of the ordinance was enjoined, the ordinance itself was unconstitutional in the sense that its enforcement had the necessary effect of violating the constitution until the State revoked all outstanding licenses and thereafter issued new licenses nondis-criminatorily.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> So it is here.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">In short, the obligation of the State to abolish its system of racial discrimination in voting registration is not met simply by a process of applying new and higher standards to all future applicants. The new tests discriminate against Negroes of voting age by subjecting them to standards to which the registered applicants (most of whom are white) were not subjected. The promise of evenhanded justice in the future does not bind our hands in undoing past injustices.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">This brings us to the question of fashioning the necessary remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">The power of Congress to adopt Civil Rights measures for protection of the electoral process against debasement by discrimination is expressly granted in the Fifteenth and Fourteenth Amendments. It is no housekeeping power. The sweep of the \u201cappropriate legislation\u201d clause is no less than the sweep of the \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d clause. The protection of the right to vote, without regard to race, is important to the individual, but the Nation has the paramount interest in the integrity of the electoral process. These considerations argue against a grudging, narrow remedy. So that the will of Congress will be clear to the courts, Section 1971(e) expressly states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-10\">\u201cThis subsection shall in' no way be construed as a limitation upon the existing powers of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-13\">Thus, in addition to the specific remedy provided in the Civil Rights Act, courts retain an undiminished authority to grant suitable equitable relief that will both rectify past inequities now, without delay, and will prevent future inequities. See State of Alabama v. United States, 5 Cir. 1962, 304 F.2d 583, aff\u2019d 1962, 371 U.S. 37, 83 S.Ct. 145, 9 L.Ed.2d 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-14\">Remedies suited to past litigation are not appropriate here for several reasons. (1) It is impracticable, if not impossible, and in any event it would create hardships, generate endless litigation, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>dislocate registration offices, if a wholesale attempt were made to purge the rolls of white persons improperly registered. (2) It would be extremely difficult to establish who was unconstitutionally purged for failing to take the interpretation test. (3) It would be next to impossible to establish which qualified Negroes were rejected for failure to understand or interpret a constitutional provision to the satisfaction of the registrar, because in many parishes inadequate records are maintained by the registrars. (4) It is completely impossible to ascertain how many and which qualified Negroes were deterred from seeking registration, knowing that they had no chance of succeeding, since other qualified Negroes were kept off the rolls by the practice of racial discrimination. In many respects, the last factor is the most important:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ak_-dedup-0\">\u201cDiscrimination by a registrar is especially harmful because it is the most effective method for denying the right to vote: it denies the right to vote before an individual has the chance to exercise it, and it bars not \u25a0only the individual concerned from all elections but inhibits other qualified voters from running the guant-let of discriminatory and humiliating practices by a registrar and his deputies.\u201d United States v. Manning, W. D.La.1963, 215 F.Supp. 272, 288.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">A nondiscriminatory re-registration of all voters in the State would be the only completely fair and effective means of clearing away the effect of the interpretation test and of applying the new citizenship test. In a general registration the State could require any new, reasonable, non-discriminatory qualifications. However, this Court adheres to the principle that only to the extent \u25a0clearly necessary should federal courts interfere with established state and local procedures. Accordingly, <em>as to the \u25a0citizenship test, </em>we restrict our order to the twenty-one parishes in which the interpretation test was used and we cast our order so as to afford an option to the State. In any of the twenty-one parishes where the interpretation test was used, there need be no general re-registration. However, until there is a general re-registration of all voters in a parish where the test was used, or until the discriminatory effect of the test has been vitiated to the satisfaction of the court, we enjoin the use of the citizenship test. We narrow our order further, in the interest of equalizing the qualifications for registering, by restricting the injunction against the use of the citizenship test to the registration of those persons who were of voting age and who had the required residence in the parish pri- or to August 3, 1962; that is the period in which they were exposed to discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">This is a suit in equity. Its purpose is not to punish Louisiana for past activities. Such a purpose would be presumptuous on the part of the Court and offensive to principles of American federalism. Neither is it merely to prevent continued enforcement of unconstitutional provisions of Louisiana law. The prime purpose is to provide a remedy for a <em>federally </em>protected right by giving equitable relief: opening the rolls for those to whom the rolls were illegally closed, those who were directly discriminated against by rejection of their applications and those who were inhibited from attempting to register because of known humiliating discriminatory practices of registrars. Finally, we repeat that this decision does not touch upon the constitutionality of the citizenship test as a state qualification for voting. Our order forbids enforcement of the citizenship test until Negro applicants can be judged by the same standards used in qualifying those persons already registered. In that sense the court is cooperating with the State in laying a predicate for the fair application of a voting qualification which the State is now endeavoring to convert into an objective test with ascertainable, although unusually high, standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">We summarize our holding. The Court holds that the interpretation test is un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>constitutional because of its unlawful purpose, operation, and inescapably discriminatory effect. We enjoin its use in Louisiana, To make this decree effective and to exorcise past discrimination, the Court enjoins the use of the \u201ccitizenship test\u201d in the Parishes of Bienville, Claiborne, DeSoto, East Carroll, East Fel-iciana, Franklin, Jackson, LaSalle, Lincoln, Morehouse, Ouachita, Plaquemines, Rapides, Red River, Richland, St. Helena, Union, Webster, West Carroll, West Feli-ciana, and Winn as to all persons of voting age who had the requisite residence in the parish before August 3, 1962. These are parishes where the registrars used the interpretation test. We enjoin the use of the citizenship test in the named parishes until there has been a general re-registration of all voters in a named parish, or until it has been shown, to the satisfaction of the court, that the interpretation test has lost its discriminatory effect in the parish.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">This Court retains jurisdiction for the purpose of allowing the United States to prove and the State to disprove that the interpretation test was used in any of the forty-three parishes not named in the Court\u2019s decree, <em>and for other purposes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Formal findings of fact and conclusions of law will be entered at a later date.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b403-16\">.

In 1961, the test in Section 1(c) was deleted entirely as was the opening phrase of Section 1(d), which had made the latter section applicable only to illiterates.

The Civil Rights Commission has unanimously found, to the surprise of none, that the registration procedure is the principal means of disfranchising Negroes. 1961 Civil Rights Report 133-38. A leading authority writes: \u201cIn the South registration assumes special importance because of the peculiar regional suffrage qualifications. Registration authorities determine whether applicants meet literacy and understanding tests and thus have functioned as the principal governmental agency for Negro disfranchisement. * * * Commonly the statutes attempt to vest finality of decision in the local registration officials and make appeals from their decisions difficult.

See also McGovney, The American Suffrage Medley 61, 66-73 (1949) ; Price, The Negro Voter in the South 14-17 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\u201cApathy\u201d, an unctuous, self-excusing word comes trippingly to the tongue to rationalize the small Negro registration in some of the parishes in Louisiana. There are undoubtedly a number of reasons besides discrimination for the disparity between Negro and white registration. Thus, in a recent study the authors write: \u201cAbout 2S per cent of the voting age Negroes in the South were registered to vote in 1958, as compared to about 60 per cent of the voting age whites. It would be a gross error to attribute this substantial disparity to legal and political discrimination alone, though unquestionably official discrimination is a factor, for Southern Negroes overwhelmingly possess the historical heritage of low social status, relatively small incomes, and limited educations received in inferior schools. These attributes are associated with low voter turnout among <em>all </em>populations, regardless of skin color or region. Moreover, the low status, income and education of many southern whites foster racial prejudice. Thus poverty and ignorance may have a doublebarrelled effect on Negro political participation by decreasing the Negroes\u2019 motivation and ability to participate while increasing white resistance to their doing so. The low voting rates of Negroes in the South may result to a large extent from these factors, as well as from direct political or legal discrimination by the white community.\" Mathews and Prothro, Political Factors and Negro Voter Registration in the South, 57 Am. Pol.Sc.Rev. 355 (1963). See also Mathews &amp; Prothro, Social and Economic Factors and Negro Voter Registration in the South, 57 Am.Pol.Sc.Rev. 24, 39-14 (1963). But discriminatory registration laws and practices are the most potent weapons to keep Negro voting down. Price, The Negro and the Ballot in the South (1959); Brown, American Suffrage (1960); Mangum, The Legal Status of the Negro (1960). There was no apathy in the Negro electorate in 1897 when Negro registration equalled white registration in Louisiana. And it is a fair inference that Negro interest in voting, accelerated as it must have been by the civil rights explosion of recent years, is no less in 1963 than it was in 1897.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b411-12\">.

There were a number of organizations, some very loosely organized, which became White Leagues or were associated with <em>the </em>White League formed in New Orleans July 2, 1874. For example, there was The White Man\u2019s Club or Caucasian Club, organized in Franklin, in St. Mary\u2019s Parish by Judge Alcibiade De Blanc as early as 1867; leagues in Winn and Grant in July 1874; \u201cBulldoozers\u201d in East Feliciana, West Feliciana, East Baton Rouge, Morehouse, and Ouachita; the Innocents, most of whom were of Italian extraction. The White Leagues were especially strong in Southwest Louisiana, St. Landry, St. Martin, St. Mary, Lafayette, and New Iberia. The New Orleans White League was formed by the same men who had organized the Crescent City Democratic Club in 1868. This was a secret society composed of members of the Chalmette Club, a social club which merged with the Boston Club in 1873. The Crescent City White League, under General Fred N. Ogden, was organized into two regiments of infantry and one regiment of artillery; in the parishes the leagues were often only political clubs. Associated with the Crescent City White League was the First Louisiana Regiment, known as \u201cLouisiana\u2019s Own\u201d, a secret organization intended to serve as part of Governor McEnery\u2019s militia.

They are the only contemporaneous reports of the 1921 convention available, except for a few legal writings, because of the Convention\u2019s decision to hold secret, unreported meetings and discussions on suffrage.

In that cas\u00e9 we noted: \u201cThe sponsors of this legislation, in their public statements, if not in the Act itself, have spelled out its real purpose\u201d (197 F.Supp. 652).

Going to the next best records, newspapers, we find in the record of this case a mass of contemporary newspaper articles, filed by the plaintiffs and by amicus curiae, bearing on the legislative history of Act 2 and its related measures. Affidavits from the authors of the articles attest their accuracy. In all instances they are part of the official records.

Beginning April 15, 1956, the Citizens Council of Ouachita Parish challenged all 5,782 of the registered Negroes. Of these, all but 595 were stricken from the rolls. The Attorney General of Louisiana sent Mr. Shaw as a special representative to advise the Registrar of voters of Ouachita Parish. As of December 1962, Negro registration in Ouachita was up to 1,038. In Bienville Parish permanent registration was adopted after the purge. All persons who had registered since January 1, 1953, were put on the permanent rolls, except those who were purged. For the Negroes, nearly all of whom were purged, the interpretation test was a prerequisite to registration while for whites, nearly all of whom had registered before it, was not a prerequisite. Thus, as of October 1, 1955, there were 4,825 white persons registered to vote in Bien-ville Parish out of a white voting population which, according to the 1960 census, was 5,617.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">Some parishes required no special effort. For example, in East Carroll, Madison, Tensas, and West Feliciana, there were no registered Negroes and in Claiborne there were only a few on the rolls. In parishes such as Webster, Morehouse, Franklin, and West Carroll, where there was periodic registration, there was no need for a purge because the rolls were automatically cleared. Negro registration in Webster dropped from 1,776 to 83 in 1958. However, there were purges even in some parishes which had periodic registration, such as Lincoln, Bed Biver, and Richland Parishes. Negro registration in Bed Biver dropped from 1,360 to 16 in 1958.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"77\">\n<p id=\"b429-9\">. These parishes are: Bienville, Claiborne, DeSoto, East Carroll, East Feliciana, Franklin, Jackson, LaSalle, Lincoln, Morehouse, Ouachita, Plaquemines, Rapides, Red River, Richland, St. Helena, Union, Webster, West Carroll, West Feliciana, and Winn. The Director of the State Board of Registration testified that certain other parishes use the test but he had no personal knowledge of this. He said also that Caddo Parish uses the test; the parties however have agreed that Caddo does not use it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"78\">\n<p id=\"b429-17\">. The depositions were taken of twenty-registrars and former registrars who used the interpretation test. The earliest use of the test by any of these registrars was in November 1955. The former registrar of Plaquemines Parish testified that he started using the test late in 1954.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"79\">\n<p id=\"b430-6\">. Thus, in Red River Parish very few Negroes have applied since 1956, although there were 1,362 Negroes registered before tlie purge.

LSA-R.S. 24:201 (1950). See Smith, Role of Louisiana Law Institute, 16 La.L.Rev. 691 (1956); Tucker, The Louisiana Law Institute, 1 La.L.Rev. 139 (1938).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"85\">\n<p id=\"b437-6\">. In 1956 the voters rejected a constitutional convention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"86\">\n<p id=\"b437-7\">. The Institute\u2019s comments on Davis v. Sclmell are:</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">\u201cIt is clear that the constitutionality of the provisions listed above is now questionable. It is impossible to predict exactly what the supreme court may require in the future to strike down the \u2018understanding\u2019 and similar clauses. <em>In the Schnell case it was shown (1) that the purpose m adopting the amendment was to disfranchise the Negroes </em>and (2) <em>that, in fact, the amendment was administered in such a way as to disfranchise the Negroes. </em>[Emphasis added.] Certainly if the same charges could be successfully made concerning the Louisiana provisions, they would be unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">\u201cIt also seems likely that the court would find a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment if only discriminatory administration were proved. [Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 6 S.Ct. 1064 [30 L.Ed. 220] (1886); William [Williams] v. Mississippi, 170 U.S. 213, 18 S.Ct. 583 [42 L.Ed. 1012] (1898); and Trudeau v. Barnes, [5 Cir.] 65 F.(2d 563 (1933)]. Discrimination as to race or color in administration, together with disfranchisement of the Negro as the original purpose of a constitutional provision, would seem to be contrary to the Fifteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-17\">\u201c\u25a0Whether constitutional provisions of this character could now stand, even though there is no showing of malicious purpose in adoption or discrimination in administration, is subject to question. In two previous cases involving such \u2018understanding\u2019 clauses, one concerning the Mississippi constitutional provision [Williams v. Mississippi, 170 U.S. 213, 18 S. Ct. 583 [42 L.Ed. 1012] (1898) ] and the other involving the Louisiana constitutional provision [Trudeau v. Barnes, [5 Cir.] 65 F.(2d) 563 (1933)], the court held that the constitutional provisions standing alone without proof of discrimination in administration were not unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, in the <em>Schnell </em>case, although discrimination in administration was found, the lower court did not base its conclusion upon this; <em>rather, it declared the provision unconstitutional on its face because it furnished no test or standard to control administrative discretion. </em>Thus, it may be that now such provisions will be held unconstitutional in themselves regardless of whether or not discriminatory administration is found.\u201d 3 Projet of a Constitution for the State of Louisiana 40, 41 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-19\">In addition to deleting the interpretation test, the Projet also omits the requirements of (1) filling out the registration application form, (2) the good character clause, and (3) the clause requiring one to understand the duties and obligations of citizenship.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"87\">\n<p id=\"b438-6\">. In <em>Darby </em>the court relied strongly on Williams v. Mississippi, 1898, 170 U.S. 213, 18 S.Ct. 583, 42 L.Ed. 1012. That case did not involve a direct attack on the standards for registration. <em>Williams </em>was a murder case; the suffrage issue was collateral. The record in <em>Williams, </em>as in <em>Trudeau, </em>showed no proof of a discriminatory purpose and no discriminatory use of the test. Moreover, the relief sought was registration under the \u201cunderstanding\u201d standards rather than invalidation of them. See Comment, 72 Tale L.Jour. 770 (1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"88\">\n<p id=\"b438-7\">. The delegates to the Constitutional Convention of 1921 fully understood that the Convention had adopted the Mississippi understanding clause. Thus, Frank J.

This Three Judge Court originally had before it only the question of the constitutionality of Louisiana\u2019s constitutional interpretation test, LSA-Const. of 1921, Art. VIII, Sec. 1(d) and LSA-R.S. Title 18, See. 35, as used to determine voter qualifications. After this matter had been briefed and submitted, the Government suddenly injected another issue, i. e., the question of the constitutionality of Louisiana\u2019s new citizenship test, LSA-R.S. 18:191, as amended by Act 62 of 1962, as a State qualification for voting. I objected to the Court\u2019s considering the question of the constitutionality of the new citizenship test on the grounds that no \u201ccase or controversy\u201d had arisen thereunder, and that therefore, the question of its constitutionality was not properly before the Court at this time. However, the majority of the Court decided otherwise, and has now held that the constitutional interpretation test, as provided for in Art. VIII, Sec. 1(d) of the La.Const., and in LSA-R.S. Title 18, Sec. 35, is <em>\u201cper se </em>invalid under the Fifteenth Amendment\u201d, and that \u201cit is also <em>per se </em>invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d. The majority further holds that \u201c[t]he vices cannot be cured by an injunction enjoining its unfair application\u201d. As to the lately injected issue concerning the constitutionality of the citizenship test, the majority specifically state that \u201c[T]his decision does not touch upon the constitutionality of the citizenship test as a state qualification for voting\u201d, but then proceed to forbid the enforcement or use of that test until the State \u201csatisfies this Court\u201d that what it considers \u201cerrors of the past\u201d have been corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">The majority opinion, including footnotes, comprises some 93 mimeographed pages, most of which is completely immaterial to a decision of this case. When the majority of the Court finds that the constitutional interpretation test is <em>\u201cper se </em>invalid\u201d, there is, of course, no reason to delve into the past history and usage of the test. For an act to be <em>\u201cper </em>se\u201d invalid, it must be invalid in itself; it must be invalid when taken alone; it must be inherently invalid; and it must be invalid in itself without reference to other matters. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, Fourth Edition. Consequently, if the act is, as the majority holds, invalid <em>per se, </em>then it must be invalid on its face, and in itself, and thus the question of the method of its administration is wholly immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>That the constitutional interpretation test used by Louisiana is not, however, \u201cper se invalid\u201d becomes quite clear when viewed in light of prior holdings of the United States Supreme Court. It is sometimes difficult to decide whether to rely on the law as the Supreme Court interpreted it a few years ago, or to rely on it as interpreted last week, or to speculate on how they might interpret it tomorrow. However, in this instance, relative to a citizen\u2019s right of suffrage, I prefer to believe the law to be as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court on many occasions in the past. In rejecting the proposition that the Fourteenth Amendment added the right to vote to the privileges and immunities of citizenship, the Supreme Court, in Minor v. Happersett, 21 Wall. 162, 177, 88 U.S. 162, 177, 22 L.Ed. 627, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-4\">\u201cCertainly, if the Courts can consider any question settled, this one is. For nearly 90 years the people have acted upon the idea that the Constitution, when it conferred citizenship, did not necessarily confer the right of suffrage. If uniform practice, long continued, can settle the construction of so important an instrument as the Constitution of the United States confessedly is, most certainly it has been done here. Our province is to decide what the law is, not to declare what it should be.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Then, in United States v. Reese, 92 U.S. 214, 23 L.Ed. 563, 564, in disposing of the argument that the right to vote was conferred by the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">\u201cThe Fifteenth Amendment does not confer the right of suffrage upon anyone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">And then, in McPherson v. Blacker, 146 U.S. 1, 39, 13 S.Ct. 3, 36 L.Ed. 869, the United States Supreme Court once more recognized the fact that it was within the province of the State, and not the Federal Government, to determine voter qualifications. In the course of its opinion, it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-9\">\u201cThe right to vote intended to be protected refers to the right to vote as established by the laws and constitution of the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">In a long line of unbroken jurisprudence beginning in 1874, the United States Supreme Court has consistently recognized that the privilege of voting is conferred upon citizens by the States, and that the United States Constitution does not confer upon anyone the privilege of suffrage. In Pope v. Williams, 193 U.S. 621, 632, 24 S.Ct. 573, 575, 48 L.Ed. 817, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-11\">\u201cThe privilege to vote in any State is not given by the Federal Constitution, or by any of its amendments. It is not a privilege springing from citizenship of the United States. * * * It may not be refused on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude, but it does not follow from mere citizenship of the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-14\">Therefore, insofar as the majority opinion seems to indicate that somehow, the right to vote is guaranteed by the United States Constitution, I respectfully suggest that the majority is in error. In view of the fact that the privilege of voting emanates entirely from the States, and not from the Federal Government, and in view of the fact that the judicial function is properly exercised only by indicating whether or not the State has transcended provisions of the Federal Constitution, it follows, just as the night follows the day, that the role of the Federal Court is not to direct the State in the procedures to be used in registering voters. The Supreme Court has held that the \u201cconditions under which the right of suffrage may be exercised\u201d lies with the States. Lassiter v. Northampton Board of Elections, 360 U.S. 45, 50, 79 S.Ct. 985, 989, 3 L.Ed.2d 1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-15\">The majority opinion is so lengthy, and involves so many extra-judicial dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>courses, that it is rather difficult to determine whether it holds that the State constitutional provision and the State Statute establishing the constitutional interpretation test are unconstitutional in themselves, or whether it holds merely that these State laws have been unconstitutionally administered. I must conclude, however, that the majority intended to hold, as they stated near the close of their opinion, that the constitutional interpretation test is <em>\u201cper se </em>invalid under the Fifteenth Amendment, and it is also <em>per se </em>invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d of the United States Constitution. This being the case, the prior history of voting requirements in Louisiana, as discussed at great length in the majority opinion, is completely immaterial. If these laws are invalid <em>per se, </em>then it matters not how they were administered. No method of administration could validate a law which is invalid <em>per se. </em>If, however, the majority intended to hold, contrary to their specific statement concerning invalidity <em>per se, </em>that the test is unconstitutional because of improper application, then, in view of their ultimate order in connection with the State\u2019s use of the new citizenship test, it is difficult to understand why they did not merely enjoin the improper application of the constitutional interpretation test in the twenty-one Parishes where they found that it had been improperly applied. As will later be noted, they had no hesitancy in dividing the State into sections and holding that the new citizenship test may be applied in some Parishes of the State while it may not be applied in other Parishes. In line with this reasoning, if the constitutional interpretation test is bad only because of its improper use, then the improper use should have been enjoined only in the twenty-one Parishes where it had been improperly applied, and the remaining Parishes of the State should not have been interfered with in their use of that test. If, as stated by the majority, they actually found that the constitutional interpretation test was \u201cinvalid per se\u201d, they need only to have said so, and then, the application thereof becomes completely irrelevant because as heretofore pointed out, there is no way that an unconstitutional statute may be constitutionally applied. On the other hand, if the statute itself is per se constitutional, then I cannot agree that the \u201cvices cannot be cured by an injunction enjoining its unfair application\u201d. I believe that a Court should be most reluctant to declare unconstitutional the statutes and constitutional provisions of a State, and should do so only when the statute and/or the constitutional provision involved is clearly in contravention of the United States Constitution. In Cummings v. Merchants National Bank, 101 U.S. 153, 25 L.Ed. 903, the United States Supreme Court held that a law is not to be held unconstitutional merely because of unfaithful administration. It held that a statute, valid as to one set of facts, may be invalid as to another. That is, its application may be valid or its appli\u25a0cation may be invalid, notwithstanding the constitutionality of the statute itself. In Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v. Anderson, 233 U.S. 325, 34 S.Ct. 599, 53 L.Ed. 983, the Supreme Court considered and strongly rejected the contention that to hold that a statute has been unconstitutionally applied under one specific set of facts is tantamount to holding that the statute itself is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">I must therefore respectfully disagree with both the findings and the conclusions of the majority insofar as the validity of the constitutional interpretation test as used in the State of Louisiana is concerned. While it may well be that there have been many instances of improper applications of that test, nevertheless, such improper applications do not, in my opinion, render the laws themselves unconstitutional. If, as I believe to be the case, the constitutional interpretation test is not unconstitutional per se, then only the improper application of the test should have been enjoined. I prefer to believe that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Supreme Court of the United States meant what it said in the cases which I have cited, and in the many, many other cases that might have been cited to the same effect, namely, that the right remains with the States to decide and declare the requirements for voter registration.. I prefer to believe that the function of the Court is merely to decide, in each specific case, whether or not the State has transcended the prohibitions contained in the United States Constitution, and if such is found to be the case, to order, by injunction, if necessary, the termination of such discriminatory practices. I do not believe that it is a proper function of the Court to establish by decree the qualification requirements of voters in the State of Louisiana. That, in my opinion, is precisely what the majority of the Court in this case does.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">After concluding that the constitutional interpretation test is \u201cinvalid per se\u201d, the majority then proceed to a consideration of the validity of the new citizenship test, despite the fact that there were no allegations, nor could there be, that the citizenship test was either unconstitutional or improperly applied. Indeed, the majority specifically states that it does not \u201ctouch upon the constitutionality of the citizenship test as a state qualification for voting\u201d, but then proceeds to prohibit its use in twenty-one Parishes in the State of Louisiana. It is too elementary to require citation of authority that a statute properly passed by a State Legislature is presumed to be constitutional until such time as it is found to be unconstitutional. This Court has not found the citizenship test to be unconstitutional, and thus, it must, of course, be presumed to be constitutional. If the test is, in fact, constitutional, as it must be considered to be in light of the Court\u2019s failure to find it unconstitutional, then, it is a complete mystery to me where the Court finds its authority to enjoin its use. If the majority has found that the constitutional interpretation test is unconstitutional because of its improper use, a conclusion with which I strenuously disagree, then by the same token, I suppose, they could have found that the citizenship test is unconstitutional because of improper use. However, the Court does not find that the citizenship test has been improperly used, and in fact, they have not found it to be unconstitutional in any way whatsoever. Nevertheless, in spite of this fact, the majority takes the position that the use of this new test in the twenty-one Parishes where they considered the constitutional interpretation test to have been improperly applied, would result in continued discrimination unless all voters were purged from the rolls and a complete new re-registration of all voters, using the new citizenship test, were accomplished. The majority decrees that the new citizenship test may not be used \u201cuntil the discriminatory effect of the test has been vitiated to the satisfaction of the court\u201d. In other words, it would seem that in order to comply with this order, the new citizenship test, even though constitutional in every respect, may not be used until the case of every single voter on the rolls in tweny-one Parishes has been submitted to the Court for a determination of whether or not each individual voter has been properly registered to vote, without discrimination. I simply cannot agree that this is a function properly within the ambit of the authority of this Court. Anyone has a right to claim discrimination, and when discrimination has been claimed, he has a right to his day in court. But until such a case or controversy has been presented, the Court simply has no right to intervene. The majority opinion states: \u201cThe ordered society our Constitution establishes does not permit one man to have uncontrolled power over his fellow citizens. When the State clothes a registrar with omnipotence in deciding the qualifications of voters, it has enacted \u2018not a law, but an attempt to make the arbiter in such a case the law in himself.\u2019 \u201d The majority opinion would merely refuse to allow the registrar to be \u201ca law in him<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>self\u201d, and substitute, in his stead, this Court. This opinion can have no other effect than the taking over by this Court \u25a0of the functions of the State when it \u25a0comes to determining the qualifications required for voter privileges. The majority opinion further states: \u201c[T]his Court \u25a0adheres to the principle that only to the extent clearly necessary should federal courts interfere with established state and local procedures.\u201d I can only say that if the majority means what it says in \u2022this statement, it must surely have failed fo read its own opinion. The majority opinion says, in effect, that whenever a State wishes to alter or improve its voting requirements, it may do so only if it has a complete re-registration of everyone on the rolls throughout the entire State. This proposition has been rejected by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in \u25a0United States v. Atkins, et al., 323 F.2d 733 (1963). The majority opinion attempts to distinguish the present case from the Atkins case, but in my opinion fails completely to do so. The Atkins \u2022case specifically rejects the proposition that a State may not alter its voting requirements without re-registering all voters in the State. They try to distinguish Atkins on the grounds that in that case the question was whether a Board of Registrars should be required to violate a <em>valid </em>State law in the future because a predecessor board of that county had violated the <em>same law </em>in the past. They then go on to say that the difference between that case and the present case is that the issue here is whether a State may raise the standards for registration by enacting a new law which has the necessary, inescapable effect of freezing discrimination under an <em>unconstitutional </em>prior law. \u2018They fail to recognize the fact that the law establishing the constitutional interpretation test used by the State of Louisiana and under which the majority now holds there were instances of discrimination, was not an \u201cunconstitutional law\u201d \u25a0until this present decision was handed down. The very same law had been specifically held to be constitutional in the case of Trudeau v. Barnes, 65 F.2d 563 (C.A.5 1933). All action by the State of Louisiana taken pursuant to that law was, prior to the filing of this decision, taken pursuant to a statute which the Federal Court, Fifth Circuit, had specifically held to be constitutional. In the Trudeau case the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">\u201cIt is at once apparent that the clause of the State Constitution which is under attack applies to all voters alike, denies to none of them the equal protection of the laws, does not undertake to deny or abridge the right of citizens of the United States to vote on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. It is difficult to conceive how this clause can be said to violate either the Fourteenth or the Fifteenth Amendment. It lays down but one test, that of intelligence, which applies uniformly and without discrimination to voters of every race and color. * * * The Louisiana Constitution protects every citizen who desires to register from being arbitrarily denied that right by the registrar of voters by giving the applicant a right to apply without delay and without expense to himself to the trial court for relief, to submit his qualifications to vote to a jury, and to have them finally passed upon by an appellate court. It is idle to say that the defendant as registrar had the arbitrary power to deny plaintiff the right to vote. We cannot say, and refuse to assume, that, if the plaintiff had pursued the administrative remedy that was open to him, he would not have received any relief to which he was entitled. * * * \u00bb&gt;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Consequently, the distinction attempted to be drawn by the majority to distinguish the Atkins case is simply not valid. The effect of the majority order in this case, that the State of Louisiana may not use the new citizenship test in the twenty-one Parishes involved, is to order the State to violate an existing, valid law un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>til this Court tells them that they need no longer violate it. The citizenship test, as of now, is valid and has not been held invalid by any court, including this one. Therefore, for this Court now to order the State to refrain from using that test is to order them to violate a valid existing law of the State of Louisiana. In my judgment, the opinion of the majority in this case is just another example of the \u201cpersonal decreeing\u201d so bitterly criticized by Judge Hutcheson in his dissenting opinion in Lee v. United States of America, (1963), 5 Cir., 322 F.2d 770. I concur completely with the remarks of Judge Hutcheson contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">In brief, I cannot sanction the take over by this Court of the functions of the State whereby this Court attempts to establish, and administer, as well as to adjudicate the State laws relative to voter registration. I believe that this Court should confine its activities to the judicial determination of cases and controversies as obviously contemplated by the limited jurisdictional grant contained in the United States Constitution</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">I can do no more than to concur with Judge Bell\u2019s dissent in Davis v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County, 322 F.2d 356, 362 (C.A.5 1963), when he said: \u201cTherefore, I must dissent * * with the admonition that more constitutional rights will be lost than gained in the long run by departure from procedures which have stood the test of time, and which are a part of due process of law as we have heretofore known it,\u201d and to concur with Judge Cameron\u2019s dissent in Sharp v. Lucky, 252 F.2d 910, 924 (C.A.5 1958), wherein he said: \u201cThis sad epoch in our history [post Civil War] was fomented in no small part, by well-intentioned men in too much of a hurry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">I must, for these reasons, respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
