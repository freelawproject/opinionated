In an action for personal injuries sustained by the plaintiff as the result of his falling into a coal hole in the sidewalk in front of the defendant\u2019s building, where the evidence tended as much to show joint use of the cellar under the coal hole by two of the defendant\u2019s tenants as to show joint use by her and one of her tenants, an instruction that \u201cwhere there is an opening through a public sidewalk into a cellar underneath, and that such cellar is used in common by two or more persons who are tenants or occupants of the land or buildings adjacent thereto, then it becomes the duty of the owner of such land or buildings to use reasonable care to keep and maintain the said opening and its cover in reasonably safe condition for persons traveling upon the highway,\u201d held erroneous as the verdict, which was returned in favor of the plaintiff, may have been based on the assumption of liability on the part of the defendant although she retained no control over the cellar in question.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b291-14\" pgmap=\"291\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
