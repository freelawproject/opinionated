Divorce, \u00a7 11<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when desertion is a valid ground. Desertion, in order to be a valid ground for divorce, must not only be wilful and without reasonable cause in the beginning but must continue so for the period of at least two years.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b518-7\" pgmap=\"518\">2. Divorce, \u00a7 9*\u2014what does not constitute desertion. Living separate and apart by consent or by agreement will not constitute wilful desertion or entitle either party to a divorce on that ground.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b518-8\" pgmap=\"518\">3. Divorce, \u00a7 48*\u2014when evidence shows that desertion was not wilful. On a bill for divorce filed by a husband, based on desertion of the wife, the latter having filed a cross-bill for separate maintenance, where it appeared that five days after the wife left the husband, the parties entered into a contract in writing whereby the wife was to receive in lieu of all dower, homestead and other rights, arising from a marriage relation, all the household goods belonging to the parties and $3,000, held that the making of the contract, so soon after the separation, and in view of a recital therein that it was made because of such' separation and in contemplation of its continuance, amounted to such a consent to and an agreement for a separation as to deprive the living apart of the element of wilful desertion on the part of either of the parties.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b518-9\" pgmap=\"518\">' 4.
