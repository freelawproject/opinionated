Negligence, \u00a7 119<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014how declaration charging should he drawn. In drawing a declaration charging negligence, it is not necessary, even if it is proper, to allege alone a duty on the part of defendant to do certain things, but facts must be alleged from which the law will raise a presumption of such duty.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b574-14\" pgmap=\"574(81) 575(129)\">2. Master and servant, \u00a7 538*\u2014when declaration sufficiently alleges duty on part of master to provide safe place. In an action for personal injuries sustained by a workman employed in the erection of a building, whose duty it was, while standing on a platform beside a chute for concrete, to accelerate the movement of the concrete, and who, having stepped into the chute for such purpose and finding that the chute was beginning to sag because of its weight, got out on the platform beside the chute and was knocked down by it as the chute fell, a declaration which alleged that the plaintiff was employed by the defendant, that the chute was dangerous and unsafe, that employees were required to work in the chute, that the chute frequently got clogged so that employees Yvould have to get into it to accelerate the movement of the concrete, that such condition was known or could have been known to the defendant by the exercise of proper diligence and that, while the plaintiff was in the chute moving the concrete, it gave way by reason of its being unsafe, held sufficient to show an obligation on the part of the defendant to make the chute safe.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b574-15\" pgmap=\"574\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols, XI to XV, and Cumulative Quarterly, same topic and section number*</p> </footnote> <footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b575-12\" pgmap=\"575\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.

Pbesiding Justice Higbee</author> <p id=\"AWrk\" pgmap=\"574\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <headnotes id=\"b575-5\" pgmap=\"575\">3. Master and servant, \u00a7 137<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when doctrine of safe place to work is applicable. In an action for personal injuries sustained by an employee in the erection of a building, whose duty it was, while standing on a platform beside a chute for concrete, to accelerate the movement of the concrete, and who, having stepped into the chute for such purpose and finding that it was beginning to sag because of its weight, got out upon a platform and was knocked down by the chute as it fell, held that the rule making it the duty-of a master to furnish the servant with a safe place to work applied.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b575-6\" pgmap=\"575\">4. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, \u00a7 2*-\u2014when question of duty of master to furnish servant with safe place to work is immai\u00e9rial. In an action for personal injuries by a servant against his master, who has failed to come under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, the question whether it was the duty of the master to furnish the servant with a safe place to work was immaterial, since he is precluded from taking advantage of the defense of assumed risk and contributory negligence.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b575-8\" pgmap=\"575\">5. Master and servant, \u00a7 770*\u2014when refusal to direct verdict for plaintiff in action for personal injuries is proper. In an action for personal injuries sustained by a workman employed in the erection of a building, whose duty it was, while standing on a platform by a chute for concrete, to accelerate the movement of the concrete, and who, having stepped into the chute for such purpose and finding that it was beginning to sag because of its weight, got out on the platform and was knocked down by the chute as it fell, held that the trial court did not err in refusing to direct a verdict for the defendant, and that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the verdict.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b575-11\" pgmap=\"575(56) 576(113)\">6. Trial, \u00a7 276*\u2014when interrogatory is properly refused as inapplicable. In an action for personal injuries by a workman employed in the erection of a building, whose duty it was, while standing on a platform beside a chute for concrete, to accelerate the movement of the concrete, and who, having stepped into the chute for such purpose and finding that it was beginning to sag because of its weight, got out upon a platform and was knocked down by the chute as it fell, held that a special proposed interrogatory reading, \u201cWas the work upon which defendant was engaged at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s alleged injury a work of construction of a building or other structure, which was undergoing changes and passing successive temporary conditions which, from the very nature of construction were dangerous? \u201d was properly refused, as, on the facts, the case was not one where the rule requiring the master to furnish the servant a safe place to work did not apply.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b576-4\" pgmap=\"576\">7. Trial, \u00a7 276<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when special interrogatory calling for answers as to evidentiary facts is properly refused. It is not erroneous to refuse a special interrogatory calling for answers as to evidentiary facts only, instead of ultimate facts.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b576-5\" pgmap=\"576\">8. Instructions, \u00a7 126*\u2014when properly refused as abstract. The refusal to give instructions stating abstract propositions of law is not erroneous.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b576-6\" pgmap=\"576\">9. Damages, \u00a7 132*\u2014when verdict for damages for personal injuries is not excessive. A verdict of four hundred dollars awarded a laborer, engaged in the construction of a building, for injuries, consisting of a sprained wrist and a cut on his leg below the knee several inches long, held not so excessive \u00e1s to warrant the reversal of a judgment in his favor.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
