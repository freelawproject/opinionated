Defendant\u2019s husband testified that he and defendant resided in Chicago; that Manie B. Ayres lived with them; that he was a practicing attorney and represented said Manie B. Ayres in certain business transactions; that in 1901 defendant moved to New York where she was to be joined by him and that he was in need of funds and wrote the defendant to execute certain notes and send them to him so that he could have them discounted and obtain the necessary funds; that the defendant executed the notes as requested, including the one in suit, and mailed them to him; that upon receipt of them he placed the note in question in a safe deposit box in Chicago where he kept other papers; that Manie B. Ayres also had a safe deposit box with the same company; that she requested him to permit her to put some of her papers in his box, stating that the one she had was too small; that the request was granted and Manie B. Ayres was given access to his box; that afterwards he removed some of the papers from the box; that he did not recall anything further about the note until about the time of the institution of this suit, October 7, 1907; that he never delivered the note to Manie B. Ayres nor to any other person nor authorized any one else to do so. The evidence tends to show that Manie B. Ayres died intestate October 3, 1902, and letters of administration were issued by the County Court of Coles county, Illinois, October 6, 1902, to James F. Bell; that the note in question was found by the administrator among the ejects of Mrs. Ayres in her safe deposit box in Chicago, and was inventoried in her estate as \u201cbad\u201d; that the administrator, after investigation, doubted the advisability of bringing suit thereon on account of the then financial condition of the defendant, and on January 9, 1905, the County Court of Coles county ordered the note filed; that it was later ordered to be turned over to Iona Bourne Bell as heir of said Manie B. Ayres. Subsequently, the administrator and his wife, Iona-Bourne Bell, moved to Chicago, and the note in suit was given by the latter to the plaintiff in payment of legal services rendered.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b212-6\" pgmap=\"212\">Frank 1ST.
