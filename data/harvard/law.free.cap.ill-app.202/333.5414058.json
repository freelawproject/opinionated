The difference between $502.23, the amount of the guaranty mentioned in the writing signed by the defendant and $155.27, the net amount received by the plaintiff, is the amount for which the judgment was entered, that is $346.96.</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-4\" pgmap=\"361\">On October 1,1913, almost three years after the date of the contract, the defendant wrote to the plaintiff the following letter, in part, as follows:</p><p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-5\" pgmap=\"361\">\u201cIn our prosecution of the claims you have submitted for our service under a certain printed form of contract, we find that we will not be able to realize the full amount stipulated on the claims filed to date. This is due to the fact that some of the claims filed with us were against persons who were not to be found at nor traced from the addresses given us; others outlawed or discharged in bankruptcy.</p><p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-6\" pgmap=\"361\">\u201cWe, therefore, inform you of our election to continue to give you our services as collectors beyond the three year period mentioned in the contract, and in accordance with its terms our service will be employed in your behalf, without additional costs except commissions on moneys collected for you. * * *\u201d</p><p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-7\" pgmap=\"361\">The writings above set forth and the admissions as to the amounts paid and received, and a written statement of the claims, constitute all the evidence in the case. The record, however, showed that the defendant offered to prove that a report was made to the plaintiff that the correct addresses of five of the debtors, against whom were claims aggregating $1,557.84, could not be found.</p><attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b361-8\" pgmap=\"361\">Delavan B.
