Martin, complainants, against Julius Heidenreich, Ida M. Heidenreich and Michael Zimmer, sheriff of Cook county, defendants, in the Superior Court of Cook county, to reach a master\u2019s certificate of sale in foreclosure proceedings, alleged to have been transferred by defendant Julius Heidenreich, a judgment debtor of complainants, to defendant Ida Heidenreich, in fraud of plaintiffs; cross-bill by defendant Zimmer, as sheriff of Cook county, in the nature of interpleader, against complainants lies and Martin, and defendants Heidenreich, to determine the title to a fund in his hands as sheriff, being money paid to him in redemption of the certificate in question. This case was consolidated with cases No. 21,708, 201 Ill. App. 619, and 21,709, ante, p. 1, which were appeals by Ida Heidenreich from a decree on an amended creditor\u2019s bill and a separate decree on a cross and supplemental bill of interpleader, respectively. To reverse a decree on the bill setting aside the transfer of the certificate, and a separate decree on the cross-bill, granting the inter-pleader and ordering the fund paid to the clerk, and that cross complainant be discharged from further liability, defendant Julius Heidenreich prosecutes a single writ of error.</p><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b31-5\" pgmap=\"31\">Farlan H.
