Appeal and ebkob\u2014when review of final decree not authorized on assignments of error. Where the Appellate Court dismisses an appeal from an order in a chancery cause on the ground that it was premature, the order appealed from not being final, the assignments of error filed on such dismissed appeal, when refiled on appeal from a final decree in the same cause, cannot be treated as bringing the final decree before the Appellate Court for review, since such assignments relate to proceedings anterior to such final decree.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b78-14\" pgmap=\"78(44) 79(58)\">2.

On appeal by a complainant from a final decree dismissing the bill as to several defendants, and entering a decree against only one defendant, a writ of error not bringing all the defendants before the Appellate Court must be dismissed, since the writ must agree with the record, and in order to bring the decree up for review, all living defendants in the original suit must join, so that the whole case may be disposed of and that the record may agree with the record below.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b78-15\" pgmap=\"78\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
