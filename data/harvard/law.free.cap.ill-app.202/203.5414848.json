From a judgment for defendant on a directed verdict, plaintiff brings error.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-10\" pgmap=\"229(44) 230(86)\">The automobile was purchased June 14, 1913, with money which plaintiff received from his grandmother as a gift. The automobile at this time was delivered to plaintiff. On June 1, 1914, plaintiff wrote a letter to defendant stating that he had elected to disaffirm his contract, and on or about September 12, 1914, appeared at the office of defendant and tendered the car, stating that at the time of its purchase he was a minor. He claimed that he became of age on August 13, 1914. Defendant refused to accept the car, and thereupon plaintiff resumed possession of it and has kept it in his possession since that time. Plaintiff testified that during the spring and summer of 1915 he used the car and drove it upon the streets.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b230-5\" pgmap=\"230\">Marcus J.
