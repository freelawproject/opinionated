From a judgment for plaintiff for $7,000, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-9\" pgmap=\"157(124) 158(49)\">The accident occurred August 29,1912, about 4 p. m. The evidence tended to show that plaintiff, a child under the age of eight years, with a companion, was on the west side of Indiana avenue, in Chicago, about midway between 31st and 32nd streets and started to cross to the east side. At the southwest corner of 31st street a building was being constructed and the street for about one hundred and fifty feet south of 31st street was obstructed with building material. Plaintiff was struck by a northbound car as she and her companion suddenly ran into Indiana avenue when the car was about twenty feet south of the point where she left the sidewalk. The car was running at an ordinary rate of speed, and, on seeing plaintiff, the motorman shut off power and applied the air brake. Plaintiff ran into the west side of the car about eight feet to the rear of the front. The car stopped within seventy-five feet north of where plaintiff was picked up.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b158-5\" pgmap=\"158\">Franklin B.

A street car motorman who was not running his car at an excessive rate of speed held not guilty of negligence in striking a pedestrian who suddenly dashed from the sidewalk to cross in front of the car, where the evidence showed that the motorman could not, by the exercise of extraordinary care and diligenc\u00e9, have stopped the car in. time to avoid the accident, even though it took place at a street crossing and though the motorman saw the pedestrian when she started from the sidewalk. - .</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b158-12\" pgmap=\"158\">3.

In an action to recover for personal injuries sustained as a result of being struck by defendant\u2019s street railway car, where plaintiff came out from behind an obstruction in the street in the middle of a block and started to cross in front of the car, and where there was evidence that the car was not running at an excessive rate of speed, and that when the motorman saw plaintiff, he shut off the power and applied the air brake, a verdict and judgment for plaintiff held clearly contrary to the weight of the evidence.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b158-13\" pgmap=\"158\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.

Street railroads, \u00a7 63<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what is effect of stireet obstructions as to duty of motorman. The fact that there are obstructions in a street occasioned by the construction of a building does not operate to change the place of crossing for pedestrians from the crosswalk to the middle of the block, or to impose a duty on the servants of a street car company to anticipate that pedestrians would suddenly cross the street in the middle of the block.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b159-4\" pgmap=\"159\">5. Street railroads, \u00a7 73*\u2014when failure to sound gong not negligent. No negligence can be imputed to a street car motorman as a matter of law in not sounding the gong or arresting the speed of the car in the middle of the block.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b159-7\" pgmap=\"159\">6. Street railroads, \u00a7 66*\u2014when duty of motorman discharged after discovery of peril. In an action to recover for personal injuries sustained as a result of being struck by defendant\u2019s street car, where defendant\u2019s motorman was not running at an excessive rate of speed, there can be no liability- where all things possible to be done were done by the motorman to avoid the accident, the environment of the parties considered.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b159-8\" pgmap=\"159\">7.

The Appellate Court on review is not restrained, as is the trial court, from determining the probative force of the evidence, and may reverse a judgment with a finding of fact when in its opinion the evidence fails to sustain such judgment.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
