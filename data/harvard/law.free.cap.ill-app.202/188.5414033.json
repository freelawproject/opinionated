In an action on a written assignment of wages by the assignee against the employer, held that the defendant\u2019s objection, that the plaintiff\u2019s testimony on the trial that he mailed a notice of assignment to the defendant was a mere conclusion of the witness and that the contents of the notice were not shown, was not available to the defendant on appeal since he had not raised the objection in the trial court.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b214-14\" pgmap=\"214(21) 215(70)\">2.

In an action on an assignment of wages against the employer, by the assignee, evidence tending to show that the party to whom the plaintiff gave notice by mail of the assignment was the vice president and secretary of the defendant company, and testimony of its president that in his absence such party opened all the mail addressed to the company, was sufficient to establish the agency of such party to receive the notice.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b214-15\" pgmap=\"214\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vois.

Where it was contended on appeal by a defendant that its motion in arrest of judgment should have been sustained for the reason that there was a variance between the summons, naming as defendant certain individuals doing business as a company, and the amended statement of claim, designating the defendant as a corporation, held that inasmuch as the defendant entered its appearance as a corporation to the original summons and statement of claim and subsequently the plaintiff filed the amended statement of claim, designating the defendant as a corporation, to which the defendant filed an affidavit of merits, the defendant\u2019s contention was without merit.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
