Said orders usually covered their floor tile requirements for a year from the date thereof. These orders were not in the form of contracts but were in the nature of general requisitions, showing the name of' the customer, the gross amount of tile ordered, the purchase price, the terms of payment and shipment, and were sighed by plaintiff as agent for defendant, and contained the signature or initials of the purchaser. From time to time the customers would order out specific quantities and kinds of tile under these general orders, as the requirements of their business demanded.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-12\" pgmap=\"304(15) 305(42)\">The said contract of employment provided that plaintiff should receive as his compensation a certain percentage of the selling price of all \u201cgoods sold,\u201d and recited further, that \u201call settlements on the account of the second party (plaintiff) shall be made by the tenth of each month, covering accepted and shipped orders of the month previous.\u201d</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b305-4\" pgmap=\"305\">Newman, Popfenhusen &amp; Stern, for appellant; Edward E.
