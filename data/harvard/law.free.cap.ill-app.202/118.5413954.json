From a judgment for plaintiff for $4,162.11, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-13\" pgmap=\"144\">The plaintiff entered into a written agreement with defendant giving to him the exclusive concession and license to conduct a theater in plaintiff\u2019s premises known as the skating rink building, during the summer season. The defendant agreed to- build a stage and prepare the building for theatrical purposes at his own expense. He also agreed to pay plaintiff for lighting, advertising, etc. Defendant took possession and erected a stage in the skating rink building and prepared it for use as a theater.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-3\" pgmap=\"145\">It was claimed by plaintiff that later the defendant requested to be permitted to change the grade of the floor so that patrons of the theater sitting in the rear could see the acting on the stage, and that it was agreed between the parties that defendant might construct a graded or sloping floor as a superstructure on the skating \"rink floor, upon condition that at the conclusion of the summer season defendant would remove this superstructure and restore the skating rink floor to its original condition. Such a graded floor was erected and used during the summer season, but at the conclusion of the summer season defendant did not remove this superstructure, whereupon plaintiff had this done, and attempted by this suit to recover the cost incurred by it in so doing. Liability for the expense of this work and the correctness of the account for the same were the subjects of controversy.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b145-4\" pgmap=\"145\">Frank &amp; Lurie, for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b145-5\" pgmap=\"145\">Sidney S.
