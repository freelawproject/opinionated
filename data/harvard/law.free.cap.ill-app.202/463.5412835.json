Upon a hearing upon this petition, the County Court entered an order directing the appellant to inventory and charge himself with $2,566.34 funds belonging to the estate. From this order the administrator prayed an appeal to the Circuit Court but never perfected it. Later, the administrator filed a supplementary inventory charging himself with the sum of $2,566.34, with the notation, \u201cFor which amount the said James M. Baker claims he is not justly indebted to the estate.\u201d Later, at a subsequent term of the County Court, the administrator filed a final report and omitted therein to charge himself with the sum of $2,566.34, to which report the appellees objected, which objection was sustained and the order appealed from was entered.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-4\" pgmap=\"490\">On the hearing of the appeal in the Circuit Court, the appellant filed a petition in which he requested that his final report he changed to a report current, that he be permitted to resign as administrator and that a new administrator be appointed so that he could have a trial by jury on the question whether he was indebted to the estate, which petition was denied.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b490-5\" pgmap=\"490\">Wobthington, Beevb &amp; Gbeen, for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b490-6\" pgmap=\"490\">J.
