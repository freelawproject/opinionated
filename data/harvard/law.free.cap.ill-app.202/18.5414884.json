Cramer and C. A. Mullen, plaintiff, against John P. Cummings, trustee, and Joseph T. Delfosse, defendants, in the Municipal Court of Chicago, to recover on a replevin bond on which defendant Joseph T. Delfosse was surety. To reverse a judgment for plaintiff, defendant Joseph. T. Delfosse prosecutes this writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-3\" pgmap=\"45\">The action in which the bond sued on was given was against Anton J. Cermak, bailiff of the Municipal Court of Chicago, to recover possession of an automobile which said Cermak held by virtue of an execution and levy against defendant John P. Cummings, as the individual property of said Cummings and to satisfy a judgment against him. It was admitted that the replevin action was not determined upon the merits. A document was offered in evidence by defendant Joseph T. Delfosse, and excluded by the court, as follows:</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-7\" pgmap=\"45\">\u201cChicago, May 14,1913.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-8\" pgmap=\"45\">\u201cReceived of Joseph T.

In an action against a surety on a replevin bond, where the merits of the replevin action have not been determined in the action in which the bond was given, it is error to exclude evidence that the plaintiff in the replevin action held title to the property replevied, an automobile, as trustee for defendant, since the right to prove such fact in such case is expressly given to defendant by the Replevin Act, sec. 26 (J. &amp; A. If 9211), and it is therefore essential that defendant be allowed to prove, by competent evidence, that plaintiff in the replevin action was entitled to the possession of the replevied property as trustee or bailee for defendant.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b45-16\" pgmap=\"45\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
