Landlordi and tenant, \u00a7 530<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when exclusion of record in forcible entry action not improper in action for breach of contract. Where a tenant claiming to hold under a written lease had been evicted from a farm under an execution in an action of forcible entry and detainer and his goods placed in a highway by the evicting officer, and later he brought an action against his former landlord for breach of a verbal contract for work performed, materials furnished, etc., held that the defendant\u2019s contention in the latter action that the record in the forcible entry and detainer action should have been admitted in evidence for the reason that counsel for the plaintiff had used expressions which disclosed that the tenant had been put off the farm by a constable, was untenable, there being nothing in the expressions challenging the righteousness of the expulsion or to raise that question for the determination of the jury, and further because the court instructed the jury that the defendant had the right to evict the plaintiff and that the officer had the right to place his property in the public road.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b534-11\" pgmap=\"534(124) 535(29)\">2. Evidence, \u00a7 365*\u2014When answer of witness not misleading as assuming ownership of property. In an action by a former tenant of a farm against his former landlord for breach of an oral contract for work performed, materials furnished, etc., including a claim for grain taken, in which the notice of set-off specified claims for failure of tenant to deliver rent corn due according to the terms of the former lease, held that the answer of the tenant\u2019s son who was interrogated as to what became of the grain, that they put the defendant\u2019s corn on one side of a crib and their own on the other side and later hauled it to a certain place and hauled the defendant\u2019s oats to town, was not misleading or prejudicial to the defendant as assuming the ownership of the oats, although both question and answer should have been clothed in different language.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b534-12\" pgmap=\"534\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.

In an action by a former tenant of a farm against his former ^landlord for his share of corn alleged to have been left on the farm and appropriated by the landlord, held that an instruction to the effect that if the jury believed that the tenant had fairly divided the corn while he was tenant and turned over to the landlord his just, full and fair proportion thereof, and\" that the landlord appropriated the tenant\u2019s share, the landlord should be required to account for such a share in so far as it exceeded the amount of set-off which he established by proof even though the grain was not divided in the manner provided for by the lease, was not objectionable, though the grain was not averaged as provided for in the lease.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b535-7\" pgmap=\"535\">4.
