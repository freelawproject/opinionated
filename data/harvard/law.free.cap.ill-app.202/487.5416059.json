Defendants appeared and answered the bill. The important part of the answer was that a special election was legally called on July 23, 1914, and was legally held in said school district on August 6,1914, in which election about one-third of the legal voters of that district participated, and that a large majority of those who voted at that election cast their ballots for a new schoolhouse site, for building a new schoolhouse and for issuing bonds to raise money with which to build the same.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-5\" pgmap=\"514\">Complainants, while admitting that a pretended election was held in said district on August 6, 1914, and that the result of the same was as stated by defendants, denied that such election was properly called or held, or that the result of it authorized or justified defendants in the doing of the things contemplated.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-6\" pgmap=\"514\">A typewritten, purported record of a meeting of the directors supposed to have been held on July 23, 1914, which had been dictated by an attorney and by him pasted into the record book some three months after this suit was brought, was introduced in evidence to prove the calling of the special election in question.
