From a judgment for plaintiffs, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-13\" pgmap=\"121(27) 122(148)\">The parties were adjoining landowners, and a fence was built forty or more years before the action was brought, which fence separated the land of the parties. The land sought to be recovered was on plaintiffs \u2019 side of the fence, and was about twenty-five feet wide at one end of the fence and ten feet wide at the other. The fence was originally of rails, which about twenty years before the action was brought was removed and a wire fence erected. Plaintiffs cultivated the land to the fence and were in obvious and continuous possession. Defendant, on purchasing his property in 1905, made a survey, in consequence of which he claimed title to the land sought to be recovered, and after notice to plaintiffs that he would remove the fence and re-erect it on what he claimed was the correct line, carried his threat into effect, against the protest of plaintiffs, who ordered defendant to desist. Defendant then took possession of the strip of land in question.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b122-5\" pgmap=\"122\">George McMahon, for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b122-6\" pgmap=\"122\">Thomas McEnbrny, for appellees.</attorneys><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b122-8\" pgmap=\"122\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b122-9\" pgmap=\"122\">1.

The invasion of land obviously in possession of another against the wish and protest of the owner, and the removal of fences and their re-erection in another place, constitutes a forcible .entry and will enable the owner to maintain an action of forcible entry and detainer, although defendant acted under a claim of right to the land.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b122-10\" pgmap=\"122\">2. Fobcible entby and detainee, \u00a7 73*\u2014what evidence inadmissible as defense. In actions of forcible entry and detainer, evidence of a paramount title in defendant is incompetent, the action being wholly statutory and involving only possessory rights, so that rights derived from a paramount title can only be claimed in ejectment or other appropriate proceeding.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b122-11\" pgmap=\"122\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
