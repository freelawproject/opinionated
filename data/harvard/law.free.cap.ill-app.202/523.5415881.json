In an action by a prospective passenger on a railway train for damages for personal injuries alleged to have resulted from a trapdoor not properly equipped with latches over the steps of a vestibule door falling upon him as he was attempting to board the train, it being undisputed that the train was then in motion, where the preponderance of the evidence showed that the vestibule door was-open and the trapdoor was down and that the plaintiff lost his hold and was thus injured, held that a judgment for the plaintiff could not be sustained.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
