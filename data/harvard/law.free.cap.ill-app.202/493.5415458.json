Norton, plaintiff, against United Commercial Travelers of America, incorporated, defendant, on a certificate of life insurance. To review a judgment for defendant, plaintiff prosecutes a writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-11\" pgmap=\"519(83) 520(192)\">The plaintiff was the wife of the deceased insured, Samuel Lee Norton, and was named as-beneficiary in the certificate. Samuel Lee Norton, on the date of the issuance of the certificate, October 21,1910, was a commercial traveler. He was in the employ of the Cement, Tile &amp; Machinery Company of Waterloo, Iowa, on a salary. After August, 1912, he continued in the employ of the same company but received his compensation by way of commissions instead of a salary. In the fall of 1912, he with others entered into a copartnership known as the Havana Concrete, Tile &amp; Product Company of Havana,' Illinois. He was employed as manager of that company. .He still continued to be in the employ of the Cement, Tile &amp; Machinery Company. While he was on a collecting trip as manager of the Havana Concrete, Tile &amp; Product Company on June 27,1913, he was accidentally drowned. He was in good standing in the United Commercial Travelers of America at the time of his death. Proof of death was made in due time. Defendant admitted liability to the extent of $3,150, which it paid. Plaintiff contends that she should have received $5,000 within ninety days after the receipt of satisfactory proof of the accidental death of the insured, and $1,300 in weekly instalments of $25, amounting in all to $6,300. The contention of defendant was that the deceased changed his occupation and thereby it became liable to only one-half of the amount named in the certificate; that there had been an accord and satisfaction and that the suit was barred by the limitation stipulated in the contract.</p><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b520-5\" pgmap=\"520\">Sterling &amp; Whitmore, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b520-6\" pgmap=\"520\">Barry &amp; Morrissey, for defendant in error.</attorneys><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b520-8\" pgmap=\"520\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b520-9\" pgmap=\"520(74) 521(165)\">1.

Where a beneficiary in a certificate of benefit insurance received from the insurer an amount which it admitted was due, and the receipt of which it claimed constituted an accord and satisfaction of the entire amount claimed by the beneficiary, held in an action by the latter on the certificate that even if such sum was paid and accepted in full of all liability upon the certificate sued on, the agreement that it should be in full, not having any consideration to support it, would be a mere nudum pactum and not constitute an accord and satisfaction.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b521-7\" pgmap=\"521\">3.
