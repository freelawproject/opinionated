In a prosecution for selling liquor in anti-saloon territory, where a witness for the State was allowed to state the contents of an examined copy which he had made of a federal special revenue stamp issued to the defendant over the objection thereto on the ground that the copy would be the best evidence, held that he could not on appeal urge such action of the court as reversible error, as he later objected to the admission of the stamp in evidence when offered by the prosecution, which objection was sustained.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b573-8\" pgmap=\"573\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
