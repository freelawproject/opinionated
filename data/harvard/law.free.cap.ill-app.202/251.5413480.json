From a judgment for plaintiff, defendant brings error.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-8\" pgmap=\"277\">During the course of construction of the building the error was discovered, and it became necessary in order to have the sewer laid below the basement floor to raise the latter. The basement walls, however, were not heightened, which resulted in a somewhat lower ceiling in the basement, and also resulted, as the sidewalk had to be relaid and raised to grade, in bringing the first floor on a level with the street grade, necessitating the construction of bulkheads about the basement windows.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b277-9\" pgmap=\"277\">William B.
