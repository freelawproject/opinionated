Peter &amp; Paul, a corporation, defendant, to recover on a promissory note given 'to a local fraternal lodge of the Slovak Evangelical Union of America, known as Spolek Dr. Milos Stefanovie No. 83, and which had been surrendered to the defendant by the seceding members of such local lodge against the wills of the plaintiffs. Prom a judgment for plaintiffs, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"As-7\" pgmap=\"306\">The aforesaid plaintiffs constituted the remaining loyal members of the Spolek Dr. Milos Stefanovic No. 83. The subordinate lodges were organized under and governed by the constitution and by-laws of the parent organization, whose principal, object was to pay sick and death benefits.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-16\" pgmap=\"306(28) 307(235)\">At the annual convention of the parent organization held during the fall of 1912, a change was made in the method of assessing its members, from a uniform assessment plan for all members to one under which the members were assessed according to their respective ages. Said change was to have become effective January 1, 1913. This new plan of assessment met with the disapproval of a majority of the members of Spolek No. 83, as a result of which, at a meeting held early in January, 1913, upwards of one hundred of the one hundred and sixty-three members of said spolek withdrew from the association and formed a rival organization. At the meeting at which this action was taken there were present fifteen or sixteen members of the organization, who manifested their determination to remain loyal to the parent organization. These loyal members were compelled to leave the meeting, after which the insurgent members proceeded to dispose of all the property belonging to Spolek No. 83. The money in its treasury, amounting to upwards of $500, was donated to one John Ducaj, the then treasurer, for his services, while the $1,000 note in question was donated to the appellant church, the maker thereof. A few days later, the loyal adherents of the said Spolek No. 83 called a meeting of all loyal members thereof, at which they formally protested against the action of the secessionists who had dissolved the said spolek and disposed of its property, and subsequently demanded a return of all of its property.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-4\" pgmap=\"307\">The constitution and by-laws of the parent organization contained the following provisions:</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-5\" pgmap=\"307\">\u201cSection 131.

As long as the minimum number of members necessary to constitute the existing local organization remain in a subordinate lodge of a fraternal insurance order such members, even though in the minority, are alone entitled to the use and enjoyment of the property of the organization, and the members of the lodge who secede therefrom lose their right to the property and funds of the lodge, although they constitute a majority of the members.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b308-6\" pgmap=\"308\">2.
