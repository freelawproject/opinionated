From a judgment for plaintiff for $1,500, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-5\" pgmap=\"160\">The evidence showed that plaintiff was crossing West 69th street in Chicago when injured, near the alley between Emerald and Union avenues. He was hurrying after another man, and sought to cross the street at a point which was not a regular crossing, but was south of the center of 69th street when struck. Defendant\u2019s automobile was being driven south of the center of such street, without apparent necessity for its being out of the usual line of vehicular traffic. There was no congestion of traffic or street obstruction to account for its being there. The automobile at the time was proceeding' west.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b160-6\" pgmap=\"160\">Willard C. McNitt and Joseph A.

In an action to recover for personal injuries sustained by a pedestrian by being struck by defendant\u2019s automobile, held that plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence although when struck he was crossing a street at a point which was not a regular crossing, it also appearing that defendant\u2019s automobile was at the time of the accident being recklessly driven out of the path of vehicular traffic in the street, so that if plaintiff was originally negligent in selecting a point for crossing, he had, when struck, escaped from the path where the automobile should have been driven.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b160-11\" pgmap=\"160\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.

In an action to recover for personal injuries sustained by a pedestrian by being struck by defendant\u2019s automobile while plaintiff was crossing a street, where it appeared that, though plaintiff sought to cross at a point not a regular crossing, defendant\u2019s automobile was being driven out of the regular path of vehicular traffic when it struck plaintiff, a judgment for plaintiff held sustained by the evidence.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b161-4\" pgmap=\"161\">3. Appeal and ebbor, \u00a7 1629*\u2014when improper questions of counsel not reversible error. Improper questions asked by counsel for plaintiff are not reversible error where the evidence and the size of the verdict show that defendant was not prejudiced thereby, and where on prompt objection by defendant the court ruled the questions out, such ruling being a sufficient curative.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b161-5\" pgmap=\"161\">4.
