In a petition for mandamus to compel the reinstatement of relator in a public office, an averment that on a certain date a city established a certain department by an ordinance set out in the petition in haec verba, held a sufficient averment of the passage and existence of the ordinance, although the different steps taken in passing it were not alleged.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b127-5\" pgmap=\"127\">3.

Civil service, \u00a7 12*\u2014how period of probation computed. The ordinary rule that in computing time the first day of a period must be excluded and the last included does not apply to the probationary period provided by the Civil Service Act, sec. 10 (J. &amp; A. T 1808), where the commission passes a rule that time served on probation, whether continuous or not, shall be credited on the period of probation, so that the exclusion of the first day the probationer works would conflict with the rule of the commission.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b128-5\" pgmap=\"128\">8.

The discharge on May 13th of a civil service employee whose probationary period commenced on November 13th of the previous year, which was also -his first day of work under his appointment, held void.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b128-8\" pgmap=\"128\">11. Mandamus, \u00a7 139*\u2014when petition for reinstatement in office not obnoxious to general demurrer.
