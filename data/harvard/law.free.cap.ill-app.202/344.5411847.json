Chuipek, administrator of the estate of Luke Chuipek, deceased, plaintiff, against the Northwestern Yeast Company, a corporation, defendant, to recover for damages for death of deceased alleged to have been caused by the negligence of defendant, by whom deceased was. employed. From a judgment for defendant upon a directed verdict, plaintiff appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-9\" pgmap=\"370\">At the time of his death, plaintiff\u2019s intestate was in the employ of the defendant. His duty was to descend into a corn bin for the purpose of sweeping the walls thereof while the grain was being withdrawn, and while thus employed he became submerged in the grain and death ensued.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-10\" pgmap=\"370\">The bin in question was one of a series of adjoining bins contained in a large building, all of which were used as receptacles for shelled com. The grain was withdrawn therefrom through an opening at the bottom, whence, by means of a conveyor, it was carried to the mill. These bins were cylindrical in shape, about eighty-five feet high and twenty feet in diameter. There were two openings, each about two feet square, at the top of each bin; also a spout leading from the upper conveyor, by means of which the bins were filled.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-11\" pgmap=\"370(16) 371(134)\">While the grain was being withdrawn therefrom, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate descended into the bin to sweep the walls for the purpose of removing an injurious germinating dust which frequently adhered thereto. In the performance of this duty he walked around the surface of the com. When the bottom of the bin was opened, the conveyor placed in operation and the corn being withdrawn, it caused a depression of some eight or ten feet to form in the middle of the corn surfac'e. Plaintiff\u2019s intestate was therefore-required to keep to the outer edge of the com in order not to be drawn into the cavity thus formed. A rope was attached to the back of a harness or belt worn by the plaintiff\u2019s intestate and extended up and through a pulley block fastened to a beam in the ceiling and thence to the opening in the bin, where it was tied.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-6\" pgmap=\"371\">While the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was working in the bin, another man, named Tony, stayed at the top to slacken the rope as required, and to render any other necessary assistance to the plaintiff\u2019s intestate which occasion demanded, while in the performance of this work.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-7\" pgmap=\"371(169) 372(40)\">The accident in question occurred on a Sunday evening. The man at the top of the bin heard plaintiff\u2019s intestate call, \u2018 \u2018 Stop the com, \u2019 \u2019 and observed him submerged therein to a point about four inches below his arm pits, and vainly tried to pull him out by the' rope, after which he tied up the rope and called for assistance. The-foreman, who had started upstairs when he heard the shouts of Tony, went down into the basement and stopped the machinery, after which the two went to the top of the bin and descended into it and talked with plaintiff\u2019s intestate, who by that time had become submerged to his chin. The foreman then summoned the fireman and engineer of the building, after which it was deemed advisable to again start the conveyor and let the grain out slowly, while two of them held the rope which was attached to the belt worn by plaintiff\u2019s intestate. This also proved unavailing, whereupon the conveyor was again stopped and the city fire department summoned. Throug'h the combined efforts of defendant\u2019s servants and the members of the city fire department, the body of plaintiff\u2019s intestate was extricated, but not until death had intervened.</p><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b372-5\" pgmap=\"372\">Brothers &amp; Brothers and Cruice &amp; Langille, for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b372-6\" pgmap=\"372\">Brundage, Landon &amp; Holt, for appellee.</attorneys><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b372-8\" pgmap=\"372\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b372-9\" pgmap=\"372\">1.
