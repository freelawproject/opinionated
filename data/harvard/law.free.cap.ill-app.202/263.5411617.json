In-an action for the purchase price of goods alleged by the plaintiff to have been sold and delivered to the defendant under a contract where the plaintiff claimed that its salesman quoted the price to the defendant\u2019s buyer as $13 per thousand articles and the defendant\u2019s buyer claimed that he understood the price to be 13 cents per thousand, held that a memorandum made by the defendant\u2019s buyer at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s salesman\u2019s oral offer and in his presence, in which the price appeared as 13 cents, was admissible on the question of mistake and meeting of the minds, -as was also evidence as to what the defendant\u2019s buyer did with respect to the price which led up to the making of a written order by him in which the price appeared as 13 cents, which order was sent to the plaintiff\u2019s salesman, and also correspondence from the defendant to one of its customers after the defendant\u2019s buyer\u2019s first interview with the plaintiff\u2019s salesman and prior to the sending of the written order by the defendant to the plaintiff.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b290-5\" pgmap=\"290\">2. Sales, \u00a7 326*\u2014when improbability of evidence does not affect its admissibility. In an action for goods sold and delivered where the plaintiff\u2019s salesman testified that he quoted the price of the articles to the defendant\u2019s buyer at so many dollars per thousand and the defendant\u2019s buyer testified that he understood the price to be cents per thousand, held that the admissibility of competent evidence, tending to show what the real understanding of the defendant\u2019s buyer was, was not affected by the fact that the price which the defendant\u2019s buyer claimed he understood to be the price of the goods was ridiculous in view of their value, the buyer having testified that he was not familiar with the value of such goods.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
