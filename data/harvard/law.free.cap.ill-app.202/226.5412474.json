A conviction under an information charging the defendant with causing the delinquency of a female child under the age of eighteen years in the City of Chicago, held justified where the evidence showed that the defendant met the girl out of the State, that she came to Chicago at the instigation of the defendant, that he paid her expenses and had sexual intercourse with her in Chicago.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b253-8\" pgmap=\"253\">3.
