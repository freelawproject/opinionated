The plaintiffs took possession apparently with the consent of the defendant, but no new lease was entered into by them. The loss having been paid to the plaintiffs by an insurance company, the plaintiffs brought this suit for the use of the company.</p><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b505-5\" pgmap=\"505\">Oglevee &amp; Franklin and Barger &amp; Hicks, for plaintiffs in error; C.

Purchasers of a grain elevator standing on a railroad company\u2019s right of way, the railroad company not being the owner of the building but the lessor, to the owner, of the land on which it stood, held presumed to know not only that the building was on the right of way under some arrangement between the owner and the railroad company, but also what that arrangement was.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b505-10\" pgmap=\"505\">2.

A railroad company is under no obligation to permit an elevator to be placed upon its right of way, and if it does so it has the right to exact such terms and conditions as it deems fit to impose as a basis of permitting it to be placed there.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b505-11\" pgmap=\"505(59) 506(72)\">3.
