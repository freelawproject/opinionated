This land frequently overflowed. Plaintiff himself testified: \u201cThere is a lake or natural stream that flows through my land. It flows from Lansdowne through my land into the big lake. This embankment of the defendant railway company is built across that lake and they did not leave opening enough. They only put in a 36-inch pipe, and a 36-inch pipe will not drain a lake 200 feet wide and 8 or 9 feet deep.\u201d Defendant\u2019s railroad cut plaintiff\u2019s tract of land into two parts, one part lying on the north side of the track and the other on the south. The contention of plaintiff was that his crops were damaged on account of the water overflowing his land and that this condition obtained on both sides of the embankment. The land owned by plaintiff through which defendant\u2019s railroad was constructed was practically flat, and the land had very little fall.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-4\" pgmap=\"668\">The second instruction was with reference to the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony. This instruction concluded by instructing the jury that if it appeared that any witness had knowingly or wilfully testified falsely to any material fact, the jury had the right to disregard the testimony of such witness, except in so far as it was corroborated by other credible testimony or by facts and circumstances proven on the trial.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-5\" pgmap=\"668\">The third instruction was to the effect that if the jury believed from the evidence that the lands of plaintiff had, prior to the construction of the embankment by the defendant, been subject to overflow, and if they believed the crops of plaintiff to have been injured and destroyed in the same manner and to as great an extent before as after the embankment had been constructed by defendant, they should find the defendant not guilty.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-6\" pgmap=\"668\">Defendant\u2019s fifth instruction was as follows: \u201cThe court instructs the jury that the plaintiff is seeking to recover in this suit for damages caused by the surface water being obstructed or interfered with by the embankment of the defendant; that even though you may believe from the evidence that said embankment did interfere with water coming upon the land of the plaintiff, and even though you may believe that because thereof plaintiff was so injured, yet, unless you may believe further from the evidence that the said water was surface water, your verdict should .be for the defendant.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-7\" pgmap=\"668(42) 669(72)\">Defendant\u2019s sixth instruction was as follows: \u201cThe court instructs you that the defendant corporation is a railroad corporation, acting under legal authority and power to construct, maintain and operate its railway over and upon the lands in question; that in the construction, operation and maintenance of its railway and embankments it is not a guarantor that its railway and embankments will be so constructed as to carry off or permit the carrying off of all the surface waters which might occur at times of such extraordinary and exceptional rainfall as has never occurred before, or such extraordinary or exceptional rainfalls, which, though they have occurred, may not reasonably be expected to recur.\"</p><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b669-5\" pgmap=\"669\">M.

Railroads, \u00a7 350<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence is sufficient to show that construction of embankment over stream is not cause of overflow. In an action for damages against a railroad company for overflowing of lands, claimed to have been due to a railroad embankment, constructed through said lands, where the evidence showed the embankment was built across a lake or natural stream eight or nine feet deep with a 36-inch pipe running through the embankment, by reason of which the water sometimes stood higher on one side and sometimes higher on the other side, with quite a current through the pipe, and the lands of the plaintiff on either side of the embankment were practically flat with little fall, so that at times of heavy rainfall all of the lands in that locality were flooded, held that the jury were warranted in finding that the embankment did not cause the water to back on the plaintiff\u2019s land, but that the overflow was on account of natural conditions.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b669-10\" pgmap=\"669\">2. 'Instructions, \u00a7 96*\u2014when not erroneous on right of jury to discredit testimony of witness testifying falsely.

Railroads, \u00a7 352<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when instruction in action for damages for overflowing of land caused by embankment is not erroneous. In an action for damages for overflowing of lands claimed to have been due to a railroad embankment, where an instruction was given to the effect that if the jury believe from the evidence that tho plaintiff\u2019s lands had, prior to the construction of said embankment by the defendant, been subject to overflow and the crops of plaintiff to have been injured and destroyed in the same manner and to as great an extent before as after the construction of said embankment, they should find the defendant not guilty, held said instruction was faulty in form but there was no error in giving same, as if the jury found from the evidence the matters stated in said instruction it would have been their duty to have found the defendant not guilty.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b670-5\" pgmap=\"670\">4. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1552*\u2014when giving of ambiguous instruction is harmless error. Where an instruction is not clear in its statements and its meaning is somewhat ambiguous, but no particular error therein is' pointed out by counsel whereby such instruction could have injured the party against whom the verdict was rendered, and under the evidence the jury could not have been misled thereby to such party\u2019s hurt, the giving of such an instruction is not ground for reversal.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b670-6\" pgmap=\"670\">5. Instructions, \u00a7 63*\u2014when not erroneous as assuming facts. The giving of an instruction on behalf of a defendant to the effdct that the defendant was a railroad corporation and as such had the right and legal authority to construct its railroad across the land's of the plaintiff was not erroneous as assuming facts, where the plaintiff himself had testified that he had sold the right of way to the defendant for railway purposes.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"Aqsp\" pgmap=\"670\">6. Railroads, \u00a7 352*\u2014when instruction as to nonliability of for overflow due to construction of embankment over stream is not seriously erroneous. An instruction given on behalf of a railroad company sued for damages for overflowing of the plaintiff\u2019s lands, stating that \u201cin the construction, operation and maintenance of its railway and embankments it is not a guarantor that its railway and embankments will be so constructed as to carry off or permit the carrying off of all the surface waters which might occur at times of such extraordinary and exceptional rainfall as,has never occurred before, or such extraordinary or exceptional rainfalls which, though they have occurred, may not reasonably be expected to recur,\u201d\" held not seriously erroneous.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"AGj\" pgmap=\"670(20) 671(60)\">7. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1752*\u2014when judgment affirmed because of defective abstract. Where an abstract is tendered on an appeal which, wholly fails to comply with the rules laid down by the Appellate Court covering the preparation of abstracts, as when it fails to abstract the pleadings or refer to the same, and the index refers to the record alone and not to the abstract, affirmance of the judgment without consideration of the case on its merits is warranted.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b671-4\" pgmap=\"671\">8.
