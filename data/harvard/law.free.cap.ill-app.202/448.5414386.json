Principal and surety, \u00a7 54<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence shows alteration in interest rate of note. In an action against a surety on a promissory note, evidence held to show that the note had been materially altered by raising the interest rate with the knowledge and consent of the plaintiff, payee, and without the knowledge of the defendant.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b475-10\" pgmap=\"475\">2. Principal and surety, \u00a7 54*\u2014when evidence shows extension of time by holder of note. In an action against a surety on a promissory note, evidence among other things, that at the maturity of the note the plaintiff, the payee, received from the maker $10 more than the accrued interest charge according to the tenor of the note, held tended to show that the time of payment had been extended by the plaintiff without the consent of the defendant.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b475-11\" pgmap=\"475\">3. Principal and surety, \u00a7 39*\u2014what essential to enforceable promise to pay discharged debt. The promise by which a discharged debt is revived must be clear, distinct and unequivocal. The mere recognition or acknowledgment of such a debt does not create a legal obligation to pay it. There must be an express promise to pay the debt, and even the payment of part of the principal or the interest without any express promise will not revive the obligation.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b475-12\" pgmap=\"475\">4. Principal and surety, \u00a7 39*\u2014when new promise by surety on note will not support action. In an action against one of five sureties on a promissory note, the payment of which had been extended by the payee, the plaintiff, without the consent of the defendant, a statement by the defendant that he was willing to do what was right and to pay one-fifth of the note, held not a new promise to pay the note on which an action for the full amount could be maintained.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b475-13\" pgmap=\"475\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
