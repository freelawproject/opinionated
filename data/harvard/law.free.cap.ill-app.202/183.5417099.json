In an action to recover for personal injuries resulting from a collision between the plaintiff\u2019s wagon and a truck belonging to the defendant, alleged to have been caused by the negligence of the defendant\u2019s driver, evidence held not to justify a reversal of a judgment for the plaintiff.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b210-9\" pgmap=\"210\">2. Damages, \u00a7 167*\u2014^when variance is cured by amendment. In an action for personal injuries, held that the contention of the defendant that testimony of physicians, who had attended the plaintiff, as to the reasonable value of their services was improperly admitted because the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim averred that he had expended certain sums of money while the evidence showed that he had not paid the physician but had become liable to do so, was untenable, since, after the evidence was introduced, the court permitted the plaintiff to amend the statement of claim to correspond with the proof.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b210-10\" pgmap=\"210\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vola.
