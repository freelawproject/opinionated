The defendant owned the land north of this line; he managed his estate through the agency of one Evenal Estes, who was from time to time engaged, with sundry laborers employed by him, in removing stones and other obstructions from the bed of the stream; and the stones thus removed were placed on the north bank of the river. The plaintiff introduced evidence to show that on one or more occasions the laborers so employed had entered upon the land of the plaintiff, or had removed stones or earth that were attached to the same, and displaced some of his soil.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-7\">The defendant, not admitting these facts to be proved, contended that if they were as above stated, yet he was not liable therefor, inasmuch as said Evenal had testified that if he and his workmen passed over the defendant\u2019s line and entered upon the land of the plaintiff, it was against the defendant\u2019s directions given to them while thus employed; and requested the court so to instruct the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-8\">But Dewey, J., before whom the case was tried, instructed the jury on this point, that if the servants of the defendant had done such acts while in his service, and the acts done were within the general course of business and scope of employment, in which they were employed by him; and although directed to remove stones or earth within the defendant\u2019s southern boundary line, yet if they, when thus employed, negligently passed over the limits thus pointed out by the master, being at the time employed to remove stones, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>transport them to the north bank of the stream; and had thus removed stones from the plaintiff\u2019s bank, and carried them to the defendant\u2019s bank on the opposite side of the river, and there deposited them for a wall or embankment, the master was liable in this action; but that if the acts of the servants were not done negligently, but wilfully, and with the intention of disregarding the directions of the master, he would not be responsible therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the case was reported for the consideration of the whole court..</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b394-6\"><em>H. L. Dawes, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJt\">A master'cannot be held liable for the tortious acts of his servants, committed against his express directions, merely because they were not done wilfully.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Adu\">The distinction between the liability of the master, for the negligent acts of his servants, and that resulting from their wilful and designed tortious acts, appears to have been carefully made and correctly stated in- the charge of the judge. <em>McManus </em>v. <em>Crickett, </em>1 East, 106. A servant may do great damage to another person, in the negligent and careless performance of his master\u2019s service, though against the master\u2019s will and contrary to his orders; yet this is a ground of action against the master.
