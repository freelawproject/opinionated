Borough of Watchung, </em>29 <em>N. J. Super. </em>41, 44, 45 <em>(App. Div. </em>1953), affirmed 15 <em>N. J. </em>376 (1954), and cases cited therein, commencing with the leading and still authoritative decision, <em>Lohndorf v. Peper Bros. Paint Co., </em>134 <em>N. J. L. </em>156 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1946), affirmed 135 <em>N. J. L. </em>352 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1947); see also <em>Mergel v. New Jersey Conveyors Corp., </em>14 <em>N. J. </em>609 (1954), wherein Mr. Justice Brennan, concurring in the result (14 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>page </em>614), synthesized the view of a minority of the Supreme Court that \u201cif the injury occurred by reason of the strain at work, whatever the degree of the strain, there is an accident in the statutory sense and there is no occasion for an inquiry whether the strain was an event or happening beyond the mere employment itself.\u201d <em>Cf. Lohndorf, supra </em>(134 <em>N. J. L., </em>at <em>page </em>160). Of course, the views of the members of this court with respect to that difference of opinion are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>irrelevant as we are an intermediate appellate tribunal, bound by the continued adherence by the Supreme Court to the <em>Lohndorf </em>doctrine. <em>Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Co. v. City of Asbury Park, </em>128 <em>N. J. L. </em>141, 146 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1942), affirmed 129 <em>N. J. L. </em>253 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">We are clear that the case before us does not represent a situation of a heart attack occurring because of an unusual strain or exertion, \u201cbeyond the mere employment itself,\u201d within the language and holdings in <em>Lohndorf </em>and later cases, and that the affirmance by the Essex County Court of an award in the Compensation Division in favor of the petitioner must therefore be reversed. See also <em>Becker v. City of Union </em>City, 17 <em>N. J. Super. </em>217, 224 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The decedent, aged 50, was a bus driver in the employ of the respondent. On February 2, 1952, a Saturday, he left his home in apparently good health at 9 :00 A. it. and began work at about 9:58 A. it. on his regular Newark bus route. When he reached the Military Park (Newark) terminus at between 11:00 a. m. and 11:30 A. it., he phoned the respondent\u2019s station master, Ulbrich, at 20th Street and 16th Avenue, said he was ill, that he \u201chad been sweating and he had the chills,\u201d and that he wanted to be relieved at 19th Street and 14th Avenue. This is a regular relief point in respondent\u2019s bus operations and decedent had his car parked at that location. The decedent had started his route from there that morning. Dlbrich told him he would be relieved there, and decedent drove his bus to that point, a distance of perhaps two miles through the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">When decedent reached 19th Street and 14th Avenue he was relieved by another driver. He looked ill but declined a suggestion that he be driven home, preferring to drive his own car. On his way home he lost consciousness, his car veered across a street out of control, and it came to a stop against a retaining wall. A few minutes later he expired. There is no indication in the record whatever that decedent had any intimation that he was in the throes of a coronary attack before he died.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>An autopsy was performed on the body about two hours after death. The certification by the medical examiner indicates that the autopsy showed, among other things, \u201cocclusive coronary arteriosclerosis.\u201d The \u201cautopsy protocol\u201d states,, under item \u201c15. Coronary Arteries\u201d: \u201c* * * one area of complete occlusion in upper anterior descending branch. Another area of occlusion in a large branch of the circumflex near its origin. No thrombi.\u201d The \u201cprimary cause of death\u201d is given as \u201ccoronary arteriosclerosis, severe, occlusive.\u201d There was no involvement of the heart muscle.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">At the hearing in the Compensation Division the theory of petitioner\u2019s factual case was that the operation of the bus by the decedent from Military Park to the relief point had a causal relationship with his death, the effort aggravating an incipient condition of coronary insufficiency. Eor purposes of the <em>ratio decidendi </em>of this determination the details of the medical proof are not particularly significant. There is unanimity of opinion that decedent before the events of the day in question had a general condition of arteriosclerosis and that when he telephoned for relief he was in the early throes of a cardiovascular collapse. One expert for petitioner, Dr. Ritota, testified that any effort, even walking, was \u201can imposition\u201d upon the decedent\u2019s heart in his then condition and driving the bus was a \u201ccontributing factor\u201d to the death. Dr. Lieb testified for petitioner that the driving of the bus \u201caggravated the attack of coronary insufficiency which had already had its onset and contributed to and hastened the death that eventually happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Dr. York and Dr. Kaufman testified on behalf of respondent to the effect that there was no causal relationship between the driving of the bus and the death, although both admitted that the driving of the bus would not be medically indicated for a person undergoing the commencement of an attack of coronary insufficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The Deputy Director in the Compensation Division found that the \u201caccident\u201d arose out of and in the course of the decedent\u2019s employment and made an award. He did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>consider at all the question as to whether there was shown an unusual strain or exertion in the employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The County Court evinced recognition of the requirements of the eases following the <em>Lohndorf </em>line hut concluded in its \u201cfindings\u201d that they were met. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">* * The exertion and emotional and nervous strain he experienced thereafter driving the bus through the city streets of Newark for a mile and a half under that unusual condition of having the commencement or beginning of a coronary attack seems to me to constitute the unusual event or strain to satisfy the requirements of our rule. There is ample evidence in the form of expert testimony in the record to sustain the hypothesis that but for his continued employment, that is, for his continued driving of the bus after advising his superior that he was ill and not being relieved, he wouldn\u2019t have died at the time he did. It is not necessary that it be found that ho certainly would have lived. It is only necessary under our cases to find that it was a reasonable probability that he would not have died when he did but for the continued driving.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">Where, as here, an employer through its proper superior officer has knowledge that an employee is ill and he does not then relieve the employee of his duties, even though he does not expressly direct him to continue with them, the fact that the employee in furtherance of his employer\u2019s business continues to perform these duties in that condition seems to me to constitute the unusual event or exertion. From what I have said it follows that decedent suffered an accident within the meaning of the rule laid down in the eases previously cited, and that the petitioner is entitled to recover compensation in the amount stipulated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">The record is clear that in driving the bus from Military Park to the relief point the decedent was doing his everyday job in his normal manner and that no <em>unusual </em>strain or exertion was involved insofar as concerns the nature of the work done. If, as the quoted excerpt from its opinion indicates the County Court apparently believed was the case, decedent in fact knew he was having a heart attack and was therefore suffering from \u201cemotional and nervous strain\u201d on account of that knowledge while driving, superimposed upon the physical effort of driving while in such a condition, a materially different legal situation might be presented and the unusualness of the experience possibly sufficient to satisfy the <em>Lohndorf </em>rule. <em>Snoden v. Borough of Watchung, supra </em>(unusual strain found because of \u201cemotional or nervous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>strain and anxiety\u201d over failure of pump to operate for volunteer fireman at burning building). But the factual assumption by the County Court was entirely unfounded in the record. As already noted, there is nothing in the proof to show that the decedent realized the serious nature of his illness nor any other indication that he was suffering emotional or nervous strain. The fact that he drove his bus to the relief point on Ms own suggestion and there rejected advice that he allow himself to be driven home, as well as other minor incidents which need not be detailed, is indicative of the contrary. Indeed counsel for petitioner at the argument candidly disclaimed any assertion of an emotional or nervous strain and placed Ms case, as in the brief, on the flat position that the effort of driving the bus, while ordinarily not an unusual strain, became such when undertaken by a person then in fact undergoing a coronary attack, whether or not he knew what kind of illness had seized him.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">But we are not persuaded that the rationale advanced meets the intent of the <em>Lohndorf </em>rule. In essence the argument advanced is that if in fact there is a causal relationship between the work effort and the fatal outcome of the attack, no matter what the character of the former, there is a compensable accident. But this assertion makes the very issue upon which the members of the Supreme Court are divided and the point urged is one which the majority of the court still rejects. Thus, while petitioner stresses that all the medical experts agreed that the driving of the bus by one in the actual cardiac condition of the decedent was <em>contra</em>indieated, yet in the same paragraph in which the court in the <em>Lohndorf </em>case laid down the requisite that there be shown \u201can event or happening, beyond the mere employment itself,\u201d it stated (134 <em>N. J. L., </em>at <em>page </em>160) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">\u201cBecause an individual continues his occupation when rest is indicated or work contra-indicated and because by continuing the employment he becomes sick or disabled does not of itself form a basis for compensation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Petitioner cites <em>Todd v. Northeastern Poultry Producers Council, Inc., </em>9 <em>N. J. Super. </em>348 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1950), as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>supposed example of compensability for a heart attack aggravated by the driving of a car in employment. But the court there was at pains to stress the unusual and burdensome nature of the driving done by the employee. Petitioner also cites Dean Larson as authority for the view that the \u201cunusual strain\u201d doctrine is subject to an exception in cases \u201cwhen exertion is continued after symptoms are felt.\u201d 1 <em>Larson on Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>(1952), \u00a7 38.83, <em>p. </em>564, and \u00a7 38.64(c), <em>pp. </em>555, 556. But the only New Jersey case cited as authority by Larson is the inapposite <em>Todd </em>case, <em>supra. </em>Moreover, the author disclaims holding any brief for the logical validity of the distinction from the standpoint of unusualness, or accidental character of the event <em>(p. </em>555), and there obviously is none. The other authorities cited by petitioner are decisions from other states, and they are plainly contrary to the New Jersey rule which we have no choice but to follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
