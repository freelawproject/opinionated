J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A7a\">(temporarily assigned). This is an appeal from a dismissal by the Essex County Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>a writ of <em>habeas corpus. In </em>November 1948 the defendant filed pleas of <em>non vult </em>to two indictments charging him, respectively, with rape and assault with intent to rape. The sentences imposed were from 10 to 12 years on each indictment, to run consecutively. The intent indictment referred to prosecutrix, D. S., and the rape indictment referred to prosecutrix, H. G. Each indictment included a second count charging assault and battery on the same individual. The defendant had also been indicted at the same time for atrocious assault and battery, and for robbery, in two separate indictments. These were <em>nolle prossed </em>after pleas of <em>non vult </em>were entered on the indictments <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">An opinion was filed by Judge Poley in support of his order dismissing the writ after hearing. The appellant raises two grounds of appeal: (1) the indictment and its underlying statute are invalid in that the defendant was not adequately informed of the \u201cnature and cause of the offense charged,\u201d and (2) the manner in which his pleas of <em>non vult </em>were accepted violated his right to due process. We consider the contentions in that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">The first argument is in two phases. The first is that the rape indictment made no reference to the age of the prosecutrix and that defendant was therefore unable to tell which of the three types of offense penalized by the then effective statute, <em>R. S. </em>2:163-1 (now <em>N. J. S. 2A: </em>138\u20141), he was charged with. The statute read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">\u201cAny person who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman forcibly against her will, or shall aid, abet, counsel, hire, cause or procure any person to commit such offense, or who, being of the age of sixteen or over, shall unlawfully and carnally abuse a woman-child under the age of twelve years, with or without her consent, shall be guilty of a high misdemeanor * * *; or who, being of the age of sixteen or over, shall unlawfully and carnally abuse a woman-child over the age of twelve years and under the age of sixteen years, with or without her consent, shall be guilty of a high misdemeanor * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>The indictment in question reads, so far as material, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-5\">\u201cThe Grand Jurors of the State of New Jersey, for the County of Essex, upon their oath present that Frederick A. Faas, on the loth day of June, 1948, at the Township of Caldwell, in the County of Essex aforesaid and within the jurisdiction of this Court, did have carnal knowledge of [H. G.j forcibly against her will, contrary to the provisions of <em>R. S. </em>2:163-1, against the peace of this State, the government and dignity of the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The three offenses encompassed by the statute have been succinctly summarized as follows: \u201c(1) rape, (2) carnal abuse of a woman-child under the age of 12 years, and (3) carnal abuse of a woman-child over the age of 12 years and under the age of 16.\u201d <em>State v. Lefante, </em>12 <em>N. J. </em>505, 513 (1953). The penalty for (2) is greater than for (3). It will be perceived that the indictment uses, <em>verbatim, </em>the language of that portion of the statute dealing with \u201crape\u201d and it would seem from that fact and from the absence of any reference to the age of the female that defendant is unmistakably apprised that he is charged with rape and not with carnal abuse of either category specified in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">In normal usage rape, or forcible carnal knowledge, is entirely distinct from carnal abuse, the first involving actual sexual penetration, and the second being, as stated in <em>State v. Huggins, </em>84 <em>N. J. L. </em>254, 259 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1913), \u201can act of debauchery of the female sexual organs by those of the male which does not amount to penetration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">In <em>State v. Tilton, </em>104 <em>N. J. L. </em>268, 271 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1928), the court said that \u201cwhere the indictment charges a statutory crime, the general rule is that the offense may be charged either in the words of the statute or there may be such a particular statement of facts as will bring the accused within its operation.\u201d Defendant makes the point that it was stated in the <em>Tilton </em>ease, <em>supra, </em>that the words, \u201ccarnal knowledge,\u201d include within their meaning, \u201ccarnally abuse,\u201d as applied to a woman-child over the age of 12 years and under the age of 16, and that, therefore, the use of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>language, \u201ccarnal knowledge,\u201d in the subject indictment, of itself does not inform defendant whether it is carnal knowledge or carnal abuse that he is accused of. All that the <em>Tilton </em>case held was that where the defendant was charged with having had carnal knowledge of a prosecutrix described in the indictment as being a woman-child over the age of 12 years and under the age of 16 years, the defendant being described as over the age of 16, the words \u201ccarnal knowledge\u201d in the indictment were sufficiently comprehensive of the act which is connoted by the term \u201ccarnal abuse\u201d so as adequately to sustain a conviction of the latter offense. The case is clearly not applicable in the present connection. Indeed it helps the State, since the present indictment was framed in the language of the statute, as the court there indicated was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">The defendant also cites <em>State v. </em>Lefante, <em>supra. </em>In that case the court sustained an indictment for carnal abuse notwithstanding that it did not recite the age of the defendant, whereas the statute requires that the defendant shall be over the age of 16. The court rejected the objection, holding that this was a matter of defense. The opinion went on by way of <em>dictum </em>to state that it was the duty of the State to allege the age of the girl \u201cso that the defendant will know what crime he is charged with,\u201d but it is obvious, that the court was speaking in terms of a situation where carnal abuse, not rape, was being charged in the indictment. The excerpt from the opinion which defendant relies upon expressly states, as noted above, that there are three separate crimes specified in the statute, the first of which is rape. Where that is the charge, as here, the age of the female is, of course, entirely immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The second aspect of defendant\u2019s first contention is that since the statute does not use the words, \u201cunlawfully\u201d or \u201cfeloniously,\u201d and since a husband presumably may have carnal knowledge of a woman (his wife) forcibly and against her will, a situation which defendant says the Legislature \u201cdid not intend to proscribe,\u201d the statute and the indictment leave a defendant open to prosecution for an unintended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>offense and thus are lacking in due process. The argument is specious. Pirst, there is no principle requiring a criminal statute to use the term, \u201cunlawfully,\u201d or similar language, in defining an offense which the statute declares to be a misdemeanor. That declaration itself is equivalent to a declaration that the act is unlawful. <em>22 C. J. S., Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 24, <em>p. </em>74. In <em>State v. Labato, </em>7 <em>N. J. </em>137, 149, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">\u201c\u00ae * * it is within the competency of the lawgiver, in the common interest, to declare an act criminal irrespective of the knowledge or motive of the doer of the act. The Legislature may make the doing of the prohibited act criminal or penal, regardless of a corrupt or criminal purpose or even knowledge of the illegal character of the act; and in such ease only the doing of the proscribed act need be shown. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">When the present statute interdicts the carnal knowledge by a man of a woman \u201cforcibly against her will,\u201d the Legislature uses language which cannot possibly be misunderstood, and nothing essential would be added thereto by adding the adverbs \u201cunlawfully\u201d or \u201cfeloniously.\u201d Although not express, the intention that an act by a husband against his wife is not intended to be included may possibly be derived as a matter of historial construction of the common-law origins of the offense and from the apparently settled principle that a defendant in a marital relationship with a prosecutrix was privileged thereby. 75 <em>C. J. S., Rape, </em>\u00a7 6, <em>p. </em>467. But we have no occasion here to hold that such a privilege exists under our statute. If it does, we point out that defendant was not the husband of the prosecutrix. If he were, his remedy, if any, would be by defense, proving the fact. In his opinion Judge Eoley said, and we agree:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">\u201cExcept where allegation and proof of a state of non-marriage are made necessary by statute, proof of the existence of marital relationship is generally held to be a matter of defense. <em>State v. Williamson, supra </em>[22 <em>Utah </em>248, 62 <em>P. </em>1022 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1900)] ; <em>Commonwealth v. Landis, </em>129 <em>Ky. </em>445, 112 <em>S. W. </em>581 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1908) ; <em>State v. Fudge, </em>96 <em>W. Va. </em>109, 122 <em>S. E. </em>519 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1924) ; <em>Commonwealth v. Fogerty, </em>8 <em>Gray (Mass.) </em>489 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1857) ; 48 <em>Am. Jur., \u2018Rape,\u2019 secs. </em>44, 59, <em>supra.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>It may be observed that to the extent that the foregoing arguments of the defendant are based upon alleged invalidity of an indictment, they were appropriately to be raised by appeal rather than <em>habeas corpus. State v. Mastic, </em>20 <em>N. J. </em>428, 431 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Defendant complains that when he retracted his not guilty pleas and entered pleas of <em>non vult, </em>the prosecutor\u2019s representative stated: \u201cYou understand that the plea of <em>non vult </em>is practically the same as pleading guilty to the indictment ?\u201d The argument is that the statement was inaccurate, the plea being the equivalent of a plea of guilty, and that defendant was misled by the statement into believing the plea \u201cwould entail less serious consequences.\u201d When this kind of question is raised, the fundamental issue is whether the plea \u201cwas entered under circumstances which rendered its acceptance fundamentally unfair or shocking to a sense of justice.\u201d If so, the resulting conviction violates the due process clause and may be relieved by writ of <em>habeas corpus. State v. Cynkowski, </em>10 <em>N. J. </em>571, 576 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\"> We do not believe defendant\u2019s position has merit. When the prosecutor stated that the plea of <em>non vult </em>was practically the same as a plea of guilty, his statement was calculated, in our opinion, to convey to the defendant that he might expect practically or substantially the same sentence on a plea of <em>non vult </em>as he might expect on a plea of guilty, not a lesser sentence. Indeed prosecutor\u2019s representative\u2019s statement was a benefit to the defendant rather than a disservice to him. Moreover, it was substantially correct as a matter of law. See <em>Johnson v. State, </em>18 <em>N. J. </em>422, 429 (1955); <em>State v. Pometti, </em>12 <em>N. J. </em>446, 452 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">Defendant also argues that since he had been charged on four indictments, the reading by the prosecutor at the arraignment for the change of plea of only the numbers rather than the language of the two indictments on which he was changing his plea was unfair, as he was not thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>apprised as to which of the indictments he was pleading to, nor, consequently, as to the seriousness of the offenses involved. This contention is frivolous. Defendant was represented by counsel on the occasion of the entry of these pleas. The very purpose of the arraignment was to enter changes of plea on the indictments for rape and assault with intent to rape. It is to be presumed that both defendant and his counsel knew that the indictment numbers read on the call were for those indictments and not for the other indictments (for robbery and atrocious assault and battery). No question was raised at the time as to the identity of the indictments, and defendant does not now contend that he was actually under a misapprehension at that time as to which of the four separate and distinct crimes charged in the four indictments were involved in indictments numbered 603 and 604, to which he pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
