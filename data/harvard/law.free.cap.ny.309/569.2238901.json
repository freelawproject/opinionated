While the traditional formula \u2014 rate base x rate of return = return \u2014 still has general acceptance as an approach to the problem of arriving at just and reasonable rates, the so-called \u201c fair value \u201d rate base has been thoroughly discredited and repudiated. <em>(Smyth </em>v. <em>Ames, </em>169 U.

The Public Service Law requires the commission to establish and permit the imposition of \u2018 \u2018 just and reasonable \u201d rates \u2014nothing more, nothing less. It does not prescribe any exclusive method or process by which such rates shall be determined. <em>(Matter of Village of Saratoga Springs </em>v. <em>Saratoga Gas, Elec.

The Public Service Law directive to determine just and reasonable telephone rates, modified by a procedural prescription for due regard to a return upon the \u201cvalue\u201d of the utility\u2019s property, evinces no legislative intent to require rates to be determined, as a matter of substantive law, on the basis of the procedural doctrine of 1 \u2018 fair value \u2019 \u2019 or any of its offshoot theories, or on the basis of market or exchange value. <em>(Power Comm. </em>v. <em>Pipeline Co., </em>315 U.

The petition is framed under subdivision 6 of section 1296 of the Civil Practice Act which presents for review the question <em>\u201c </em>whether there was any competent proof of all the facts necessary to be proved in order to authorize the determination.\u201d Yet, the opinions and briefs below disclose that the sole question there litigated and determined was whether the commission, in excluding evidence of the theoretical cost of reproducing the petitioner\u2019s property, violated an alleged rule of law claimed to arise out of subdivision 1 of section 97 of the Public Service Law. It would seem, therefore, that the petition should more properly be cast under subdivision 5 of section 1296 of the Civil Practice Act to present for review the question of \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>whether, in making the determination, any rule of law affecting the rights of the parties thereto has been violated to the prejudice of the petitioner. \u2019 \u2019 II. The majority of the Appellate Division, in construing subdivision 1 of section 97 of the Public Service Law, failed to apply the time-tested rules of construction applicable to such legislation. <em>(Power Comm. </em>v. <em>Hope Gas Co., </em>320 U.

The mandate of section 97 that the commission shall give due regard to a reasonable average return upon the value of the telephone company\u2019s property actually used in the public service requires the commission to hear and consider evidence showing that the value of the property differs from its depreciated original cost. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Broadway R.

The courts of every one of the nine sister States where the problem has arisen have held that, despite the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the <em>Hope </em>case, statutes which by their terms or established construction direct a commission to consider the value of a utility\u2019s property in fixing rates require the admission of evidence of value such as that offered here. <em>(Solar Elec.

The long and consistent administrative, legislative and judicial constructions of the rate-fixing provisions of the Public Service Law, as requiring utility rates to be based on fair value, preclude a contrary construction. <em>(Matter of New York Tel.

The <em>Hope </em>case does not support the commission\u2019s attempted rejection of the fair value rate base.

As interpreted, the several rate-making sections of our Public Service Law must be construed as prescribing that the same standards be applied for all utility rate making. <em>(Matter of Doyle, </em>257 N.

The weight to be given such evidence, as we shall indicate later, is quite another matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Until the 1944 decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Federal Power Comm. </em>v. <em>Hope Natural Gas Co. </em>(320 U. S. 591), the resolution of the issue before us would have required consideration of constitutional principles as enunciated in the frequently cited case of <em>Smyth </em>v. <em>Ames </em>(169 U. S. 466) decided in 1898. There the Supreme Court held that in determining reasonable rates upon the fair value of a utility\u2019s property used in the public service, regulatory bodies must take into consideration various factors, including both original costs and reproduction value. However, in 1944, that court determined that the Constitution did not mandate consideration of reproduction cost or any other specific factor in fixing rates, provided the end result \u2014 the rate fixed \u2014 be just and reasonable <em>(Federal Power Comm. </em>v. <em>Hope Natural Gas Co., supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">With the <em>constitutional </em>barrier thus removed, public utility rate making in this State remained nonetheless subject to our <em>statutory </em>mandate. Section 97 of the Public Service Commission Law, which is the governing statute in telephone rate proceedings, provides: <em>\u201c </em>the commission <em>shall, </em>with <em>due regard, among other things, to </em>a reasonable average return upon the <em>value </em>of the property <em>actually used </em>in the public service and to the necessity of making reservation out of income for surplus and contingencies, determine the just and reasonable rates \u201d. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The telephone company contends that the above language requires the commission to give due regard to a reasonable return upon a rate base consisting of the present value of its plant, and has offered evidence before the commission as to its current reproduction cost. The commission, however, has refused to receive the \u201c bulk \u201d of such evidence, taking the position that it would use a 1 \u2018so-called investment rate base: one based on original cost less the actual depreciation reserve \u201d, and that the language of the statute is not mandatory, or that, even if it were, it would not require the commission to accept proof of reproduction cost. The majority of the Appellate Division has rejected the position of the commission, and ruled that the proffered evidence of reproduction cost was improperly refused. In our view, this conclusion is inescapable in light of the history and clear language of the Public Service Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>The legislative history of section 97 and related sections is set forth adequately in the prevailing opinion below, and it will serve no useful purpose to review it here. In sum, it clearly obviates any mere accident of language in the various statutes whence the commission derives its authority to fix rates for specific utilities. There can be no doubt that the Legislature, in enacting the Public Service Law, <em>intended </em>the difference between those factors which the commission shall consider \u201c among other things \u201d when determining (1) telephone and railroad rates [a just and reasonable return \u2018 \u2018 upon the value of the property actually used in the public service \u201d (telephone corporations: \u00a7 97; railroad corporations: \u00a7 49, both of which embrace large territories in the State)] and (2) those of other utilities [a just and reasonable return upon \u201c capital actually expended\u201d (omnibus corporations: \u00a7 63-b; gas and electric corporations: \u00a7 72; steam corporations: \u00a7 85; waterworks corporations : \u00a7 89-j, utilities more local in scope) ].</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">There is additional evidence that the language of section 97 was deliberately chosen. By chapter 134 of the Laws of 1921, the Legislature amended sections 49 and 97 of the Public Service Law which then provided that the commission \u201c shall, with due regard, among other things, to a reasonable average return upon the value of the property actually used in the public service * * * determine the just and reasonable \u201d rates, by causing <em>\u201c </em>shall \u201d to read \u201c may \u201d and by inserting the words \u201c in its discretion \u201d before \u201c determine \u201d. However, promptly following requests made by Governor Miller (his Papers, 1921, pp. 92-94), the Legislature, among other things, deleted the amendments and restored sections 49 and 97 to their previous mandatoiy form (L. 1921, ch. 335), which is also their present form.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Indeed, for many years, the commission construed section 97 as requiring a finding of \u201cvalue \u201d, and recognized that, under the <em>statute, </em>aside from constitutional considerations, \u201c value \u201d was something very different from original cost, as, e.g., <em>Matter of Stone </em>v. <em>New York Tel. Co. </em>(26 N. Y. St. Dept. Rep. 235 [1921]); <em>Matter of Buck </em>v. <em>New York Tel. Co. </em>(26 N. Y. St. Dept. Rep. 455 [1921]); <em>Matter of New York Tel. Co. </em>(29 N. Y. St. Dept. Rep. 1 [1923]); <em>Matter of New York Tel. Co. </em>(34 N. Y. St. Dept. Rep. 621 [1926]).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Moreover, in its rule IV governing rate proceedings, after providing that \u201c the utility shall establish by competent evidence the original cost of the property used and useful in the service * * * and the accrued depreciation thereon \u201d (subd. 8), the commission also provided: \u201c <em>Evidence of reproduction cost </em>need not be submitted <em>but if presented </em>it shall be shown by * * * [a prescribed method] and the corresponding original cost and book cost of the property \u201d is also required to be shown if the book cost differs from the original cost (subd. 10). Subdivision 11 further provides: \u201c <em>If evidence of reproduction cost is submitted, </em>the accrued depreciation * * * shall be shown * * *. <em>Reproduction cost without accrued depreciation is not an element </em>in determining the <em>value </em>of the property <em>for the purpose of computing a return </em>and will not be accepted as such \u201d (Buies of Procedure of Public Service Comm., eff. July 1, 1943, as amd., rule IV; 4 N. Y. Official Compilation of Codes, Bules &amp; Begulations, pp. 6-7; all emphasis supplied). Thus, by its own rules, it clearly indicates that such evidence may be submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Despite its interpretation of section 97 over the years, and its own rules which were in effect prior to the <em>Hope </em>case <em>(supra), </em>and <em>still are, </em>the commission now takes the view that the same statute and said rules authorize it to bar proof of reproduction cost less depreciation as some evidence of the value of the company\u2019s property actually used in the public service. It took this view, it says, for the first time in 1945, one year after the <em>Hope </em>case, in <em>Matter of Staten Is. Edison Corp. </em>(60 P. U. R. [N. <em>S.] </em>385, 421).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">But the <em>Hope </em>case, of course, could not amend our statute. Only the Legislature may do that. Since it has not chosen to do so, although well over a decade has elapsed since the Supreme Court removed the aforesaid constitutional barrier, section 97 continues to require that the commission <em>shall </em>\u201cdetermine the just and reasonable rates \u201d \u201cwith due regard, <em>among other things </em>\u201d, to a reasonable average return upon the present value of the company\u2019s plant, i.e., \u201cproperty actually used in the public service \u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">The concept of value, of course, is quite different from that of cost, and the expression \u201c actually used \u201d connotes a present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>use. Thus the commission is required to receive proof of reproduction cost less depreciation as some evidence of present value in the case of utility property which, due to the unique restrictions placed upon it by law, cannot readily be valued by other usual methods, such as so-called \u201cmarket\u201d, \u201csales\u201d or \u201c exchange \u201d value.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">This is not to say that the rates must be <em>based </em>upon reproduction cost less depreciation. As the commission itself states, it is under no statutory or other obligation to confine itself to consideration of any particular one of the various alternative rate bases. All that the statute says is that the commission shall \u201c determine the just and reasonable rates \u201d with \u201c due regard, among other things, to a reasonable average return upon the value of the property actually used in the public service \u201d. \u201c Due regard \u201d to one factor \u201c among other things \u201d requires consideration of that factor. It is by no means controlling. While price indices rise in some periods, in others the general level of prices declines. What consideration is to be given to \u201c value \u201d \u201c among other things \u201d is for the commission to decide, having in mind that the overriding principle governing its primary duty is that it shall determine \u2018 \u2018 just and reasonable rates \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">\u201c Due regard \u201d, as the Supreme Court of the United States has said, \u201c calls for the exercise of discretion \u201d <em>(Opp Cotton Mills </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>312 U. S. 126, 151). \u201c To give due consideration to a particular factor necessarily means to give such weight or significance to it as under the circumstances it seems to merit, and this, of course, involves discretion \u201d <em>(United States ex rel. Maine Potato Growers &amp; Shippers Assn. </em>v. <em>Interstate Commerce Comm., </em>88 F. 2d 780, 783, certiorari denied 300 U. S. 684). In <em>Railroad Comm. </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas Co. </em>(302 U. S. 388), Chief Justice Hughes said (p. 398): \u201cWhile the Court has frequently declared that 1 in order to determine present value, the cost of reproducing the property is a relevant fact which should have appropriate consideration, \u2019 we have been careful to point out that \u2018 the Court has not decided that the cost of reproduction furnishes an exclusive test \u2019 and in that relation we have <em>\u2018 </em>emphasized the danger in resting conclusions upon estimates of a conjectural character.\u2019 \u201d (See, also, <em>People </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number><em>ex rel. Consolidated Water Co. </em>v. <em>Maltbie, </em>275 N. Y. 357, appeal dismissed on the ground that \u201c no substantial federal question is presented \u201d, 303 U. S. 158.)</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">If, then, as we believe, the statute has a clear and definite meaning by its plain language and in the light of its .legislative history, neither the commission nor the courts may presume to say that its meaning must now be changed because it reflects an approach to rate making which may currently be unpopular with some experts. Although it is urged that the language of the statute represents the survival of a theory of rate making which is unsound and outmoded, it may here be noted that the element of reproduction cost, which was introduced for the protection of the public as a means of avoiding rates based upon an excessive and unreasonable capital structure, may also serve as a potential safeguard for the public in times of recession. Nor is it without some significance that, after much debate, the 1938 Constitutional Convention recommended, and the People of the State subsequently approved \u2014 forty years after <em>Smyth </em>v. <em>Ames (supra) </em>\u2014 a provision guaranteeing to municipally owned utilities a fair return on <em>\u201c the value of the property used and useful in such public utility service \u201d </em>(N. Y. Const., art. Ill, \u00a7 18; emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">In any event, if indeed the advocates for a prudent investment or any other theory are correct and it is time for a change, that decision is not ours to make. The function of the judiciary is not to choose between different theories of rate making on the sole basis of their alleged merits. All arguments concerning such matters should properly be addressed to the Legislature which, within constitutional limits, may adopt or favor one over the other \u2014 as it did in 1934 (L. 1934, ch. 287) in section 114 of the Public Service Law, relating to the fixing of temporary rates \u2014 or may rely upon the <em>expertise </em>of the commission by empowering them to employ methods and procedures reflecting current trends in economic thought. Neither we, nor any other court, have the power to amend the law as written <em>(Meltzer </em>v. <em>Koenigsberg, </em>302 N. Y. 523).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The department stores, intervenors-appellants, urge that we uphold the commission on the basis of the alleged invalidity of rates for business service, as proposed by the telephone com-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>pony, in that the company failed to sustain its proposed rates as to business service. Since the question of allocation of rates was never reached below, this is a matter which must be reserved for the commission upon rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The order below should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b613-6\">Dye, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUqq\">(dissenting). , I dissent and vote to reverse the order of the court below and to confirm and reinstate the determination of the Public Service Commission, with costs in all courts, on the ground that the cost of reproducing the petitioner\u2019s multimillion dollar plant is not material or relevant in the computation of a value rate base. Subdivision 1 of section 97 of the Public Service Law, as I read it, does not mandate the Public Service Commission to employ any exclusive method or process for the determination of a just and reasonable value rate basis, nor does it require such commission to deal differently with separate types of utilities, but rather it requires it to use any fair and reasonable method or process to ascertain a just and reasonable value base, as long as it gives \u201c due regard * * * to a reasonable average return upon the value of the property actually used in the public service \u201d (\u00a797, subd. 1). Upon this record, I am satisfied it did so here, particularly as the petitioner does not claim that the rates allowed are either unjust or unreasonable.
