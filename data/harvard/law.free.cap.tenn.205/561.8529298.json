Justice Prewitt,</author>\n<p id=\"Akc\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">The question presented in this cause is whether a suit will lie to enjoin the county and the County Board of Education from maintaining a nuisance near one of the large grammar schools in the Sixth Civil District of Knox County.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">It seems that the county and the School Board had installed a modern sewage treatment plant at the school, which was attended by about 500 pupils on an average daily attendance.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">The principal charge in the bill is that in the operation of this sanitary sewage disposal plant noxious odors emit therefrom, and that the plant has no covering on it; that it is accessible to flies, and then this filth is thrown into a public ditch within a short distance of the home of the complainant in this neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">There was a demurrer to the bill, which was overruled by the Chancellor, and a temporary injunction ordered and this appeal resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">The county, although acting in its governmental capacity, is not authorized to commit and maintain a public nuisance and this seems to be the general rule. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>See 42 C.J.S. Indemnity secs. 32, 36, pp. 618 and 630; <em>Lees v. Sampson Land Company, </em>372 Pa. 126, 92 A.2d 692, 40 A.L.R.2d beginning at 1171 through 1207; 49 A.L.R.2d beginning at page 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">\"We think the case of <em>Williams v. Cross, </em>16 Tenn.App. 454, 65 S.W.2d 198, is in point and involves the right to enjoin the maintenance of a nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The case of <em>City of Murfreesboro v. Haynes, </em>18 Tenn. App. 653, 82 S.W.2d 236, was a case of the landowner suing the City of Murfreesboro for polluting the river and first syllabus in that case holds that the city is liable although acting as a governmental agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">In <em>Pierce v. Gibson County, </em>107 Tenn. 224, 64 S.W. 33, 555 L.R.A. 477, it was held that these governmental functions do not authorize the maintenance of a nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">The appellants here urge that the rule is stated in <em>Odil v. Maury County, </em>175 Tenn. 550, 136 S.W.2d 500, and <em>Buckcholtz v. Hamilton County, </em>180 Tenn. 263, 174 S.W.2d 455. However, these cases involve tort actions for damages and have no application in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">It results that we find no error in the decree of the Chancellor and it is affirmed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
