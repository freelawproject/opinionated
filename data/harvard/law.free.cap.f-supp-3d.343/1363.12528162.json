In reaching this conclusion, the lower court relied on a \"sliding scale approach\" that took into account the defendant's \"extensive contacts with California\" generally, as well as the similarities between the non-resident plaintiffs' claims and those of the resident plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The defendant challenged the court's exercise of specific personal jurisdiction with regard to the non-resident plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Supreme Court sided with the defendant company.

The Court emphasized that although a court with general jurisdiction over a defendant may hear \"any claim against that defendant, even if all the incidents underlying the claim occurred in a different state,\" the California court could exercise only specific jurisdiction in accordance with \"settled principles\" requiring \"an affiliation between the forum and the underlying controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1780-81 (citing\n   <em>\n    Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v.

The\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   Court explained that this \"burden\" requires consideration of more than such practical inconveniences as the defendant being made to litigate in\n   distant forums, also encompassing \"the more abstract matter of submitting to the coercive power of a State that may have little legitimate interest in the claims in question.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Moreover, Justice Sotomayor noted in her dissent that \"[t]he Court today does not confront the question whether its opinion here would also apply to a class action in which a plaintiff injured in the forum State seeks to represent a nationwide class of plaintiffs, not all of whom were injured there.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1789 n.4 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting).

In contrast to a mass tort action, the class action requirements of Rule 23 ensure that the \"defendant is presented with a unitary, coherent claim to which it need respond only with a unitary, coherent defense\" and, as such, the Court \"perceives no unfairness in haling the defendant into court to answer to it in a forum that has specific jurisdiction over the defendant based on the representative's claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Sanchez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524032\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/297/1360/\">\n    297 F.Supp.3d at 1366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Molock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524013\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/297/114/\">\n    297 F.Supp.3d at 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that the \"additional elements of a class action supply due process safeguards not applicable in the mass tort context.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Additionally, the Court is concerned about the impracticality of conducting a specific jurisdiction analysis when the contacts of each absent class member are not yet known. In mass tort actions, each plaintiff is a real party in interest to the complaint. Therefore, information regarding his or her contacts with the defendant and the forum state are easily ascertainable. In class actions, however, the litigation is generally conducted by named parties as representatives. In this case, Plaintiff has not yet moved for class certification. By limiting Plaintiff's class action to a Georgia-only class, the Court is concerned about the possibility of excluding non-resident class members who do have contacts with Defendants establishing specific jurisdiction.
