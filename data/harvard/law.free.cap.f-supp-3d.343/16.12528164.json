(\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , [Docs. ## 69, 96].)

The Second\n   Circuit deemed the argument \"merifless\" and instructed that, even with assets held in their name, Relief Defendants needed to first \"identify any improperly frozen assets\" and apply for their release before the SEC would be \"required to carry its burden of demonstrating that any such identified assets are either ill-gotten gains to which Relief Defendants do not have a legitimate claim or that Iftikar in fact owns the assets in question.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12124341\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/664/53/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 57 (citing\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Relief Defendants subsequently hired an expert \"to counter the Commission's argument that the Relief Defendants are mere nominees.\" ( [Doc. # 340] at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Since the Second Circuit's ruling, Ms. Ahmed has identified only two allegedly improperly frozen assets: 1) $250,000.00 in rental proceeds from Unit 12A that was previously placed in Fidelity x7540; and (2) nine 1-kilogram gold bars discovered in jointly-owned safety deposit boxes. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Doc. # 442].) The Court rejected these requests, finding that neither asset belonged to her: \"Ms. Ahmed is not entitled to proceeds of Unit 12A because she was only a nominal owner of the condominium\" and \"[e]ven Relief Defendants' Motion does not contain an explicit allegation of Ms. Ahmed's ownership of the Gold Bars, and the SEC has pointed to testimony which demonstrates that Ms. Ahmed had no knowledge of the existence of the bars.\" ( [Doc. # 658] at 3-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following the Court's Summary Judgment Ruling on Liability, Relief Defendants were ordered to-and agreed to-\"provide a list identifying all assets they claim belong to them, and the reasons why they claim such ownership.\" ( [Doc. # 842] at 3.) On April 27, 2018, Relief Defendants filed the required list. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Relief Defendant's Asset List [Doc. # 862] ). Despite having made claims to only five frozen assets during the preceding three years of litigation (all of which were rejected), Ms. Ahmed and her young children now claim to own more than $85 million in frozen assets.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3822871\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/653/121/#p128\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Neither Relief Defendants' Asset List, nor any other submissions to the Court, explain how Relief Defendants controlled the assets or how they were acquired.

Relief Defendants cry foul, claiming entitlement to a jury on the question of whether specific assets belong to them, or are in fact owned by Mr. Ahmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Relief Defendants provide no convincing authority supporting their position that\n   ownership of the assets in this context is a question of fact that must be determined by a jury. They attempt to characterize the SEC's theory of recovery against Relief Defendants as one of fraudulent conveyance, a question of common law rather than equity, in order to show entitlement to a jury trial. However, their sole cited case involves a private lawsuit in which the government intervened to enforce tax liens against two defendants by proceeding against a third defendant under the theory that it was a nominee for the first two.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iantosca v.

In evaluating that likelihood, a court may consider such factors as the degree of scienter involved; the sincerity of the defendant's assurances against future violations; the recurrent or isolated nature of the infraction; the defendant's recognition of the wrongful nature of his conduct; and the likelihood, given defendant's occupation, that future violations may occur.\n   <em>\n    SEC v.

(Def.'s Opp'n at 40.) Despite these noble proclamations, the above factors weigh in favor of issuing an injunction here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant's violation was not an isolated incident, rather he continuously violated the securities laws for nearly a decade while employed at Oak. Moreover, Defendant committed these violations with the highest degree of scienter-\"Defendant opened bank accounts he alone controlled that were deceptively titled in the name of Oak and its portfolio companies, which he then used to divert monies intended for Oak funds or its portfolio companies into his and his wife's personal bank accounts.\"\n   <em>\n    Ahmed II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525037\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/308/628/#p636\">\n    308 F.Supp.3d at 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendant's solo, flagrant, fraudulent conduct took place over many years, it was undoubtedly willful, with the sole motivation being to personally profit at the expense of his victims, whose resulting losses were immense. Defendant not only fled the country following his indictment on criminal charges in Massachusetts, but he has consistently and indignantly denied any wrongdoing whatsoever throughout the course of this litigation. There is no doubt Defendant utilized his professional talents and position to commandeer investors' funds purely for personal gain. Additionally, Defendant has not demonstrated that his financial condition warrants any downward adjustment, and his contention that the fine should be reduced based upon his inability to pay deserves little attention given that the SEC has already secured assets which are likely sufficient to satisfy the total award.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    The Court is of the view that a civil penalty in the amount of $21 million, representing just over half of the total disgorgement\n    amount, is reasonable and justified on the facts of this case, which is far from a mere slap on the wrist, and is sufficient to effectuate the punitive and deterrent purposes of such penalties, while not being greater than necessary.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Razmilovic\n    </em>\n    , 822 F.Supp.2d at 281-82.\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    <strong>\n     C.

Relief Defendants object to the process being used by the Court, arguing that it \"would, among other things, improperly shift the burden of proof to Relief Defendants, requiring them to establish ownership over assets held in their names.\" ( [Doc. # 862 at 1.] ) According to Relief Defendants, the SEC is asking the Court to find that Relief Defendants are nominal owners of Mr. Ahmed's assets without providing an asset-by-asset analysis, which they claim is required under state law.

The Court rejects this attempt to avoid the burden of presenting evidence establishing Relief Defendants' ownership.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Relief Defendants have had every opportunity to refute the SEC's claim that Defendant actually owns all of the frozen assets throughout the course of this litigation, and yet have failed to do so. They cannot establish ownership of these assets simply by again complaining that the SEC has to prove that Mr. Ahmed controlled and benefited from assets in Relief Defendants' names, without offering any evidence that Relief Defendants in fact controlled and owned these assets. On the other hand, the SEC does put forth evidence that the seized assets belong to Mr. Ahmed and were placed in the names of Relief Defendants as nominees only, in an effort to protect and hide the fraudulently obtained assets.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Even Relief Defendant's own expert report found that from 2004 through 2014, Ms. Shalini Ahmed earned just over $1.9 million in gross income, and that all other \"non-suspect\" sources of income, totaling $62,758,960.96, belonged to Mr. Ahmed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    (Ex. 15 (R. Def.'s Expert Report [Doc. # 888-15] ) to SEC's Mot. for Judgment \u00b6 20.) Thus, 98.8% of all funds that the Ahmeds received during the past fourteen years came from Defendant. In light of these facts, it is difficult to see, and neither Defendant nor Relief Defendants provide any argument, much less a credible explanation, how Ms. Ahmed and her children could own more than $85 million in assets while Defendant owns less than $6 million in liquid assets. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    [Doc. 862-1] at 4.) Furthermore, the Ahmeds' lavish lifestyle greatly exceeded Ms. Ahmed's earnings over this ten year period, as Ms. Ahmed admitted her living expenses exceeded $46,000 per month. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    [Doc. # 69] at 14.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Moreover, in her interrogatory responses, Ms. Ahmed claimed only to own a few assets,\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n    and never supplemented this response to assert ownership of anywhere near the $85 million of assets she now claims belong to her and her children.\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n    Further undermining her claim, Ms. Ahmed was unable to remember receiving more than $25 million in checks from Defendant, money she now claims to have managed (as discussed below).\n    <footnotemark>\n     15\n    </footnotemark>\n    Both Defendant and Ms. Ahmed refused to testify about the transfer and placement of assets into her name (aside from those that were nominally placed into Ms. Ahmed's name as a contingency plan). Defendant invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination,\n    <footnotemark>\n     16\n    </footnotemark>\n    and Ms. Ahmed invoked the marital privilege.\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      2.

Rather than explain why the factors above demonstrate that specific assets are indeed Relief Defendants' and should not be used to satisfy any judgment, Relief Defendants' Schedule A [Doc. # 862-1] offers as the basis for ownership only four \"additional reasons for Relief Defendants' ownership,\" three of which the SEC correctly argues, even if taken as true, do not prevent the SEC from using the asset to satisfy a judgment against Defendant.\n    <footnotemark>\n     18\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    First, Relief Defendants' contention that the SEC cannot collect any assets acquired more than five-years before the SEC commenced the action is incorrect. Although after\n    <em>\n     Kokesh\n    </em>\n    the SEC is no longer able to seek a disgorgement award for fraudulent conduct that occurred more than five years before the initiation of an action, it remains free to collect against all of Defendant's assets, no matter when they were acquired, in order to satisfy a judgment.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     SEC v.

Circuit noted, \"the requirement of a causal relationship between a wrongful act and the property to be disgorged does not imply that a court may order a malefactor to disgorge only the actual property obtained by means of his wrongful act.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"192887\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/494/1301/#p1309\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    It went on to explain that \"the causal connection required is between the amount by which the defendant was unjustly enriched and the amount he can be required to disgorge.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"192887\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/494/1301/#p1309\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Thus, these reasons would be relevant only if Relief Defendants could show that the asset in question was purchased or funded with\n    <em>\n     their\n    </em>\n    untainted funds, as opposed to Mr. Ahmed's.\n    <footnotemark>\n     20\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Accordingly, assets to which Relief Defendants claim ownership on any of these three grounds, and on no other basis, may be collected by the SEC to satisfy the judgment against Defendant.\n    <footnotemark>\n     21\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Relief Defendants' final reason for ownership, that an asset was a gift from a non-party, the SEC agrees is grounds for precluding the asset from being used to satisfy a judgment against Defendant. Still, Relief Defendants must offer some evidence that these were indeed gifts received from someone other than Mr. Ahmed, and have failed to do so here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      3. Ms. Ahmed's Claim of Managing Assets\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    In addition to the reasons listed in Relief Defendants' Schedule A, which as discussed above do not preclude a finding that those assets are available to satisfy a judgment against Defendant, Relief Defendants argue that most of the assets belong to them because Ms. Ahmed \"contributed materially to developing and enhancing the corpus of marital property[,]\" giving \"her a cognizable right to that property.\" (R. Def.'s Opp'n at 19.) The SEC counters that Ms. Ahmed's \"sudden management claim\" is belied by the evidence and inconsistent with this Court's previous rejections of her claims to specific assets.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    According to Relief Defendants, the fact that Mr. and Ms. Ahmed are married is critical because the quantum of proof needed to show that one spouse is the equitable owner of an asset titled to the other is meaningfully higher than where the primary defendant and relief defendant are not married. The sole case they cite in support of this contention,\n    <em>\n     In re Vebeliunas\n    </em>\n    , deals with the question of whether the veil of an irrevocable trust could be pierced under New York State law based on the argument that the debtor was the equitable owner of the trust.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9121132,9112790\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/332/85/\">\n     332 F.3d 85\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2d Cir. 2003). There, the court found that the trust's equitable owner was the debtor's spouse, who had funded the trust with her own assets earned by investing her inheritance.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9121132,9112790\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/332/85/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9121132,9112790\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/332/85/\">\n     at 92\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The court observed that because spouses \"routinely share certain financial assets, such as streams of income,\" and \"routinely administer each other's assets and conduct business on behalf of each other,\" these facts did not evidence control by the debtor\n    over the trust.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9121132,9112790\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/332/85/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9121132,9112790\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/332/85/\">\n     at 92-93\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Here, though, Ms. Ahmed has not demonstrated that any of the assets were purchased or funded by her, and in fact the evidence is to the contrary, considering that nearly all of the funds acquired by the Ahmeds were earned or stolen by Defendant.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Specifically, as mentioned above, the Second Circuit held Defendant's salary belongs to him and was properly frozen to preserve his ability to pay an eventual judgment and, in the face of Ms. Ahmed's claims of managing certain assets, found that aside from her stock options and retirement accounts, which were unfrozen, she \"failed to identify any other particular contributions to the marital estate.\"\n    <em>\n     I-Cubed Domains, LLC\n    </em>\n    , 664 Fed.

To the extent Ms. Ahmed now attempts to argue that she acted as the \"family CIO\" and that this contribution entitles her to at least a portion of the marital estate, her argument misses the mark.\n    <footnotemark>\n     22\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Even if Ms. Ahmed legitimately managed the family assets, Relief Defendants provide no authority that where a spouse manages assets which were fraudulently acquired by the other spouse, the spouse managing those assets somehow gains an ownership interest in them such that the assets cannot be used to satisfy a judgment against the other spouse.

Because the\n    <em>\n     Penn\n    </em>\n    court reasoned that the defendant \"is not required to disgorge amounts that he has already repaid [to the fund,]\" it ordered an evidentiary hearing to determine what, if any, value was received by the fund from Penn's forfeiture.

Appointment of a Receiver and Establishment of a Fair Fund\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    The authority of the district court to appoint a receiver to marshal, collect, and maintain assets, including judgments, with a view to distribution is well-established and appropriate where necessary to effectuate the purposes of the securities laws.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     SEC v.

The SEC requests that a receiver be appointed to take control of all Defendant's assets, held in his name and the name of nominees, with the goal of repatriating the assets to victims. Plaintiff suggests that a receiver is necessary to oversee the sale of illiquid (and difficult to value) assets. Defendants protest that a receivership is not necessary here, arguing that since there is only one victim, Oak, there is no need to appoint a receiver to sort through competing claims, and that appointing a receiver would also result in unneeded costs.\n    <footnotemark>\n     25\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    It will likely be necessary to appoint a receiver to hold the currently frozen funds and who will then effectuate a mechanism for distribution of assets to victims in accordance with this Ruling. The receiver would then ensure the return of any frozen assets to Defendant in excess of the amount required to satisfy the judgment against him. The appointment and scope of the receiver's duties will be determined post judgment. The SEC may submit a proposed receivership order for consideration by the Court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Moreover, the SEC requests that the Court place Defendant's assets into a Fair Fund to compensate the victims of his fraud. A \"fair fund for investors\" is provided for by law:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n    If, in any judicial or administrative action brought by the Commission under the securities laws, the Commission obtains a civil penalty against any person for a violation of such laws, or such person agrees, in settlement of any such action, to such civil penalty, the amount of such civil penalty shall, on the motion or at the direction of the Commission, be added to and become part of a disgorgement fund or other fund established for the benefit of the victims of such violation.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207246\">\n     15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7246\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a). Thus, a Fair Fund affords \"the SEC ... flexibility by permitting it to distribute civil penalties among defrauded investors by adding the civil penalties to the disgorgement fund.\"\n    <em>\n     Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors of WorldCom, Inc. v.

The parties will be given an opportunity post-judgment to address the propriety and necessity of establishing a Fair Fund under these facts and circumstances.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    <strong>\n     III. Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, the SEC's Motion for Remedy and Judgment is GRANTED with modification, for a total of $62,920,639.00 plus prejudgment interest for the period of time prior to the asset freeze,\n    <footnotemark>\n     27\n    </footnotemark>\n    and all interest and gains returned on the frozen assets during the pendency of the freeze.

All of the assets listed on the SEC's Asset Schedule, which are currently frozen, are available to satisfy this judgment against Defendant.

Ahmed Family Trust and the children's Uniform Transfer to Minors Act (\"UTMA\") accounts cannot be used to satisfy a judgment against Defendant because the beneficiaries are Defendant's descendants and the SEC has not shown they were funded by Defendant's illicit gains. (R. Def.'s Opp'n at 5.) Relatedly, Relief Defendants maintain that the MetLife insurance policy is also exempt from collection because it is owned by the Family Trust for the benefit of the minor children. The SEC counters that the Family Trust was funded with Defendant's money, including approximately $1.577 million from the Company G fraud and approximately $2.0 million from the Company I fraud. (Ex. A) (Defendant writing checks deposited to Family Trust). Because the evidence establishes only that Defendant funded this Trust, and there is no indication that any other Relief Defendant also did so, the Court is satisfied that the Family Trust was funded and created using Defendant's money and therefore can be used to satisfy a judgment against him.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-119\">\n     In addition, Relief Defendants contend that the Family Trust is entitled to a significant portion of the Rakitfi Holdings account at Northern Trust ending x5218 because Defendant assigned 99% of his interest in Rakitfi Holdings LLC to the Family Trust in exchange for a promissory note of $1,510,000 at 2.25% annual interest. (R. Def.'s Opp'n at 6.) However, even if the record supported this claim, because the Court finds that Defendant controls the Family Trust, these funds are available for collection in either event.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"22\">\n    <p id=\"p-120\">\n     Relief Defendants offer emails which they claim demonstrate Ms. Ahmed's management of the family assets.
