No. 6]\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed by plaintiff's counsel, Thomas Cartmell, Esquire, Jeffrey Kuntz, Esquire, and David DeGreeff, Esquire, on behalf of their law firm Wagstaff &amp; Cartmell, LLP (hereinafter collectively referred to as \"counsel\"). No opposition to the motion has\n   been filed. The Court recently held oral argument. Counsel seeks to withdraw because the case is too expensive now that his client has chosen to litigate rather than settle. For the reasons to be discussed, counsel's Motion to Withdraw is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Because the Court writes primarily for the benefit of the parties and the parties are familiar with the background of this matter, only the most salient facts will be set forth. This case is part of a multi-district products liability litigation (\"MDL\") wherein individual plaintiffs, including Terry McDaniel, brought suit against Daiichi Sankyo Inc., Daiichi Sankyo U.S. Holdings, Inc., and Forest Laboratories, Inc. alleging adverse drug reactions to the olmesarten family of pharmaceutical drugs developed and marketed by defendants. Approximately 2,000 related lawsuits are pending before the Court. On or about August 1, 2017, defendants and a committee of plaintiffs' counsel reached an agreement in principal to settle. The agreement was supplemented in 2018. The parties' settlement set up a detailed voluntary settlement program whereby each participant was required to opt in in order to participate. Plaintiff is one of only five claimants who have not elected to participate in the voluntary settlement program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 6, 2018, the Court issued an Order requiring any plaintiff who had not enrolled in the settlement program by the enrollment deadline to appear with counsel before the Court on July 24, 2018. Plaintiff did not enroll in the settlement by the deadline. Accordingly, he appeared with counsel on July 24, 2018. At that hearing, plaintiff informed the Court he did not want to enroll in the settlement program but requested to proceed with his claims individually. The Court offered plaintiff additional time to think about his decision, requiring plaintiff to inform the Court of his final decision by July 30, 2018. On July 30, plaintiff informed the Court of his intent to enroll in the settlement program. [Doc. No. 9]. However, the following day, counsel informed the Court plaintiff changed his mind and was declining to enroll in the settlement program. [Doc. No. 10].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Counsel for plaintiff filed this Motion to Withdraw stating that it is their belief that entering into the settlement program is in the best interest of the plaintiff. Brief in Support of Motion (\"Mot.\") [Doc. No. 6-1] at 2. However, counsel acknowledges plaintiff has the right to move forward with his claims against their recommendation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nevertheless, counsel contends they should be permitted to withdraw primarily because plaintiff's decision to litigate presents a financial burden on counsel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pursuant to L.

Counsel argues: (1) counsel's withdrawal will not have a material adverse effect on plaintiff; (2) requiring counsel to continue\n   to represent plaintiff would place an undue financial burden on counsel; and (3) the retainer agreement between counsel and plaintiff permits counsel to discontinue their representation. After evaluating all relevant factors, the Court finds counsel's motion must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Prejudice to Plaintiff\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Pursuant to RPC 1.16(b)(1) a lawyer may not withdraw from representation unless \"withdrawal can be accomplished without material adverse effect on the interests of the client.\" Counsel contends \"withdrawal as counsel for plaintiff can be accomplished without material adverse effect on his interests.\" Mot. at 1. Counsel points out the case has not been set for trial and discovery has not been completed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7404638\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/814/414/#p422\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Counsel avers the case is in the early stages, therefore, plaintiff \"has time to find a new lawyer, and a new lawyer could easily take this case over without any delay to get up to speed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7404638\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/814/414/#p422\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, counsel argues their withdrawal would not prejudice plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court disagrees with counsel and is convinced plaintiff will be substantially and materially prejudiced if counsel is permitted to withdraw. It is doubtful plaintiff will be able to retain new counsel at this stage in the litigation. Although trial has not been scheduled and discovery is not complete, this MDL has been ongoing since 2015. Because a detailed settlement program has been agreed to, and plaintiff is one of only five plaintiffs who elected to litigate rather than settle, it is almost certain plaintiff will not be able to find counsel willing to represent him. This is a complex drug liability case that will require substantial resources to prosecute. Plaintiff does not have the resources to fund the litigation. Even counsel acknowledges the value of plaintiff's claim is not enough to pay for the necessary litigation expenses to pursue the case. Given this situation, plaintiff will not be able to find new counsel to represent him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Further, counsel represents several hundred other plaintiffs in this MDL. Given their experience acquired throughout the course of this litigation, counsel is or should be knowledgeable regarding the relevant facts, documents, expert testimony, and legal issues in the case. It would take replacement counsel a significant amount of time to become familiar with the case.

Financial Burden on Counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   To support their motion, counsel relies on RPC 1.16(b)(6) which states that an attorney may withdraw his representation if \"the representation will result in unreasonable financial burden on the lawyer or has been rendered unreasonably difficult by the client.\" Counsel argues requiring them \"to continue representing [p]laintiff places an undue financial hardship/burden on them.\" Mot. at 2.

The fact that it will be expensive to litigate the case is not a surprise to counsel. They knew this when they undertook to represent plaintiff.

This is not a sufficient reason to withdraw.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RPC 1.2(a) (\"A lawyer shall abide by a client's decision whether to settle a matter.\"). It has long been recognized that an attorney owes a duty of zealous representation to his or her client.\n   <em>\n    LoBiondo v. Schwartz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4141696\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/199/62/#p100\">\n    199 N.J. 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 100,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=970%20A.2d%201007\">\n    970 A.2d 1007\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). When counsel \"signed up\" hundreds of clients they undertook to represent all of their interests, not just those who elected to settle. Counsel's obligations do not stop when a client rejects a settlement offer. While it will undoubtedly be expensive to litigate the case, this is a risk counsel undertook when they chose to represent plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Haines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7404638\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/814/414/#p422\">\n    814 F.Supp. at 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that when a plaintiff and attorney enter into a contract on a contingency fee basis, the attorney cannot then walk away from the contract simply because \"the case may not generate the return it expected at the outset\"). Counsel's obligations to their client do not evaporate when counsel's economic interests are at risk. As noted in\n   <em>\n    Haines\n   </em>\n   , \"[a]s with all contingency fee arrangements, [the firm] knowingly assumed the risk that its arrangement with [the plaintiff] would not match its initial prediction of costs and returns.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7404638\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/814/414/#p422\">\n    814 F.Supp. at 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, \"the needs and obligations of the contingency fee system dictate that [the law firm] not be permitted to close the door to the courts which it has opened. To permit withdrawal would be to permit the nullification of any contingency fee contract which later turns out to be less profitable than originally thought.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7404638\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/814/414/#p422\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7404638\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/814/414/#p422\">\n    at 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The fact that hundreds of counsel's clients settled is undoubtedly lucrative. Counsel must accept the good with the bad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION AND ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, counsel's motion will be denied.

That motion sought to retract a previous Motion to Withdraw as Counsel filed on the docket [Doc. No. 3]. Because the previous Motion to Withdraw as Counsel [Doc.
