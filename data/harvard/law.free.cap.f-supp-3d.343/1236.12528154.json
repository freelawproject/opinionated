MARTINEZ, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   THIS CAUSE came before the Court on Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction against Defendants SANDBAR BAY, LLC, ALBERTO BORRERO, and JOSEPH LONGO (collectively, \"Defendants\") [ECF No. 5]. Defendants subsequently filed a response in opposition [ECF No. 27]. This Court referred all matters relating to Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction to the Honorable Magistrate Judge to take all necessary and proper action as required by law with respect to Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction [ECF No. 6]. The Magistrate Judge held an evidentiary hearing on Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction [ECF No. 30] and issued a Report and Recommendation, recommending that Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction be DENIED [ECF No 47]. Plaintiff timely filed its objections to the Report and Recommendation (\"Plaintiff's objections\") [ECF No. 50] and Defendants also timely filed their objection to the Report and Recommendation (\"Defendants' objection\") [ECF No. 49]. The Court has reviewed the entire file and record, has made a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the issues that both sets of objections to the Report and Recommendation present and is otherwise fully advised in the premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff has operated a sports bar in Coconut Grove, Sandbar Sports Grill since 1999 [ECF No. 47 \u00b6 4]. On July 28, 2017, Plaintiff \"registered the Sandbar Name and the Sandbar Logo with the State of Florida,\" with said marks having been used \"since May 25, 1999 in connection with bar and restaurant services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. Sandbar Sports Grill in Coconut Grove includes its logo in its menu and on a sign\n   hanging above the bar.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. In addition to its logo, Sandbar Sports Grill in Coconut Grove also has the following slogans: \"Home of the Fish Taco\" and \"Get Rescued From Ordinary Food\".\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. Since its opening, Sandbar Sports Grill in Coconut Grove has \"won awards from various local newspapers and blogs,\" including the New Times Sports Bar of the Year Award, which it has won multiple times, as recently as 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. Sandbar Sports Grill has a social media presence, \"maintain[ing] social media accounts with Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook\" and also markets itself on local radio, advertises in the Miami Hurricanes program guide, and places ads on social media.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant Longo owned an interest in the Sandbar Sports Grill in Coconut Grove until he decided to move out of Miami for personal reasons in 2013 [ECF No. 48, at 55:9-15]. At that time, Defendant Longo sold his shares to Plaintiff's principal, Michael Scott Perrin (\"Perrin\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59:18-20. Defendant Longo also signed a document titled Sale, Transfer and Assignment, and Covenant, which he considered \"a license for him to use the Sandbar name,\" so long as it was not within a ten-mile radius from the Sandbar Sports Grill in Coconut Grove [ECF No. 47 \u00b6 33-34]. Defendant Borrero became a shareholder of Sandbar Sports Grill in Coconut Grove in 2008 [ECF No. 48, at 90:1-5]. In January 2018, Defendant Longo and Defendant Borrero opened Sandbar Sports Grill in Cutler Bay, \"us[ing] the Sandbar logo with a different picture inside the life preserver on its menu.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. Around this time, Plaintiff's principal, Mr. Perrin, \"experienced a drop of between 20 to 40 percent in number of posts and marking images seen by customers,\" and, also claimed that \"any negative publicity regarding inspections of the Sandbar Sports Grill in Cutler Bay would affect the reputation of the Sandbar Sports Grill in Coconut Grove because both are in the same market.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. Plaintiff filed suit against Defendants and subsequently filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction which would prohibit Defendants from using Plaintiff's trademark and trade dress, namely Plaintiff's slogan [ECF No. 5].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After an evidentiary hearing, the Magistrate Judge recommended Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction be denied. Both parties filed objections to the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation. This Court will address each parties' objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Defendants' Objection to Report and Recommendation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants filed a single objection as to the factual findings contained in paragraph 32 of the Report and Recommendation [ECF No. 49]. While the Court notes that the factual finding is not dispositive or material to Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction and that \"[f]indings made on an application for preliminary injunction are not controlling at a later hearing on a permanent injunction,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   this Court will address Defendants' sole objection. Paragraph 32 of the Report and Recommendation states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The day before the closing, Longo received a packet of documents to sign. The packet included a document that prohibited Longo from using the Sandbar Marks in any way, shape or form. Longo could not sign that document because he was already operating a Sandbar Sports Grill in Kentucky, was in the process of opening one in Stuart, Florida, and was planning to open others.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [ECF No. 47]. In their objection, Defendants argue that the day before closing, Defendant Longo received closing documents with no restrictions and it was not until the next day, at closing, that Defendant Longo received a prior version of the stock transfer agreement with a total restriction-a document that Defendant Longo refused to sign because he was already operating a Sandbar and had plans to open another. Defendants specifically included the relevant portions of Defendant Longo's testimony at the evidentiary hearing [ECF No. 49, at 2-4].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the evidence elicited at the evidentiary hearing reflects that Defendant Longo signed all the documents the day before the closing, as instructed by the attorney [ECF No. 48, at 55:21-25] and that he could not sign the documents on the day of the closing \"A) because [he]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   already had in operation a Sandbar Sports Grill in Owensboro, Kentucky, which would violate the agreement, and B) [he] planned on opening up one during this time in Stuart Florida\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 58:5-10) so they \"came up with [a] new document\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 58:11-20). Defendants' objection to the Magistrate Judge's factual finding is limited to the narrow factual finding that Longo chose not to sign the document with a total restriction on the day\n   <em>\n    before the closing\n   </em>\n   , rather, he refused to sign it on the day of the closing. For the foregoing reasons, this Court finds that the record reflects that Longo decided not to sign the document\n   <em>\n    on the day of the closing\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Accordingly, this Court\n   <strong>\n    SUSTAINS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' objection and solely modifies the factual finding in paragraph 32 of the Report and Recommendation, to the extent that Longo decided not to sign the document with the total restriction on the day of the closing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Plaintiff's Objections\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In order for Plaintiff to prevail on its Motion for Preliminary Injunction, it must show by a preponderance of the evidence: (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) irreparable harm; (3) balancing of the equities favors issuance of the injunction; and (4) the public interest will not be disserved.\n   <em>\n    Levi Strauss &amp; Co. v. Sunrise Intern. Trading, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11360720\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/51/982/#p985\">\n    51 F.3d 982\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 985 (11th Cir. 1995). Plaintiff objects to the Magistrate Judge's findings with respect to whether Plaintiff has shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a preliminary injunction is appropriate under the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In order for Plaintiff to succeed on a claim under the Lanham Act, it must establish a prima facie case of trademark infringement by showing that (1) the plaintiff's mark has priority and (2) the defendant's mark is likely to cause consumer confusion.\n   <em>\n    Frehling Enters. v. Int'l Select Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11574368,11574401\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/192/1330/\">\n    192 F.3d 1330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1335 (11th Cir. 1999) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Priority\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff does not object to the Magistrate Judge's finding that, \"Plaintiff has enforceable rights in the Sandbar Marks by virtue of its continued use of the Sandbar Marks since the opening of the Sandbar Sports Grill in Coconut Grove in 1999 [ECF No. 47, at 14]. Therefore, this Court adopts and affirms the Magistrate Judge's finding as to Plaintiff's priority use of the Sandbar Marks. As Plaintiff concedes, \"the only issue before this Court is whether Defendants' use of the Sandbar Marks at the Cutler Bay location is likely to cause confusion\" [ECF No. 50, at 5].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Consumer Confusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In the Eleventh Circuit, likelihood of consumer confusion is determined by evaluating the following factors: (1) type of mark; (2) similarity of mark; (3) similarity of the products the marks represent; (4) similarity of the parties' retail outlets (trade channels) and customers; (5) similarity of advertising media; (6) defendants' intent; and (7) actual confusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Frehling Enters.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11574368,11574401\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/192/1330/\">\n    192 F.3d at 1335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Of these, the type of mark and the evidence of actual confusion are the most important.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11574368,11574401\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/192/1330/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Popular Bank of Florida v.

The Magistrate Judge concluded that the Sandbar Marks are generic because they use the term \"Sports Grill\" to describe a sports bar and restaurant [ECF No. 47, at 15]. However, this Court finds that the use of the term \"Sports Grill\" should not preclude a finding that the Sandbar Marks are arbitrary. Similar to the way \"Sun Bank\" was categorized as an arbitrary mark because \"Sun\" bears no relationship to banking services, neither does \"Sandbar\" bear any relationship to a sports bar and restaurant.\n   <em>\n    Freedom Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"317302\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/757/1176/\">\n    757 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1182 n.5.

This Court therefore adopts and affirms the Magistrate Judge's finding as to the similarity of the Sandbar Marks and the name and logo used by Defendants for the Sandbar Sports Grill in Cutler Bay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    iii.

Similarity of the Parties' Retail Outlets (trade channels) and Customers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff does not object to the Magistrate Judge's finding that Plaintiff and Defendants \"use similar retail outlets, namely, restaurants and bars, and cater to similar customers, namely, those who enjoy a sports bar venue for their restaurant experience\" [ECF No. 47, at 17].

In the Report and Recommendation, the Magistrate Judge notes that \"Plaintiff proffered testimony from Perrin regarding its advertising media\" but failed to present any \"evidence regarding what advertising media Defendants use\" [ECF No. 47, at 17]. However, based on a review of the record evidence in this case, this Court finds that Defendants, like Plaintiff, also advertised on social media [ECF No. 56 at 85] [Defendants' State Court Complaint for Declaratory &amp; Injunction Relief].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    SUSTAINS\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    vi.

In the Report and Recommendation, the Magistrate Judge found: (i) Defendants acted under the belief that they could use Sandbar Marks as long as they complied with the ten-mile Restricted Area (Def. Ex. 3) and (ii) all parties were aware of, and made no objection to, the Sandbar Sports Grills operating in Cocoa Beach and Key West. [ECF No. 47, at 18].

At the evidentiary hearing, Mr. Perrin testified that he oversaw Sandbar Sports Grill's (Coconut Grove) social media accounts and had the administrative passwords for said accounts [ECF No. 48, at 12:23-25, 13:1-4). During his testimony, he\n   was shown \"a collection of a lot of the social media messages or posts or - mostly messages and posts that were all either sent or directed towards Sandbar Coconut Grove, and they all show confusion over the Sandbar in Cutler Bay.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:23-25, 14:1. While this Court notes the Magistrate Judge sustained hearsay objections as to the admissibility of the collection of social media posts and messages to prove actual confusion, the Magistrate Judge did allow said collection as evidence that Mr. Perrine received them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17:8-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   This Court will consider the evidence that Mr. Perrine received reports of confused consumers [ECF No. 37-1, Pl.'s Ex. 4]. Like in\n   <em>\n    Kos\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Perrine received \"numerous and varied reports of alleged confusion\" and the \"factual claim[s]\" shown therein have \"independent evidentiary value tending to show actual confusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Kos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9247262\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/369/700/#p719\">\n    369 F.3d at 719-720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, after a review of the proffered collection of posts and messages, this Court will consider them as probative of the declarant's state of mind. These social media posts and messages included but are not limited to: (1) a request to Sandbar Sports Grill (Coconut Grove) to have \"a relief drive at the Cutler Bay location\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5); (2) customer inquiries as to whether Sandbar Sports Grill is opening a location in Cutler Bay (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7); (3) employment inquiries (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9) and at least one customer post stating he was \"[g]etting a sandbar in cutler bay (sic) !!!\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, this Court will consider the postings as evidence of actual confusion, as they show the declarants', or in this case, the social media posters' state of mind.\n   <em>\n    Conversive\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5544228\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/433/1079/#p1091\">\n    433 F.Supp.2d at 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Even assuming arguendo that the foregoing social media posts or messages are hearsay, this Court finds that, at this juncture in the proceedings, it may rely on \"hearsay materials which would not be admissible evidence for a permanent injunction, if the evidence is 'appropriate given the character and objectives of the injunctive proceeding.' \"\n   <em>\n    Levi Strauss &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11360720\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/51/982/#p985\">\n    51 F.3d at 985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    SUSTAINS\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    viii.

Canes has operated a sports bar known as Sandbar Sports Grill, Sandbar or Sandbar Grill in Coconut Grove since 1999.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   2. Perrin became the President of Canes in 2013 when he gained control of the majority of the shares in the company through the shares owned by him (31%) and those owned by his father, Terry Perrin (20%). The other shareholders of Canes are Borrero and Richard M. Gentile a/k/a Matthew Gentile (\"Gentile\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def's Ex. 1 at 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   3. Perrin had previously acquired shares of Canes in 2008, at which time he was aware that Longo was the original founder of the Sandbar Sports Grill in Coconut Grove.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   4. The Sandbar Sports Grill in Coconut Grove uses the logo depicted above and the slogans \"Home of the Fish Taco,\" and \"Get Rescued from Ordinary Food.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   5. The Sandbar Sports Grill in Coconut Grove has won dozens of awards from various local newspapers and blogs. It has won the New Times Sports Bar of the Year Award multiple times, including as recently as 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   6. Because these awards encompass the Miami area and both the Sandbar Sports Grill in Coconut Grove and the Sandbar Sports Grill in Cutler Bay are located in Miami, the two establishments compete for the same awards for the best sports bar in Miami.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   7. The Sandbar Sports Grill in Coconut Grove has a widely known promotion, called the Five Pound Burrito Challenge, that has been covered by several media outlets and was named the top eating challenge in all of South Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   8. Canes registered the Sandbar Name and the Sandbar Logo with the State of Florida on July 28, 2017 as marks used since May 25, 1999 in connection with bar and restaurant services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl's Exs. 1 &amp; 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   9. The Sandbar Sports Grill in Coconut Grove uses the Sandbar Logo in its menu, with the slogan, \"Get Rescued from Ordinary Food\" printed above the logo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl's Ex. 3. The slogan is also printed on a sign that hangs over the bar. The menu also features five categories of a rum drink named \"Hurricanes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11153128\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/234/1163/#p1176\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   10. The Sandbar Sports Grill in Coconut Grove maintains social media accounts with Instagram, Twitter and Facebook. The undersigned admitted a group of social media posts and emails from those accounts referencing the Sandbar Sports Grill in Cutler Bay only for the fact that they were received by Perrin. However, the undersigned sustained Defendants' hearsay objection and did not admit the social media posts and emails as evidence of confusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl's Ex. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   11. The Sandbar Sports Grill in Coconut Grove markets itself on local radio by hosting a coaches' radio show and advertising in a dozen radio spots. Other marketing strategies include: advertising in the Miami Hurricanes program guide, sponsoring a lane at the University of Miami Hall of Fame Tournament, and placing ads on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   12. According to Perrin, in the thirty days preceding the evidentiary hearing, the Sandbar Sports Grill in Coconut Grove experienced a drop of between 20 to 40 percent in the number of posts and marketing images seen by customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   13. Perrin is concerned that any negative publicity regarding inspections of the Sandbar Sports Grill in Cutler Bay would affect the reputation of the Sandbar Sports Grill in Coconut Grove because both are in the same market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   14. When he first acquired shares of Canes in 2008, Perrin was aware that Longo had opened a Sandbar Sports Grill in Cocoa Beach, Florida in 2004, which is still open and uses the same logo as the Sandbar Sports Grill in Coconut Grove, with the words Cocoa Beach instead of Coconut\n   Grove at the bottom and a slightly different design at the center of the life preserver.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def's Ex. 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   15. Perrin never has and does not presently object to the operation of the Sandbar Sports Grill in Cocoa Beach; and has not brought any legal action against this restaurant. In response to an inquiry from a principal of the Sandbar Sports Grill in Cocoa Beach regarding the filing of a trademark registration for the Sandbar Marks, Perrin replied, \"As far as Cocoa Beach is concerned, my intention is absolutely nothing at all.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def's Ex. 4 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   16. The Sandbar Sports Grill in Cocoa Beach does not compete for the same awards as the Sandbar Sports Grill in Coconut Grove. Also, the distributors of beer and other merchandise for the Coconut Grove and Cocoa Beach locations are different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   17. When he acquired additional shares of Canes in 2013, Perrin was aware that Longo had opened a Sandbar Sports Grill in Kendall, across from Miami-Dade College. That restaurant remained in business for approximately one year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   18. Perrin is also aware that Longo and Borrero opened a Sandbar Sports Grill in Key West in 2016, which is still open and uses the same logo as the Sandbar Sports Grill in Coconut Grove with the words Key West instead of Coconut Grove at the bottom and a slightly different design at the center of the life preserver.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def's Ex. 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   19. Perrin, on behalf of Canes, had no objection to the opening of this restaurant. In fact, on February 11, 2016, Perrin sent a congratulatory email to Borrero on its opening.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def's Ex. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   20. The Sandbar Sports Grill in Key West does not compete for the same awards as the Sandbar Sports Grill in Coconut Grove and the newspapers in Miami and Key West are different. Also, the merchandise distributors for Coconut Grove and Key West are different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   21. On May 31, 2013, Perrin and the other shareholders of Canes entered into an Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement (hereafter, \"Shareholder Agreement\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def's Ex. 1. Perrin signed the agreement individually and as President of Canes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   22. Paragraph 11.8 of the Shareholder Agreement provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    Other Businesses\n   </strong>\n   . The Shareholders acknowledge and agree that each Shareholder is involved in other business ventures. No Shareholder is obligated to offer to the Company or the other Shareholders of the Company any interest in an (sic) current or future business venture of any kind. No Shareholder, without consent of the other Shareholders, shall engage in a business which operates under the name \"Sandbar Grill\", \"Sandbar Sports Grill\", \"Sandbar\", or similar name within a 10 mile radius of the Company. Subject to the foregoing limitation, this Agreement, or participation as a Shareholder, officer or director of the Company, shall give no Shareholder of the Company an exclusive right, license or otherwise to the trade name \"Sandbar Grill\", \"Sandbar Sports Grill\", \"Sandbar\", or similar name variation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   23. Perrin acknowledged that the Sandbar Sports Grill in Cutler Bay is located over ten miles from the Sandbar Sports Grill in Coconut Grove.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   24. Perrin claimed that he had nothing to do with the decision regarding the ten-mile restriction in Paragraph 11.8 of the Shareholder Agreement. According to Perrin, the attorney drafting the Shareholder Agreement was the one who wrote ten\n   miles in Paragraph 11.8, and all the shareholders went along with it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Longo\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   25. Longo developed the concept of the Sandbar restaurants in San Diego, California. Longo and his partner opened two restaurants there and looked for additional locations in California and Florida.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   They found the Coconut Grove location and initially intended to call the restaurant \"Canes Bar and Grill,\" but the University of Miami objected so they came up with the Sandbar Name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   26. Longo incorporated Canes in 1999 and filed the original fictitious name registration for \"Sandbar Grill &amp; Cantina\" that same year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def's Ex. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   27. Longo also was involved in the opening of the Sandbar Sports Grill in Cocoa Beach. He owns the property where the restaurant is located. He initially owned 20 percent of the business and gave the other 80 percent to two of his associates from the Sandbar Sports Grill in Coconut Grove. However, between 2010 and 2013, Longo sold his 20 percent interest in the business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   28. In 2005, Longo filed the fictitious name registration for the Sandbar Sports Grill in Cocoa Beach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def's Ex. 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   29. Longo designed the Sandbar Logo for the Coconut Grove, Cocoa Beach and Key West locations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def's Ex. 7. He varied the picture at the center of the life preserver for each restaurant to match each location and what is around it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   30. In 2013, Longo decided to move out of Miami for personal reasons and to sell his shares in Canes. At that time, Borrero was a shareholder in Canes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   31. Longo negotiated the purchase price and the terms for the sale of his shares in Canes with Perrin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   32. The day before the closing, Longo received a packet of documents to sign. The packet included a document that prohibited Longo from using the Sandbar Marks in any way, shape or form. Longo could not sign that document because he was already operating a Sandbar Sports Grill in Kentucky, was in the process of opening one in Stuart, Florida, and was planning to open others.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   33. At the closing on May 31, 2013, Longo told Perrin and the other Canes shareholders who were present that he wanted to use the Sandbar Name; and he refused to sign the document he had received prior to the closing. The shareholders got together and agreed on a new document entitled Sale, Transfer and Assignment, and Covenant not to Compete (hereafter, \"Covenant\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def's Ex. 3. Longo signed the Covenant as \"Seller\" and had it notarized that same day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   There are no other signatories to the Covenant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   34. In addition to the language assigning Longo's shares of Canes to Borrero, Gentile, Perrin and Terry Perrin (collectively referred to as \"Buyer\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Covenant contains the following provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   The undersigned further assigns, sells and transfers to Buyer all his rights, title and interest to the trade name \"Sandbar\", \"Sandbar Grill\", \"Sandbar Sports Grill\", \"Sandbar Bar &amp; Grill\", \"Sandbar Sports Bar\", and any similar\n   variations thereof (hereinafter the \"Name\"), except however Seller shall retain the right(s), royalty f[r]ee, to use the Name on an unlimited basis, without restriction and without the consent of Buyer, outside the Restricted Area (as defined below) in connection with any business, bar, restaurant or establishment including, but not limited to, any business or establishment in which all or any of Buyers(s) are not involved. Seller shall not use the Name in connection with the operation of a bar, restaurant, or similar establishment within a ten (10) mile radius of 3064 Grand Avenue, Coconut Grove, Florida (the \"Restricted Area\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Longo considered this provision to be a license for him to use the Sandbar Name outside the ten mile radius prescribed as the Restricted Area. Therefore, Longo and Borrero are using the Sandbar Name at the Cutler Bay location. Longo did acknowledge that he has never done business using the Sandbar Name or used the Sandbar Logo personally and has always used the Sandbar Marks as part of an entity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   35. The Covenant further provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   In further consideration of the sums paid to Seller in connection with the purchase of Sellers interest in the Corporation, and to induce Buyer to enter into said purchase, Seller will not be involved in any way, as an owner, shareholder, member, employee, officer, director, contractor, consultant, or otherwise, in the operation or ownership of a restaurant/bar within the neighborhood commonly known as Coconut Grove, Florida for a period of not less than 3 years after the date set forth below. Seller acknowledges that this provision is a material term and induced Buyer to purchase Seller's interest in the Corporation pursuant to that Stock Purchase Agreement dated February 28, 2013.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This provision was required by Perrin in his capacity as President of Canes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   36. Longo operated the Sandbar Sports Grill in Kendall in 2008 using the Sandbar Logo. At the time, Perrin was a shareholder of Canes and had no objections to the operation of the Sandbar Sports Grill in Kendall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   37. Longo opened the Sandbar Sports Grill in Stuart in 2013. Longo sold the restaurant at the end of 2014. During that time, Perrin was a shareholder of Canes and he did not object to the operation of the Sandbar Sports Grill in Stuart. Longo uses a very similar logo to the Sandbar Logo, featuring a surfboard, on the restaurant's menu.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   38. Longo decided to open the Sandbar Sports Grill in Key West in 2016. The menu for that restaurant features the Sandbar Logo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def's Ex. 8. Longo uses the slogan \"Home of the Fish Taco\" and offers a Three Pound Burrito Challenge at that location.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   39. The Sandbar Sports Grill in Cocoa Beach also uses the slogan \"Home of the Fish Taco\" and offers a Five Pound Burrito Challenge\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   40. The rum drinks named \"Hurricanes\" are also offered at the Key West and Cocoa Beach locations. Other restaurants in the immediate areas do not offer such drinks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   41. Longo is aware of other restaurants using the name \"Sandbar\" in Big Pine Key, Islamorada, and another location in the Florida Keys. Longo is also aware of \"Sandbar\" restaurants at the following Florida locations: Fort Myers, Clearwater Beach, and the Contemporary Hotel in Disney World.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   42. In December 2017, an entity named Sandbar Subs LLC located in Kansas complained about attempts to obtain federal trademark registration for the Sandbar Sports Grill in Cocoa Beach and the Sandbar Sports Grill in Key West and accused those entities of trademark infringement on its own \"SANDBAR\" mark.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def's Ex. 9 at 1-3. The firm of Malloy &amp; Malloy, P.L. responded to the complaint, and no further action has occurred.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-7. Borrero handled this matter, and Longo was not involved in it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   43. Longo and Borrero found the location and started negotiating a lease for the Sandbar Sports Grill in Cutler Bay in June 2017 and opened the restaurant in January 2018. The restaurant uses the Sandbar Logo with a different picture inside the life preserver on its menu.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def's Ex. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   44. Longo believes that he and Borrero are within their rights to operate the Sandbar Sports Grill in Cutler Bay because they have honored the ten-mile restriction set forth in Paragraph 11.8 of the Shareholder Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   45. Prior to the opening of the Sandbar Sports Grill in Cutler Bay, there had been no issues with Perrin or Canes about Longo's operation of other Sandbar restaurants, and all the Sandbar restaurants had peacefully coexisted. Longo learned of Canes' trademark registration of the Sandbar Marks in Florida after the opening of the Sandbar Sports Grill in Cutler Bay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Borrero\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   46. Borrero first became a shareholder of Canes in 2008 when he purchased Longo's original partner's shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   47. Borrero acquired additional shares of Canes in 2013 at the time he signed the Shareholder Agreement. Borrero acknowledged that the Shareholder Agreement does not address the Sandbar Logo or the slogan \"Get Rescued from Ordinary Food.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   48. Borrero believes that he is subject to the ten-mile restriction set forth in Paragraph 11.8 of the Shareholder Agreement, but that he can use the Sandbar Name outside the ten-mile radius.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   49. According to Borrero, the ten-mile restriction in the Covenant and in Paragraph 11.8 of the Shareholder Agreement reflected the shareholders' concern, not only with Coconut Grove, but also with the nearby Brickell area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   50.

As noted by the Magistrate Judge, the Shareholder Agreement and Covenant are of \"limited impact, if any\" to the issues raised by Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction [ECF No. 47, at 14].\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-193\">\n    <em>\n     Popular Bank of Florida v.
