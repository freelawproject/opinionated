Sept. 14, 2017) (the \"Substitution Opinion\"). After reviewing the agreements purporting to transfer alleged rights in the Ferring Patents-first from Fein to Reprise (the \"March 2007 Agreement,\" DTX 244), then to Allergan (the \"Three-Way Agreement,\" DTX 186), and finally back to Reprise and Serenity (the \"Dissolution and Reversion,\" DTX 459, 460)-it was concluded that the contracts could \"establish that Fein's intellectual property rights have been transferred,\" but that there were \"factual disputes irresolvable\" at the time of the motion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204083579\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204083579\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204083579\">\n    2017 WL 4083579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-*5.

Fein stated that the March 2007 Agreement with Reprise was intended to assign Reprise the \"ownership and interest\" in his inventions for \"low dose and sublingual and other routes of administration that could exploit the low dose hypothesis.\" Tr. 109:17-19.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He stated further that it was not his intention to retain rights in those inventions following the agreement. Tr. 109:23-110:7. Similarly, Fein stated that he had intended the Three-Way Agreement between Reprise, Serenity, and Allergan to convey to Allergan the same interests and rights that Fein conveyed earlier to Reprise. Tr. 110:11-112:9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On cross-examination, Fein made additional statements as to the agreements. Fein testified that the Ferring Patents did not, at the time of the Three-Way Agreement, meet all the stated descriptions of the patent rights to be assigned by Reprise under the agreement. For example, Fein stated that, at the time of the agreement, the Ferring Patents were not in Reprise's \"sole and exclusive\" ownership as stated to be true under the agreement. Tr. 251:13-252:20. The transferred rights that were returned to Reprise and Serenity from Allergan following the 2017 Reprise Assignment included only certain enumerated patents and did not include\n   the Ferring Patents or discuss the return of any \"inventions.\" Tr. 253:2-255:8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   During cross-examination of Fein, Ferring moved pursuant to Rule 52(c) to dismiss Defendants' counterclaims for lack of standing. Tr. 256:15-257:13. Accompanying their motion papers, Defendants moved to join Fein as a Counterclaimant pursuant to Rule 17. Dkt. No. 318. The motions were denied by the Court in its May 24, 2018 Standing Opinion, which found, in part, \"whatever rights Fein had in the Ferring Patents prior to the 2007 Agreement-if any-were transferred to, and are now held by, Counterclaim Plaintiffs Reprise and Serenity.\"\n   <em>\n    Ferring B.V. v.

In so finding, the Court acknowledged a standing defect that existed from the period between 2014, when Allergan brought its counterclaims against Ferring, and 2017, when Reprise and Serenity were substituted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at n. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On June 22, 2018, Ferring moved to certify for immediate appeal the Standing Opinion under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), and for a stay of proceedings pending appellate review.

Courts consider four factors when determining whether to stay a case during the pendency of an interlocutory appeal: (1) likelihood of success in the appeal; (2) whether the requesting party would be irreparably injured without a stay; (3) whether a stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceedings; and (4) the public interests at play.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 640. \"The first two questions-addressing likely success and irreparable harm to the movant-are the most salient concerns.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Nken\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/\">\n    129 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1761 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   First, on the likelihood of success, Ferring contends that \"a sufficient likelihood of success exists for the same reasons that justify an interlocutory appeal on standing.\" Pl. Memo in Support, at 10, ECF. No. 344. Ferring argues that the Standing Finding presents \"substantial grounds for disagreement on the proper resolution of Ferring's Rule 52(c) standing motion and whether procedural substitution rules can cure a standing defect.\" Pl. Memo. in Support at 7, ECF No. 34 4. Counterclaim Plaintiffs do not dispute this.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs. Memo in Opp. at 3 n. 1 (\"Serenity and Reprise assume, without conceding, that there is 'substantial ground for difference of opinion' with respect to the Court's determination that they have standing to pursue the counterclaim.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Second, as to whether Ferring would be irreparably harmed if trial were to proceed with an intermediate appeal pending, the Court finds that it would. Continuation of trial at this stage, with a case-dispositive issue pending on appeal, would drain parties' resources and the Court's. If on appeal the Federal Circuit reverses this Court's Standing Opinion, trial will have been a nullity, irreparably harming both parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Third, no evidence has been adduced to suggest a stay would harm either party. While a stay may prolong this litigation a few months, it has already gone on for nearly seven years. Moreover, trial will be resumed as soon as the Federal Circuit renders a decision on the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Nor would a stay affect disposition of the recently transferred case from Delaware concerning Ferring's new product, NOCDURNA, which involves different patents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ferring Pharmaceuticals Inc. et al. v.

It would be a waste of resources-the parties', the Court's, and the public's-to proceed to a trial that turns out to be a nullity. For this reason, and the reasons above, a stay is warranted.
