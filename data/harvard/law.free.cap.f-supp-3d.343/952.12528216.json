The Pauma Band of Luiseno Mission Indians of the Pauma &amp; Yuima Reservation (\"Pauma\" or \"Tribe\") seeks to offer new forms of gambling at its casino in Northern San Diego County. To make this possible, the Tribe entered into compact negotiations with the State of California and Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr. (collectively, \"State\") to expand its gaming rights. However, Pauma now claims the State has failed to negotiate with the Tribe in good faith. Pauma brings suit to trigger a remedial scheme that is designed to result in a new gaming compact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Presently before the Court are Pauma's and the State's cross-motions for summary judgment on the Tribe's bad faith negotiation claims. (ECF Nos. 36, 37.) The parties have also submitted a joint record of their negotiations. (Joint Record of Negotiations (\"JR\"), ECF Nos. 32-1 to 32-4.) The Court held oral argument on the motions. (ECF No. 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   There is no shortage of animosity between the parties. When they commenced negotiations to reach a new gaming compact, Pauma and the State were embroiled in litigation concerning an amendment to the parties' operative compact. Unsurprisingly, the parties' negotiations became contentious and unproductive at times. But the joint record does not demonstrate the State has failed to negotiate in good faith. The State met with Pauma several times and expressed a willingness to agree that the Tribe could offer additional forms of gambling at its casino. The State also reached out to other parties for information and obtained sample agreements to help Pauma and the State negotiate a new compact. In addition, to guide the parties' future discussions, the State transmitted a first draft of a new compact. Although Pauma now takes issue with the terms proposed in this initial draft, the Tribe never objected to these terms or otherwise responded to the State's proposal. Finally, at the time Pauma stopped participating in the negotiations and filed this lawsuit, nothing indicated the State was unwilling\n   to continue to negotiate with the Tribe to reach a compromise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court cannot conclude on this record that the State has failed to negotiate in good faith. Consequently, for the following reasons, the Court denies Pauma's motion for summary judgment, grants the State's cross-motion for summary judgment, and directs entry of judgment on the claims at issue under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

As the parties appealed the district court's rulings in Pauma's action challenging the 2004 Amendment, the Tribe set the gears in motion to possibly obtain a successor to the 1999 Compact by another avenue-new negotiations. On November 24, 2014, Pauma sent the State a request to \"commence formal renegotiations\" pursuant to Section 12.2 of the 1999 Compact \"and/or\" the 2004 Amendment. (JR 1.) This provision states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   This Gaming Compact is subject to renegotiation in the event the Tribe wishes to engage in forms of Class III gaming other than those games authorized herein and requests renegotiation for that purpose, provided that no such renegotiations may be sought for 12 months following the effective date of this Gaming Compact.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   (1999 Compact \u00a7 12.2, ECF No. 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   To trigger this provision, Pauma identified two types of Class III gaming not authorized by the 1999 Compact that it wished to conduct.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The 1999 Compact allows Pauma to operate \"any devices or games that are authorized under state law to the California State Lottery.\" (1999 Compact \u00a7 3(c).)

'shall be governed, controlled, and conducted in conformity with the provisions and requirements of IGRA, including those provisions regarding the obligation of the state to negotiate in good faith and the enforcement of that obligation in federal court.' \" (JR 3 (quoting 1999 Compact \u00a7 12.3).) Finally, the Tribe requested that the negotiations be kept strictly confidential. (JR 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On December 15, 2014, the State responded to Pauma's request, agreeing to commence negotiations regarding a compact that addresses the additional forms of gaming identified by Pauma, but noted that Class III gaming activities \"not authorized in California\" fall outside the governor's \"constitutional authority to negotiate\" and are \"not appropriate subjects for inclusion in a Compact.\" (JR 5 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(B) ; Cal. Const. art. IV, \u00a7 19, subds. (e) &amp; (f) ).) The State suggested an initial meeting on December 24, 2014, at the Governor's Office in Sacramento,\n   California. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   JR 9 (explaining why this specific date was chosen to comply with the deadline in Pauma's letter and that the State had tried to discuss any scheduling issues with Pauma).) The State also requested that the parties discuss at their initial meeting \"preliminary issues, such as process and confidentiality, with the objective of confirming the scope of the confidentiality agreement, as raised in [Pauma's] letter, and a timeframe for, and the scope of, our negotiations.\" (JR 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Through the exchange of additional letters, in which the parties discuss accommodating schedules and who will attend the first meeting, the parties agreed to meet in San Diego, California, on January 16, 2015. (JR 8-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    A. First Meeting\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   At their initial meeting, the parties discussed preliminary matters and Pauma's potential horse racing venture.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the State has never entered into an on-track horse racing compact with a tribe, it sought details into Pauma's operation, which Pauma deferred discussion of as premature because the Tribe was hesitant to \"substantially invest in the project\" before knowing whether it would \"have the ability to conduct on track betting at all.\" (JR 18;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   JR 21.) The State pointed out that it had \"entered into off-track wagering compacts and that those might be used as a starting point for Pauma's proposed facility.\" (JR 21.) Further, to facilitate the process, the State \"offered to bring in someone from the California Horse Racing Board\" to assist the parties with their discussions. (JR 18;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   JR 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As to Pauma's request for expanded lottery games, the parties offer differing recollections of their discussions. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   JR 18,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   JR 21-22.) The State's memorialization provides that it \"asked for examples of the types of lottery games Pauma is considering,\" and that the Tribe's counsel \"referred the State to the games listed in the Tribe's November 24, 2014 letter.\" (JR 21.) Pauma then referenced a prior Ninth Circuit decision concerning tribal gaming rights in California, to which the State then reiterated its \"need to understand the scope of games that Pauma intends to offer to help identify issues and establish a legal framework for future negotiations.\" (JR 22.) Last, the State \"suggested both sides research the general legal framework for the lottery games further,\" prior to the parties' next meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Pauma, on the other hand, recalls that the State-in addition to asking for legal support for Pauma's position-also described the expanded lottery games \"issue as 'murky' and requiring further research.\" (JR 18.) Moreover, Pauma contends it asked the State to provide its \"position in writing as to the games underlying the negotiations before the next meeting, and [the State] agreed to do so.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The State disputes this claim. (JR 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Beyond the gaming rights issues, the State recalls that, upon being asked if the Tribe sought \"further amendments to its compact,\" Pauma's counsel \"responded that at this time the Tribe wishes to focus on the additional games and nothing broader.\" (JR 22.) Further, according to the State, \"Pauma indicated it had prepared to discuss solely confidentiality and scheduling issues at the meeting,\" and the State's follow-up letter notes that \"it is hopeful\" the parties \"can discuss Pauma's proposals to operate a live horse racing\n   facility and offer additional lottery games in more detail at [their] next meeting.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Finally, the parties discussed scheduling their \"next meeting in approximately May 2015, as the parties' participating attorneys face[d] appellate briefing deadlines over the next few months\"-presumably related to the then-ongoing 2004 Amendment litigation. (JR 20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   JR 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Second Meeting\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Prelude\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   A few months passed before the parties reengaged. By this point, the tenor of the negotiations was quickly deteriorating. On May 8, 2015, Pauma sent the State a letter disputing California's summary of the parties' first meeting and reiterating the Tribe's position on its request for expanded lottery games. (JR 23-25.) Pauma's Chairman particularly took issue with the State's contention that it did not agree to provide its position on the expanded lottery games issue in writing before the next meeting:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   While sensitive to the fact that the State is resistant to put anything in writing out of fear of creating a coherent record for any future bad faith suit, I am more concerned by the amount of time and money Pauma may expend going through an undefined and seemingly inefficient process in which it may be simply spinning its wheels.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   (JR 24.) The Tribe then requested that the State identify \"before our next meeting ... the games over which the State is and is not willing to negotiate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Next, Pauma takes issue with the State's proposed process for formulating an on-track horse racing compact, with the Tribe asking the State to meet with the State Horse Racing Board \"to formulate the State's position regarding the civil regulations it would like to negotiate for during forthcoming meetings.\" (JR 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Last, after raising these grievances, Pauma asks to postpone the next negotiation meeting to accommodate the parties' appeals in the 2004 Amendment litigation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Although this letter may appear to ask a lot from the State on a relatively short schedule, the recent orders in the pending compact litigation have essentially guaranteed that our attorneys will be largely preoccupied until the oral argument scheduled for July 10, 2015. In light of that, the prudent thing to do would be to delay ou[r] next negotiation session from the May 2015 date we contemplated during our first meeting to some point shortly following the scheduled date for the oral argument.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   (JR 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   On May 27, 2015, the State responded to Pauma's communication, agreeing to transcribe the parties' future negotiations \"so we can focus our energy on discussing and resolving issues, rather than arguing about statements made at prior meetings.\" (JR 26.) The State also stood by its prior summary of the first meeting, characterizing \"the Tribe's posture at that meeting\" as being \"primarily oriented towards seeking a legal position from the State without providing a clear description of the kinds of horse racing or lottery games it sought to conduct.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Beyond this back-and-forth, the State requested Pauma's Chairman provide it with \"dates in early August that would be convenient for you to meet in Sacramento so we can continue our discussions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Pauma's counsel replied to the State on August 5, 2015, and provided proposed dates at the end of the month for the parties to continue their negotiations. (JR 27.) The Tribe also, again, conveyed its perception that the State was exhibiting a lack of willingness to negotiate for the expanded gaming rights Pauma requested:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Given the lack of a concrete response from the State over the past eight months as to whether or not it is actually willing to negotiate for these rights, Pauma has no choice but to simply construe your silence as a tacit affirmation that these forms of games are indeed available so the discussion of terms that both parties seemingly desire can finally take place.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   (JR 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The parties continue to spar by correspondence as they settle on a date for their second meeting and discuss other miscellaneous matters. (JR 29-37.) Ultimately, the parties would agree to meet in Sacramento at the California Attorney General's Office on September 8, 2015, for a transcribed and recorded negotiation session. (JR 33-37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Negotiation Session\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The parties discussed several topics at their second meeting. That being said, a disagreement is interspersed throughout their negotiations. This debate concerns how the parties should move towards reaching an actual compact. The State's negotiator, \"having reviewed the back and forth,\" proposes that \"the best way to move forward\" is for Pauma to \"just draft compact language on those two issues\" that the Tribe feels needs \"to be addressed in the compact.\" (JR 42.) The State justifies this request by stating it \"will be the best way to at least move things forward so [the parties] are not just arguing about positions\" and \"are actually working on language that ultimately hopefully will lead to a compact.\" (JR 42-43.) Pauma, on the other hand, wants more input from the State before getting started. (JR 75-76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Horse Wagering\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As to substance, the parties first discussed Pauma's on-track horse wagering request. (JR 42-76.) Pauma expressed that it is \"going to be very difficult for us to come up with what a horse racing compact is supposed to be -- look like.\" (JR 43.) Although the State previously entered into compacts providing for off-track wagering, these compacts are \"15 or 20 pages\" and \"[r]elatively simple.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In contrast, Pauma stated a compact providing for operation of a horse race track potentially implicates a wide range of horse racing regulations that \"cover a whole slew of things,\" like weeks of operation and charity racings. (JR 43;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   JR 50- 51.) In response, the State asked Pauma to \"do [its] best\" and come up with a draft- with placeholders as necessary-to \"start[ ] the ball moving.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The State also explained that it brought the Executive Director of the California Horse Racing Board to the meeting because of the complexity of a tribe conducting on-track betting in California. (JR 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   During this discussion, the Executive Director informed Pauma that he believes the Tribe's involvement with the horse racing business \"would be very well received\" because it is \"a declining industry\" with \"tracks closing.\" (JR 45.) The State also encouraged Pauma to include \"off-track wagering\" as part of its plans, and the State informed Pauma that it had worked with the Executive Director and his staff \"to update the older provisions\" in compacts concerning off-track wagering. (JR 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   After more discussion, the State requested that Pauma put together a \"shell of something that lays out what\" the Tribe is looking for, and the Tribe pushed back because it believed that creating a first draft would be \"a massive undertaking,\" (JR 49), and there are \"massive amounts of regulations\" that the parties may need to consider, (JR 50). The State then repeats its willingness to work with Pauma, as tribal on-track wagering has not been done in California, and the State wants to \"try to figure out the best way to do it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   (JR 54-55.) The parties thereafter continued to discuss issues related to on-track wagering with the Executive Director, as well as continue their debate about Pauma needing to make the first attempt at a draft compact. (JR 56-76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Supplemental Lottery Games\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As for the lottery games issue, Pauma asks to \"work on the language today.\" (JR 39.) Its counsel states that in his view, this issue is \"incredibly simple\" when compared to the horse racing topic. (JR 76-77.) The State, however, again asks Pauma to \"put together something and [the State] will respond,\" with its preference to \"just get the ball rolling with some exchange of documents so we can focus on language.\" (JR 78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Pauma then shares its position on the lottery issue, including what it believes is the relevant state law framework. (JR 43-47.) The State admits that \"there is a question there,\" and that the parties may need to \"go back and research the history\" to determine if the Tribe can engage in lottery games beyond those games authorized to the California State Lottery. (JR 47.) The parties continue to debate this issue, until they reach a flashpoint:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   Pauma's Counsel: ... We just want the rights to do lottery games. And I know this is a sensitive area for the State since the [State] lottery makes like $5 billion per year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   State's Negotiator: Right. And it goes to all of our kids' education, right? I mean --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   Pauma's Counsel: I know. And our kids can't even get education. And that's why we are trying to fix this, Joe.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   State's Negotiator: I mean, actually, to make the point, it does go to schools statewide, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   State's Negotiator: And it benefits all of our kids, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   Pauma's Counsel: I get it. But you -- I don't know if protectionism is, like, a valid concern under IGRA, though. You know, there is a way to provide tribes with equal rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   State's Counsel: Actually, it is valid under IGRA. If you look at IGRA, one of the things that the State is entitled to negotiate over is to protect its own gambling industry. I'm not suggesting we would do that. But that's expressed in IGRA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   Pauma's Counsel: That's a - that's a colorful interpretation ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   State's Counsel: It's straight language. It's not colorful interpretation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   (JR 52-55.) Pauma presses onward, with the State eventually responding that the issue is what exact games the state constitution may permit the Tribes to conduct because the relevant constitutional provision simply states \"lottery games.\" (JR 56- 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The parties take a break and return, but the negotiations quickly break down. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   JR 96-109.) Pauma's counsel starts employing sarcasm. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JR 102 (remarking that Pauma wants to race \"some elephants\" and \"donkeys\" at its track, and it is \"going to be something else\"). And these comments draw the ire of the State's negotiator. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JR 109 (\"No. You are being sarcastic. And it's just ridiculous.\").) Eventually, the State's negotiator expresses that he believes the parties \"can make a lot of progress on the horse racing side.\" (JR 112.) As to the lottery issue, the State says, \"we will see where that goes too. I mean, let's get some language and we will respond. At least we will have a framework of - you know, we'll have the issues ... I mean, just arguing back and forth, with all respect, isn't really moving us anywhere.\" (JR 113.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Scope of Negotiations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Toward the end of the parties' meeting, the State's negotiator asks to focus \"on the next step\" and inquires: \"What's the time line? What do we need to do?\" (JR 114.) These questions prompt Pauma's counsel to bring up the start date of the future compact they are negotiating for. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Yet, when Pauma wants to broaden the topics of discussion, the State resists. (JR 117.) Its negotiator emphasizes that Pauma was \"clear that it\" only wanted to negotiate regarding \"on-track horse racing and issues related to lottery games.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   JR 120.) The debate over this issue quickly degenerates. More sarcasm is employed by Pauma's counsel, again drawing the ire of the State's negotiator. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JR 86-126.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Needless to say, the parties make limited progress during the rest of the meeting. At the end, the State's position is twofold. (JR 140.) First, if Pauma seeks to broaden the negotiations, the State requests that Pauma adhere to the 1999 Compact by sending a letter that clarifies the scope of the negotiations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Second, the State asks Pauma to send the State \"some compact language\" regarding the horse racing and expanded lottery games issues. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Resolution of Scope of Negotiations Dispute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   About a month later, Pauma sends the State a letter criticizing the State's conduct at the second meeting. (JR 174-81.) After acknowledging the meeting \"had a promising start,\" Pauma characterizes the State as trying \"to bring the meeting to an end\" by asking Pauma to \"unilaterally draft the horse racing and on-track wagering regulations for its compact by distilling down the many hundreds of pages of convoluted State laws that have developed over the past eighty years and now govern these activities.\" (JR 174.) Pauma's Chairman continues: \"And this says nothing about the State's abject refusal to discuss the lottery games topic even when Pauma's counsel proposed a simple one sentence revision to the language currently in ... the 1999 Compact ... to account for those games that are ... not 'authorized' to the California State Lottery[.]\" (JR 175.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In addition, Pauma objects-at length-to the State's position that the parties' negotiations are limited to the additional gaming rights Pauma identified in its initial request. (JR 176-77.) Pauma also suggests the State is dodging the cooperative negotiation process \"simply because of bad feelings arising out [of the prior] litigation or a desire to protect the State Lottery from tribal competition.\" (JR 177.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The State responds several weeks later. (JR 182-84.) It initially focuses on the parties' dispute as to the scope of negotiations. (JR 182-83.) After incorporating excerpts from the parties' prior letters, the State concludes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   Pauma did not previously request to negotiate subjects outside of section 12.2. Pauma now seeks to expand the scope of the negotiations to include subjects not encompassed by section 12.2 and that the State has not agreed to renegotiate since receiving Pauma's November 24, 2014 letter. Under the terms of the compact, the State is under no obligation to renegotiate any matters beyond the scope of those identified in, or related to, your initial request and declines to do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   (JR 183.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The State also follows-up on the horse racing issue, noting that since the parties' last meeting, the State has \"reached out to the National Indian Gaming Commission to obtain information regarding other tribes that may be conducting on-track betting.\" (JR 183.) The State shares the fruits of its effort by attaching a \"Compact\n   Addendum between the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe and the State of North Dakota addressing pari-mutuel horse racing\" to serve as a reference for the parties' further discussions. (JR 183, 185-205.) In closing, the State reports that it is \"preparing a draft off-track wagering compact for discussion and will forward it to you soon\" and \"look[s] forward to reviewing Pauma's proposals regarding a framework for final compact language addressing the new forms of gaming that it proposes to offer-horse racing and lottery games.\" (JR 184.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Several weeks later, Pauma reacts to the State's steadfast position on the scope of negotiations by triggering the 1999 Compact's dispute resolution process. (JR 206.) In identifying the dispute, Pauma notes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   The amount of time the parties have spent going in circles about these issues should eliminate any need to reiterate the problems let alone provide gross specificity, but it should go without saying that the prevailing dispute relates to the proper interpretation of Sections 12.2 and 12.3 of the compact, the position the State has taken in regards to such issues over the course of the last year of negotiations, whether the State has negotiated in good faith during this time, and related issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   (JR 206.) The Tribe also expresses its \"hope that the parties will approach the future meeting ... and any ensuing ones in good faith, thereby eliminating any need for federal court involvement.\" (JR 207.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Several days later, the State acknowledges Pauma's dispute resolution request and suggests the parties meet on December 4, 2015. (JR 208.) The State also summarizes the steps it has taken to move the parties forward on the horse racing issue and also attaches \"for discussion a draft compact addendum that would authorize a satellite wagering facility.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   JR 210-21.) As for the expanded lottery games issue, the State notes that it has \"asked for draft compact language and received nothing but lengthy letters from [Pauma] or [its] lawyers that seek to blame the State for the lack of progress, but fail to do anything to help the parties move forward towards the conclusion of a compact.\" (JR 209.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In follow-up e-mails, the parties discuss scheduling and the location of the dispute resolution meeting. (JR 222-27.) Pauma presses for an in-person meeting near its reservation, but the State pushes back reportedly due to the short notice and a lack of contract carrier flights to San Diego on the agreed-upon date. (JR 225-27.) Pauma again presses the State, suggesting its representatives fly into Ontario instead. (JR 224.) The State's negotiator repels Pauma, taking issue with what the State believes is the Tribe's manipulation of the holiday season:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   With all due respect, your comments about inconvenience and difficulty of scheduling lack credibility and are difficult to take seriously when you requested this meeting ... at approximately 9 p.m. on the evening before Thanksgiving .... It appears that you intentionally waited until the evening before a four day holiday weekend to request a meeting within ten days so you can find some basis to argue that the State is not in compliance with its compact obligations. You appear to be implementing a strategy of obtaining a compact by litigation rather than negotiation. IGRA should not be manipulated by either party to avoid the obligation to negotiate in good faith towards the conclusion of a compact. We have tried, and will continue to try to work with you in good faith. We worked over the holiday to provide a response and present draft compact language on the Monday after the holiday. Despite your many letters and e-mails, the State has yet to receive a single word of proposed compact language\n   from the Tribe. I believe we'd do more to further the interests of the Tribe and the State if we spent more time on developing a compact, than arguing about scheduling.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   (JR 223.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The parties met on December 4, 2015, to discuss their scope of negotiations dispute. (JR 228.) Afterwards, Pauma e-mailed the State two letters to support the Tribe's interpretation of the renegotiation provision of the 1999 Compact. (JR 228-33.) The State agreed to provide a response within a week. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JR 228.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The State did. (JR 234-35.) Its response provides that the \"exchange of information, as well as the discussion at our meeting of December 4, 2015, was helpful to frame the disputed issue,\" but the State concludes its interpretation of the 1999 Compact's renegotiation provision, \"as consistently applied, is supported by the specific compact language and reflects the intention and understanding of compact parties.\" (JR 234.) That said, the State agrees to broaden the scope of negotiations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   However, rather than focus additional time and energy on this dispute, the State is amenable and now agrees, pursuant to section 12.1 of the compact, to enter into negotiations for a new or amended tribal-state gaming compact .... To be clear, this letter reflects the State's understanding that both parties are amenable to considering all aspects of the existing compact and other appropriate provisions to ensure that we are able to achieve our mutual objectives.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   (JR 234.) Next, the State cautions Pauma that it is engaged in \"compact negotiations with a large number of tribes,\" emphasizing that it is committed to develop a new compact but wants to \"be up front with [the Tribe] about the demands on [the State's] time to ensure that we set realistic timeframes.\" (JR 235.) Finally, the State requests Pauma provide a date for a future meeting, and the State's negotiator notes that he is \"amenable to conducting many of our meetings by phone to avoid cost and inconvenience and to allow us to focus our efforts on productive negotiations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Several days later, the Tribe replied to the State's offer \"to negotiate under the voluntary negotiation provision of\" the 1999 Compact. (JR 236.) The Tribe asks the State to confirm that negotiations under the voluntary provision will include the new forms of gaming Pauma is seeking. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Tribe's Chairman then informs the State he will contact it \"in short order about scheduling the next negotiation session and the issues\" to be addressed at that meeting once the scope of the current negotiations are confirmed.

(JR 239-41.) The letter does not include further negotiation on the horse racing provision; it instead focuses solely on the Tribe's request for expanded lottery games. (JR 244-45.) Further, the Tribe's counsel tells the State:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   Pauma prefers to conduct the negotiations in a piecemeal fashion, focusing on one material issue and then moving on to the next only after the parties have largely agreed on language for the final compact. It is my view that structuring the negotiations in such a manner will foster productivity and allow the parties to seek court guidance regarding a particular issue should an impasse arise while simultaneously remaining free to negotiate the other issues that come under the ambit of these negotiations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   (JR 241.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   As to the lottery games, Pauma's counsel suggests \"two revisions\" to the 1999 Compact to provide the Tribe with the gaming rights it seeks. (JR 240-41.) These revisions involve inserting a definition for the term \"Lottery\" and amending the scope of permitted lottery games to broaden it to include at least nine categories of additional lottery games. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In closing, the Tribe informs the State that as it considers Pauma's letter, the Tribe \"will begin to formulate positions on other topics-including the horse racing-so the parties may turn to those once we have reached a consensus on the lottery provisions.\" (JR 241.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   When the State does not respond to Pauma's piecemeal negotiation proposal in the next several weeks, Pauma follows-up. (JR 242-43.) The Tribe emphasizes that it has been \"four hundred and seventy (470) days since Pauma conveyed its request to commence renegotiations of the 1999 Compact\" and \"respectfully request[s] that the Office of the Governor expedite its response\" to Pauma's most-recent proposal. (JR 242.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   In a response several weeks later, the State declines Pauma's offer to \"conduct negotiations in a piecemeal fashion.\" (JR 244.) The State rationalizes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   Such an approach has no basis in the dispute resolution framework created within the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) that governs the possibility of an impasse in the negotiations, limits the ability of the parties to achieve consensus by giving and taking on the wide range of issues that are addressed in bilateral compact negotiations, and is remarkably inefficient.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Next, in addressing Pauma's lottery games proposal, the State argues that the governor's authority to negotiate for lottery games under the California Constitution's tribal gaming provision \"has always been understood to encompass those games authorized for play by the California State Lottery.\" (JR 244.) That said, the State tells Pauma that it \"is willing to negotiate to authorize Pauma to offer certain additional lottery games to be enumerated in the compact.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The State continues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   Specifying the games provides clarity as to the scope of the authorization, avoids future disputes between the parties, and mitigates the risk of running afoul of other prohibitions on how lottery games may be conducted, such as the keno game offered by the California State Lottery that was found to be an illegal banked game by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Western Telcon, Inc. v.

Finally, the State tells Pauma that it will\n   provide the Tribe with \"a complete draft document to guide our future discussions within the next few weeks.\" (JR 245.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Several weeks later, the State sends Pauma a \"draft compact\" by e-mail. (JR 246-382.) In a margin comment to the draft compact's authorization of Class III gaming, the State notes that it \"is open, as indicated in prior correspondence, to discussion regarding the authorization of additional enumerated [lottery] games.\" (JR 261.) The State also comments that it \"has proposed\" an off-track wagering compact \"that can be incorporated as an Appendix or negotiated and concluded as a separate class III gaming compact.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Pauma, however, did not respond to either the State's letter explaining its position on the additional lottery games or its proposed draft compact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

In its Second Amended Complaint, Pauma brings a torrent of twenty claims against the State for \"bad faith negotiation\" under IGRA. (Second Am. Compl. (\"SAC\") \u00b6\u00b6 210-310.) The Tribe requests that this Court \"find that the State failed to negotiate in good faith under Section 2710(d)(7)(B)(iii) of IGRA and trigger the statutory remedial scheme set forth in Section 2710(d)(7)(B)(iii)-(vii).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Prayer \u00b6 1.)

Thus, the Court has considered the entirety of the negotiations in weighing whether: (1) Pauma demonstrates that the State did not respond to the Tribe's request to negotiate a compact \"in good faith\"; and (2) if so, the State meets its burden to \"prove that the State has negotiated with [Pauma] in good faith.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(7)(B)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Having done so, all of Pauma's claims encounter the same problem: the parties never \"reached an impasse\" in their negotiations to reach a new compact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rincon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3919867\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/602/1019/#p1025\">\n    602 F.3d at 1026\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Tribe now brings ten claims raising procedural and substantive objections to the parties' negotiations predicated on this draft document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Lack of Individualized Negotiations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   In Count 11, Pauma raises a procedural objection to the negotiations, arguing the State failed to negotiate in good faith because it \"did not conduct any individualized\n   negotiations with Pauma.\" (SAC \u00b6 263.) The Tribe claims the State \"simply threw in the towel and sent Pauma a 'complete draft [compact]' \" that is substantially similar to an agreement the State had negotiated with another tribe, but with material changes made to Pauma's detriment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alteration in original).) Thus, Pauma argues that \"negotiations that started out with Pauma asking for something unique ultimately ended with the State handing out a compact that was designed for another tribe,\" demonstrating a lack of good faith. (Pl.'s Mot. 23:2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Pauma does not show the State failed to respond to the Tribe's request to negotiate a new compact in good faith on this basis. Initially, as forecasted above, the Court rejects Pauma's characterization that the State was \"wrapping up the negotiations by simply offering a compact designed for another tribe.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl's. Mot. 21:12-14.) The joint record demonstrates the State was seeking to continue the negotiations and move them forward-not wrap them up. The State's negotiator stated the draft compact was to \"guide [the parties'] future discussions.\" (JR 245.) In transmitting the draft, the State then asked Pauma to \"[p]lease let us know when you would like to discuss.\" (JR 246.) The State did not express that this initial draft was a final offer or anything but an initial proposal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JR 245-46.) Rather, it appears the only reason the negotiations \"ended with the State handing out a compact that was\" based on another tribe's agreement is because Pauma did not respond to the State's draft. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. 23:2-3.) Furthermore, the State had invited the Tribe to \"just to take a crack\" at a first draft incorporating Pauma's requests, but it appears the Tribe never did so in draft format. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JR 48;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , JR 54, 72, 143.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   The joint record also does not support Pauma's criticism that the State was \"trying to cut off any further communication on the subject of\" lottery games by \"relaying a generic compact offer.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. 23:14-15.) A comment attached to the relevant section of the draft compact notes that the \"State is open, as indicated in prior correspondence, to discussion regarding the authorization of additional enumerated [lottery] games.\" (JR 261.) Nothing prevented the Tribe from engaging in further discussion with the State on the lottery games subject. Nor does State's prior letter demonstrate it was \"trying to cut off any further communication\" on this subject. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JR 244-45.) Simply put, Pauma's claim that the \"State flouted the good faith requirement of IGRA by utterly failing to engage in negotiations that were even remotely responsive to Pauma's needs and concerns\" does not survive scrutiny. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. 23:16-18.) Hence, the Tribe fails to demonstrate a lack of good faith on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Harshness of Proposed Terms\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Next, Pauma brings a series of claims challenging the proposed terms of the draft compact.

(SAC \u00b6\u00b6 306-10.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   In moving for summary judgment, the State argues that Pauma's claims challenging the specific terms of the draft compact are premature because the Tribe never objected to these terms or responded to the State's proposal. (Defs.' Mot. 33:20- 40:11; Defs.' Reply 13:7-14:6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   The Court agrees. This Court will not wade into the granular details of a first draft that was never even the subject of discussion between the parties.

In those cases, the State had either taken a \" 'hard line' negotiation position\" or had tried to \"impose\" taxation on the Tribe.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rincon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3919867\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/602/1019/#p1025\">\n    602 F.3d at 1032-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing these concepts and citing\n   <em>\n    Coyote Valley II\n   </em>\n   , where the State had \"insist[ed] on certain provisions\"). The Ninth Circuit explained that in the context of a demand for taxation, the State \" 'impose[s]' something during negotiations ... by insisting, over tribal objections, that the tribe make a given concession-a concession beyond those specially authorized by [IGRA] and contrary to the tribe's sovereign interests-in order to obtain a compact.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3919867\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/602/1019/#p1025\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3919867\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/602/1019/#p1025\">\n    at 1031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted). Similarly, the Ninth Circuit noted that a \"state may not take a 'hard line' position in IGRA negotiations when it results in a 'take it or leave it offer' to the tribe to either accept nonbeneficial provisions outside the permissible scope of [IGRA's compact topics], or go without a compact.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3919867\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/602/1019/#p1025\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3919867\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/602/1019/#p1025\">\n    at 1039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Here, where Pauma did not respond or object to the State's proposed terms, it cannot claim the State tried to \"impose\" taxation or revenue sharing \"by insisting,\n   <em>\n    over tribal objections\n   </em>\n   ... that [Pauma] make a given concession ... to obtain a compact.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rincon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3919867\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/602/1019/#p1025\">\n    602 F.3d at 1031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

And because Pauma does not make this threshold showing, Pauma fails to demonstrate the State's proposal was a \"take it or leave it offer\" to Pauma to accept unfavorable provisions outside the scope of IGRA or go without a compact.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3919867\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/602/1019/#p1025\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In sum, in light of the posture of the negotiations in this case, the Court finds the \"meaningful concessions\" framework from\n   <em>\n    Coyote Valley\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rincon\n   </em>\n   inapposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Relatedly, the Court is also unpersuaded by Pauma's various efforts to characterize the draft compact as a final offer and then compare it to the final agreements entered into between the State and other tribes. For example, Pauma describes the State's first draft \"as the ultimate terms the State offered.\" (Pl.'s Mot. 23:23.) In another instance, the Tribe labels the proposal as \"the seemingly final offer [the State] extended to Pauma.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   23:22-28:4.) Pauma then compares the terms in the State's proposal to the terms in the final agreement between the State and the nearby Pala tribe (as well as other final tribal-state compacts). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   1:21-2:11, 23:22-28:4.) In doing so, the Tribe highlights, for example, that the State's first proposal to Pauma requires 8% of one form of revenue sharing whereas the executed Pala compact requires only 6%. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   1:27-2:3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   These efforts are unconvincing. For one, Pauma's characterizations are inaccurate. Again, the State's \"draft compact\" was transmitted to \"guide [the parties'] future discussions,\" included comments noting the State was open to further discussion, and was accompanied with an e-mail asking Pauma to \"[p]lease let us know when you would like to discuss.\" (JR 245-382.) There\n   is no indication that this proposal was the State's best, \"seemingly final,\" or \"ultimate\" offer to Pauma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   In addition, the Court will not impute bad faith based on the deal another tribe received when Pauma never negotiated for or requested more favorable terms. At oral argument, the Tribe said it felt \"boxed into a corner\" and \"almost checkmated\" by the State's initial draft. (ECF No. 48.) When pressed to explain why Pauma chose not to respond to the proposal, the Tribe said Pauma felt it would have been a \"pretty monumental undertaking\" to obtain Pala's comparably better terms \"through the course of negotiations,\" and that it was \"under the impression that at some point the negotiations have to break off if the parties felt like they had reached an impasse.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) But an objective evaluation of the joint record does not substantiate these claims of an impasse or Pauma being \"almost checkmated\" by an initial proposal sent to guide the parties' future discussions. Nor does the evidence substantiate Pauma's speculative claim that \"there was\n   <em>\n    zero\n   </em>\n   chance the State would have reduced the financial burden of the 'complete draft [compact] through further negotiation.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n 27:11-13 (alteration and emphasis in original).) The Court is therefore unmoved by Pauma's attempts to demonstrate a lack of good faith by comparing a set of terms that are yet to be discussed with the specifics of final deals struck between the State and other tribes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. 23:22-28:4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   In sum, Pauma's claims targeting the terms of the draft compact-Counts 12 to 20-do not demonstrate the State has failed to negotiate in good faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Horse Wagering\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Pauma claims in Count 3 that the State failed to negotiate in good faith in light of the State's response to the Tribe's request to engage in on-track horse wagering. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 220-24.) The State argues it is entitled to summary judgment because the record of negotiations demonstrates the State \"repeatedly attempted to engage\n   Pauma\" on this issue and \"remained a willing and engaged partner for an on-track horse-racing compact.\" (Defs.' Mot. 29:13-31:22;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Reply 6:11-8:14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   The Court agrees that Pauma fails to demonstrate a lack of good faith on this basis. The State's dealings with the Tribe concerning horse wagering do not reveal the State failed to respond to Pauma's request to negotiate a compact \"in good faith.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(7)(B)(ii)(II). Pauma requested the right to conduct on-track wagering, a type of Class III gaming that it cannot presently conduct under the 1999 Compact. (JR 2.) Although the State expressed that this type of compact had never been done in California before, the State never told Pauma it would not negotiate for this new gaming right. Instead, the State sought additional information about Pauma's plans and also offered to reach out to the Executive Director of the California Horse Racing Board to assist the parties. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , JR 18, 21, 22, 30.) The State then brought the Executive Director to the parties' second meeting, where the participants discussed Pauma's request. (JR 42-76.) The State also encouraged Pauma to include \"off-track wagering\" as part of its plans, and the State informed Pauma that it had worked with the Executive Director and his staff \"to update the older provisions\" of an agreement concerning this type of wagering. (JR 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Further along in the negotiations, the State \"reached out to the National Indian Gaming Commission to obtain information regarding other tribes that may be conducting on-track betting.\" (JR 183.) The State shared with Pauma a \"Compact Addendum between the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe and the State of North Dakota addressing pari-mutuel horse racing\" to serve as a reference for the parties' further discussions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; JR 185-205.) The State also subsequently provided \"for discussion a draft compact addendum that would authorize a satellite wagering facility.\" (JR 208;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   JR 210-21.) Finally, the State's draft discussion compact noted that the State had proposed an \"OTW wagering compact that can be incorporated as an Appendix or negotiated and concluded as a separate class III gaming compact.\" (JR 261.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   At the time Pauma filed this lawsuit, the Tribe had not responded to or commented on the State's sample compact from North Dakota or draft compact addendum authorizing a satellite wagering facility. Nothing in the joint record demonstrates the State, at the time Pauma filed this lawsuit, did not \"remain[ ] willing to meet with the tribe for further discussions\" concerning horse wagering.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coyote Valley II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7351442,9114551\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/331/1094/\">\n    331 F.3d at 1110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   The Court \"cannot conclude from the history of negotiations recounted above that ... the State has refused to negotiate in good faith\" on this basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coyote Valley II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7351442,9114551\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/331/1094/\">\n    331 F.3d at 1109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nor is the Court persuaded by Pauma's attempts to argue the State acted in bad faith. Pauma principally complains that the State insisted on more details about the Tribe's plans and did not do more to assist the Tribe in navigating \"the legions of horse racing regulations\" in California. (See Opp'n 15:3- 20:26.) Having considered Pauma's arguments in light of the joint record of negotiations, none of them convincingly identify conduct that amounts to bad faith. Accordingly, Pauma does not demonstrate a lack of good faith based on the State's negotiations concerning horse wagering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

(JR 2-3.) In the Tribe's view, because \"lottery games ... are ... permitted to be conducted and operated on tribal lands subject to [gaming] compacts,\" California is required under IGRA to negotiate with Pauma to allow it to conduct all \"lottery games,\" not just those \"lottery games\" conducted by the California State Lottery.

(SAC \u00b6\u00b6 210-54;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. 4:23-18:20.) In Count 1, the Tribe alleges the State has engaged in \"surface bargaining\" by employing \"dilatory tactics or other forms of 'sophisticated pretense' to avoid reaching an agreement on\" the lottery games issue. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 12 (quoting Farnsworth on Contracts \u00a7 3.26c - Meaning of Fair Dealing (4th ed. 2003) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. 4:23-8:13 (focusing on the lottery games issue).) The Tribe argues the joint record shows that after Pauma requested additional lottery games, \"the State did everything in its power to avoid discussing those [gaming] rights for the next five-hundred-plus days.\" (Pl.'s Mot. 4:27-5:1.) Count 2 relatedly alleges the State has failed to negotiate in good faith because it is trying to protect the California State Lottery from increased tribal competition. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 215-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   Next, in Counts 4 through 8, Pauma alleges the State has negotiated in bad faith because it has refused to negotiate for certain types of lottery games: (i) those games not authorized to the California State Lottery, (Count 4, SAC \u00b6\u00b6 225-29); (ii) video lottery terminals, (Count 5, SAC \u00b6\u00b6 230-34); (iii) video lottery terminals that dispense coins or currency, (Count 6, SAC \u00b6\u00b6 235-39); (iv) games based on a tribal lottery system, (Count 7, SAC \u00b6\u00b6 240-44); and (v) games authorized to the Multi-State Lottery Association or any other state, (Count 8, SAC \u00b6\u00b6 245-49). (\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. 11:15-16:23.) Finally, in Count 9, Pauma claims the State negotiated in bad faith by not substantiating its position on whether Pauma can conduct additional lottery games. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 250-54;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. 16:24-18:20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   The State argues that \"[r]egardless of these claims' multiple lottery-game labels, none shows any failure by the State to negotiate in good faith under IGRA,\" and \"the record of negotiations demonstrates that at all times the State was willing to\n   negotiate with Pauma over lottery games.\" (Defs.'

Pauma claims otherwise in its briefing, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. 16:24-26), and Pauma advanced a similar claim at oral argument, but the Court is unconvinced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   Pauma's last two communications to the State (1) expressed the Tribe's preference \"to conduct the negotiations in a piecemeal fashion,\" (2) articulated Pauma's position on additional lottery games, and (3) communicated that the State \"has not indicated whether it is willing to negotiate for the requested lottery games, let alone begin to draft compact language.\" (JR 239-43.) In response, the State objected to Pauma's preference to conduct piecemeal negotiations and provided its position on additional lottery games:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-219\">\n   The grant of authority to the Governor to negotiate for lottery games under ... the California Constitution has always been understood to encompass those games authorized for play by the California State Lottery. This was the intent and understanding of the language proposed by tribal negotiators and presented to the voters as they considered the amendment to the California Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-220\">\n   However, the State is willing to negotiate to authorize Pauma to offer certain additional lottery games to be enumerated in the compact. Specifying the games provides clarity as to the scope of the authorization, avoids future disputes between the parties, and mitigates the risk of running afoul of other prohibitions on how lottery games may be conducted, such as the keno game offered by the California State Lottery that was found to be an illegal banked game by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Western Telcon, Inc. v. California State Lottery\n   </em>\n   (1996)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1965912\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/13/45/\">\n    13 Cal.4th 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [475,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20812\">\n    53 Cal.Rptr.2d 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=917%20P.2d%20651\">\n    917 P.2d 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-221\">\n   To be clear, the State is not conceding that it has an obligation to negotiate for all lottery games enumerated in your January 27, 2016 letter (other than those authorized to the California State Lottery). Furthermore, the State expressly takes issue with Pauma's ability under IGRA to seek to negotiate \"devices or games that are authorized to any other state lottery or any other multi-state lottery association,\" \"lottery games that are played on video terminals,\" \"tribal lottery systems\" or other lottery systems to the extent operated or conducted off tribal lands, and \"video lottery games that dispense coins or currency.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   (JR 244-45.) Pauma did not respond to the State's negotiation position. And as mentioned several times, the State's proposed draft compact that was transmitted several weeks later expressed that the \"State [was] open, as indicated in prior correspondence, to discussion regarding the authorization of additional enumerated [lottery] games.\" (JR 261.) In light of the foregoing, the parties did not reach an impasse on\n   the lottery games issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rincon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3919867\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/602/1019/#p1025\">\n    602 F.3d at 1026\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, the State's letter-as well as the notation in its first draft of the parties' new compact provided to guide their discussions-indicates the State remained willing to continue negotiating with Pauma on this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coyote Valley II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7351442,9114551\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/331/1094/\">\n    331 F.3d at 1110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That the State was open to further negotiation on the lottery games issue undercuts Pauma's various claims alleging the State failed to negotiate in good faith on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   Moreover, the Court is unpersuaded by Pauma's arguments that the State failed to negotiate in good faith because it engaged in \"shadow boxing\" and \"refused\" to negotiate for particular subsets of lottery games. In advancing its \"shadow boxing\" count, Pauma claims the State engaged in bad faith because the State \"simply sen[t] Pauma\" a draft compact \"that simply omitted any new games\" after the parties' back-and-forth on the lottery games topic. (SAC \u00b6 218;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 228, 223, 238, 243, 248, 253 (repeatedly highlighting that the State sent Pauma a draft compact \"that simply re-conveys the same gaming rights as the 1999 Compact\").) The Tribe similarly argues the focus should be \"on answering questions like 'why did the State send Pauma a \"complete draft [compact]\" five hundred and twenty-two days into the negotiations that was mum on both new forms of gaming that instigated the talks?' \" (Pl.'s Opp'n 24:6-8 (alteration in original).) But the draft compact provided to guide the parties' further discussions is not silent on the Tribe's request for new lottery games. The relevant portion of the draft has a comment stating that the \"State is open, as indicated in prior correspondence, to discussion regarding the authorization of additional enumerated games.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (JR 261.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   Similarly unpersuasive is Pauma's repeated emphasis on the \"five hundred and twenty-two day[ ]\" length of the negotiations to support its allegations concerning the lottery games issue. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl.'s Mot. 4:23-28.) Pauma requested the parties negotiate a new compact shortly before Thanksgiving in 2015, (JR 1), and the final communication in the joint record is dated April 28, 2016, (JR 246). Like in\n   <em>\n    Coyote Valley I\n   </em>\n   , \"the record reflects that both parties at times were less than diligent\" in seeking to move the negotiations forward, particularly because of the State and Pauma's ongoing litigation concerning the 2004 Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11090637\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/147/1011/#p1021\">\n    147 F.Supp.2d at 1015\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For example, the State's summary of the parties' January 30, 2015, meeting reports that the parties \"discussed scheduling [their] next meeting in approximately May 2015, as the parties' participating attorneys [would] face appellate briefing deadlines over the next few months.\" (JR 20.) Then, in the next communication dated May 8, 2015, Pauma requested the negotiations be delayed for another few months because \"the recent orders in the pending compact litigation have essentially guaranteed that [the parties'] attorneys will be largely preoccupied until the oral argument scheduled for July 10, 2015.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JR 25.) The parties did not meet until September 8, 2015-more than six months after their first meeting. (JR 38.) Similarly, when the State was slow to respond to Pauma's January 27, 2016, letter, the State noted on March 30, 2016:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-225\">\n   The State's compact negotiating team is currently in negotiations with over forty\n   other California tribes and this necessarily impacts our scheduling of meetings and response time. In addition to compact negotiations, Pauma and the State continue to actively work on the litigation currently pending at every level of the federal courts and have recently filed significant pleadings. We are committed to moving these negotiations forward but also understand if the Tribe prefers, as it has previously, to defer some negotiation matters until there is a break in the litigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   (JR 245.) Hence, Pauma's emphasis on the total length of the negotiations paints an incomplete picture of the joint record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Overall, having reviewed the joint record, \"[a]ny delays that may have been caused by the State do not rise to the level of bad faith.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coyote Valley I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11090637\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/147/1011/#p1021\">\n    147 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1015 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rincon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3919867\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/602/1019/#p1025\">\n    602 F.3d at 1024-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (summarizing a course of negotiations that spanned from 2003 to 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   Further, Pauma's claims centered on the State's \"refusal to negotiate for\" certain categories of lottery games do not demonstrate the State failed to negotiate in good faith. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 225-49.) The State expressed a willingness to negotiate for additional games, including those not authorized by the California State Lottery. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JR 244, 261.) And, although the State informed Pauma that it \"expressly takes issue\" with certain remaining categories of new lottery games, the Court is not persuaded that the State's conduct amounts to a lack of good faith-or that the parties had even reached an impasse on these other categories of new games. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JR 244- 45.)\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rumsey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7415656\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/64/1250/#p1256\">\n    64 F.3d at 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting the State \"refused to negotiate with the tribes\" concerning \"certain stand-alone electronic gaming devices and live banking and percentage card games\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mashantucket Pequot Tribe v.

The Court is unpersuaded that the parties' back-and-forth in the second negotiation session demonstrates the State's representatives \"insinuated that ... they were engaging in [protectionism] to protect the revenue stream of the State Lottery.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 218;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   JR 89-90 (\"I'm not suggesting we would do that.\").) And the State subsequently said it \"is willing to negotiate to authorize Pauma to offer certain additional lottery games to be enumerated in the compact.\" (JR 244;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   JR 261.) If agreeing to negotiate to allow Pauma to offer new games beyond that conducted by the California State Lottery is part of the State's protectionist strategy, it is a poor one. The Court cannot conclude the State has failed to respond \"in good faith\" to Pauma's request to negotiate a new compact on this basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(7)(B)(ii)(II).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   The Court reaches the same conclusion for Pauma's claim concerning the State's alleged failure to substantiate its position\n   on additional lottery games. Pauma assigns significant weight to the State negotiator's statement that \"[t]he grant of authority to the Governor to negotiate for lottery games under article IV, section 19, subdivision (f) of the California Constitution has always been understood to encompass those games authorized for play by the California State Lottery.\" (JR 244;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 253; Pl.'s Mot. 16:24-18:20.) Pauma argues the State's \"ability to throw out this baseless claim without any sort of corrective check allowed the State to shut down all discussion on lottery games and leave the negotiations in a hopeless morass.\" (Pl.'s Mot. 18:16-18.) But, as outlined above, the State did not \"shut down all discussion on lottery games.\" The next sentence of the State's letter provides: \"However, the State is willing to negotiate to authorize Pauma to offer certain additional lottery games to be enumerated in the compact.\" (JR 244.) Further, the State's proposed draft compact, which is attached to the most recent communication in the negotiations, similarly expressed that the \"State is open, as indicated in prior correspondence, to discussion regarding the authorization of additional enumerated games.\" (JR 261.) In light of the foregoing, Pauma does not demonstrate a lack of good faith on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   In sum, Pauma's lottery games claims based on the parties' incomplete negotiations are unconvincing. After Pauma pressed the State on this issue, the State agreed to negotiate for certain additional lottery games and took \"issue\" with several other categories of new games. The Tribe, having received the State's position on this topic, never responded to it. And Pauma's efforts to portray the State as seeking to shut down negotiation on this topic are unconvincing. Overall, the Court concludes the evidence concerning lottery games does not show the State has failed to respond to Pauma's request to negotiate a new compact \"in good faith.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(7)(B)(ii)(II).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Scope of Negotiations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   Pauma's remaining claim alleges the State negotiated in bad faith by erecting procedural barriers to hinder the parties' negotiations. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 255-59.) This claim centers on the parties' dispute concerning the scope of negotiations that is outlined above. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. 18:21-21:11.) To recap, the parties sparred over whether Pauma's request to offer two new forms of gaming under the 1999 Compact's renegotiation provision-Section 12.1-subjected all of the compact's terms to renegotiation. The parties resolved their dispute, decided to proceed under the amendment provision-Section 12.2-and agreed that \"the entire compact\" is up for negotiation. (JR 238.) Having secured the State's agreement that the entire compact is subject to negotiation, Pauma then informed the State that the Tribe \"prefers to conduct the negotiations in a piecemeal fashion, focusing on one material issue and then moving on to the next only after the parties have largely agreed on language for the final compact.\" (JR 239.) The State declined to conduct negotiations in this fashion, provided its position on Pauma's lottery games request, and transmitted a draft compact to guide the parties' future discussions. (JR 244- 46.) The negotiations then ended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   In Count 10, the Tribe alleges the State's \"negotiator used this change in the basis for the negotiations to shift the discussion from what the State would\n   <em>\n    give\n   </em>\n   to what it would\n   <em>\n    receive\n   </em>\n   .\" (SAC \u00b6 258.) \"As a consequence,\" in Pauma's view, the State's negotiator \"simply transmitted a 'complete draft [compact]' to Pauma that the State had prepared for another tribe that incorporates legions of new regulations while simply reconveying the same gaming\n   rights of the 1999 Compact (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , slot machines, house banked card games, and only those lottery games that the State Lottery has authorized itself to offer).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alteration in original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   The Court is unpersuaded that this claim demonstrates a lack of good faith. Although the parties' disagreement concerning the scope of negotiations may have caused a delay in their discussions, the joint record reveals the parties resolved this dispute and pressed onwards-with Pauma then seeking to focus on a single issue, and the State seeking to negotiate the entire compact. (JR 234-38.) The Court also notes that during the parties' dispute concerning the scope of negotiations, the State continued to engage Pauma on the lottery games and horse wagering issues. (JR 183-84, 208-09.) Overall, \"[a]ny delays that may have been caused by the State [regarding this issue] do not rise to the level of bad faith.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coyote Valley I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11090637\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/147/1011/#p1021\">\n    147 F.Supp.2d at 1015\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, when considering the balance of the parties' negotiations, the State's conduct regarding the scope of negotiations does not demonstrate the State has failed to respond to Pauma's request to negotiate a new compact \"in good faith.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(7)(B)(ii)(II).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   In sum, having considered all of Pauma's twenty bad faith negotiation claims, the Court \"cannot conclude from the history of negotiations recounted above that ... the State has refused to negotiate in good faith.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coyote Valley II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7351442,9114551\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/331/1094/\">\n    331 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1109 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(7)(B)(ii)(II).

(Joint Mot. 2:19-24, ECF No. 28.) \"A district court order is ... not appealable unless it disposes of all claims as to all parties or unless judgment is entered in compliance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b).\n   <em>\n    Romoland Sch.

This Court's resolution of the parties' cross-motions does not dispose of this action in its entirety-Pauma also brings two claims against the State for breach of the 1999 Compact. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 311-20.) Hence, the Court turns to Rule 54(b). This rule provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-239\">\n   When an action presents more than one claim for relief ..., the court may direct entry of a final judgment as to one or more, but fewer than all, claims ... only if the court expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay.

(\n    <em>\n     E.g.\n    </em>\n    , Pl.'s Mot. 23:2-18 (alteration in original).) In doing so, Pauma argues \"complete\" means the draft document was \"to the greatest extent or degree\" finished-that is, a \"functionally final draft of the compact. (\n    <em>\n     See id.\n    </em>\n    23:4-10.) This effort is not convincing. Nothing prevented the Tribe from seeking to negotiate or modify the terms of the draft compact. The document itself also shows it is not \"to the greatest extent or degree\" finished. The draft compact includes comments indicating that the State is open to incorporating Pauma's requests to conduct new forms of gambling. (JR 247-381.) More importantly, the State expressed that this draft was to \"guide [the parties'] future discussions,\" stated the draft was for Pauma's \"consideration,\" and requested that the Tribe \"[p]lease let [the State] know when [it] would like to discuss\" the draft. (JR 245-46.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-253\">\n    Even less convincing is Pauma's reliance on a comment attached to the draft table of contents in the draft compact. The Tribe argues the draft compact \"contained a comment bubble at the very outset explaining that the document was '[t]o be finalized before singing.' \" (Pl.'s 22:13- 14 (citing JR 248).) The implication Pauma asks the Court to draw is that the State was suggesting the document is \"complete\" and only needs to be \"finalized before signing.\" (\n    <em>\n     See id.\n    </em>\n    ) But, as indicated, the \"comment bubble\" Pauma relies upon is appended to the draft compact's \"TABLE OF CONTENTS\" header. (JR 248.) Meaning, the State was commenting that the document's table of contents was \"[t]o be finalized before signing.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) If anything, this comment undercuts Pauma's claims. It shows the State was anticipating that there would be changes made to the draft compact that would require the document's table of contents to be updated and \"finalized\" before execution of the compact. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    )\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-254\">\n    For the same reasons, the record does not validate Pauma's claim that the State \"sought to block all new lottery games solely on the conjectural basis that one of them could run afoul of the law at some point in the future.\" (Pl.'s Opp'n 14:13-15 (emphasis in original).) Again, the State said it was \"willing\" and \"open\" to negotiating certain additional lottery games to be enumerated in the compact. (JR 244, 261.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-255\">\n    In the same vein, the Court disapproves of Pauma characterizing the State as \"enter[ing] month ten of its efforts to stall the discussions\" at the second negotiation session. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n 24:15-17.) As recounted above, the parties did not meet for approximately six months between the first and second meetings-in part due to Pauma's request to delay the second meeting because of the ongoing 2004 Amendment litigation.
