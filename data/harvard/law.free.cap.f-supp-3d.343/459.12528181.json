(\"Ecore\") and its Chairman and CEO, Arthur Dodge, III, and Defendants, Paul Downey and his companies, CSR Industries, Inc. (\"CSR\") and Pliteq, Inc. (\"Pliteq\"). The parties have asserted various claims and counterclaims against each other, all of which generally relate to Downey's and CSR's former consulting relationship with Ecore, and to the parties' dispute over the rights to several patents and the underlying intellectual property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff's Motion (ECF No. 88) seeks summary judgment on: Ecore's breach of contract claim (Count IV, Am. Compl., ECF No. 49.), Downey's claims for breach of contract (Countercl. I, Answ. &amp; Countercl., ECF No. 50) and\n   <em>\n    quantum meryit\n   </em>\n   /unjust enrichment (Countercl. II), CSR's claim for\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   /unjust enrichment (Countercl. IV), Downey's and CSR's claims for promissory estoppel (Countercl. V) and fraudulent inducement (Countercl. VI), and Pliteq's claims for tortious interference with contract and prospective contract (Countercls. VII, VIII). Ecore also seeks summary judgment that it is the owner of a patent at issue in Pliteq's claim of false marketing (Countercl. XIV).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants' Motion (ECF No. 85) seeks summary judgment on: Counterclaims I, II, and IV; CSR's breach of contract claim (Countercl. III); portions of Plaintiff's Lanham Act claim (Count I); and Plaintiff's claim for conversion (Count I, Compl., Case No. 16-1993, ECF No. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons that follow, Ecore's Motion for Summary Judgment will be granted on Defendants' Counterclaims I, II, IV, V, VI, VII, and VIII; granted in part on Ecore's Count IV; and denied as to Counterclaim XIV. Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment will be granted on the portions of Ecore's Count I that are based on the alleged alteration of product test reports. In all other respects, Defendants' Motion will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The company now known as Ecore was formed in 1869 and, throughout its existence, Ecore has been in the business of transforming reclaimed materials into new\n   products.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Pl.'s SJ Br. 3.) In 1990, Ecore, then operating under the name Dodge Cork Company, formed a joint venture with a German company, Berleburger Schaumstoffwerk GmbH (\"BSW\"), in order to use BSW technology in the United States and expand Ecore's business in the market for recycled rubber products. (Dodge 8/22/16 Dep. 17-18.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dodge became CEO of the venture, and the company name was changed from Dodge Cork Company to Dodge-Regupol, Inc. (\"DRI\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19.) In January 2008, the joint venture was dissolved, and the \"Dodge-side\" of the venture changed its name from DRI to Ecore.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Paul Downey is a chemical engineer and a citizen and resident of Canada. (Downey 4/1/11 Dep. 7; Downey 11/29/16 Decl. \u00b6 3, ECF No. 85-4.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   From 1992 to 1999, Downey worked as a production supervisor at National Rubber Industries, Inc. (\"NRI\"), a rubber recycling company and competitor of Ecore's. (Downey 4/1/11 Dep. 14; Downey 11/29/16 Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6; Ontario Ct. App. Op. \u00b6 5, Pl.'s SJ Ex. F.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 1998, while working at NRI, Downey founded CSR as an engineering consulting company. (Downey 11/29/16 Decl. \u00b6 8; Downey 8/29/16 Dep. 53.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    1. The Consulting Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In August and September 1999, Downey and Dodge discussed a potential role for Downey with Ecore. (Ontario Ct. App. Op. \u00b6 6.) On September 9, 1999, Dodge sent Downey a letter and an \"Employment Proposal\" offering Downey a position with Ecore as \"Business Development Manager - Industrial Products.\" (Defs.' SJ Opp. Ex. 1.) Given Downey's status as a Canadian citizen and resident, Dodge proposed that Downey initially be retained as an independent contractor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dodge's letter further stated: \"[g]iven your history and industry knowledge, coincident with your joining the company and as a condition of your employment, we will require you to sign an Employee Confidentiality Agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In response to Ecore's offer, Downey proposed that Ecore instead enter into a consulting agreement with his company, CSR, because that arrangement would be advantageous to Downey under Canadian tax law. (Ontario Ct. App. Op. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 27; Ontario Sup. Ct. Op. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 30, Defs.' SJ Opp. Ex. 7.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Downey's attorney drafted a consulting agreement between Ecore and CSR, with Downey identified as CSR's \"Key Person,\" and Downey sent the\n   draft agreement to Dodge. (Downey 8/11/2011 Dep. 28, Pl.'s SJ Ex. B.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On September 14, 1999, Ecore and CSR entered into a Consulting Agreement, which was a modified version of the draft agreement Downey's attorney had prepared.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Consulting Agreement defined Ecore as the \"Client,\" CSR as the \"Consultant,\" and Downey as a \"Key Person of the Consultant.\" (Consulting Agmt. Pmbl, \u00a7 7(a).) Pursuant to the Consulting Agreement, and commencing on October 4, 1999, the Consultant was to \"act as Manager Business Development - Industrial Products for the Client pertaining to the development and sale of Regupol sheets and rolls\" in specified markets, and to provide other services, including \"the investigation and development of new business opportunities within industrial market segments.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1.) The Key Person provision of the Agreement stated, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The parties acknowledge that Paul Downey is a Key Person of the Consultant and is integral to the successful performance of the Services by the Consultant under this Agreement. It is acknowledged by the Consultant that Paul Downey will perform all services of the Services, unless the client otherwise consents in writing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7(a).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As the base fee for services provided under the Agreement, Ecore was to pay CSR $132,000 (CDN) per year, to be paid weekly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3(a).) The Consulting Agreement provided that the base compensation would be reviewed annually and could be modified upward at Ecore's \"sole discretion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3(b).) The Consulting Agreement provided that CSR was entitled to a bonus of $20,000 (CDN) if Ecore realized $1 million (USD) in new revenue in fiscal year 2000, plus 2.5 percent of all revenue over $1 million (USD) in that year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3(c).) In addition, CSR would be considered for participation in company-wide bonus distributions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Consulting Agreement included a \"Confidential Information\" provision, which stated: \"The Consultant will execute a copy of the Client's standard confidentiality agreement, and said confidentiality agreement, upon execution, will form a part of this agreement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    2. The Confidentiality Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Downey began working for Ecore in early October 1999 and, at Ecore's request, he executed a Confidentiality Agreement, dated October 1, 1999.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Downey 8/29/16 Dep. 118-119; Ontario Sup. Ct. Op. \u00b6 15.) The parties to the Confidentiality Agreement were DRI, referred to as \"Company,\" and Downey, referred to as \"Employee.\" (Confidentiality Agmt. Pmbl.).

The Confidentiality Agreement defined \"Proprietary Information\" as:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n    (a) all technology, know how, plans, designs, specifications, formulas, technical information, drawings, and other information related to the Company's products, production equipment, and manufacturing processes,\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n    (b) audited and internally prepared financial statements and related supplementary information, and other financial information of the Company which may include information about revenue, expenses, prices, and profits, and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n    (c) all other information owned by or related to the Company which is not generally known within the industry in which the Company is engaged.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    (Confidentiality Agmt. \u00a7 1.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Under Section 2 of the Agreement, Downey agreed: (a) to treat Proprietary Information as \"secret and confidential\"; (b) to use Proprietary Information only for Ecore's benefit and not for his own benefit; (c) to not directly or indirectly disclose or communicate any Proprietary Information to anyone except as authorized by Ecore; and (d) to promptly return to Ecore all Proprietary Information, without retaining any copies, summaries, or excerpts, upon termination of his employment. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 2.) The Confidentiality Agreement also declared Ecore's \"exclusive rights\" to intellectual property relating to its Proprietary Information, stating:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n    All inventions or discoveries which relate to the Proprietary Information shall be the exclusive property of the Company. Whenever requested by the Company, either during or subsequent to employment, Employee shall execute such instruments as Company deems necessary for the purpose of confirming Company's exclusive rights to any such invention or discovery under applicable intellectual property law, including but not\n    <em>\n     limited\n    </em>\n    to any application for Letters patent and assignments thereof.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 4.)

According to Dodge, confidentiality and intellectual property protections were an essential prerequisite to Ecore's willingness to work with Downey. Dodge testified:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n    Downey was retained by Ecore having worked for a competitor. One of the initial conversations I had with [Downey] was under no circumstances would\n    we consider extending any relationship or employment or any other relationship with [Downey] unless he entered into a confidentiality and intellectual property protection and assignment agreement. That was absolutely sacred. We would never have hired somebody from a direct competitor and allowed them to pursue any alternative lines of business. It would have been foolhardy, foolish, never would have done it.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    (Dodge 8/22/16 Dep. 89-90.) Downey has acknowledged that he agreed to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement. (Downey 8/29/16 Dep. 118-119.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    In 2008, Ecore asked Downey to sign an \"Amended and Restated Confidentiality Agreement\" that sought to: (1) refer to Downey as a \"Key Person\" of the Consultant instead of an \"Employee\"; and (2) create joint and several obligations on the part of Downey and CSR. (Defs.' SJ Opp. 8, Ex. 2; Ont. Ct. App. Op. \u00b6 24.) Downey declined to sign the amended agreement. (Downey 1/3/17 Decl. \u00b6 3, ECF No. 91-2.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    <em>\n     3. The Disputed Intellectual Property\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    a. The Impact Sound Isolation Invention and Assignment\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    As noted above, Downey began working as Ecore's business development manager for industrial products in October 1999. (Downey 6/27/07 Dep. 64; Downey 8/29/16 Dep. 65, 70.)\n    <footnotemark>\n     16\n    </footnotemark>\n    In January 2000, Dodge told Downey that Ecore wanted to pursue business in the sound and vibration mitigation product market, and he asked Downey to investigate and develop opportunities in that market. (Downey 6/27/07 Dep. 84; Downey 8/29/16 Dep. 70.) To identify potential opportunities, Downey consulted with Ecore's engineers and decided to focus on flooring system products that could mitigate impact sound. (Downey 6/27/07 Dep. 87, 90-91.) At that time, Downey had no background in the sound and vibration flooring market, but he and Dodge knew that rubber was a good material with which to \"build products ... that had sound and vibration qualities.\" (Downey 6/27/07 Dep. 85, 90.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Downey considered the sound and vibration products already on the market and explored whether Ecore's existing rubber products might have a sound and vibration application. (Downey 8/29/16 Dep. 70-71; Downey 6/27/07 Dep. 106.) He examined Ecore products from its sample room and reviewed Ecore's formulas and specification sheets for its rubber products. (Downey 6/27/07 Dep. 87, 90-91; Downey 4/1/11 Dep. 22-23, 62; Downey 4/24/08 Dep. 217, Pl.'s SJ Ex. I.)\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n    Downey also consulted with employees of Ecore's joint venture partner, BSW, who informed him that the material used in Ecore's 6010 and 6510 formulations was \"suitable for absorbing vibration.\" (Downey 4/1/11 Dep. 23.) BSW personnel also provided literature, including a binder, with test results and other information regarding the vibration isolation properties of the 6010 and 6510 formulations. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 22-27.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Downey ultimately decided to modify Ecore's 6510-LC formulation so that it would be suitable for use as substrate between a subfloor and a decorative top floor covering, such as ceramic tile. (Downey 6/27/07 Dep. 106; Downey 4/1/11 Dep. 57, 62.) Downey asked Ecore employee Dierk Heinbach \"to add some more regrind\" to the 6510-LC formula in order to\n    make the product \"slightly more porous for the adhesive\" and to give it a \"slightly higher dynamic stiffness.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     18\n    </footnotemark>\n    (Downey 4/1/11 Dep. 57, 62, 73.) With this one modification, the resulting formulation - designated 6510-LC-2 - could be used as a flooring substrate that \"could support the decorative floor covering and still perform acoustically.\" (Downey 4/1/11 Dep. 57, 73.) This new flooring system design became known as the Impact Sound Insulation (\"ISI\") invention.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    On August 16, 2001, Ecore filed patent application No. 09/931,320 (the \" '320 Application\") for the ISI invention.\n    <footnotemark>\n     19\n    </footnotemark>\n    (Downey 11/29/16 Decl. \u00b6 14; Defs.' SJ Opp. Ex. 4.) The '320 Application named Downey as its sole inventor. (Downey 11/29/16 Decl. \u00b6 15.) On October 10, 2001, Downey executed an Assignment to Ecore of the ISI invention set forth in the '320 Application (the \"Assignment\").\n    <footnotemark>\n     20\n    </footnotemark>\n    Pursuant to the Assignment, Downey agreed to,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    :\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n    1.

(Pl.'s SJ Br. 7; Downey 1/3/17 Decl. \u00b6 26; Downey 8/29/16 Dep. 291.) Initially, Downey worked with Dodge and Ecore's counsel, Barley Snyder, LLC, to pursue a patent for the NVMM invention. (Pl.'s SJ Br. 7; Downey 8/29/16 Dep. 291-292.) On October 1, 2002, Ecore filed provisional patent application No. 60/415,054 (the \" '054 Application\") for the NVMM invention. (Downey 1/3/17 Decl. \u00b6 25.) On October 1, 2003, Ecore filed patent application No. PCT/US03/31348 (the \" '348 Application\"), claiming priority to the '054 Application. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) On April 1, 2005, Ecore filed application No. 11/096,589 (the \" '589 Application\"), which was a continuation in part of the '348 Application. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Subsequently, the '589 Application was abandoned. (Defs. SJ Ex. LL; Defs.'

(Downey 1/3/17 Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 28-29; Defs.' SJ Ex. MM.) On July 24, 2012, Downey filed patent application No. 13/556,731 (the \" '731 Application\"), which was a continuation of the '339 Application. (Defs.' SJ Exs. D, LL.) On August, 14, 2012, the '339 Application issued as\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%208%2C240%2C430\">\n     U.S. Patent No. 8,240,430\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (the \" '430 Patent\"), and on October 15, 2013, the '731 Application issued as\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%208%2C\">\n     U.S. Patent No. 8,\n    </extracted-citation>\n    556,029 (the \" '029 Patent\"). The '430 and '029 Patents are both titled \"Noise and Vibration Mitigating Mat.\" (Defs.' SJ Exs. D, MM.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Defendants contend that Ecore abandoned the NVMM invention patent applications, and that Dodge told Downey he could pursue patenting of the invention on his own. (Downey 8/29/16 Dep. 294-95; Downey 1/3/17 Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 25, 27.) According to Ecore, however, it did not abandon the NVMM invention and did not give Downey permission to pursue the related patents on his own behalf. (Dodge Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6; Pl.'s SJ Opp. 5.) Ecore further asserts that it did not know the '029 Patent existed until Defendants disclosed it in their Answer and Counterclaims to Plaintiff's Amended Complaint in Case No. 11-6843. (Pl.'s SJ Opp. 5-6.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    <em>\n     4. Downey/CSR Compensation Disputes\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    The record indicates that from late 2000 through the end of the parties' business relationship, Downey and Dodge engaged in a number of communications and negotiations relating to the compensation issues\n    in dispute in the parties' summary judgment motions. These disputes involve: (1) Downey's claimed entitlement to compensation for the ISI invention and Assignment, and (2) CSR's claim for allegedly unpaid bonus compensation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    As noted above, the Consulting Agreement originally obligated Ecore to pay CSR $132,000 (CDN) per year, plus a $20,000 (CDN) bonus if Ecore realized $1 million (USD) in new revenue in fiscal year 2000, and an additional 2.5 percent of all revenue over $1 million (USD) in that year.\n    <footnotemark>\n     25\n    </footnotemark>\n    (Consulting Agmt. \u00a7 3(a), (c).) By early to mid December 2000, it was evident that Ecore would not realize $1 million (USD) in new revenue in 2000. (Pl.'s SJ Exs. M, O.) Nevertheless, by letter dated December 8, 2000, Dodge offered to pay CSR/Downey a bonus of $10,000 (CDN) for 2000. (Pl's SJ Ex. M.) Dodge also proposed a 4.5 percent increase in base compensation and a target bonus of $20,000 (CDN) for 2001. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Downey counteroffered for a $15,000 (USD) bonus for 2000, plus an incentive bonus of 3.33 percent of new, profitable revenues in 2001, rather than the 2.5 percent over $1 million specified in the Consulting Agreement. (Pl.'s SJ Ex. N.) Ultimately, it appears that the parties agreed on a bonus of $10,000 (CDN) for 2000 and a modified incentive bonus of 6 percent of the gross margin on Ecore's sound and vibration-related revenues for 2001 and going forward. (Pl.'s SJ Ex. O.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Defendants contend that in early October 2001, when Downey agreed to assign his rights in the '320 Application to Ecore, Dodge told Downey that, in return, Ecore would reasonably compensate him for the ISI invention and Assignment. (Downey 11/29/16 Decl. \u00b6 16; Downey 8/29/16 Dep. 225-26.) Downey asserts that he \"accepted [this] offer,\" which he claims resulted in an enforceable oral agreement (the \"October 2001 'Agreement' \") under which Ecore was obligated to pay him \"reasonable compensation\" for the Assignment. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 16-17; Downey 1/3/17 Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-12.) The alleged October 2001 \"Agreement\"-the existence of which is disputed-did not specify what would constitute \"reasonable compensation,\" how that compensation would be calculated or determined, when the compensation was to be paid, or whether and to what extent Downey would share the costs of defending or enforcing the ISI invention patents. Defendants contend that the alleged October 2001 \"Agreement\" supersedes the Confidentiality Agreement and controls the Assignment of the ISI invention. (Defs.' SJ Opp. 26, 28, 33-34; Defs.' SJ Reply 5, 10-11, ECF No. 94.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Ecore denies that any such agreement existed. Dodge testified that Ecore \"never\" agreed to compensate Downey for the Assignment (Dodge 8/22/16 Dep. 88.) According to Dodge, \"[Ecore] had no duty or obligation to compensate Mr. Downey for something that he was legally obligated to do pursuant to his employment agreement.\" (Dodge 8/22/16 Dep. 88.) Dodge further testified that Downey \"was compensated at the time he entered into his employment agreement.... The consideration he received was his salary and bonuses to that point in time.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 90.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Downey claims that between October 2001 and the July 2005 issuance of the '723 Patent, Dodge repeatedly told him that Ecore would reasonably compensate him for the Assignment under the October 2001 \"Agreement\" as soon as the patent\n    was issued and could be successfully asserted by Ecore. (Downey 1/3/17 Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.) However, for most of that period, the parties' written communications contain no reference to the allegedly promised Assignment compensation. For example, on January 2, 2002, Dodge sent Downey an email confirming their agreement that \"your bonus will continue to be based upon our current formula: namely, 6% of the gross margin for all identified sound and vibration customers.... This formula shall remain in effect for FY 2002-2004,\" (Pl.'s SJ Ex. P; Dodge 8/22/16 Dep. 63-64.) Similarly, between May and December 2004, Dodge and Downey exchanged correspondence regarding the CSR/Downey compensation and bonus calculation, and Downey indicated that he wished to enter into negotiations for a new consulting agreement between Ecore and CSR. (Pl.'s SJ Exs. S, T.) This correspondence contains no reference-by either Dodge or Downey-to compensation for the Assignment, generally, or to the alleged October 2001 \"Agreement,\" specifically.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The record reflects that in early 2005, Dodge and Downey were negotiating the terms of future base and bonus compensation to be paid to CSR/Downey, and Downey was requesting compensation for the Assignment. However, the negotiations contain no express reference to the alleged October 2001 \"Agreement.\" (Pl.'s SJ Ex. T.) In a May 2, 2005 letter to Dodge, Downey stated,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    :\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n    My compensation was supposed to be designed to reflect additional remuneration for the impact sound patent I had assigned to DRI, which your proposal does not address.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n    * * *\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n    Building upon these points, and on a basis that I wish to continue my relationship with DRI, any proposal for my future remuneration must reflect the fact that I am to be compensated for my development of the patent and inauguration of the [Sound &amp; Vibration] Product line. I would propose that I be compensated on a percentage basis (exact amount to be agreed subsequent to negotiations) of the gross revenue based upon sales of the [ISI], the patent for which I had previously assigned to DRI, in consideration for that assignment from me.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    )\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    The parties' negotiations continued in 2006, and in early May of that year, Dodge faxed Downey three proposed agreements: an Independent Contractor Agreement, a Special Commission Agreement, and a Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Between May 5, 2006 and early November 2006, Downey and Dodge exchanged a series of emails regarding the terms of the proposed agreements, including the provisions relating to patents and intellectual property. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) In the first of three May 5 emails, Downey stated: \"I have reviewed the proposed agreements you faxed to me. There is much work to be done and unfortunately not much time left in which to do it.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Downey then proposed some revisions to the agreements, including to the terms of the \"special commissions agreement ie. patent licensing agreement,\" which Downey said would apply to the ISI, NVMM, and other inventions. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Downey further proposed:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n    If the Consulting Agreement is terminated I will have the sole option of having the patents assigned back to me or revoking the [license], as the case may be. This will allow DRI to continue to market and sell the products manufactured using the patents at the same remuneration rate, or having DRI take permanent assignment of the patents, upon an agreed upon compensation,\n    which would [be] based upon a valuation at the time. Additionally, termination of the Licensing Agreement would not automatically occur upon termination of the Consulting Agreement.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) In the second May 5 email, Dodge responded to Downey's revisions and, regarding Downey's patent-related proposal, Dodge stated:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n    [A]ll intellectual property, patents and copyrights developed during the course of employment with DRI by any employee must be assigned to the Company....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n    Paul, let's be clear. At no time, did I or any member of the DRI Board or management represent that you or companies owned by you could claim ownership of patentable Regupol product applications technology developed by the Company during your employment. What we did discuss was the form and duration of appropriate compensation for unique, new, patentable applications of Regupol, which we encourage. The Special Commission Agreement addresses this issue, which you and I discussed previously. The Special Commission Agreement can be with CSR Tech Holdings Inc, or whatever entity you prefer, but DRI funded patents must remain irrevocably with DRI.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n    * * *\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n    While [I] understand and appreciate that time is of the essence for you, any modification of our current offer will require the consent of the Board.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Downey then responded in a third email, stating: \"The agreements aren't much use unless we have the basics in place. When we met in Toronto in July 2005 and again in Lancaster in March 2006 we discussed and consented to three general principles[.]\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) According to Downey's email, one of these principles was \"[t]o provide compensation for patent assignment.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     26\n    </footnotemark>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) In his email, Downey told Dodge: \"None of this is news to you. If you need to have those discussions with the Board, you should have them now.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    )\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The negotiations continued, and in a November 8, 2006 email to Downey, Dodge noted that Ecore had borne all the costs of defending the patents - a sum Dodge said was between $750,000 and $1 million. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Downey responded the next day, stating, in part: \"I think we have already outlined what is close to an agreement. We actually need to have something written down that makes sense to both of us. The Board needs to review the agreement for patent licensing that I tabled in August.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Dodge responded later that day, stating:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n    Again, let's be straight. We've kicked around a lot of scenarios, but agreed on nothing.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n    Your answer does not address the issues I put to you yesterday.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n    What specifically do you want as a fair and reasonable compensation package.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n    [I] understand what is in the proposed Licensing Agreement, but what more do you expect.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n    Please be very clear and unambiguous here.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Downey subsequently sent a detailed response outlining \"[t]he specifics of the new proposed agreement,\" which Downey stated \"are consistent with our verbal discussions and are based on a continuation of the current consulting agreement with the following changes.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) The changes\n    outlined in Downey's email related to his position and title with the company, his compensation, and \"Patent Licensing: as proposed.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Downey closed the email by stating: Please review so that we can formalize the agreement and get going towards taking on our continued business growth.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    )\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    It is undisputed that beginning in 2007, the CSR/Downey incentive bonus was increased to 12 percent of the sound and vibration unit operating profit.\n    <footnotemark>\n     27\n    </footnotemark>\n    (Defs.' SJ Ex. W, X; Downey 8/29/16 Dep. 140.) However, the issue of patent compensation remained unresolved. Defendants contend that during the time Ecore was pursuing the Reissue Application, Dodge repeatedly assured Downey that he would be reasonably compensated under the October 2001 \"Agreement.\" (Downey 1/3/2017 Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.) On October 1, 2007, Dodge sent Downey an email stating:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n    This confirms our understanding that your agreement to sign the authorization for the reissue of the '723 patent does not negate DRI's responsibility to reasonably compensate you thereunder.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    (Defs.' SJ Ex. I; Defs.' SJ Opp. Ex. 11.) According to Dodge, this email did not acknowledge the alleged October 2001 \"Agreement,\" but, rather, referred only to \"[t]he bonus compensation that [Downey] was and had historically been receiving.\" (Dodge 8/22/16 Dep. 93.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    In early 2008, the independent members of Ecore's Board of Directors rejected Downey's demand for additional compensation for the ISI invention patents, and instead proposed potential future long-term compensation conditioned on Downey staying with Ecore for at least ten years. (Defs.' SJ Ex. W.) In a January 11, 2008 email to Downey forwarding the Board of Directors' decision, Dodge stated: \"We agreed that we would all be bound by the decision of the independent directors, hence I believe that [the patent compensation] issue is now resolved.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) The issue, however, was not resolved and, in his May 22, 2010 letter to Dodge enclosing the executed inventor declaration for the Reissue Application, Downey stated that he \"[was] not waiving any of my claims relating to the [ '723 Patent], or any reissued patent, including claims to compensation.\" (Defs.' SJ Ex. J.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    On March 10, 2011, Dodge sent an email to Ecore's CFO, stating: \"[Downey] wants comp for coming up with the patent concept in the event he's terminated, quits or dies. Told him I'd think about it as soon as the patent is enforceable. Quasi golden handcuffs.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     28\n    </footnotemark>\n    (Defs.' SJ Ex. L.) Shortly thereafter, in a March 22, 2011 email to Dodge about other business issues, Downey asked Dodge: \"What is your status on the proposal for Ecore compensating me for my patent?\" (Pl's SJ Reply Ex. D.) Finally, in a letter to Dodge dated June 29, 2011, Downey stated that Dodge was \"ignor[ing]\" and \"stonewall[ing]\" his \"10-year-old claim to compensation from our agreement on the reissued patent.\" (Pl.'s\n    SJ Ex. U; Defs.' SJ Ex. O.) Downey later testified in his deposition that despite negotiations with Dodge \"over the course of several years,\" Dodge \"never fulfilled his promise\" to reasonably compensate Downey for the Assignment. (Downey 8/29/16 Dep. 190-91, 225-26.) Ecore asserts that it paid CSR a total of almost $1.9 million in fees and expenses between 2000 and 2010, and that it paid Downey a total of more than $1.5 million in commissions between 2003 and 2010. (Pl.'s SJ Ex. Q.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    <em>\n     5. Downey's Formation and Operation Of Pliteq\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    In 2006, Downey formed Pliteq, Inc. \"[f]or the production and sale of treadmill pad products and an acoustical isolation clip.\" (Downey 8/29/16 Dep. 11.) Initially, Pliteq sold products that did not compete with Ecore's. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 11-13.) However, in approximately 2009, Downey began buying the QTscu product from Ecore, re-labeling it, and re-selling it as a competing Pliteq product called GenieMat. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 13, 42-43; Freidkes Dep. 33-34.)\n    <footnotemark>\n     29\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Defendants claim that Dodge knew of and approved Pliteq's sale of its GenieMat as a \"private label\" version of Ecore's QTscu product. (Downey 8/29/16 Dep. 42-43.) Defendants point to a chain of email messages Downey forwarded to Dodge on September 29, 2010. (Defs.' SJ Ex. U; Defs.' SJ Opp. Ex. 5.) The forwarded messages appear to contain Downey's discussions with a third party named John LoVerde about Ecore competitors' products and price comparisons. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) In his message to Dodge forwarding the email chain, Downey stated: \"This is what I'm dealing with - note the last paragraph.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) In the last paragraph of the most recent forwarded email, LoVerde appears to be recounting to Downey that a potential Ecore customer was considering buying a competitor's comparable product - called Regupol-Impacta - at prices and terms that were better than Ecore's. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) In the last paragraph of the earliest email in the chain, Downey told LoVerde that he had informed the potential customer that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n    [W]e will sell a private label of QT, called Pliteq GenieMat, through our distributor ... It won't have the same level of testing, or say QT on it, but at least is comparable with the SoundSeal testing, and we can provide a letter saying it is a private label as manufactured by Ecore.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    )\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    In response to the forwarded email chain, Dodge replied to Downey, stating: \"F*** them ... cut their throat on price.... Take no prisoners ... we'll clean up the market mess once we have the reissue in hand.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) According to Defendants, the forwarded email chain represented Downey's \"proposal\" to Dodge for Pliteq to sell a private label version of Ecore's QT product, and Dodge's response represented his \"emphatic\" agreement to that \"proposal.\" (Defs.' SJ Opp. 49-51;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Downey 8/29/16 Dep. 42-43.) Defendants contend that Dodge's approval of Pliteq's activities is confirmed by independent sales representative John Freidkes, who testified that he overheard Downey's side of a telephone call in which Downey told Dodge: \"We need to sell an inexpensive mat without destroying the QT brand.\" (Freidkes Dep. 44-45.) Freidkes, who did not hear Dodge's side of the conversation, testified that Downey told him \"he had Art's approval to sell a competitive mat.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    )\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    In contrast to Defendants' account of these events, Ecore asserts that Downey never had permission to disclose Ecore's proprietary information to Pliteq or to use\n    that information to sell Pliteq's GenieMat product in competition with Ecore. (Pl.'s SJ Br. 14-15; Pl.'s SJ Reply 9-12; Dodge 8/22/16 Dep. 111-116.) Regarding the email chain Downey forwarded on September 29, 2010, Dodge testified that at the time, he did not even read the last paragraph of the earliest forwarded email. (Dodge 8/22/2016 Dep. 114-16.) Dodge further testified that his response to Downey referred to the competing Regupol-Impacta product referenced in the most recent forwarded email. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 117.) According to Ecore, it did not know that Pliteq existed until mid-July 2011. (Dodge 10/25/2012 Dep. 112, Pl.'s SJ Reply Ex. B.) Specifically, on July 13, 2011, Ecore's vice president of operations sent Dodge an email asking: \"Do you know anything about a company called Pliteq? They sell sound underlayment under the name GenieMat\u2122 RST02.\" (Pl's SJ Reply Ex. C.) The same day, Dodge forwarded this inquiry to another Ecore employee and asked: \"Who is this?\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) In response, the employee told Dodge: \"We have never heard of them. They are out of Toronto.

App. Op. \u00b6 25; Downey Stmt. of Claim 8, Defs.' SJ Ex. P.) In the Ontario Proceedings, Downey sought \"damages, or in the alternative, rescission of his assignment of the invention[ ] and an accounting of profits by Ecore.\" (Ontario Ct. App. Op. \u00b6 25.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Ecore filed a motion to stay or dismiss the Ontario Proceedings on the ground that under the forum selection clause of the Confidentiality Agreement, the courts of Pennsylvania had exclusive jurisdiction over the action. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 26.) The motion judge denied Ecore's motion, finding that although Downey's claims arose out of and related to his business relations with Ecore, and would otherwise fall within the scope of the Confidentiality Agreement, \"Downey never received consideration for executing the Confidentiality Agreement and is not personally bound by its terms, including the [forum selection clause] contained therein.\" (Ontario Sup. Ct. Op. \u00b6\u00b6 37, 41.) The motion judge rejected Ecore's argument that Downey's consideration for the Confidentiality Agreement was the access to proprietary information and the compensation that he received, through CSR, under the Consulting Agreement, (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 34-37.) According to the motion judge, \"CSR, not Downey, [was] the party to the Consulting Agreement,\" and pursuant to that agreement, the confidential information and compensation was to flow to CSR. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 35.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    On Ecore's appeal, the Ontario Court of Appeal reversed, ruling that the Confidentiality Agreement was supported by valid consideration and was binding upon Downey.\n    <footnotemark>\n     30\n    </footnotemark>\n    (Ontario Ct. App. Op. 36, 59.) Construing the Consulting\n    and Confidentiality Agreements together, and considering the factual circumstances under which they were executed, the Ontario Court of Appeals reasoned:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n    The motion judge erred in finding that Ecore accepted that CSR would receive both the Proprietary Information and the benefits flowing from Downey's relationship with Ecore. The wording of the agreements and the overall factual matrix reveals that the\n    <em>\n     de facto\n    </em>\n    relationship between the parties was between Ecore and Downey. It was Downey, not CSR, who committed to perform the consulting services. And it was Downey who would receive the benefits arising from the relationship with Ecore, whether directly or through the corporate vehicle of CSR.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 47.) The court further noted that the interpretation adopted by the motion judge would render the Confidentiality Agreement meaningless and lead to a commercially absurd result. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 51.)\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n    [O]n the motion judge's findings, neither Downey nor CSR is bound by the Confidentiality Agreement. Downey is not bound because, in the motion judge's view, there was no consideration for the agreement. And CSR is not bound because it is not a party to the agreement. On this interpretation, Ecore is deprived of the very protection of its intellectual property for which it bargained.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 52.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    b.\n    <em>\n     The Re-labeling Case\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    On May 18, 2012, Ecore filed a separate action in this District against Downey, Pliteq, and Dart Advantage Warehousing, Inc.

The Re-labeling Case centered on Ecore's allegations that Pliteq and Downey, using Dart's employees and warehouse, obtained shipments of Ecore's rubber underlayment products, removed the Ecore labels and re-labeled the products as Pliteq's, then re-packaged the products for shipment to Pliteq's customers.

SJ Opp. 28.) In support of their position, Defendants cite to Downey's assertion that his execution of the Assignment constituted acceptance of Dodge's offer (on behalf of Ecore) to reasonably compensate Downey for the invention and Assignment. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 29.) Defendants contend that Dodge repeatedly reaffirmed the alleged agreement, including in writing in his October 1, 2007 email, which stated: \"This confirms our understanding that your agreement to sign the authorization for the reissue of the '723 patent does not negate DRI's responsibility to reasonably compensate you thereunder.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    (Defs.' SJ Ex. I; Downey 1/3/17 Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 17-19.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    According to Defendants, \"Ecore's promise to provide reasonable compensation for the assignment is valid consideration, as evidenced by the fact that both parties manifested their mutual assent to be bound by the terms of the October 2001 Agreement, as well as their understanding of such terms.\" (Defs.' SJ Opp. 29.) Defendants argue that \"Ecore received as consideration clear title to the ISI invention as a result of the parties entering into the October 2001 Agreement.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 30.) Defendants contend that the alleged agreement \"is a valid, enforceable contract\" under Pennsylvania law even though it omits the amount of the compensation. (Defs.' SJ Opp. 28-29.) Defendants also contend that \"it is disputed that the term \"Proprietary Information\" in the Confidentiality Agreement covers the ISI invention\"; that \"the agreement ... on its face does not bind Downey himself, only CSR\"; that the Confidentiality Agreement only applied during Downey's employment; and that \"Downey was never employed by DRI or Ecore because the [Consulting Agreement] was between Ecore and CSR.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Finally, Defendants argue that Downey's claim is timely under several tolling doctrines.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    Ecore argues that Downey cannot establish the existence of the alleged contract \"because there was never an agreement to compensate him for the Assignment above and beyond the funds he received ... under the Consulting Agreement.\" (Pl.'s SJ Opp. 9.) Ecore points to Dodge's testimony that Ecore \"never\" agreed to separately compensate Downey for the ISI invention and assignment, and \"had no duty or obligation to compensate Mr. Downey for something he was legally obligated to do pursuant to his employment agreement.\" (Dodge 8/22/16 Dep. 88.) Ecore disputes Defendants' characterization of Dodge's October 1, 2007 email, which, according to Dodge, referred only to \"[t]he bonus compensation that [Downey] was and had historically been receiving.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 93.) Moreover, Ecore argues, Downey confirmed the absence of any agreement when he referred, in his March 22, 2011 email, to \"the proposal for Ecore compensating me for my patent.\" (Pl.'s SJ Reply Ex. D.) Ecore argues that the alleged oral agreement is, at most, an unenforceable \"agreement to agree\" because it omits essential terms, namely, the amount and timing of Downey's compensation. (Pl.'s SJ Opp. 11.) Ecore further argues that the alleged agreement is unsupported by consideration because Downey was already required to assign the ISI invention and Patents under the Confidentiality Agreement, which the Ontario Proceedings determined is enforceable against Downey. Finally, Ecore contends that Downey's claim is time-barred, and that none of the equitable doctrines cited by Defendants are applicable in this case to toll the four-year statute of limitations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    For the reasons discussed below, we find that the alleged October 2001 \"Agreement\" is not a valid, enforceable contract. We further find that even if the alleged oral contract existed and was enforceable, Downey's claims are barred by the statute of limitations. Accordingly, summary judgment will be granted in favor of Ecore and against Downey with respect to Counterclaim I.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    <em>\n     1.

First, no reasonable fact finder could conclude that the parties manifested the intent to be bound by the alleged agreement. In reaching this conclusion, we accept Downey's assertion that at the time of the Assignment, Dodge told him he would be \"reasonably compensated\" for assigning the ISI invention to Ecore. However, Dodge's October 2001 statement-construed in context with the circumstances and content of the parties' previous and subsequent course of dealings and communications-establishes,\n    <em>\n     at most\n    </em>\n    , that the parties' expected future negotiations for adjustments to Downey's compensation under the Consulting Agreement to consider his contributions to the ISI invention. The parties' October 2001 communications, assuming they occurred as Downey claims, fall far short of what would be necessary for a jury to find the existence of an enforceable contract.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lackner\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8984579\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/892/21/#p30\">\n     892 A.2d at 31-32\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (affirming trial court's grant of summary judgment to defendant where evidence of record was \"woefully inadequate\" to establish that alleged promise of future compensation for patent assignment constituted an enforceable oral agreement). Moreover, the existence of the alleged oral agreement is belied by the rather extensive written - and undisputed - evidence of the parties' communications and course of dealing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    The evidence, which is exhaustively recounted above, reflects that when the parties intended to enter into binding agreements-such as the Consulting and Confidentiality Agreements-they did so in writing. For example, during their November 2006 compensation negotiations, Downey stated: \"I think we have already outlined what is close to an agreement. We actually need to have something written down that makes sense to both of us.\" (Pl.'s SJ Ex. T.) It was also the practice of both parties to even memorialize the terms of their respective offers and counteroffers in writing. In all of the pre-2011 written communications regarding compensation, there is no express reference to the alleged October 2001 \"Agreement,\" and no reference at all to patent-related compensation until 2005. Moreover, once Downey and Dodge began negotiating patent compensation, Downey repeatedly characterized the issue in terms of \"proposals,\" an acknowledgment that no prior agreement existed.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Landan\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201491257\">\n     2015 WL 1491257\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *8 (noting that \"all objective evidence negates the existence of [alleged oral] agreement\");\n    <em>\n     Legendary Art\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4320141\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/888/577/#p585\">\n     888 F.

On this record, no reasonable jury could find that the parties manifested a mutual intent to enter into a binding oral agreement for patent compensation in 2001.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    Second, the terms of the alleged October 2001 \"Agreement\" are too uncertain to constitute an enforceable contract. Specifically, the alleged agreement does not identify what would constitute \"reasonable compensation,\" how the compensation would be calculated, when it would be paid, whether it would be paid to Downey or one of his companies, or whether and to what extent Downey would share in the costs of procuring, enforcing, or defending the patents. Significantly, essential terms such as\n    these were the subject of protracted negotiation when Dodge and Downey later exchanged written proposals for patent compensation. It defies reason to suggest that these parties would have agreed to be bound by an oral agreement that omitted any mention of such material terms. Moreover, the indefiniteness of the purported agreement means that determining whether a breach occurred, or determining an adequate remedy, would require the court to supply terms that the parties never agreed upon.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Sloan\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%204433366\">\n     2013 WL 4433366\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *4 (\"Because [plaintiff] has failed to identify the material terms of the agreement, such as what her alleged 5% interest entitled her to, under what circumstances any profits would be distributed, and how those profits would be determined, there is no way to determine whether Defendants breached the agreement or what action would provide [plaintiff] an adequate remedy.\");\n    <em>\n     Legendary Art\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4320141\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/888/577/#p585\">\n     888 F.

Moreover, as Ecore notes, and Downey's deposition testimony confirms, \"the rubber product used in the invention underlying the patent was developed using (1) Ecore's pre-existing formula (6510-LC), (2) Ecore's manufacturing process, (3) Ecore's product samples and product spec sheets; and (4) the know-how of Ecore's employees to add the ideal amount of regrind to the existing formula.\" (Pl.'s SJ Br. 18.)

As such, Downey was contractually obligated by the Confidentiality Agreement to assign the invention to Ecore, and neither Downey's performance of that pre-existing obligation, nor Ecore's alleged promise to pay additional compensation for the performance, constitute consideration for the alleged October 2001 \"Agreement\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    Downey's arguments that the Confidentiality Agreement does not bind him because he was not a party to the Consulting Agreement and was never employed by Ecore were thoroughly considered and rejected in the Ontario Proceedings. In those proceedings, the Ontario Court of Appeal held,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    :\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n    [W]hen the Consulting Agreement and Confidentiality Agreement are read together, the terms of those agreements reveal the parties' intentions that Ecore's Proprietary Information was to be protected in the hands of the person who was actually to receive that information - Downey.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n    * * *\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n    The wording of the agreements and the overall factual matrix reveals that the\n    <em>\n     de facto\n    </em>\n    relationship between the parties was between Ecore and Downey.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    (Ontario Ct. App. Op. \u00b6\u00b6 46, 47.) The court further found that the Confidentiality Agreement provision stating that it was to apply \"during and after\" Downey's employment with Ecore \"simply confirms that Downey's confidentiality obligations were to survive the termination of his relationship\n    with Ecore. This makes commercial sense given the purpose of the agreed protections for Ecore's Proprietary Information.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 61.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    The issues raised by Downey here: (1) are the same as those involved in the Ontario Proceedings; (2) were actually litigated in those proceedings; (3) were determined by the Ontario Court of Appeal; and (4) were essential to that court's judgment that the Confidentiality Agreement is binding and enforceable as to Downey. Significantly, Downey has not argued otherwise, and he has not challenged the fairness of the Ontario Proceedings or the validity of the Ontario Court of Appeal decision.

Furthermore, Defendants have not expressly attacked the validity of the Confidentiality Agreement, and we have rejected their arguments that it was superseded or is not binding as to Downey. Because Downey's compensation and the parties' rights with respect to the ISI invention are governed by written agreements, Downey cannot maintain his claim for\n    <em>\n     quantum meruit\n    </em>\n    relief.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    Even if Downey's\n    <em>\n     quantum meruit\n    </em>\n    claim were cognizable, it would nevertheless be barred because Downey did not assert it within Pennsylvania's four-year statute of limitations for contracts.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    42 Pa.

Specifically, Defendants allege that Ecore has not paid CSR its incentive bonuses for 2011 or July through December 2010. According to Defendants, the unpaid incentive bonuses total $124,443.52, exclusive of interest. In Count IV, CSR asserts, in the alternative, a\n    <em>\n     quantum meruit\n    </em>\n    /unjust enrichment claim with regard to the unpaid bonuses. Defendants seek summary judgment as to Counterclaim III, and both Defendants and Ecore seek summary judgment as to Counterclaim IV.

Ecore is correct that if Defendants materially breached the parties' agreements, that breach may excuse Ecore's payment obligation and preclude CSR's breach of contract claim.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     LJL Transp., Inc. v.

However, as is discussed below, there is conflicting evidence regarding whether Ecore knew about and approved of Downey's and CSR's activities through Pliteq. Because factual disputes exist regarding Defendants' potential material breach,\n    which, if established, may relieve Ecore of any obligation to pay CSR, summary judgment is not appropriate as to Counterclaim III at this juncture.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-179\">\n    Ecore also argues that material factual disputes exist regarding the amount of bonus compensation, if any, that is owed to CSR. We agree. As evidence of the amounts allegedly owed, Defendants offer: (1) an undated Ecore summary of the monthly incentive bonus calculation from 2003 through June 2011, with a notation stating that the 2011 incentive bonus was not paid; and (2) a compilation of canceled checks paid by Ecore to Downey between February 2005 and July 2010, with no notations identifying the bonus periods to which the checks correspond. (Defs.' SJ Exs. X, Y.) Based on Defendants' interpretation of these documents, the amounts allegedly owed are \"undisputed\" and admitted by Ecore. (Defs.' SJ Br. 33-34; Defs.' SJ Reply 20-21.) Ecore, however, argues that the same documents \"reflect that Downey and CSR were\n    <em>\n     overpaid\n    </em>\n    ... in 2010.\" (Ecore SJ Opp. 26.) With only these two exhibits and the parties' conflicting interpretations of them, we cannot tell what, if any, bonus amount remains unpaid, and we will not scour the record further to find evidence that might answer that question.\n    <em>\n     Doeblers' Pa.

For example, the evidence as to Sound Isolation Store indicates only that Dodge apparently left a voicemail for someone at that company in which he said that Ecore had filed a lawsuit against Pliteq \"for a number of things including interfering with our business, stealing our patents, and just doing a bunch of bad things.\" (Defs.' SJ Exs. 16, 18, 19;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Downey 8/30/16 Dep. 110.) The message then stated: \"We're sure you're not aware of that, we just want to have a conversation with you about it, try to get this thing resolved in an amicable way....\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) As to Century Tile, Defendants rely upon an email, apparently from someone at Century Tile to John Freidkes, stating: \"We have a letter indicating a pending law suit between your company and the QT4005 people. At this time your material is not being considered. Once you get in give a call and we can discuss. Sorry to [bear] the bad news.\" (Defs.' SJ Ex. 35.) As to DalTile and Marjam, the evidence cited by Defendants is even more sparse and consists only of (1) Downey's hearsay statement that \"DalTile stopped buying from Pliteq\" and \"wanted an indemnity against a lawsuit\" after Dodge \"call[ed] DalTile and threaten[ed] litigation,\" (Downey 8/30/16 Dep. 112-113); (2) a vague and unexplained email from Marjam's product manager to Downey and Friedkes, (Defs.' SJ Ex. 37); and (3) Downey's unsubstantiated assertion that Ecore's interference with respect to Marjam is one of the causes of Marjam's lawsuit against Pliteq. (Downey 8/30/16 Dep. 165-66.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-219\">\n    Even drawing all inferences in Pliteq's favor, there is no genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether Ecore lacked privilege or justification for its alleged actions. Defendants have identified no evidence that Ecore employed the \"predatory\" means outlined in the Restatement. On the contrary, the record reveals, at most, that Ecore responded to what it perceived as improper conduct by Pliteq, informed customers of the parties' legal dispute, and tried to persuade customers to do business with Ecore rather than Pliteq. These are\n    permissible competitive actions under the circumstances here, where Ecore and Pliteq \"were competitors and the [actions] directly concerned relations involved in the competing business and not some affair unrelated to their competition.\"\n    <em>\n     Synthes\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202616824\">\n     2014 WL 2616824\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *23 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Audi of Am.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526318\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/321/503/#p518\">\n     321 F.Supp.3d at 519\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"[A]n actor is privileged to interfere with another's performance of a contract when: (1) the actor has a legally protected interest; (2) he acts or threatens to act to protect the interest; and (3) the threat is to protect it by proper means.\" (citation and quotation omitted) ). Because no reasonable factfinder could conclude that Ecore tortiously interfered with Pliteq's business, summary judgment will be granted in favor of Ecore as to Counterclaims VII and VIII.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-220\">\n    <strong>\n     G. Ownership Issue Of Pliteq's False Marketing Claim (Countercl.

Ecore seeks summary judgment that it is the owner of the patent that ultimately issued for the QTrbm product-the '430 Patent. Ecore asserts that because it filed the original application for the NVMM invention/QTrbm product, it is the owner of the patents that ultimately issued. Ecore further argues that \"because this invention 'relates to' Ecore's Proprietary Information,\" it is Ecore's exclusive property. (Pl.'s SJ Br. 33.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-222\">\n    Ecore has cited to no authority for its conclusory assertion that the initial filer of a patent application is, under all circumstances, the owner of whatever patent ultimately issues from that application, even if the initial filer may have abandoned its application. Moreover, as noted in the Factual Background above, material factual disputes exist regarding whether Ecore abandoned the applications that ultimately led to the NVMM invention patents. Finally, Ecore has identified no evidence from which a fact finder could conclude that the NVMM invention relates to Ecore's Proprietary Information. The record reflects only that Downey developed the NVMM invention while working at Ecore. Plaintiff has not identified any evidence that Downey's development of this invention relied upon Ecore's \"technology, know-how, plans, designs, specifications, formulas, drawings, [or] other information related to [Ecore's] products, production equipment, [or] manufacturing processes.\" (Confidentiality Agmt. \u00a7 1(a).)

Ecore's Breach of Contract Claim (Count IV)\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-224\">\n    Ecore asserts that it is entitled to summary judgment on its breach of contract claim against Downey, because (1) Downey disclosed Ecore's proprietary information to Pliteq; and (2) Downey impermissibly retained Ecore's Proprietary Information once the Confidentiality Agreement was terminated. We address each alleged breach in turn.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-225\">\n    <em>\n     1. Disclosure of Proprietary Information to Pliteq\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-226\">\n    Regarding the disclosure of Ecore's proprietary information to Pliteq, Defendants' primary argument is that Dodge knew of and approved the disclosure as part of its agreement allowing Pliteq to market and sell a private label version of Ecore's QT product. Defendants rely on Dodge's response to the email chain Downey forwarded to him on September\n    28, 2010, and on Downey's and John Freidkes' testimony regarding Dodge's alleged approval of Pliteq's private label activities. Ecore counters this evidence with Dodge's testimony that he never read the relevant part of the forwarded emails, and that he first learned of Pliteq's existence in July 2011. Ecore also cites to other email communications indicating that Ecore did not learn of Downey's and Pliteq's private label activities until 2011, at which point it immediately terminated its relationship with Downey and CSR.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-227\">\n    Defendants do not dispute that Downey and CSR disclosed Ecore's Proprietary Information to Pliteq. However, the conflicting evidence recounted in detail in the Factual Background reflects a material factual dispute as to whether Ecore gave its approval for Downey's and CSR's actions with respect to Pliteq. In the Re-labeling Case, the court denied Ecore's motion for summary judgment after considering essentially the same evidence and arguments that are before us here. In so ruling, the court concluded: \"Given the highly factual nature of the parties' contentions regarding what the [September 2010] email [chain] meant, whether Dodge even read it, and whether the parties' conduct corroborates the existence of the agreement, the alleged agreement to engage in relabeling is properly a matter for the jury to assess.\"\n    <em>\n     Ecore Int'l, Inc. v.

Downey's argument\n    that he was avoiding spoliation by retaining Ecore's Proprietary Information in anticipation of litigation is insufficient to justify his breach of the Confidentiality Agreement. The express terms of that agreement required the return of Proprietary Information; Downey did not have the obligation or the option to destroy such information. Therefore, compliance with the agreement did not implicate a spoliation concern.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-231\">\n    Because Downey breached the Confidentiality Agreement in this respect, summary judgment will be granted in part to Ecore as to Downey's liability for retaining Ecore's Proprietary Information.

The Agreement provided for the dismissal with prejudice of \"all Claims asserted in the Action, including the Remaining Claims,\" (July 2, 2015 Agmt. 2.) The\n    corresponding Joint Stipulation of Dismissal With Prejudice finally disposed of \"all claims and causes of action arising in the above-styled action.\" (Re-labeling Case, ECF No. 82.) \"A judgment entered with prejudice pursuant to a settlement is a final judgment on the merits for the purposes of res judicata.\"\n    <em>\n     Guiles v.

The fact that Ecore sued Downey and CSR in this case, rather than Downey and Pliteq, is immaterial because CSR is clearly in privity with Downey. Third, Ecore's Lanham Act allegations relating to the 2008 and 2009 test reports could have been brought in the Re-labeling Case. Specifically, the allegations at issue here and the claims asserted in the Re-labeling Case both relate to Pilteq's and Downey's actions in changing product information to make it appear that Ecore's products were Pliteq's. Ecore was aware of the facts relating to the altered test reports at the time it settled and stipulated to the dismissal of the Re-labeling Case, yet Ecore did not allege those facts until July 14, 2015, in its Amended Complaint in this action. Finally, and contrary to Ecore's argument, our\n    <em>\n     res judicata\n    </em>\n    analysis is not affected by the Re-labeling Case settlement carve-out for \"claims and counterclaims pending\" in Case No. 11-6843. (July 2, 2015 Agmt. \u00b6 3.) Ecore's allegations regarding test report alterations were first asserted in this case on July 14, 2015 and, thus, were not pending in this case at the time the Re-labeling Case was settled effective July 2, 2015, and dismissed with prejudice on July 7, 2015.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-237\">\n    Summary judgment will be granted in favor of Defendants as to the portions of Count I that are based on the alleged alteration of product test reports.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-238\">\n    <strong>\n     J. Ecore's Conversion Claim (Case No. 16-1993, Count I)\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-239\">\n    Ecore's Complaint in Case No. 16-1993 asserts a claim against Downey for conversion of the intellectual property underlying the '029 Patent. Ecore alleges that it is the rightful owner of the intellectual property underlying the '029 Patent, and that Downey wrongfully sought and obtained the '029 Patent without legal justification and without Ecore's consent. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27-28, 30-34.) Ecore further alleges that it had no knowledge of the '029 Patent until Defendants filed their Answer and Counterclaims to the Amended Complaint in Case No. 11-6843. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 24-26, 35.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-240\">\n    Defendants seek summary judgment as to Ecore's conversion claim on two grounds. Defendants argue that the claim is barred by waiver/estoppel because Ecore allegedly abandoned the previous applications for the NVMM invention. Defendants also contend that Ecore's claim is barred by the two-year statute of limitations. According to Defendants, Ecore knew of the '029 Patent by late 2013 or early 2014, \"when Ecore's counsel was monitoring Pliteq's website and product brochures, both of which highlighted the '029 Patent.\" (Defs.' SJ Br. 39.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-241\">\n    Once again, material factual disputes exist regarding whether Ecore abandoned the applications that ultimately led to the '029 and '430 Patents for the NVMM invention. Factual disputes also preclude summary judgment regarding the statute of limitations. Defendants' argument on that issue is based on an email from Ecore's counsel reflecting that she had reviewed certain marketing materials on Pliteq's website related to its FF product, and on a printout from the \"news\" section of Pliteq's website that includes,\n    among approximately 50 entries, an announcement of the '029 Patent's issuance. Defendants made the same argument, citing the same evidence, in their Motion to Dismiss Ecore's claims in Case No. 16-1993. In denying that Motion, we noted that \"Defendants' exhibits show, at most, that disputed issues of fact exist regarding when Ecore knew or should have known of the '029 Patent.\" (ECF No. 132 (citing\n    <em>\n     Farm Credit Leasing Servs. Corp. v.
