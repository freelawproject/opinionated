And it is undisputed that the video of Cloud Gate was taken in Illinois. Thus, the NRA's contacts with Illinois directly relate to or arise out of its alleged filming of Cloud Gate, which necessarily occurred in Illinois and allegedly injured Kapoor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    John Crane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517129\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/891/692/#p695\">\n    891 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   695-96 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moncrief Oil Int'l Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3870406\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/481/309/#p314\">\n    481 F.3d at 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"tortious conduct amounts to sufficient minimum contacts with the state by the defendant to constitutionally permit courts within that state\" to exercise personal jurisdiction) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    Ploense v.

App. Ct. 2007) (explaining that \"commission of a tortious act within\" the state is grounds for personal jurisdiction).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   But wait, the NRA responds. The video of the Cloud Gate was taken by a third-party photographer who worked for an advertising agency retained by the NRA, not by the NRA itself. Kapoor insists that the photographer was an \"agent\" of the NRA purposes of the jurisdictional analysis; the NRA disagrees. Whether the photographer in fact was the NRA's agent is a question of fact that the Court cannot resolve on the current record,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spitz v. Proven Winners N. Am., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4155283\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/759/724/#p732\">\n    759 F.3d 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 732 (7th Cir. 2014), and would ordinarily warrant jurisdictional discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Testosterone Replacement Therapy Prods. Liability Litig. Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180743\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/136/968/#p973\">\n    136 F.Supp.3d 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 973 (N.D. Ill. 2015). But because the Court concludes-for the reasons discussed below-that this case should proceed in a different forum, it declines to order such discovery here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The NRA believes that this case should be transferred to the Eastern District of Virginia, where it does not dispute jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support, the NRA points out that it and its employees are located there, that decisions pertaining to the video were made there, and that evidence pertaining to the video is located there. Additionally, it argues that this district has \"no connection to the underlying claim\" because the video was distributed nationwide, that Kapoor lives in London\n   and thus has no convenient connection to either district, and that the Eastern District of Virginia has a reputation for resolving cases quickly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On balance, the Court agrees that the Eastern District of Virginia is a more convenient forum in which to litigate this case. Kapoor does note that he has chosen to litigate in Illinois, and a plaintiff's choice \"should rarely be disturbed.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8939594\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/420/702/#p704\">\n    420 F.3d 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 704 (7th Cir. 2005). \"Rarely, however, is not never.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Nat'l Presto Indus.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9049801\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/347/662/#p664\">\n    347 F.3d 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 664 (7th Cir. 2003) (collecting cases). Here, the Court concludes that, although at least one possible tort (that is, filming Cloud Gate without permission) occurred in Illinois, nearly all of the evidence related to that tort will come from witnesses who do not reside in Illinois. And Kapoor, a London resident, has no connection to Illinois other than the existence of his sculpture here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   What is more, the other convenience factors under \u00a7 1404(a) weigh heavily in favor of the NRA. For instance, the NRA is headquartered in Fairfax, Virginia, so that location is far more convenient for it than Illinois. Similarly, many of the likely witnesses in this case work at the NRA's headquarters or nearby. And although it is true that the convenience of witnesses employed by a party is entitled to little weight, it is still a relevant factor.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hyatt Corp. v. Pers. Commc'ns Indus. Ass'n\n   </em>\n   , No.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=04%20Cow.%204656\">\n    04 C 4656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%202931288\">\n    2004 WL 2931288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 15, 2004) (considering the location of employee-witnesses when analyzing the convenience of the parties). This is particularly the case here, where the convenience of non-party witnesses is a non-factor because they all are located outside of Illinois and Virginia. Finally, documents pertaining to this case are located at the NRA's headquarters, which tilts slightly in favor of Virginia, although in this age of electronic discovery, documentary evidence is easily transferable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The interests of justice-the second element of the \u00a7 1404 inquiry-also weigh in the NRA's favor. The NRA has presented evidence that the Eastern District of Virginia typically resolves cases faster than this district.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Ex. D, U.S. Dist. Ct. Judicial Caseload Profile, ECF No. 26-4. Moreover, it correctly contends that Virginia has an interest in a dispute concerning the rights of its citizens to free speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   According to Kapoor, Illinois too has an interest in the Cloud Gate sculpture, because it is a public work of art. And certainly the residents of this district are justifiably proud of the Bean. What is more, the Bean is a very popular tourist attraction. However, whether such general public interests have any relationship to the issues raised in this lawsuit-Kapoor's copyright versus the NRA's First Amendment right to advocate its view of the Second Amendment-is less clear. And Kapoor has not provided any authority to support such a contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Other justice-related factors-such as each court's relative familiarity with the relevant law, and the respective desirability of resolving controversies in each locale-are neutral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In sum, the only factors under \u00a7 1404(a) weighing in the Plaintiff's favor are his choice of Illinois as a forum and the presence of the Cloud Gate sculpture here. Weighing in the NRA's favor are the convenience to it as a party and to its employees as witnesses, the ease of access to sources of proof, the likelihood of a faster resolution in the Eastern District of Virginia, and Virginia's interest in the controversy. On balance, the Court finds that the factors weigh in favor of transfer to the\n   Eastern District of Virginia, so the NRA's request to transfer this case is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, Plaintiff's motion [35] for jurisdictional discovery is denied. Defendant's motion [25] is granted in part and denied in part. This case is transferred to the Eastern District of Virginia forthwith and terminated on this Court's docket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    The NRA characterizes its request as arising under the common-law doctrine of\n    <em>\n     forum non conveniens.
