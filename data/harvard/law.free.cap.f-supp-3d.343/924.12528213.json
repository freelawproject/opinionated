Nunley, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the Court pursuant to Defendant County of Sacramento, (\"County\") Defendant Scott Jones, in his official capacity as Sacramento County Sheriff, (\"Sheriff\") and Defendant Kamala Harris's, in her official capacity as the California Attorney General, (\"AG\") (collectively \"Defendants\") Motions to Dismiss. (ECF No. 35; ECF No. 36.) Plaintiff Gary Wayne Welchen, et al. (\"Plaintiff\") filed oppositions to Defendants' motions. (ECF No. 37; ECF No. 38.) Defendants filed replies. (ECF No. 39; ECF No. 40.) The Court has carefully considered the parties' arguments. For the reasons set forth below, Defendants' Motions to Dismiss are GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff, a 50-year-old indigent and homeless resident of Sacramento, was arrested by Sacramento police on January\n   29, 2016, for suspicion of second-degree burglary of an uninhabited dwelling. (Pl.'s First Am. Compl. (\"FAC\"), ECF No. 31, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28, 30.) Plaintiff alleges that after he was taken to jail, he was informed he would be kept in jail unless he paid $10,000 for bail. (ECF No. 31, \u00b6 29.) Plaintiff alleges that because he could not afford to pay $10,000, he was detained for six days before he was released by the Sheriff's Department. (ECF No. 31, \u00b6 33.) That same day, Plaintiff filed this class action against the County and AG alleging that enforcement of California Penal Code section 1269b (\"Bail Law\") and the County's bail schedule adopted pursuant to that law (\"Bail Schedule\") violate his Constitutional rights under the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 65-68.) Plaintiff later named the Sheriff as an additional defendant in the FAC for the same claims. (ECF No. 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff alleges the County and Sheriff's \"policy of implementing the money bail system [pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201269\">\n    Cal. Pen. Code \u00a7 1269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ] ... amounts to unconstitutional wealth-based detention.\" (ECF No. 31, \u00b6 16.) Plaintiff alleges that at the end of the booking process, arrestees are given a booking sheet, which includes their booking charge and their bail amount. (ECF No. 31, \u00b6 37.) Plaintiff further alleges bail is determined by referring to the Felony and Misdemeanor Bail Schedule as established by the Superior Court of California, County of Sacramento. (ECF No. 31, \u00b6 37.) Plaintiff states deputy sheriffs use this bail schedule, referring to an arrestee's booking charge(s), when determining an arrestee's bail amount. (ECF No. 31, \u00b6 37.) Plaintiff alleges arrestees are told that if they pay their bail amount, they will be released immediately. (ECF No. 31, \u00b6 38.) Plaintiff alleges arrestees are then told that if they cannot pay bail, they will remain in jail until arraignment or discharge. (ECF No. 31, \u00b6 38.) Plaintiff states that arrestees who are not able to pay their money bail amount are shown a poster listing the phone numbers of bail bond agents and told that they may call one of these numbers to attempt to secure their release. (ECF No. 31, \u00b6 39.) Plaintiff alleges arrestees who obtain release through bail bond agents remain in jail while arranging cosigners and finalizing the bail bond contract. (ECF No. 31, \u00b6 39.) According to Plaintiff, this process can take hours or days. (ECF No. 31, \u00b6 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that if an arrestee can afford to pay her bail amount, the Sheriff's Department accepts the bail payment and orders the release of the arrestee. (ECF No. 31, \u00b6 40.) Plaintiff further states that if an arrestee cannot afford to pay her bail amount, the Sheriff's Department keeps her in jail until either she can make other arrangements to obtain her release, she is discharged, or she is taken to court two to five days later for arraignment. (ECF No. 31, \u00b6 41.) Consequently, Plaintiff alleges that \"[a]rrestees are given a right to release pending trial, but Defendants' pay-for-freedom system conditions their release on their ability to afford money bail, thus tying their pretrial freedom to their wealth-status.\" (ECF No. 31, \u00b6 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff alleges the Bail Law violates substantive due process because the system is not narrowly tailored to public safety or ensuring court appearances. (ECF No. 31, \u00b6 74.) Plaintiff further alleges that non-wealth-based alternatives to the money bail system exist and could be implemented. (ECF No. 31, \u00b6 75.) Moreover, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants' wealth-based detention system is excessive in relation to its purpose to ensure court appearances considering successful non-money-based systems that do not infringe on the fundamental right to pretrial liberty, such as phone and text message reminders of court dates, rides to court\n   for those without transportation or a stable address, counseling, SCRAM bracelets (for alcohol testing), and electronic monitoring services. (ECF No. 31, \u00b6\u00b6 76-77, 80.) According to Plaintiff, subjecting the poor to unnecessary pretrial detention causes instability in employment, housing, and care dependent relatives. (ECF No. 31, \u00b6 84.) Plaintiff further alleges that unnecessary pretrial detention also leads to worse outcomes at trial when compared with those released pretrial. (ECF No. 31, \u00b6 84.) Plaintiff states that unnecessary pretrial detention causes difficulties in preparing a defense, gathering evidence and witnesses, and meeting with their lawyers. (ECF No. 31, \u00b6 84.) Plaintiff also alleges that the Bail Law does not provide individualized assessments of risk level. (ECF No. 31, \u00b6 78.) For these reasons, Plaintiff alleges Defendants' policy and practice of enforcing the money-based bail system is excessive in relation to the Bail Law's regulatory purpose. (ECF No. 31, \u00b6 111.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff brings suit under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" \u00a7 1983\"). (ECF No. 31, \u00b6 7.) Plaintiff alleges the County violates Plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment rights by its policy and practice of implementing the Bail Law's wealth-based detention system. (ECF No. 31, \u00b6 112.) Plaintiff alleges the Sheriff, in his official capacity, violates Plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment rights by implementing the Bail Schedule through his oversight of the county jail, by implementing the state's bail laws, and by enforcing provisions of California state law regarding the use of money bail. (ECF No. 31, \u00b6 113.) Finally, Plaintiff alleges the AG, in her official capacity, violates Plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment rights by requiring the County and Sheriff to adopt and implement a bail schedule that results in detaining them solely because they cannot afford to pay money bail. (ECF No. 31, \u00b6 114.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff requests declaratory judgment that: (1) Defendants violated and continue to violate Plaintiff's and proposed class members' rights under the Fourteenth Amendment; (2) Defendants must follow the requirements of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses, regardless of contrary state law or contrary policies and practices; (3) California Penal Code section 1269b(b) and any other state statutory or constitutional provisions that require the use of secured money bail to detain any person without an inquiry into ability to pay are facially unconstitutional; and (4) as applied by Defendants against Plaintiff and class members, California Penal Code section 1269b(b) and any other state statutory or constitutional provisions that require the use of secured money bail to detain any person without an inquiry into ability to pay are unconstitutional. (ECF No. 31 at 21-22.) Plaintiff also seeks preliminary and permanent injunctive relief enjoining Defendants and all involved employees of the County from enforcing the bail policy and practices against all proposed class members and request money damages and attorneys' fees and costs. (ECF No. 31 at 21-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Complaint was filed on January 29, 2016, with accompanying motions for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and class certification. (ECF Nos. 1, 2, &amp; 3.) On February 4, 2016, this Court denied Plaintiff's ex parte motion for a temporary restraining order. (ECF No. 12.) On February 18, 2016, the AG filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. (ECF No. 14.) The County joined in the AG's motion to dismiss, but also in the alternative moved the Court for a more definite statement of the law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(e). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joinder in Mot. to Dismiss and Not. of Mot. in the Alt. for More Def. Statement,\n   ECF No. 17.) The Court granted Defendants' motion to dismiss as to Plaintiff's Equal Protection claim without leave to amend and granted the motion for a more definite statement as to Plaintiff's Due Process claim. (ECF No. 30.) The Court denied the pending motion for class certification as moot. (ECF No. 30 at 19-20.) Plaintiff filed the FAC on November 9, 2016. (ECF No. 31.) The AG filed a motion to dismiss the FAC on December 13, 2016. (ECF No. 36). That same day, the Sheriff and the County (collectively \"County Defendants\") also jointly filed a separate motion to dismiss. (Mot. Dismiss, ECF No. 35; Mem. Points Auth. for Mot. Dismiss, ECF No. 35-1.) The Court will rule on both motions to dismiss in this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III. STATUTORY BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Under the challenged Bail Law, Cal. Penal Code section 1269b, a person arrested for a crime may be released on bail while awaiting trial or some alternative resolution of the charges. Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 1269b(a). The bail amount is determined by a judge if the arrestee appears before a judge; if not, then the bail amount is determined by \"the uniform countywide schedule of bail\" (i.e. the Bail Schedule). Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 1269b(b). This Bail Schedule is \"prepare[d], adopt[ed], and annually revise[d]\" by the county's superior court judges who consider the \"seriousness of the offense charged.\" Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 1269b(c) &amp; (e). The Bail Law also allows detained individuals to petition for release on their own recognizance or for a lower bail. Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 1269c. While individuals charged with serious felonies may seek lower bail than the Bail Schedule, those charged with misdemeanors are presumptively entitled to release unless the court foresees a public safety or court appearance issue.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201270\">\n    Cal.

Even if we assume that a problem exists, Proposition 100 employs a profoundly overbroad irrebuttable presumption, rather than an individualized evaluation, to determine whether an arrestee is an unmanageable flight risk. As discussed, this mechanism necessarily results in the deprivation of liberty even where not necessary to ensure appearance at trial, because undocumented immigrants who do not pose a flight risk or who pose a manageable one are categorically denied bail based solely on their status. Given this\n   <em>\n    severe\n   </em>\n   lack of fit between the asserted nonpunitive purpose and the actual operation of the law, we conclude that Proposition 100's bail provisions are punitive rather than regulatory.

(ECF No. 31, \u00b6\u00b6 38-41.) According to Plaintiff, \"wealthy arrestees can purchase their immediate release, while poorer arrestees must remain in jail.\" (ECF No. 31, \u00b6 105.) Plaintiff further alleges there is \"no evidence that ability to pay correlates closely with unmanageable flight risk or public safety ... a person's wealth is not determinative of her likelihood of appearing for trial or threatening public safety.\" (ECF No. 31, \u00b6 69.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The AG's argument that the Bail Law is not a categorical bar to pretrial release because it \"allows any individual ... to obtain bail,\" (ECF No. 36 at 7), ignores the thrust of Plaintiff's claim, which is that the Bail Law effectively imposes a categorial bar to pretrial release of poor arrestees, not because bail does not exist, but because the poor cannot afford it. (ECF No. 31, \u00b6 111.) In the instant case, as in\n   <em>\n    Arpaio\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff alleges the Bail Law \"categorically eliminates the opportunity for people who are poor to achieve pretrial freedom, even if they are not a danger or flight risk,\" and it does so without any \"individualized assessment of risk level\" of the arrestee.

Based on Plaintiff's allegations that the Bail Law categorically prevents poor individuals from pretrial release, the Court finds Plaintiff pleaded sufficient facts that the Bail Law is facially invalid to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Therefore, the AG's motions to dismiss on the basis that the Bail Law is not facially invalid is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    ii. Excessive in Relation to its Purpose\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The AG and Sheriff both argue that Plaintiff has not sufficiently pleaded that the Bail Law has a punitive purpose or is excessive to its legitimate purposes of ensuring public safety and court appearances. (ECF No. 35-1 at 13-14; ECF No. 36 at 8.) Plaintiff does not claim the Bail Law has an expressly punitive purpose. Rather, Plaintiff responds that the bail provisions are excessive in relation to any legitimate purpose. (ECF No. 38 at 2, 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the Bail Law \"has no connection to public safety\" because\n   \"[t]hose wealthy enough to pay their bail amount have their full amount returned to them if they appear for all their court dates, regardless of whether they commit additional crimes.\" (ECF No. 31, \u00b6 70.) Plaintiff further alleges that the Bail Law is excessive in relation to its sole remaining legitimate purpose, ensuring court appearances.

In the instant case, Plaintiff alleges that the Bail Law, like Proposition 100 \"restricts pretrial liberty in relation to any regulatory purpose,\" and fails \"to provide for individualized assessments of risk levels ....\" (ECF No. 31, \u00b6\u00b6 76, 78.) To bolster his accusation that the Bail Law is excessive, Plaintiff alleges that successful non-money-based alternatives exist to ensure court appearances, such as phone and text message reminders of court dates, rides to court for those without transportation or a stable address, and electronic monitoring services. (ECF No. 31, \u00b6\u00b6 76-77, 80.) Plaintiff also alleges that unnecessary pretrial detention causes arrestees to suffer instability in employment, housing, and care for dependent relatives. (ECF No. 31, \u00b6 84.) Moreover, Plaintiff alleges that pretrial detention also leads to worse outcomes at trial and delays in preparing a defense.
