Dkt. 112. Having considered the parties' briefing, the applicable legal authorities, oral argument, and the summary judgment record, the Court RECOMMENDS that BASF Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. 77) be GRANTED; Plaintiff's Second Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. 71) be DENIED; and BASF's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (Dkt. 31) be DENIED AS MOOT. The Court's reasoning is explained in detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Kitchen began working for BASF, a producer and marketer of chemicals and related products, in 2006 at a chemical plant in Seaford, Delaware. In the fall of 2010, Kitchen was involved in a drunk driving accident in which he injured two people while driving with an alcohol level of approximately 0.13. Instead of immediately terminating Kitchen's employment, BASF permitted him to take a 30-day leave of absence to undergo inpatient alcohol abuse treatment. Kitchen rejoined BASF after completing the treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When BASF closed the Seaford, Delaware plant in 2013, BASF offered Kitchen the opportunity to transfer to its Freeport, Texas facility. Around October 2013, before Kitchen relocated to Texas, BASF allowed Kitchen to take another leave of absence for alcohol abuse treatment. After participating in this two-month treatment program, Kitchen moved halfway across the country and, in February 2014, started his new position at BASF's Freeport, Texas location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In April 2014, a co-worker reported to management that Kitchen's breath smelled like alcohol. Kitchen admitted that it was certainly plausible since he probably had four drinks that day\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     after\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   he arrived at the plant for work. Instead of terminating him this time around, BASF told Kitchen they wanted to get him help, and arranged for him to take approximately five months off work to seek outpatient treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Unfortunately, the alcohol treatment did not resolve Kitchen's problems with alcohol. In May 2014, police pulled Kitchen over for driving erratically, and charged him with driving under the influence after a breathalyzer test indicated that he was driving with an alcohol level of 0.15. Kitchen pled guilty and spent 19 days in jail. While incarcerated, Kitchen wrote BASF a letter requesting that he be allowed to keep his job: \"Whatever your decision is just know I appr[e]ciate the opportunity you gave me, the kindness and support you have shown and making me feel at home with BASF.\" Dkt. 77-3 at 32. Somewhat incredibly, BASF did not terminate Kitchen. Instead, the company again accommodated him, requiring him to complete an Employee Assistance Program at an outpatient facility. Kitchen returned to work at BASF in October 2014. As a condition of his return to work, Kitchen agreed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 He would remain sober at work;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 He would continue treatment for alcohol abuse;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 He would undergo follow-up testing at work; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 He would conduct himself professionally and appropriately.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Before Kitchen rejoined BASF, the company issued a Final Warning and Return to Work, notifying Kitchen that any subsequent violations of the above conditions would result in immediate termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On September 28, 2015, Kitchen was scheduled for an alcohol test. He arrived for work at 7:30 a.m. that day, two hours late. The test was not administered until 10:40 a.m., and the results showed an alcohol level of 0.014. A second test was administered approximately 15 minutes later, showing an alcohol level of 0.010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Kitchen's supervisor, Mark Damron (\"Damron\"), reviewed these results and conferred with BASF's in-house physician regarding the rate alcohol is metabolized in the body over time. Based on the company doctor's calculations, Damron's understanding was that, assuming Kitchen had not been drinking at work and that alcohol levels in his body had decreased normally over time, Kitchen must have been under the influence of alcohol when he arrived at work at 7:30 a.m. Because Damron believed Kitchen had turned up at\n   work under the influence of alcohol in violation of company policy and his Return to Work Agreement and Final Warning, Kitchen's employment was terminated effective October 2, 2015. At the time of his termination, Kitchen was over the age of 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Kitchen contends that the alcohol testing process conducted by BASF was replete with problems in the administration of the test and interpretation of the test results. These alleged problems included a lack of proper certification by the individual who administered the alcohol test, the use of a defective machine, false test results, and a failure to properly calibrate the testing machine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a). A genuine dispute of material fact does not exist unless \"the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Burell v. Prudential Ins.

If the burden of production at trial \"ultimately rests on the nonmovant, the movant must merely demonstrate an absence of evidentiary support in the record for the nonmovant's case.\"\n   <em>\n    Lyles v.

Once a party \"meets the initial burden of demonstrating that there exists no genuine issue of material fact for trial, the burden shifts to the non-movant to produce evidence of the existence of such an issue for trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Brandon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4366687\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/808/266/#p269\">\n    808 F.3d at 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The party opposing summary judgment \"must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts. [It] must go beyond the pleadings and come forward with specific facts indicating a genuine issue for trial to avoid summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4366687\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/808/266/#p269\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations and quotation marks omitted). \"In deciding whether a fact issue exists, courts must view the facts and draw reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Rayborn v.

In a nutshell, Kitchen asserts that he can establish a prima facie case of ADA discrimination, and BASF cannot rebut the presumption because the company's proffered reason for terminating his employment is a mere pretext, with the real reason for his termination having been based on impermissible animus. Meanwhile, BASF has filed its own Motion for Summary Judgment, arguing that Kitchen\n   cannot establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA and cannot show that BASF's legitimate reason for his termination is a mere pretext for a discriminatory animus against disabled persons. BASF also argues that Kitchen's age discrimination claim under the ADEA and his Section 1981 claim fail as matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff's Opposition/Response to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Summary Judgment Response\") contains 24-pages of argument but has no summary judgment evidence attached.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is a problem for Kitchen because it is well-established in the Fifth Circuit that unsworn pleadings do not constitute summary judgment evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. City of Houston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530564\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/14/1056/#p1060\">\n    14 F.3d 1056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1060 (5th Cir. 1994) (\"Unsworn pleadings, memoranda or the like are not, of course, competent summary judgment evidence.\") (citation omitted). Although Kitchen failed to introduce competent summary judgment evidence in response to BASF's Motion for Summary Judgment, this Court is not permitted to automatically enter a summary judgment against him. As the movant, BASF must still show there is no genuine issue of material fact and that it is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hetzel v. Bethlehem Steel Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413015\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/50/360/\">\n    50 F.3d 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 362 n.3 (5th Cir. 1995). If BASF fails to meet its initial burden, the Court must deny the motion for summary judgment even if the nonmovant fails present any evidence or file a response.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eversley v. Mbank Dallas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10542781\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/843/172/#p174\">\n    843 F.2d 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 174 (5th Cir. 1988).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   For convenience sake, the Court will address both parties' summary judgment motions at the same time. To be clear, although Kitchen failed to timely submit summary judgment evidence in conjunction with his response to BASF's Motion for Summary Judgment, he did submit evidence in conjunction with his own Second Motion for Summary Judgment. The Court considers this evidence for the purpose of assessing both pending motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

By way of example, Kitchen's live pleading alleges that he was sober for approximately two years prior to his termination.

Indeed, the uncontroverted evidence is that Kitchen had no issues in performing the major life activity of working for a living; he readily acknowledges that he worked for BASF for nine years prior to his termination.

As a legal matter, Kitchen's subjective belief that age played a role in his termination is insufficient to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADEA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vasquez v. Nueces Cnty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4227288\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/551/91/#p93\">\n    551 F.

Kitchen provides zero evidence that he was treated differently than any other BASF employees under similar circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Although Kitchen dismisses the fact that Damron, the individual who fired him, is also in his 50s and thus a member of the same protected class as Kitchen, the law is clear: \"When decision makers are in the same protected class as the plaintiff, there is a presumption that unlawful discrimination is not a factor in the discharge.\"\n   <em>\n    Agoh v.

Summary judgment is appropriate in favor of BASF on the ADEA cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Section 1981\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Kitchen's Original Complaint also cites Section 1981, which \"provides a cause of action for public or private discrimination based on race or alienage.\"\n   <em>\n    Jett v.

Jan. 5, 2015) (\" Section 1981 refers to discrimination in the making and enforcement of contracts and is designed to include a federal remedy against discrimination in employment on the basis of race or alienage.\") (citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted). Since Kitchen does not even identify his race or alienage, BASF argues Kitchen's Section 1981 claim must fail as matter of law. In response, Kitchen notes that the reference to Section 1981 in the Original Complaint was a typographical error, and acknowledges that he has no Section 1981 claim. Out of an abundance of caution, the Court recommends BASF's motion for summary judgment on the Section 1981 claim be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Court RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. 77) be GRANTED, Plaintiff's Second Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. 71) be DENIED, and BASF's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (Dkt. 31) be DENIED AS MOOT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Clerk shall provide copies of this Memorandum and Recommendation to the respective parties who have fourteen days from the receipt thereof to file written objections pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b) and General Order 2002-13. Failure to file written objections within the time period mentioned shall bar an aggrieved party from attacking the factual findings and legal conclusions on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    In his first Motion for Summary Judgment, Kitchen also sought summary judgment on his ADA claim. Kitchen contended that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n    [He] was neither impaired nor did he test positive for alcohol at the time of testing which was the basis for his termination. [He] neither violated BASF policy, the Department of Transportation standards and regulation, nor the Texas Penal Code with respect to the standard for impairment or intoxication. Therefore, the reasons for termination were pretextual and were discriminatory on the basis of a disability recognized by the [ADA].\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Dkt. 22 at 10-11 (emphasis omitted). The Court denied the motion, explaining that Kitchen \"failed to show there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact.\" Dkt. 60.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Kitchen filed the Summary Judgment Response at 11:59 p.m. on July 26, 2018, the same date a response to BASF's Motion for Summary Judgment was due. The Summary Judgment Response had no evidence attached to it. Kitchen late-filed a Corrected Opposition/Response to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (with summary judgment evidence attached) at 10:27 p.m. on July 27, 2018. The Court struck the \"corrected\" response as untimely under the local rules. Dkt. 95.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Citing a 2012 BASF policy, Kitchen argues that a blood alcohol test must register at least 0.04 to constitute a positive test. Because Kitchen did not blow a 0.04, Kitchen claims that it was improper for BASF to terminate him based on 0.014 and 0.010 test results. This argument is misplaced. For starters, the uncontroverted summary judgment evidence establishes that a June 2013 BASF policy replaced the 2012 policy to which Kitchen relies, and the 2013 policy did not mandate any positive test threshold. Moreover, the Final Warning and Return to Work also did not contain any test threshold. It simply provided that \"testing positive, may lead to discipline up to, and including, termination of employment.\" Dkt. 77-3 at 50.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
