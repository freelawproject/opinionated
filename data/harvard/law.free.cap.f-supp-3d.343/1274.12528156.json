Under the Workers' Compensation Law, \"[a] person whose employment is both casual and not in the course of the trade, business, profession, or occupation of the employer\" is not an \"employee.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20440.02\">\n    Fla.

Here, the undisputed record evidence establishes that Lopez's employment was not \"casual\" because the cost of Lopez's labor was anticipated to be a minimum of $840. (Lopez Depo. 48:15-52:17). Further, UCE, Lopez's statutory employer, was a certified roofing contractor. (Pereira Depo. 5:20-6:4, 10:14-21). Thus, Lopez's work was within the \"course of the trade, business, profession, or occupation of [UCE],\" and was, therefore, not \"casual.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20440.02\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20440.02\">\n    Fla.

Plaintiff concedes that \"Lopez likely does not qualify as an 'employee' as defined in the Policy,\" but argues that Lopez is nonetheless a \"statutory employee,\" which Florida law treats identically to actual employees in employee exclusion clauses. (ECF Nos. 24 at 8-11; 39 at 1-5; and 40 at 4-7). Lopez and UCE reiterate their previous arguments that Lopez was a \"temporary employee\" or a \"casual\" worker, and that Lopez's lawsuit is covered by the Roofing Operations Endorsement. (ECF Nos. 33 and 34). The Court again disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As discussed above, Florida courts have treated \"statutory employees ... identically to actual employees in relation to standard employee exclusion clauses.\"\n   <em>\n    Revoredo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11916085\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/698/890/#p890\">\n    698 So.2d at 891\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
