BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff Alta is a corporation that was founded in 2008 in Silicon Valley. ECF No. 1 (\"Compl.\") \u00b6 8. As of 2011, Alta was the world's only known manufacturer of thin-film solar technology using Gallium Arsenide (\"GaAs\") for widespread commercial use.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-10. Such technology allows devices coated in the thin GaAs solar film to be \"powered by this independent energy source.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. Defendant LGE is a Korean company and one of the world's largest electronics manufacturers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 38. Alta alleges that prior to June 2011, LGE had not attempted development of thin-film GaAs solar cells.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   By 2011 and early 2012, Alta had already developed a \"demonstrative production line\" of thin-film GaAs solar cells and was \"prepared to implement a small-scale production line with a capacity of 10MW, to be financed through a 'Series D' investment offering.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Alta planned to then increase its scale to a \"large, commercially viable manufacturing facility which could produce the thin-film device with quality, uniformity, and economic cost, first at a capacity of 40MW and then at a capacity of 165MW.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Alta alleges that LGE was one company that showed interest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In early June of 2011, Alta and LGE entered into discussions regarding possible investment or other business opportunities related to Alta's technology.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. On June 13, 2011, Alta and LGE entered into a mutual non-disclosure agreement (\"2011 NDA,\" or \"Agreement\") that prohibited both parties from disclosing or using \"Confidential Information\" disclosed by the other party in connection with discussions regarding the potential business opportunities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.

No other right or license, whether expressed or implied, in the Confidential Information is granted to the receiving party. Title to the Confidential Information will remain solely in the disclosing party. All use of the Confidential Information by the receiving party shall be for the benefit of the disclosing party and any modifications and improvements thereof (e.g., summaries and analyses thereof) by the receiving party shall be the sole property of the disclosing party).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44 (quoting Compl. Exh. A \u00b6 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Alta alleges that two terms are covered under Section 5 of the 2011 NDA: (1) \"the time for the parties' disclosure of Confidential Information,\" and (2) \"the duration of the duty to hold in confidence the Confidential Information disclosed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45 (citing Compl.

Exh. A \u00b6 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Alta alleges that as a result of the 2011 NDA, LGE gained information \"showing the financial and technical feasibility of the mass-production of Alta Devices' solar film technology, testing information, and plans for improvement, as well as other Confidential Information.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On October 31, 2011, LGE visited Alta to learn more about Alta's technology, through which LGE gained additional Confidential Information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Alta alleges that\n   \"[b]y November 7, 2011, [LGE] intentionally began to plan how to develop in-house Alta's technology.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, Alta alleges that LGE represented an intention to invest not only in the \"Series D\" investment, but also advancing stages of participation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. Alta maintains that this representation led to LGE seeking and receiving further detailed information about the techniques and processes involved in the actual manufacturing of the solar film developed by Alta.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51-55. However, after receiving this Confidential Information from Alta, LGE declined to make binding its previous tentative investment offer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Alta alleges that in late 2013 and early 2014, LGE posed as a potential costumer interested in purchasing GaAs thin-film for incorporation onto its manufactured mobile devices and sought and received a sample of Alta's GaAs thin-film for testing its \"charging efficiency.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64. LGE then used this material for technical analysis and reverse engineering to assist LGE in developing its own manufacturing process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   LGE then developed its manufacturing capabilities using Alta's Confidential Information and is now producing very similar thin GaAs solar film while moving toward full-scale, mass-commercialized economical production.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. LGE is currently marketing its GaAs thin-film that Alta alleges is manufactured using Alta's Confidential Information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Alta alleges that it only learned of LGE's misappropriation of Alta's trade secrets in mid-2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65. Publications produced by LGE described solar cell structures manufactured using similar manufacturing techniques as Alta's, and an LGE patent application appears to incorporate similar aspects of Alta's production process and tooling.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 66-72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As a result, Alta sought reassurances from LGE and requested that LGE return Alta's Confidential Information pursuant to the 2011 NDA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 74-75, 78-79, 80-81, 83. LGE refused to return all of Alta's Confidential Information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 77, 86. LGE also \"unintentionally discarded\" two of the five solar cell samples it had received from Alta.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87. Moreover, Alta alleges that the materials LGE did return had redacted summaries and analysis of Alta's Confidential Information, and that much of the production \"consisted of many LG[E]-branded documents that appeared to be presentations summarizing the results of LG[E]'s testing, analysis, use and study of Alta's Confidential Information.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 59-63, 77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Alta claims that LGE's use of Alta's trade secrets has diminished and may destroy the market for Alta's proprietary product and that Alta's very existence is threatened by LGE's use of Alta's Confidential Information obtained under the 2011 NDA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-21; 90-92. Consequently, Alta's Complaint asserts five claims for relief. First, Alta claims that LGE misappropriated Alta's trade secrets in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201836\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   , the Defend Trade Secrets Act (\"DTSA\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201836\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201836\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 92-102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, LGE argues that Alta has failed to allege any trade secrets that were in existence after June 13, 2015, which LGE maintains is fatal to both Alta's DTSA and CUTSA claims. Mot. at 2-8. Second, LGE argues that Alta has failed to describe the trade secrets\n   that were misappropriated with sufficient particularity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203426.1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203426.1\">\n    at 9-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court considers these arguments in turn. For the reasons set forth below, the Court holds that Alta adequately plead claims under the DTSA and the CUTSA and therefore DENIES LGE's Motion to Dismiss these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Whether Alta has Plead the Existence of \"Trade Secrets\" after June 13, 2015\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   LGE attacks Alta's DTSA and CUTSA claims for not alleging trade secrets during the relevant time in question because LGE argues that Alta cannot allege any trade secrets in existence after June 13, 2015. A \"trade secret\" is defined as such if \"the owner thereof has taken\n   <em>\n    reasonable measures\n   </em>\n   to keep such information secret.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201839\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203426.1\">\n    Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 3426.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). LGE's argument that Alta failed to allege any trade secrets in existence after June 13, 2015 is effectively twofold: (1) pursuant to the 2011 NDA, LGE had\n   <em>\n    no duty\n   </em>\n   to hold in confidence the Confidential Information after June 13, 2015; and (2) Alta did not take\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   measures (let alone reasonable ones) to extend LGE's confidentiality obligations after that date. Mot. at 5-8. LGE argues that the lack of trade secrets after June 13, 2015 is fatal to Alta's DTSA claim because the DTSA requires that misappropriations occur or continue to occur on or after DTSA's date of enactment on May 11, 2016. Mot. at 3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Veronica Foods Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202806706\">\n    2017 WL 2806706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *13. LGE argues that the non-existence of trade secrets after June 13, 2015 is also fatal to Alta's CUTSA claim because Alta's Complaint alleges only specific acts of unauthorized use occurring\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   June 13, 2015, and Alta cannot state a claim for misappropriation \"absent establishment of a predicate trade secret.\" Mot. at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Specifically, LGE relies on Section 5 of the 2011 NDA (the \"Term Provision\") to support its position that its obligations to keep Alta's Confidential Information secret expired by June 13, 2015. Under the Term Provision, the parties provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    Term.\n   </strong>\n   The term for the parties' disclosure of Confidential Information under this Agreement (\"Disclosure Period\") shall be one (1) year (extendable by addendum) from the Effective Date.\n   <em>\n    The parties' duty to hold in confidence Confidential Information that was disclosed during the Term shall survive for an additional three (3) years after the expiration of this Agreement.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Compl. Exh. A \u00b6 5 (emphasis added). According to LGE, this provision provides that the \"term\" of the \"Disclosure Period\" commenced at execution of the Agreement on June 13, 2011 (the \"Effective Date\"). The Disclosure Period then ended \"one (1) year\" later, on June 13, 2012. LGE interprets the \"expiration of this Agreement\" to have occurred on June 13, 2012, the end of the Disclosure Period. LGE then interprets the Term Provision as requiring LGE to hold the Confidential Information for \"three (3) years\" after June 13, 2012, which is both the date of the Agreement's expiration and the end of the Disclosure Period. Thus, LGE's duty to hold in confidence ended on June 13, 2015. Mot. at 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. Exh. A \u00b6 5. Given this reading of the Term Provision, LGE argues that Alta had no expectation of secrecy after June 13, 2015. Mot. at 7 (citing\n   <em>\n    Silicon Image, Inc. v. Analogix Semiconductor, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. C-07-00635 JCS,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20166950\">\n    2008 WL 166950\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *17 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 17, 2008) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Thus, the main issue raised by LGE is essentially one of contract interpretation: whether the Term Provision provided for the expiration of the 2011 NDA/Agreement on June 13, 2012. A court may resolve contractual claims on a motion to dismiss if the terms of the contract are unambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Bedrosian v.

Therefore, the motion to dismiss the DTSA and CUTSA claims on this ground must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The first sentence of the Term Provision plainly provides for a Disclosure Period that was to start at the June 13, 2011 execution of the 2011 NDA and then continue for one year. However, the second sentence in the Term Provision - the sentence at issue - is unclear. It provides only that \"[t]he parties' duty to hold in confidence Confidential Information that was disclosed during the Term\n   <em>\n    shall survive for an additional three (3) years after the expiration of this Agreement.\n   </em>\n   \" Compl. Exh. A \u00b6 5 (emphasis added). Therefore, what is unclear in this provision is the definition of \"expiration of this Agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   There are no provisions in the 2011 NDA supplying a definition of the phrase \"expiration of this Agreement.\" Nothing in the 2011 NDA states that the 2011 NDA expires, let alone when expiration is intended to occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Moreover, a review of the other 2011 NDA provisions further confirms that the meaning of the phrase \"expiration of this Agreement\" is ambiguous. The \"Return of Confidential Information\" provision (Section 6), for instance, provides that LGE had to return the Confidential Information upon the earlier of \"(i) the completion or termination of the dealings between the parties contemplated hereunder; (ii) the termination of this Agreement; or (iii) at such time as the disclosing party may so request; provided, however, that the receiving party may retain such of its documents as is necessary to enable it to comply with its document retention policies.\" Compl. Exh. A \u00b6 6. This provision contemplates that \"the completion or termination of the dealings between the parties\" and the \"termination of this Agreement\" would be two distinct events.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670457\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/572/771/#p777\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This observation further supports the Court's determination that the 2011 NDA's language leaves doubts as to the parties' intent, such that the motion to dismiss must be denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Monaco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5706574\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/554/1034/#p1040\">\n    554 F.Supp.2d at 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Thus, while LGE is correct that a court may determine rights at the motion to dismiss stage for an unambiguous contract,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Salesbrain, Inc. v. AngelVision Tech.\n   </em>\n   , No. C 12-05026 LB,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201191236\">\n    2013 WL 1191236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12-*13 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 21, 2013), this is not such a situation. The 2011 NDA between Alta and LGE is not like the NDA in\n   <em>\n    Salesbrain\n   </em>\n   because there it was \"both true and uncontested that the NDA's confidentiality, non-use, and non-disclosure obligations expired on April 8, 2010, two years after [the party] signed the NDA.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201191236\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, however, the NDA 2011's Term Provision is ambiguous on its face. Thus, the Court must refrain from deciding this issue on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Monaco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5706574\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/554/1034/#p1040\">\n    554 F.Supp.2d at 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Where the language 'leaves doubt as to the parties' intent,' the motion to dismiss must be denied.\" (citation omitted) );\n   <em>\n    Bedrosian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=208%20F.3d%20220\">\n    208 F.3d at 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Resolution of contractual claims on a motion to\n   dismiss is proper if the terms of the contract are unambiguous.\"). The Court rejects LGE's argument regarding the 2011 NDA's expiration at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Moreover, even if the 2011 NDA clearly did expire on June 13, 2012, it is not immediately clear that fact would bar Alta from alleging a claim under the DTSA or the CUTSA. As discussed, the DTSA/CTSA \"trade secret\" inquiry asks whether the owner took \"reasonable measures\" to keep the information secret.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201839\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203426.1\">\n    Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 3426.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). Thus, the presence of a contract is an allegation that may support a finding of reasonable measures, but an expired contract does not automatically render any information incapable of receiving trade secretion protection. This was partially why the court in\n   <em>\n    BladeRoom Grp. Ltd. v. Facebook, Inc.\n   </em>\n   rejected defendant's motion in limine argument that because the parties' NDA expired, \" 'the information was no longer \"secret\" [and] [defendant] was under no obligation to treat it as confidential,' \" and therefore, defendant could not \"be held liable for misappropriation based on any subsequent conduct.\" No. 5:15-cv-01370-EJD,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201569703\">\n    2018 WL 1569703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 30, 2018). Instead, the court said \"as to the\n   <em>\n    tort\n   </em>\n   for trade secret misappropriation, the fact that a\n   <em>\n    contract\n   </em>\n   expired does not automatically render any information incapable of receiving trade secret protection; rather, it is one fact the jury may consider to determine whether or not Plaintiffs adequately protected their trade secrets subsequent to the termination.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201569703\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Moreover,\n   <em>\n    Silicon Image, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , does nothing to change this conclusion. In\n   <em>\n    Silicon Image, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the court only noted that there was evidence that the plaintiff itself as well as its customers had disregarded confidentiality designations under the NDAs. Thus, the evidence raised questions about whether plaintiff's \"reliance on NDAs to protect its own confidential information was reasonable at the time the alleged copying occurred, in 2005 and 2006.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20166950\">\n    2008 WL 166950\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *17. The\n   <em>\n    Silicon Image, Inc.\n   </em>\n   decision had nothing to do with the duration of an NDA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Therefore, at the motion to dismiss stage, the Court concludes that the contract is ambiguous. LGE's motion to dismiss on this basis must be DENIED.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Mot. at 10-12. Alta responds that it is not required to plead its trade secrets with \"particularity,\" and that in any event, the facts Alta alleges permit LGE to determine the boundaries of the trade secrets as well as create an inference of misappropriation. Opp'n at 13-18. The Court considers these arguments below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   To reiterate, under the DTSA and the CUTSA, a plaintiff must allege (1) that it is the owner of a trade secret; (2) that the defendant misappropriated the trade secret; and (3) that it was damaged by the defendant's actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Space Data Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205013363\">\n    2017 WL 5013363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2.

Therefore, Alta's breach of contract claim based on failure to return Confidential Information expired pursuant to the four year statute of limitations on June 13, 2016. In light of this, the Court GRANTS LGE's motion to dismiss Alta's breach of contract claim based on LGE's failure to return information. Because amendment would be futile, the motion to dismiss this claim is granted with prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leadsinger, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071886\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/512/522/#p532\">\n    512 F.3d at 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

LGE argues, like it did as to Alta's trade secret claims, that to the extent that Alta's claim for breach of contract is based on LGE's alleged unauthorized use, \"LGE's 'duty to hold in confidence' obligation under the 2011 NDA\" expired on June 13, 2015.

As already discussed in subsection III.A.1., the Court finds that the Term Provision is ambiguous as to the question of when the 2011 NDA, and therefore LGE's obligation,\n   ended.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Monaco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5706574\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/554/1034/#p1040\">\n    554 F.Supp.2d at 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Where the language 'leaves doubt as to the parties' intent,' the motion to dismiss must be denied.\" (citation omitted) );\n   <em>\n    Bedrosian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=208%20F.3d%20220\">\n    208 F.3d at 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Resolution of contractual claims on a motion to dismiss is proper if the terms of the contract are unambiguous.\").

The Court considers each argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   First, LGE argues that \"[t]o the extent that Alta's declaratory judgment claim addresses LGE's purported use of Alta's alleged trade secrets, it is 'based on the same nucleus of facts as trade secret[s] misappropriation' and thus preempted by the CUTSA.\" Mot. at 16 (citing Cal. Civ. Code. \u00a7 3426.7 and\n   <em>\n    Waymo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273803\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/256/1059/#p1062\">\n    256 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1062 ). Alta does not dispute much of LGE's first argument. Instead Alta argues that the \"CUTSA does not limit remedies not based on trade secrets.\" Opp'n at 22 (citing Cal. Civ. Code. \u00a7 3426.7 ). Alta states first that \"Alta seeks a declaration of the parties' rights and duties under the NDA,\" and that the \"CUTSA does not displace any of Alta's contractual remedies, including for declaratory relief, based on the NDA\" because \"[c]ontract remedies are expressly exempted from any effect of [the] CUTSA.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273803\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/256/1059/#p1062\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing Cal. Civ. Code. \u00a7 3426.7 ). Alta argues second that Alta may seek a declaration as to LGE's unfair business acts and practices related to its UCL claim specifically regarding Alta's rights for the samples that LGE fraudulently obtained from Alta because \"LGE's reverse engineering of [the] samples would not be misappropriation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273803\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/256/1059/#p1062\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The Court agrees with Alta that the CUTSA does not preempt Alta's breach of contract claim, and therefore does not preempt Alta's declaratory judgment claim to the extent that it relies on the breach of contract claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cal. Civ. Code. \u00a7 3426.7 (\"This title does not affect (1) contractual remedies, whether or not based upon misappropriation of a trade secret.\"). However, the Court agrees with LGE that to the extent the declaratory judgment claim is based on the same nucleus of facts as trade secret misappropriation, the declaratory judgment claim is preempted by the CUTSA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Waymo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273803\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/256/1059/#p1062\">\n    256 F.Supp.3d at 1062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"At the pleadings stage, the supersession analysis asks whether, stripped of facts supporting trade secret misappropriation, the remaining factual allegations can be reassembled to independently support other causes of action.\"). The Court therefore GRANTS LGE's Motion to Dismiss the declaratory judgment claim to the extent it is based on\n   Alta's UCL claim. However, the Court grants leave to amend to eliminate the trade secret misappropriation allegations and to set forth more clearly a basis for a declaration as to LGE's unfair, unlawful, or fraudulent business acts and practices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   III.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Second, LGE argues that \"to the extent that Alta's claim for declaratory relief is based upon LGE's failure to return information under the 2011 NDA, it is barred by the four-year statute of limitations.\" Mot. at 16 (citing Cal. Code Civ. P. \u00a7 337 ). Having found Alta's breach of contract claim based on a failure to return Confidential Information to be time barred as discussed in subsection III.B.1, the Court agrees. The Court therefore GRANTS LGE's Motion to Dismiss Alta's declaratory judgment claim with prejudice to the extent it is based upon LGE's failure to return Confidential Information under the 2011 NDA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Third, LGE argues that Alta's claim for declaratory judgment should fail in its entirety because it is \"entirely redundant of the relief sought under its claims.\" Mot. at 16. The Court disagrees. Although some courts have said that \"[a] claim for declaratory relief is unnecessary where an adequate remedy exists under some other cause of action,\"\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Mangindin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4175020\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/637/700/#p707\">\n    637 F.Supp.2d at 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 57 specifically provides that \"[t]he existence of another adequate remedy does not preclude a declaratory judgment that is otherwise appropriate.\" The critical question is whether the declaratory relief \"will serve a useful purpose in clarifying and settling the legal relations in issue.\"\n   <em>\n    McGraw-Edison Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"819264\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/362/339/#p342\">\n    362 F.2d at 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The Court declines to dismiss the declaratory judgment claim in its entirety because the Court finds that a declaratory judgment would serve a useful purpose. The declaratory relief and other claims seek different relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Yahoo! Inc. Customer Data Security Breach Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525457\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/1113/#p1139\">\n    313 F.Supp.3d 1113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1139 (N.D. Cal. 2018) (\"Based on the pleadings, the contract claims and the declaratory relief claim seek different relief. The contract claims request retrospective relief-namely, damages-for the past harms that Plaintiffs have suffered.\"). Although Alta's DTSA, CUTSA, and UCL claims seek retrospective relief (damages) for the past harm that Alta suffered, the declaratory relief claim seeks a declaration of the parties'\n   <em>\n    prospective\n   </em>\n   rights and duties under the NDA, as well as injunction going forward.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 23\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 130 (seeking a declaration to prevent further misappropriation and breaches); Compl. at 28 (seeking an \"injunction against future harm by disclosure or adverse use.\"). Accordingly, the Court DENIES LGE's motion to dismiss the declaratory judgment claim in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court rules as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   \u2022 The Motion to Dismiss the DTSA claim is DENIED;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   \u2022 The Motion to Dismiss the CUTSA claim is DENIED;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   \u2022 The Motion to Dismiss the breach of contract claim based on failure to return Confidential Information is GRANTED with prejudice;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   \u2022 The Motion to Dismiss the breach of contract claim based on misuse of the Confidential Information is DENIED;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   \u2022 The Motion to Dismiss the UCL claim is GRANTED with leave to amend;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   \u2022 The Motion to Dismiss the declaratory judgment claim in so far as it relies on Alta's breach of contract\n   claim based on failure to return Confidential Information is GRANTED with prejudice;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   \u2022 The Motion to Dismiss the declaratory judgment claim in so far as it relies on Alta's UCL claim is GRANTED with leave to amend;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   \u2022 The Motion to Dismiss the declaratory judgment claim in its entirety is DENIED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   If Alta elects to file an amended complaint, Alta must do so within 30 days of this Order.
