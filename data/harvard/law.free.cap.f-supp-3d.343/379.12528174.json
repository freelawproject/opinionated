On October 7, 2014, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"USPTO\") issued United States Patent No. 8,856,056 to iSentium, titled \"Sentiment calculus for a method and system using social media for event-driven trading\" (the \" '056 Patent\"). The '056 Patent describes a multi-step method for evaluating statements posted to Twitter that discuss publicly traded assets. This method purports to evaluate whether the statements express a positive, negative or neutral opinion, and assigns them a score of 1, 2 or 3 based on the strength of the opinion. It claims to do so with a scale, efficiency and accuracy that is not possible for human readers, and to anticipate changes in an asset's price before human traders can act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In May 2013, before the '056 Patent was issued, iSentium entered into an agreement with defendants Bloomberg Finance L.P., Bloomberg L.P. and Bloomberg Inc. (collectively, \"Bloomberg\") to incorporate iSentium's technology into the well-known Bloomberg terminal platform. In or around February 2016, Bloomberg and iSentium terminated their arrangement pursuant to a mutual non-disclosure agreement (the \"NDA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On October 4, 2017, iSentium commenced this action, alleging, among other\n   things, that Bloomberg has infringed the '056 Patent by developing its own application for analyzing social media posts. iSentium also brings claims under New York law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Bloomberg has moved to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. P. Bloomberg urges that the '056 Patent is directed to an abstract idea that is not eligible for patent protection under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Bloomberg separately moves to dismiss iSentium's claims for the misappropriation of trade secrets, promissory estoppel and unjust enrichment, all of which are brought under New York law. The Court heard argument on the motion on October 15, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the reasons that will be explained, Bloomberg's motion to dismiss iSentium's patent infringement claim is granted. Drawing every reasonable inference in favor of iSentium, the '056 Patent is directed to the abstract idea of interpreting a written statement posted to social media. It describes a method for using algorithms and databases to determine the meanings of words based on their surrounding context. But selecting information, analyzing it with mathematical techniques and reporting the results is an abstract idea that is not eligible for patent protection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SAP Am., Inc. v. InvestPic, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517925\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/898/1161/#p1167\">\n    898 F.3d 1161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2018). The '056 Patent does not describe an additional, inventive concept that transforms this abstract idea into a patent-eligible application. Bloomberg's motion to dismiss iSentium's patent infringement claim is therefore granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   RULE 12(b)(6) STANDARD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Rule 12(b)(6) requires a complaint to \"contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

(Compl't \u00b6 11 &amp; Ex. 1.) As broadly summarized in the Complaint, the '056 Patent\"allows for the delivery of highly predictive and real-time market sentiment data, derived from social media, to financial professionals, including traders, portfolio managers, and other market participants, that has hitherto been unavailable from any other source.\" (Compl't \u00b6 12.) The Complaint asserts that development of the '056 Patent was \"a complicated endeavor\" that required the investment of \"substantial capital\" and the work of \"internationally recognized experts in linguistics and computer science, over a period of five years.\" (Compl't \u00b6 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The '056 Patent describes a process that it calls \"sentiment analysis,\" which \"attempts to ascertain the feelings, thoughts, attitude, opinion, etc. of a speaker or a writer with respect to a topic.\" (Col. 1,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   22-25.) In essence, a \"sentiment analysis\" reviews a statement and identifies any opinion that it contains. The '056 Patent states that sentiment analysis traditionally has had two approaches. The first is a \"bag of words\" approach, which considers the frequency of words used in a document and classifies the document as either positive or negative. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   25-35.) The second approach is described as \"semantic orientation,\" which classifies words as either \"good\" or \"bad,\" and \"computes an overall good/bad score for the text.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   36-43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   According to the '056 Patent, these two approaches do not adequately analyze sentiments contained in the short, 140-character posts made to Twitter. (Col. 1,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   44-48; Col. 6,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   13-25.) \"[A]n object of the present invention\" is to provide a \"sentiment calculator of social-media messages for the real-time evaluation\" of publicly traded assets. (Col. 1,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   52-60.) For publicly traded stocks, the \"sentiment calculator\" purports to analyze social-media messages \"to predict stock movements before human traders can act.\" (Col. 7,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   16-17.) By evaluating the contents and frequency of posts made to Twitter, the '056 Patent intends to provide traders with a decision-making tool about anticipated changes to a stock's value. (Col. 21,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   6-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The '056 Patent bases its sentiment analysis on two concepts: \"polarity and\n   strength.\" (Col. 2,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   2-3.) Polarity simply means whether a statement is positive, negative or neutral. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   32-34.) Strength indicates how strongly held the opinion is, and is scored with integers of 1, 2 or 3. (Col. 8,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   13-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The '056 Patent explains that it determines polarity and strength by \"apply[ing] rules considering syntactic constituents in head-complement, modifier-modified, and subject-predicate relations.\" (Col. 2,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   10-13.) The terms \"head-complement, modifier-modified, and subject-predicate\" are basic elements of English grammar. (Col. 15,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   1-17.) For example, a \"modifier\" just means an adverb or adjective, accompanied by the noun or verb it describes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   9-12.) A head \"is a lexical item such as a verb\" that relates to another part of the sentence, called a \"complement.\" (Col. 15,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   5-17.) \"Syntactic constituents\" include adjectives, nouns and verbs. (Col. 14,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   65-67.) In plain English, the '056 Patent proposes a method for determining the meaning of words in a Twitter post, based on their use in the context of other words.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The '056 Patent describes, as a preferred embodiment, a \"pipeline\" that \"ingests\" posts made to Twitter. (Col. 18,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   5-19.) This includes several steps. First, the '056 Patent describes an \"Ingest Compound,\" which permits traders to perform the routine activity of conducting a keyword search. (Col. 9,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   17 to Col. 10,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   19.) A \"Language Identifier Module\" excludes posts in languages other than English. (Col. 10,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   20-36.) A \"Filter Module\" eliminates hashtags and URLs, and replaces symbols and abbreviations with natural language. (Col. 10,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   38-62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Twitter post is then reviewed by a \"Natural Language Processor,\" or \"NLP.\" (Col. 10,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   63 to Col. 14,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   23.) The NLP describes a series of steps to identify important words and score them for \"polarity\" and \"strength.\" The NLP uses two databases: one called the \"Sent-Lex\" and a second called the \"Stock-Lex.\" The \"Sent-Lex\" is \"a hand-crafted sentiment-based repository, or database,\" of words and phrases common to social media. (Col. 10,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   65-67.) Words are associated with an \"inherent polarity value\" (that is, a positive, negative or neutral meaning) and \"strength\" values of 1, 2 or 3. (Col. 11,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   21-50.) For example, the words \"good,\" \"better\" and \"best\" are all positive, with respective strength scores of 1, 2 and 3. (Col. 11,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   58-60.) The \"Stock-Lex\" serves a similar function: it is a database of common financial terms assigned positive, negative or neutral meanings, and strength values of 1, 2 or 3. (Col. 12,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   1-45.) As an example, \"die\" has a negative value of 3, whereas \"develop\" has a positive value of 1. (Col. 12,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   21-22.) A third component of the NLP is described as a \"Part of Speech\" tagger, which identifies adjectives, adverbs, verbs and nouns. (Col. 12,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   46 to Col. 13,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   38.) This purports to be an improvement on past methods of \"sentiment analysis\" that detected only adjectives. (Col. 13,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   23-38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The '056 Patent next describes a \"Sentiment Calculator.\" The Sentiment Calculator is central to the inventions described in Claim 1 and Claim 11, which are the only two independent claims of the '056 Patent that are identified by the parties. As described by the '056 Patent, \"[a] sentiment is an integer\" calculated to decide whether an opinion is positive, negative or neutral, and the strength of the underlying opinion. (Col. 14,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   25-42.) The '056 Patent lists examples of rules that determine whether a sentiment is positive, negative or neutral. (Col. 15,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   24-59.) For instance, in determining the \"polarity\" of a statement, it recites the following rule:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (22) if (Pol (x)=Pol (y) ), then\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   if (x is n) and (y is n), then Pol (y=n)n, n = n average result\n   if (x is +) and (y is +), then Pol (x=+ )+, + = + announce an upgrade\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   if (x is -) and (y is -), then Pol (y = -)- = - downgrade to sell\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (Col. 15,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   43-48.) This exemplar rule purports to identify neutral (n), positive (+) and negative (-) statements, and to determine the statements' effect for a particular asset. A neutral opinion is an \"average result,\" a positive opinion results in \"announce an upgrade\" and a negative opinion results in \"downgrade to sell.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Sentiment Calculator also recites rules for determining the strength of an opinion. (Col. 16,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   5-19.) The '056 Patent explains that the Sentiment Calculator isolates words related to a specific asset, and does not evaluate other language in the post. (Col. 16,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   20-33.) As an example, it uses the sentence, \"Canadian dollar falls for second week. Crude Oil prices rise.\" (Col. 16,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   39 to Col. 17,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   15.) For a trader who researches oil, the Sentiment Calculator would assess only the sentence \"Crude Oil prices rise,\" and attribute a positive score of 3 to the statement based on the concept of a rising price. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The '056 Patent next describes an \"Inference Engine.\" (Col. 17,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   16 to Col. 18,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   36.) The Inference Engine purports to draw conclusions that would normally require input from human experts. (Col. 17,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   16-29.) It uses two bodies of information: \"knowledge of the stock market world and knowledge of the world.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   25-29.) The sources of \"knowledge\" and how it is used in the inference engine is not described in meaningful detail, but the '056 Patent explains that such knowledge allows for conclusions that match the reasoning used by humans, as opposed to those in traditional programming rules.

Claim 11 describes \"[a] method for calculating sentiment using social media messages for the real-time evaluation of publicly traded assets,\" where \"a sentiment is an integer\" calculated from the \"polarity\" and \"strength\" of sentiments posted on social media. (Col. 24,\n   <em>\n    l.\n   </em>\n   48-55.)

When asked to identify the inventive algorithm, counsel described it as \"the consideration of words in relation to each other.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.)

Under questioning from the Court, counsel to iSentium asserted that it was claiming the use of the databases as an inventive concept. (Oct. 15 Tr. at 15-16.)

At the Rule 12 stage, the Court assumes as true that a person of ordinary skill in the relevant field would regard the structure for performing sentiment analysis as described in Claim 1 as an improvement over prior methods.
