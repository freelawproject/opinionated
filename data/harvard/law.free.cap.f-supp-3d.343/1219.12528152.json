Ford's Dispositive Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 33; Ford's Motion) and Defendant City of Lake City's Motion for Summary Judgment (A Dispositive Motion) and Memorandum of Law (Doc. 34; City's Motion) (collectively, \"the Motions\"), filed on May 21, 2018. On June 11, 2018, the Court entered an Order (Doc. 36) noting that it would treat the Motions as unopposed if Plaintiff Jason Benoit did not file a response by June 25, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order. Pursuant to the Court's directive, Benoit filed Plaintiff's Response in Opposition to Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment (Doc. 37; Response) on the deadline. With leave of Court,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Order (Doc. 39), Defendant City of Lake City (the \"City\") filed Defendant's Reply to Plaintiff's Response in Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 40; Reply) on July 25, 2018. Accordingly, this matter is ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Consideration of Defendants' Affidavits and Declaration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants have provided various items of evidentiary material in support of the Motions, including the Affidavit of Gerald Ford (Officer Ford) (Doc. 32-1; Ford Aff.), the Affidavit of Ryan Nydam (Doc. 34-7; Nydam Aff.) and the Declaration of Kevin C. Kostelnik, counsel for Defendant Officer Ford, (Doc. 32-5; Kostelnik Declaration). Before considering the merits of the Motions, the Court will address one argument raised by Benoit with regard to the evidence presented by Defendants in support of their Motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the Response, Benoit urges the Court to disregard the affidavits of Officer Ford and Nydam, as well as the Kostelnik Declaration. Response at 8. As to all three, Benoit argues that the affidavits and declaration should not be considered by the Court because they were produced after the close of discovery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, Benoit\n   points to no authority which requires that affidavits or declarations submitted in support of a motion for summary judgment need to have been produced during the course of discovery. While Rule 56(c)(1)(A), of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Rule(s) ), requires a motion for summary judgment to be supported by \"materials in the record, including .... affidavits or declarations ...,\" nothing in the Rule suggests that the affidavits or declarations themselves have to have been produced in discovery in order to be considered in support of or in opposition to a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 56(c)(4) (requiring only that affidavits be made on personal knowledge, set forth facts that would be admissible at trial, and show that the affiant is competent to testify to these matters). Thus, to the extent Benoit seeks exclusion of the affidavits and declaration on this basis, his argument is unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   With regard to Ford's Affidavit, Benoit also suggests that it should be disregarded because Officer Ford submitted only excerpts of his deposition \"leaving out the portions of his deposition that contradict the affidavit.\" Response at 8. Again, Benoit cites no authority in support of this position. Notably, as a general proposition, \"[i]n light of the jury's role in resolving questions of credibility, a district court should not reject the content of an affidavit even if it is at odds with statements made in an earlier deposition.\"\n   <em>\n    Kennett-Murray Corp. v. Bone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"478712\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/622/887/#p894\">\n    622 F.2d 887\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 894 (5th Cir. 1980). Nevertheless, in appropriate circumstances, a court may disregard a \"sham\" affidavit that is inherently inconsistent with a party's prior deposition testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Van T. Junkins &amp; Assocs., Inc. v. U.S. Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"587596\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/736/656/#p657\">\n    736 F.2d 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 657-59 (11th Cir. 1984). However, the sham affidavit exception should be applied \"sparingly because of the harsh effect [it] may have on a party's case.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rollins v. TechSouth, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10552181\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/833/1525/#p1530\">\n    833 F.2d 1525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1530 (11th Cir. 1987). Indeed, an affidavit may be disregarded as a sham only \" 'when a party has given clear answers to unambiguous questions which negate the existence of any genuine issue of material fact ... [and that party attempts] thereafter [to] create such an issue with an affidavit that merely contradicts, without explanation, previously given clear testimony.' \"\n   <em>\n    Tippens v. Celotex Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1111438\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/805/949/#p953\">\n    805 F.2d 949\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 953-54 (11th Cir. 1986) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Van T. Junkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"587596\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/736/656/#p657\">\n    736 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   657 ) (alterations in\n   <em>\n    Tippens\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In sum, the Eleventh Circuit requires \"a court to find some inherent inconsistency between an affidavit and a deposition before disregarding the affidavit.\"\n   <em>\n    Rollins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10552181\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/833/1525/#p1530\">\n    833 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1530 (citing\n   <em>\n    Tippens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1111438\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/805/949/#p953\">\n    805 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   954 ). Here,\n   Benoit has made no effort to satisfy this heavy burden. Moreover, Benoit has had ample opportunity to address any discrepancies between the deposition and the affidavit, and more importantly, has had the opportunity to submit his own evidence that may conflict with either the Ford Affidavit or his deposition. Under these circumstances, any concern Benoit may have regarding alleged conflicting information is best addressed by viewing the record evidence before the Court in the light most favorable to him. Thus, the Court will not disregard Ford's Affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Last, Benoit urges that the Kostelnik Declaration should be disregarded for the additional reason that Officer Ford did not disclose Kostelnik as a witness (or person with knowledge) prior to the close of discovery and because Kostelnik \"cannot be both the attorney of record and a witness.\" Response at 8. This argument, like the others addressed here, is unsupported by citation to any legal authority. A review of the Kostelnik Declaration discloses that it addresses only one issue relevant to the Motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Kostelnik Declaration. In Paragraph Three, Kostelnik authenticates three e-mails received in discovery from the City.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1111438\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/805/949/#p953\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court observes nothing improper in such a submission, and does not perceive it to violate Officer Ford's discovery obligations or transform his counsel into a witness for the purposes of this action. More importantly, Benoit does not contest the authenticity or content of the e-mails. Thus, his request that the Court disregard the Kostelnik Declaration warrants no relief. Having addressed Benoit's arguments regarding Defendants' affidavits and declaration, the Court turns to its identification of the undisputed facts and the merits of the parties' arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background Facts\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 1, 2014, Benoit's ex-girlfriend, Alison Melissa\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   , called 911 and reported that Benoit violated a domestic violence injunction issued against him by the Circuit Court of the Third Judicial Circuit, in and for Columbia County, Florida on May 27, 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   911 Audio Recording of Melissa's Call to Lake City Police Department (Doc. 32-1; 911 Call); Final Judgment of Injunction for Protection Against Domestic Violence Without Minor Child(ren) (After Notice) (Doc. 34-4; Injunction). The Injunction prohibited Benoit from committing any acts of domestic violence against Melissa and from contacting Melissa, directly or indirectly, \"by mail, e-mail, fax, telephone, through another person, or in any other manner.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Injunction at 1-2. The Injunction further prohibited Benoit from violating the Injunction \"through an intentional unlawful threat, word or act to do violence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. In her 911 Call, Melissa told the Lake City Police Department (LCPD) dispatcher that Benoit called and e-mailed her repeatedly over the past three days, hacked one of her accounts, and threatened to show up at her home if she did not respond to his advances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   911 Call. The LCPD dispatched Officer Ford, who had been a patrol officer with the LCPD since 2011, to Melissa's home located at 394 SW Saint Johns Street, Lack City, Florida 32055.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Videotaped Deposition of Gerald L.

A: Offense Report at 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The dispatcher told Officer Ford that the call involved the violation of a domestic violence injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ford Dep. at 23-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When Officer Ford arrived at Melissa's home, he observed that she \"had the appearance of someone scared and nervous.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Offense Report at 1, 3. Melissa showed Officer Ford a copy of the Injunction and said she was scared because she knew Benoit would hurt her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. She also said that Benoit had e-mailed her several times from a disguised e-mail address and showed Officer Ford three of the messages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The first e-mail read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   I don't want to hurt you!

I know you really don't look at it and keep it in your purse, Please. I am trying to fix this! I wouldn't have changed my number but Marc made me when we were going through all of this. I LOVE YOU ALISON[.] [sic].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Kostelnik Declaration Ex. A: E-Mails at 1. The second e-mail read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Alison, you are not being fair with me. All I ask is for one chance to talk to you. Why won't you answer my phone calls Alison? You are really upsetting me. I am willing to risk everything to come see you. I know I am on house arrest but I have to see you. I know once you see me everything will be Okay. Please don't make me do this! Answer my calls. I love you[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. The third e-mail, sent approximately three and a half hours after the second, read: \"Babe, I disguised my email so I won't get in trouble for contacting you. We need to talk. I love you babe. I got a smartphone, my number is\n   <em>\n    386-249-1448\n   </em>\n   . Please, I don't want to fight. Please just talk to me. I love you[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Melissa also told Officer Ford that Benoit hacked her facebook account and called her 23 times over the past three days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Offense Report at 3. Melissa showed Officer Ford her call history which displayed 23 incoming calls from the phone number provided in the third e-mail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ford Aff. \u00b6 11; Offense Report at 3. Officer Ford reviewed Melissa's call history to determine and document the dates and times of the 23 calls.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 101-103. In doing so, he observed that Melissa stored the caller's number under Benoit's name as an emergency contact and, according to his Offense Report, heard Benoit's voice on the voicemail greeting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Offense Report at 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Melissa then filled out a Voluntary Statement (Doc. 34-5).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Offense Report at 3; Ford Dep. at 109; Voluntary Statement. In her Voluntary Statement, Melissa wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   My ex, Jason Benoit, has a restraining order on him for my protection. In the\n   last 3 days, I have received 23 phone calls from him, he hacked my facebook account, and emailed me from a disguised email account. I have ignored him, and he still continued calling me. This afternoon, I received the last email stating if I didn't answer the phone, he would come to my house. I am scared and don't want him anywhere near me, so I contacted the police. I know he will hurt me!\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Voluntary Statement. Melissa signed the Voluntary Statement below the following affirmation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   I have read each page of this statement consisting of 1 page(s), each page of which bears my signature, and corrections, if any, bear my initials, and I certify that the facts contained herein are true and correct. I also declare that I was not told or prompted what to say in this statement. This statement was completed at 8:00 P.M. on the 1 day of July, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Voluntary Statement also bears Officer Ford's signature as a witness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   In his deposition, Officer Ford testified that at the time of his interaction with Melissa, he had no reason to believe that her statements were anything but truthful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ford Dep. at 33-34. He further testified that although he \"tried to be thorough,\" he \"wanted to get it done and move on to the next call.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 84. After leaving Melissa's residence, Officer Ford returned to the station to verify the existence and terms of the Injunction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34-35, 88-89. Having done so, Officer Ford sought and obtained clearance from Sergeant Paul Cash to arrest Benoit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ford Dep. at 90-92.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Later that night, at approximately 7:30pm, Officer Ford and two deputies of the Columbia County Sheriff's Office went to Benoit's home located at 384 SW Saint Johns Street 101, Lake City, Florida 32055, to execute the arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Arrest Report (Doc. 34-3; Arrest Report). Officer Ford advised Benoit of Melissa's allegations, which Benoit insisted were lies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Deposition of Jason Benoit (Doc. 34-6; Benoit Dep.) at 30. Benoit asked Officer Ford for the phone number used to call Melissa and to see a copy of Melissa's Voluntary Statement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30, 116-18.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officer Ford told Benoit that he \"did not have\" the Voluntary Statement, which lead Benoit to believe that she did not prepare her statement until after his arrest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115-16. Despite Benoit's protestations of innocence, the officers arrested him for: (1) willfully violating the Injunction in violation of Florida Statute section 741.31(4)(a)(5) ; (2) stalking in violation of Florida Statute section 784.048(2) ; and (3) violating the terms of his probation in violation of Florida Statute section 948.06.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Arrest Report; Benoit Dep. at 29, 40. The Officers transported Benoit to the Columbia County Jail for processing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Arrest Report at 1-2. Then, Officer Ford prepared the Offense Report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Arrest Report at 1-2; Offense Report at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Benoit believes that Officer Ford was unprofessional and rude during the arrest\n   and that the deputies disagreed with Officer Ford's conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Benoit Dep. at 105, 161-62. However, John A. Miles, an officer with the LCPD for the past 20 years, who held the position of Internal Affairs Sergeant in July of 2014, testified that \"[t]here was no evidence that Officer Ford did anything inappropriate or unprofessional\" on the night of Benoit's arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Affidavit of John A.

As such, on July 28, 2014, the State Attorney's Office filed a \"No Information\" to drop the charges against Benoit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial (Doc. 3; Complaint) \u00b6 35. The State Attorney's Office also charged Melissa with filing a false police report in violation of Florida Statute section 837.05.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nydam Aff. \u00b6 7. Melissa pled guilty to this charge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Officer Ford stopped working for the LCPD shortly after Benoit's arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ford Dep. at 8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On May 4, 2017, Benoit filed his three count Complaint in the Circuit Court of the Third Judicial Circuit, in and for Columbia County, Florida.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint. On July 25, 2017, Officer Ford removed the action to this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant's Notice of Removal (Doc. 1).

In doing so, Benoit points to Officer Ford's inability to recall certain details about Melissa's phone, none of which would have been relevant to his analysis of probable cause.
