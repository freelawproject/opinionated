Compl. \u00b6 8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Robeys intended to build their home on the lot.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Washington Mutual Loan\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Later, in order to refinance the purchase of the home, the Robeys sought to secure a loan from Washington Mutual Bank F.A. (\"Washington Mutual\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. The closing documents for the refinance loan (the \"Loan\") included a promissory note (the \"Note\") and a deed of trust (the \"Deed\"), which were sent by Washington Mutual to the Robeys in Miami, Florida for signature.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. On or about March 19, 2008, Mr. Robey-but not Mrs. Robey-executed the Note in the principal amount of $417,000.00 in favor of Washington Mutual.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12 &amp; Ex. A. And on or about that same date, Mr. Robey-but not Mrs. Robey-executed the Deed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13 &amp; Ex. B.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Plaintiffs, North Carolina law requires the signatures of both husband and wife on a deed of trust.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. The Deed, once signed, purportedly encumbered the Robeys' property and purportedly secured the repayment of the Note.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The Loan is Transferred to Chase\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After the loan documents were filed, Mr. Robey made his monthly loan payments to Washington Mutual via ACH bank transfers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Sometime later, Mr. Robey learned on his own, through a website, that the FDIC had taken over Washington Mutual and subsequently sold its assets to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\"Chase\") on September 25, 2008.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. Despite Chase's purported acquisition of all of Washington Mutual's assets, notices regarding the Note and Deed were still being sent to the Robeys from an entity called \"Washington Mutual.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. The Robeys never received any notices concerning the transfer of rights in the Note and Deed of Trust.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. However, the Robeys eventually received an invoice from Chase for loan payments at their Miami, Florida address, which invoice referenced the same loan number as the Washington Mutual statements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thereafter, Mr. Robey began making Loan payments directly to Chase.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Chase Sends False Claims of Tax Nonpayment, Inexplicably Rejects Payments, Impermissibly Charges Late Fees and Collects Escrow Funds, and Misapplies the Escrow Funds\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 3, 2009-some months after learning that Chase was now the purported holder or servicer of the Loan-Mr. Robey received a letter from \"Washington Mutual\" falsely accusing Mr. Robey of not\n   paying his 2008 real estate taxes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. While the Deed permitted Chase to escrow funds, Chase (according to Plaintiffs) waived any requirement to escrow funds in connection with the Loan, as initially the monthly Loan payments did not include money for escrows.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. In other words, the Robeys were paying taxes and insurance directly.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, having received the correspondence falsely accusing Mr. Robey of not paying his taxes, Mr. Robey promptly sent Chase, by certified mail, his paid tax bill from Watauga County for the year 2008.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Notwithstanding Mr. Robey's providing proof of paying the tax bill, and despite Mr. Robey's multiple written communications and phone calls concerning the issue, Chase never responded or otherwise acknowledged the tax payment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On or about April 20, 2009, Chase-still operating under the name \"Washington Mutual\"-also refused to accept some of Mr. Robey's monthly Loan payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Unbeknownst to Plaintiffs, the rejected Loan payments were incurring significant late fees, which-as Plaintiff alleges \"upon information and belief\"-were improperly added to the Robeys' Loan balance, making it difficult for Mr. Robey to afford the added expenses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. Chase never explained why it refused to accept Mr. Robey's payments and never informed him to what extent they were adding penalty fees, even though these fees were triggered by Chase's refusal to communicate with Mr. Robey.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Further, despite the fact that Chase was not escrowing funds for the Loan, Chase unilaterally escrowed funds, also causing the Loan balance to grow beyond what it should have been, which in turn made it difficult for Mr. Robey to keep the Loan current under the terms of the Note and Deed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. \"Upon information and belief,\" not only did Chase lack the authority to escrow monies, when it did escrow monies, it did so in a grossly inaccurate fashion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. The Loan payment history provided by Chase to Mr. Robey is not clear as to what the purpose was for the inappropriately escrowed monies, as the escrowed amounts do not correlate with any purported expenses associated with the Loan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-28 &amp; Ex. C. Moreover, Chase failed to allocate the escrow money consistent with the priority order set forth in the Deed's express terms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     The Alleged Loan Default and Pre-Foreclosure Workout Efforts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Due to the misapplication of the escrow funds, the Loan appeared to be in default.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. In other words, had the escrow monies been applied correctly, the Loan would not have been in default at the time Chase declared it so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On September 7, 2010, the Robeys received a letter from Chase claiming that the Loan was in arrears.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. In that correspondence, Chase expressly indicated that it was a debt collector attempting to collect a debt.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Only eight days later, on September 15, 2010, Chase delivered a letter notifying the Robeys of Chase's intent to foreclose on the property to recover the balance of the Loan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On October 6, 2010, the Robeys received another letter from Chase, which stated in part: \"You have missed more than one monthly payment. You are in danger of damaging your credit and losing your home. We'll try and find an option for getting you back on track.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On November 10, 2010, Chase sent a letter to the Robeys encouraging them to modify their Loan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. On November 17, 2010, Mr. Robey received another letter from Chase, which stated in part: \"Your house is your home we want to keep it that way\"; \"the longer you delay calling us the fewer chances you may have to save your home\"; and \"your only chance of saving\n   your home is by calling us immediately.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. Also on November 17, 2010, Chase sent another letter to the Robeys, telling them that the Loan may be eligible for a \"workout.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. On that same date, Chase sent a letter of acceleration and another notice of intent to foreclose.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Having received mixed signals, Mr. Robey responded to the foregoing letters by providing copies of negotiated Loan payment checks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. The Robeys received nothing in response other than letters similar to the ones referenced above.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Consequently, on January 26, 2011, Mr. Robey sent a RESPA\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Qualified Written Request (\"QWR\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   to Chase Financial LLC's office in Jacksonville, Florida, requesting a full accounting of his Loan payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38 &amp; Ex. D.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Robey did not receive a response to his QWR until after Chase commenced foreclosure proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     The Foreclosure Filing and Post-Filing Workout Efforts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On January 20, 2011, Chase commenced an action to foreclose on the property in Watauga County, North Carolina, case number 11 SP 12.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39, 51. \"Upon information and belief,\" the Loan was never in default to justify initiating foreclosure proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On February 8, 2011, Chase responded to the QWR only to say that it was \"investigating\" the request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. Chase also responded to Mr. Robey's request by stating \"Chase respectfully declines to release the original loan documents to you.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. Chase did\n   not provide the requested accounting information relative to the Loan payments, the escrow funds and their application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Fearing the loss of his home, Mr. Robey decided to request a loan modification, hoping to also deal with the payment and escrow dispute during that process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. On February 9, 2011, the Robeys received a letter confirming that Chase had initiated a loan modification with Mr. Robey.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. During the period of time when Mr. Robey attempted to modify the Loan, he hired at least two local law firms to help him with the process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44. While Chase assured Mr. Robey that it was interested in modifying the Loan, despite multiple efforts to do so over a lengthy period of time, Chase never authorized a modification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Instead, Chase continued to send meaningless letters regarding the loan modification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Chase continued to ignore the QWR information requests, all in an intentional effort to seek foreclosure of the property rather than attempting to resolve the various issues with the Loan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44, 50-51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On March 9, 2011, Chase again responded to the QWR to say that it was \"working\" on the requests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45. Chase again failed to provide the requested information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On April 21, 2011, in an untimely manner under RESPA regulations, Chase provided another response to the QWR indicating that $2,700.00 had been applied to a suspense account without explanation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46. Per Plaintiffs, the placement of this money into a suspense account was erroneous and inappropriate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Chase still did not provide the requested accounting information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On May 26, 2011, Chase once again responded to the QWR and once again failed to provide the requested information without explanation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On February 10, 2012, Chase notified the Robeys that it had charged the Robeys for forced placed insurance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b648. The Robeys immediately filed proof of fully-paid hazard insurance, and Chase therefore was required to cancel the forced placed insurance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   While Chase did cancel the forced placed insurance, Chase apparently erroneously charged the Robeys for same.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, all of the above actions by Chase reflect an attempt to \"wrongfully, recklessly and intentionally push[ ]\" the Robeys into foreclosure rather than appropriately handle the Loan.\n   <em>\n    Se id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50-51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    F.\n    <em>\n     The Course of the Foreclosure Proceedings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Because North Carolina is a non-judicial foreclosure state, Chase (through its lawyers) had to hire a Substitute Trustee to execute the foreclosure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52. Under North Carolina law, a substitute trustee is supposed to have a fiduciary relationship with both the lender and the borrower, being equally impartial to both.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Generally, a substitute trustee's job is to make sure everything concerning the subject loan and default is processed properly under North Carolina law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In the Robeys' case, the Substitute Trustee was employed by Trustee Services of Carolina, LLC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. \"Upon information and belief,\" this was a for-profit company formed, owned, operated, and controlled by the law firm that Chase hired.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Robeys hired a North Carolina lawyer to assist in the foreclosure proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55. The lawyer discovered that the note had a blank endorsement and that the note apparently had never been assigned to Chase, leaving Chase with no standing to enforce the Note through foreclosure proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Robeys' lawyer provided notice to Chase's lawyers, the Substitute Trustee, and the foreclosure clerk for the non-judicial foreclosure that the Robeys were contesting the foreclosure based on the standing issue and the fact that the Loan was not actually in default.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nevertheless, Chase's lawyers, the Substitute Trustee, and the clerk of court proceeded with the foreclosure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Robeys, desperate to save their home, and on the advice of counsel, filed for bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of Florida in hopes of stopping the sale of the property and to attempt to rectify the issues with the Loan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57. Nonetheless, during the bankruptcy proceedings, Chase and its lawyers falsely represented that the Loan was in default.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58. \"Upon information and belief,\" Chase filed a false proof of claim regarding the defaulted Loan amount through an individual claiming to be a Vice President of Chase, \"when it appears she was not.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The bankruptcy filing failed to stop the sale of the property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Furthermore, after the home was sold, Mr. Robey for the first time noticed that the Deed contained a forgery of Mrs. Robey's signature.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59. Mr. Robey provided the Loan documents to an expert, who confirmed the forgery and also noted that the notary acknowledgment was fabricated/fraudulent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mrs. Robey never signed the Deed nor the Note.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs believe that \"someone\" fraudulently and deliberately forged Mrs. Robey's signature in efforts to make the Deed valid under North Carolina law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60. The Deed was also deficient in that: (1) the Deed listed the property as being located in Avery County, North Carolina, rather\n   than Watuga\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   County, North Carolina; (2) it reflects that it purportedly was notarized in Miami, Florida, while the Robeys never signed any Loan documentation before a notary in Miami; (3) the notary's form of attestation is the form used for an individual, yet the notary purportedly notarized both the Robeys' signatures on one document; and (4) while the notary form notes that a driver's license was presented by the Robeys, there is no notation of a driver's license number(s).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61. According to Plaintiffs, the forged Deed therefore is void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   , rendering any foreclosure sale premised thereon unenforceable and ineffective to transfer any interest in the property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62. Again, despite the void Deed and the lack of any default on the Loan, Chase, its lawyers, the Substitute Trustee and the clerk of court proceeded with the foreclosure and authorized the foreclosure sale of the property to the highest bidder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60, 63. The Robeys were evicted from their property, which since has been re-sold to a third party.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64-66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    G.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiffs commenced this action on March 19, 2018.

Viewing the allegations in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the Complaint relies on the following key acts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   (1) the Robeys purchased the Property, which is sited in North Carolina;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (2) Mr. Robey, but not Mrs. Robey, executed the Deed-this allegedly occurred in Miami, but was not an action by Chase;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   (3) Chase took over the Loan without notifying the Robeys-the Complaint is silent on from where Chase should have sent its notification\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   (4) the Robeys sent (from Miami), and Chase received and responded, various correspondence regarding Loan payments, the Loan balance, taxes, escrow funds, the QWR, the foreclosure and potential workouts/modifications-the Complaint is silent on where Chase received,\n   and from where Chase responded to, this correspondence;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   (5) Chase refused to accept Loan payments-the Complaint is silent on where Chase would or should have accepted these payments, i.e., to where Plaintiffs attempted to send the Loan payments;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   (6) Chase collected and inappropriately allocated escrow funds and forced place insurance charges-the Complaint is silent on where these actions occurred;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   (7) at some point, \"someone\" (Compl. \u00b6 60) forged Mrs. Robey's name on the Deed-the Complaint does not allege this act occurred in this District, nor that Chase is the actor responsible for the forgery;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   (8) the Deed was purportedly notarized by a notary in Miami, even though the Robeys never signed any loan documentation before a notary in Miami-again, even assuming this act occurred in this District, it was not an action by Chase;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   (9) Chase falsely declared the Robeys to be in default and commenced foreclosure proceedings in North Carolina-the foreclosure proceedings obviously commenced in North Carolina, and the Complaint is silent on from where Chase declared the Loan default; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   (10) Chase, its lawyers, the Trustee and the Clerk of Court pushed forward in the North Carolina foreclosure action, despite the myriad deficiencies and fraudulent Deed, until a foreclosure was consummated and the Robeys were evicted-these actions all occurred in North Carolina.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that Chase filed a fraudulent proof of claim in their Southern District of Florida bankruptcy case, but a careful review of the specifically-enumerated causes of action shows that this bankruptcy proceeding is not a central part of the claims-the bankruptcy is not mentioned even once in the enumerated counts' 73 paragraphs, while the North Carolina foreclosure proceedings and Chase's specific loan servicing activities (which occurred at unspecified locations, though the correspondence attached to the Complaint as Exhibit D suggests Jacksonville, Florida) are mentioned repeatedly. Moreover, Plaintiffs do not allege that Chase's fraudulent activity in the bankruptcy led to the foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   With this in mind, Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that a \"substantial part\" of Chase's acts or omissions giving rise to these specific causes of action occurred in this District. Chase's connection to this District vis-\u00e0-vis the claims in this case appears to be ancillary and indirect-for example, even if the Deed was fraudulently notarized in this District, and even if the fraudulent notarization was done at Chase's instruction (a finding that would require an inferential leap, based on the wishy-washy allegations in the Complaint), the notarization alone would not be the proximate cause of Plaintiffs' claims. Rather, the notarization is akin to the mortgage closings in\n   <em>\n    Forbes\n   </em>\n   ; the notarization may have been a necessary precondition to the foreclosure action, but it was not the proximate cause of and has no \"close nexus\" with Plaintiffs' claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%202959727\">\n    2008 WL 2959727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Other cases analyzing venue for claims like Plaintiffs' support this conclusion.
