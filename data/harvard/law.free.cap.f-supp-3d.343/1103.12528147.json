Curry County, a political subdivision of the State of New Mexico, owns the Curry County Fairgrounds (the \"Fairgrounds\"), which includes the Curry County Events Center (the \"Events Center\"), a multi-purpose sport and entertainment arena. Doc. 45 at \u00b6 5.

At all relevant times, Global Spectrum was the sole and exclusive operator of the Events Center.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, Global Spectrum was responsible\n   for booking events at the Events Center and managing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , security and crowd control.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8. For purposes of entering into contracts regarding the Fairgrounds and the Events Center, Global Spectrum acted as agent for Curry County, and was authorized to sign and enter into such contracts in Curry County's name, as an agent for Curry County. Doc. 45-3 at 20. At all relevant times, Kevin Jolley, who was an employee of Global Spectrum, served as the General Manager of the Events Center.

Doc. 45-4. BTL Entertainment is a partnership between Plaintiffs Shannon Jackson and Trendal Price. Doc 45. at \u00b6 1. The License Agreement states that Curry County \"owns\" the Event Center \"and has engaged [Global Spectrum] to manage and operate the Event Center\" on Curry County's behalf, and that Global Spectrum \"is authorized to enter into contracts on behalf of [Curry County] for use of space within the Event Center.\" Doc. 45-4.

The email message states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   It has just been brought to my attention that Global Spectrum has booked and signed a contract to lease the Curry County Events Center to Shannon Jackson and Trudle Price\n   <em>\n    [sic.]\n   </em>\n   where alcohol will be served. I have been advised by the sheriff's office that you have been notified that these two individuals have criminal records and both are presently on bond pertaining to a trafficking methamphetamine charge. As such, those two individuals cannot be involved in the sale or consumption of alcohol and cannot be on the premises where alcohol is being sold or consumed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   I am advised that the sheriff's office has previously told you that the last time that one of these individuals held a rap concern\n   <em>\n    [sic.]\n   </em>\n   in Curry County, one of them ended up shooting somebody. I certainly do not believe that these are the types of events that the Board of County Commissioners of Curry County contacted\n   <em>\n    [sic.]\n   </em>\n   with Global Spectrum to hold at the Curry County Events Center.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Global Spectrum, in addition to leasing the Events Center, has leased the Curry County liquor license. I am writing to notify you that with regard to tomorrow's concert, all laws pertaining to alcohol and alcohol consumption are to be strictly enforced by Global Spectrum. Global Spectrum and its agents and employees are to conduct themselves in such a manner as to not jeopardize or endanger Curry County's liquor license.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   It is my understanding that you have advised the Sheriff that based upon conversations with your legal representative and company representatives, that you do not believe that Global Spectrum is able to cancel the concert tomorrow night. Global Spectrum needs to make\n   sure that proper law enforcement is available to handle the crowd for this event and that the promoter pays for any additional expenses that may be needed. At the present time, please be assured that Curry County will not waive any of its rights under contract with Global Spectrum and expects that Global Spectrum will comply with all those terms of its contracts, as well as New Mexico laws.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Paragraph Number 3 on the general terms and conditions attached to your standard license agreement places the obligation on Global Spectrum to obtain and charge the licensee for all personnel, as may be required by Global Spectrum for security and others as otherwise needed. In addition, in Paragraph Number 12, it is your obligation to ensure that the licensee, and every person under its direction or contract, comply with all applicable laws with prior knowledge of the individuals who are putting on this concert, it is expected that Global Spectrum will ensure that those terms and conditions are fully complied with.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   An hour later, at approximately 4:30 p.m. Rick Hontz, Regional Vice President of Global Spectrum, sent an email message to Doerr, Jolley, Pyle, and others, regarding \"conference call to discuss hip hop show tomorrow night in Curry County.\" Doc. 45-6. In the email message, Hontz wrote, \"I think it would be beneficial if we all got on a call tomorrow morning at 9 AM to discuss this event.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Approximately 15 minutes later, Doerr sent an email message to Jolley, copied to Pyle, regarding \"Friday's Event at Events Center.\" Doc. 45-5. In the email message, Doerr wrote that he had just received a call from Hontz, regarding the telephone conference for the following morning, and that, immediately after that call, he spoke with Matthey Murray, Sheriff of Curry County, and Deputy Reeves, who advised that they had obtained \"the court order on the promoters [Jackson and Price] and informed [him] that the judge did not restrict either of the individuals from being on the premises where alcohol is served or consumed. These individuals' conditions of release only state that they themselves cannot consume alcohol.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Doerr further wrote: \"Would you please forward this to Rick [Hontz] and let him know that his concerns about the promoter not being allowed on the premises as a basis for cancelling the concert are not correct and I apologize for the same. I still think it would probably be in our best interest if we had a telephone conference call to discuss these matters.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The next morning, October 25, 2013, at 9:00 a.m., a conference call was held among Jolley, other representatives from Global Spectrum, Pyle, Murray, Reeves, and Doerr. Doc. 45 at \u00b6 27. The call focused on security for the concert that night.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28. In particular, Murray indicated that the Sheriff's Department would be providing law enforcement officers for the event, and Jolley advised that he had hired 30 people to staff the event, including 15 security guards and three staff to \"watch the bars,\" and that the security staff would be equipped with metal detecting wands to screen patrons entering the building.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 30-32. Later that morning, Murray confirmed that he would have his canine officer at the event with a drug sniffing dog, as well as signs advising the concertgoers of the presence of the dog. Doc. 45 at \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At the conclusion of the morning conference call, Pyle \"believed that all security concerns had been adequately addressed, and the concert was to be held as scheduled that evening,\" Doc. 45-1 at \u00b6 16, and Murray believed that the security measures\n   planned \"would be adequate to cover this concert and provide safety for the patrons,\" and that \"everyone was in agreement that the concert was proceeding as scheduled.\" Doc. 45-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 10-11. Nonetheless, \"[a]t the conclusion of the call, the Curry County representatives expressed their continued concerns regarding the ability to ensure safety for the public and property at the concert scheduled for that evening.\" Doc. 51-1 at \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Global Spectrums' employees, including Hontz, \"made the decision to cancel the concert based on the concerns expressed by the County representatives about the inability to ensure safety for the public and property at the event.\" Doc. 51-1 at \u00b6 7. An undated memo on Curry County Events Center letterhead addressed to BTL Entertainment, signed by Jolley as General Manager of the Events Center, states: \"The Southwest Jump Off Concert you had scheduled for Friday October 25, 2013 has been canceled. The cancellation of the show is due to Safety Concerns. We will return your deposit within 3 business days.\" Doc. 45-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Hontz advised Pyle via telephone call on the afternoon of October 25, 2013, that Global Spectrum had decided to cancel the concert. Doc. 45 at \u00b6 36. Pyle then advised Murray at 1:30 p.m. that same afternoon that Global Spectrum had cancelled the concert. Doc. 45 at \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Based on the cancellation of the concert, Plaintiffs Jackson, Price, and BTL Entertainment commenced the instant action, filing their Complaint to Recover Damages for Deprivation of Civil Rights. Doc. 1. Counts I through III of the Complaint assert violations of Plaintiff's federal constitutional rights by Pyle, Murray, and Global Spectrum, along with the companies that own Global Spectrum (Comcast Spectacor, and Global Spectrum of New Mexico, L.L.C.) (the \"Global Spectrum Defendants\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Counts IV through VI assert New Mexico state law causes of action against all Defendants, namely, Curry County, Pyle, Murray, and the Global Spectrum Defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants Curry County, Pyle, and Murray (\"Curry County Defendants\") filed the instant Summary Judgment Motion, seeking dismissal of all counts of the Complaint as against them. Doc. 45. Plaintiffs filed a response to the Motion, in which they argue that dismissal of their constitutional claims as against Curry County Defendants is not warranted but concede that Curry County Defendants cannot be held liable for any of the state law causes of action alleged in Counts IV, V, and VI. Doc. 52. Accordingly, Plaintiffs do not object to dismissal of those claims as to Curry County, Pyle, and Murray. The Court thus is left to determine whether Counts I through III of the Complaint remain viable as to Curry County Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate if \"the movant shows that there is no genuine\n   dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Montoya\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3851327\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/662/1152/#p1164\">\n    662 F.3d 1152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1164 (10th Cir. 2011). Despite this framing, Curry County Defendants' primary argument is that the undisputed evidence demonstrates that there was no state action involved in the cancellation of the concert, and that Plaintiffs' constitutional claims, brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section 1983, thus fail as a matter of law - an argument separate and apart from that of qualified immunity. Curry County Defendants' secondary argument - that Pyle and Murray did not violate any of Plaintiffs' clearly established constitutional rights, and that, consequently, neither Pyle nor Murray, nor Curry County itself, is subject to liability on Plaintiffs' constitutional claims - rests entirely on the premise that there was no state action involved in the cancellation of the concert. As set forth herein, the Court cannot agree that the undisputed evidence demonstrates that there was no state action involved in the cancellation of the concert. Because Curry County Defendants' entire Motion rests on this premise, their Motion must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    State Action\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In order to prevail on a constitutional claim brought pursuant to Section 1983, \"it is beyond cavil\" that the challenged conduct must constitute \"activity by a state.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

While noting that the record demonstrated that \"sometime prior to the concert [the director] learned that Contemporary Services would conduct the pat-down searches,\" the Court explained that \"it is well established that a state official's mere approval of or acquiescence to the conduct of a private party is insufficient to establish the nexus required for state action.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7418343\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/49/1442/#p1446\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, the Court considered the plaintiffs' reliance on the fact that uniformed officers of the University Department of Public Safety observed the pat-down searches. The Court noted that \"a number of courts have held that the mere presence of police officers does not transform the conduct of private parties into state action,\" and distinguished the case before it, where the University officers only observed the pat-down searches, from another case finding state action \"where the employees of a government entity actually enforced the challenged rules.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7418343\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/49/1442/#p1446\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7418343\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/49/1442/#p1446\">\n    at 1450-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically, the day before the concert, Doerr, on behalf\n   of Curry County, sent an email message to Jolley, General Manager of the Events Center and employee of Global Spectrum, expressly stating disapproval of the booking of the concert, and raising concerns about the ability to ensure safety at the concert. Doerr noted that Jackson and Price had criminal records for drug trafficking, that one of them had held a rap concert in Curry County at which he shot somebody, and that concerts such as this were not \"the types of events that the Board of County Commissioners of Curry County contacted\n   <em>\n    [sic.]\n   </em>\n   with Global Spectrum to hold at the Curry County Events Center.\" Doc. 45-5. The email specifically references the prospect of cancelling the concert and the consequences to Global Spectrum of not doing so, stating that Global Spectrum has advised that it is not \"able to cancel the concert tomorrow night,\" and immediately thereafter stating that \"Global Spectrum needs to make sure that proper law enforcement is available to handle the crowd for this event,\" and that \"Curry County will not waive any of its rights under contract with Global Spectrum and expects that Global Spectrum will comply with all those terms of its contracts, as well as New Mexico laws.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7418343\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/49/1442/#p1446\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Although soon realizing that he had misinformation regarding the terms of conditions of release of Jackson and Price, and thus that cancellation of the concert was not necessary based on the particular concern that it would not be lawful for the promoters themselves to be present for the concert because alcohol would be served on the premises, Doerr nonetheless continued to press for a conference call to discuss the matters that he had raised in his original email message. Doc. 45-5. Accordingly, on the morning of October 25, 2013, a conference call was held among Curry County representatives and Global Spectrum employees. Doc. 45 at \u00b6 27. The call focused on security for the concert that night.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28. While Pyle and Murray may have walked away from the call believing that the concert would proceed as planned, at the conclusion of the call, it is undisputed that \"the Curry County representatives expressed their continued concerns regarding the ability to ensure safety for the public and property at the concert scheduled for that evening.\" Doc. 51-1 at \u00b6 6. Within hours after the completion of the call, Global Spectrum's employees \"made the decision to cancel the concert based on the concerns expressed by the County representatives about the inability to ensure safety for the public and property at the event.\" Doc. 51-1 at \u00b6 7. Thus, it was directly based on the expression of concern by Curry County representatives that Jolley, in his capacity as General Manager of the Events Center, wrote BTL Entertainment a memo, on Curry County Events Center letterhead, advising that their concert had been cancelled - due to the very safety concerns expressed by Curry County representatives. Doc. 45-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The undisputed evidence thus demonstrates that the cancellation of the concert \"directly resulted\" from the specific actions of Curry County representatives in repeatedly expressing disapproval and concerns regarding the concert.\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7418343\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/49/1442/#p1446\">\n    49 F.3d at 1450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"To be sure,\" the evidence of a \"specific causal connection\" is sufficient to establish the nexus required to find state action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7418343\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/49/1442/#p1446\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, in contrast to\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   , the challenged decision was not made pursuant to a policy formulated by Global Spectrum, or any other private entity; rather, the evidence indicates that Curry County's own actions \"influenced the formulation or execution of this [decision].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7418343\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/49/1442/#p1446\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And while the Court in\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   noted that there was nothing in the record to suggest that the pat-down searches would have been conducted any differently had they been held at a privately-owned facility, here the converse is true: there is nothing in the record to suggest\n   that Global Spectrum would have decided to cancel the concert if the concert had been booked at a privately-owned facility at which Curry County's concerns had no applicability. In short, the evidence goes well beyond the existence of regulations, a contract, or approval or acquiescence, and instead demonstrates, as the nexus test requires, that Curry County \"is responsible for the specific conduct of which [Plaintiffs] complain[ ].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7418343\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/49/1442/#p1446\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7418343\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/49/1442/#p1446\">\n    at 1448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, Curry County can be held responsible for Global Spectrum's decision to cancel the concert.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7418343\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/49/1442/#p1446\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Qualified Immunity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As noted above, Curry County Defendants move for summary judgment based on qualified immunity. Perhaps assuming that the Court would agree with their contention that Global Spectrum's decision to cancel the concert was not state action, in support of their motion, Curry County Defendants fail to address or brief the relevant issue, namely, whether the decision to cancel the concert violated Plaintiffs' constitutional rights, and whether the constitutional rights asserted by Plaintiffs were clearly established.\n   <em>\n    Gross v. Pirtle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11119200\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/245/1151/#p1156\">\n    245 F.3d 1151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1156 (10th Cir. 2001). At this juncture, Curry County Defendants have not provided a properly supported basis for the Court to grant summary judgment to Pyle or Murray based on qualified immunity or to Curry County based on the theory that municipal liability cannot be established.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.N.M.L-R-Civ. 7.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Motion for Leave and Motion to Strike\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their Motion for Leave, requesting to supplement the record with certain videos and transcripts. The Court has reached its decision on the Summary Judgment Motion without reference to the videos and transcripts. The Motion for Leave thus is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Curry County Defendants filed their Motion to Strike, requesting that the Court strike the Rule 56(d) Declaration of Joseph P. Kennedy. Because the Court has determined that summary judgment is not warranted on Plaintiffs' constitutional claims at this juncture, the Court need not reach Plaintiffs' alternative request for additional discovery pursuant to Rule 56(d). Accordingly, the Court need not consider Mr. Kennedy's Declaration, and Curry County Defendants' Motion to Strike thus is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   There is a sufficiently close nexus between Curry County and Global Spectrum's decision to cancel the concert that the decision to cancel the concert may fairly be treated as state action. Because the decision to cancel the concert constitutes state action, the relevant issue is whether that decision violated Plaintiffs' clearly established constitutional rights. Curry County Defendants have not provided a properly supported motion for summary judgment addressing this issue. Accordingly, Curry County Defendants' request for summary judgment as to Counts I, II, and III must be denied. The parties agree, however, that Counts IV, V, and VI should be dismissed as to Curry County, Pyle, and Murray. For the reasons set forth above, Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave and Curry County Defendants' Motion to Strike are moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   (1) Curry County Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment Based Upon Qualified Immunity and Sovereign Immunity [Doc. 45] is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART, as follows: Counts IV, V, and VI are dismissed as to Curry County, Pyle, and Murray,\n   and Counts I, II and III remain viable as to all Defendants;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   (2) Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to Supplement Evidence in Opposition to the Curry County Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment Based Upon Qualified Immunity and Sovereign Immunity [Doc. 58] is found as moot; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   (3) Curry County Defendants' Motion to Strike Rule 56(d) Declaration of Joseph P. Kennedy [Doc. 64] is found as moot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Although the Court construes the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the Court will not consider those statements offered by Plaintiffs that amount to no more than characterizations or editorializing of the facts presented in the Curry County Defendants' Motion and conclusions that they seek the Court to draw from the facts.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Plaintiffs appear to have intentionally excluded Curry County from the list of Defendants against whom they allege their constitutional claims. The paragraphs contained within the counts alleging constitutional violations, however, includes allegations that, if proven, would amount to municipal liability on behalf of Curry County. For this reason, the Curry County Defendants construe the Complaint as alleging municipal liability claims against Curry County.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    The Global Spectrum Defendants filed a response to the Summary Judgment Motion \"solely to clarify and respond to certain facts set forth in the Curry County Defendants' Undisputed Material Facts.\" Doc. 51.
