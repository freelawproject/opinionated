For the reasons stated below, Plaintiff's motion (Docket No. 6) is\n     <em>\n      <strong>\n       <em>\n        denied\n       </em>\n      </strong>\n     </em>\n     .\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-9\">\n     <em>\n      <strong>\n       Background\n      </strong>\n     </em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-10\">\n     On November 20, 2018, Plaintiff filed a complaint seeking to bar the foreclosure sale of the Property scheduled for the\n     following day. Plaintiff alleged that she was not given proper notice of default, of her right to cure, or of foreclosure; she was not provided a copy of the original note and all original assignments; and the foreclosing entity lacked authority to foreclose, waived or forfeited the right to do so because of its inaction/conduct, and failed to comply with Massachusetts law. (Docket No. 1, at 6).\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-11\">\n     On November 21, 2018, Plaintiff filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order to bar the foreclosure sale scheduled that day. Plaintiff argued that SPS Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (\"Defendant\") failed to comply with\n     <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=209%20C.M.R.%2054\">\n      209 CMR 54\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .00 and ignored numerous requests for time to apply for a loan modification. (Docket No. 6, at 1). This Court denied that request and the Property was sold at a foreclosure auction on November 21, 2018. In denying Plaintiff's TRO, the Court agreed to hold a hearing and consider Plaintiff's motion as a motion for preliminary injunction. (Docket No. 7).\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-12\">\n     <em>\n      <strong>\n       Standard of Review\n      </strong>\n     </em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-13\">\n     In evaluating a motion for a preliminary injunction, the Court considers four factors: the likelihood the movant will succeed on the merits, whether the movant is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, the balance of equities, and whether an injunction is in the public interest.\n     <em>\n      Voice of the Arab World, Inc. v.
