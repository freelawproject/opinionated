For the reasons stated below, Plaintiff's motion (Docket No. 6) is <em><strong><em>denied</em></strong></em>.</p><p id=\"p-9\"><em><strong>Background</strong></em></p><p id=\"p-10\">On November 20, 2018, Plaintiff filed a complaint seeking to bar the foreclosure sale of the Property scheduled for the <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"7\" href=\"#p7\" id=\"p7\">*7</a>following day. Plaintiff alleged that she was not given proper notice of default, of her right to cure, or of foreclosure; she was not provided a copy of the original note and all original assignments; and the foreclosing entity lacked authority to foreclose, waived or forfeited the right to do so because of its inaction/conduct, and failed to comply with Massachusetts law. (Docket No. 1, at 6).</p><p id=\"p-11\">On November 21, 2018, Plaintiff filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order to bar the foreclosure sale scheduled that day. Plaintiff argued that SPS Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (\"Defendant\") failed to comply with <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=209%20C.M.R.%2054\">209 CMR 54</extracted-citation>.00 and ignored numerous requests for time to apply for a loan modification. (Docket No. 6, at 1). This Court denied that request and the Property was sold at a foreclosure auction on November 21, 2018. In denying Plaintiff's TRO, the Court agreed to hold a hearing and consider Plaintiff's motion as a motion for preliminary injunction. (Docket No. 7).</p><p id=\"p-12\"><em><strong>Standard of Review</strong></em></p><p id=\"p-13\">In evaluating a motion for a preliminary injunction, the Court considers four factors: the likelihood the movant will succeed on the merits, whether the movant is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, the balance of equities, and whether an injunction is in the public interest. <em>Voice of the Arab World, Inc. v. MDTV Medical News Now, Inc.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5650226\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/645/26/#p32\">645 F.3d 26</extracted-citation>, 32 (1st Cir. 2011). \"The party seeking the preliminary injunction bears the burden of establishing that these four factors weigh in its favor.\" <em>Esso Standard Oil Co. (Puerto Rico) v. Monroig-Zayas</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2782657\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/445/13/#p18\">445 F.3d 13</extracted-citation>, 18 (1st Cir. 2006). While all four factors must be weighed, the moving party's likelihood of success on the merits is \"the touchstone of the preliminary injunction inquiry.\" <em>Philip Morris, Inc. v. Harshbarger</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1615464\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/159/670/#p674\">159 F.3d 670</extracted-citation>, 674 (1st Cir. 1998). \"[I]f the moving party cannot demonstrate that he is likely to succeed in his quest, the remaining factors become matters of idle curiosity.\" <em>New Comm Wireless Servs., Inc. v. SprintCom, Inc.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9436350\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/287/1/#p9\">287 F.3d 1</extracted-citation>, 9 (1st Cir. 2002).</p><p id=\"p-14\"><em><strong>Mootness</strong></em></p><p id=\"p-15\">The doctrine of mootness requires \"that an actual controversy must be extant at all stages of the review, not merely at the time the complaint is filed.\" <em>Steffel v. Thompson</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177476\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/452/\">415 U.S. 452</extracted-citation>, 460 n.10, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177476\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/452/\">94 S.Ct. 1209</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177476\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/452/\">39 L.Ed.2d 505</extracted-citation> (1974). Thus, mootness is akin to \" 'the doctrine of standing set in a time frame.' \" <em>United States Parole Comm'n v.

Defendants have the heavy burden of establishing mootness. <em>See</em> <em>United States v. W.T.

The burden is a heavy one.\" (quotation marks and citation omitted) ). Thus, for a court to dismiss a case as moot, it must be \"absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.\" <em>United States v.
