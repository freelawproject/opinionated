INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Beaux-Arts landmark building at the corner of Fifth Avenue and East Fifty-Fifth Street in Manhattan provides a temporary home for guests of the exclusive St. Regis New York Hotel. Beginning in 2006, individuals were invited to become part of what was known as the St. Regis Residence Club: for the average price of about $455,000, members of this exclusive club could own an interest in \"Club Units\"-luxury suites located on a floor that was specially reserved for members of the club, and in which those members were entitled to spend a certain amount of time annually. The interests sold well for approximately two years. In 2008, however, when the country entered an economic recession, sales began to plummet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In response, the entities that controlled the St. Regis New York Hotel decided to take the Residence Club in a different direction-without the knowledge or input of its members. Rather than struggling to sell what was, in effect, a luxury timeshare during the greatest economic downturn in\n   recent memory, they abandoned their efforts to sell the Club Interests, and, instead, decided to rent out the Club Units to the public for overnight use. This proved successful, drawing an influx of short-term renters to the Club Units and reducing their resale value, much to the chagrin of the Residence Club's members, who assert that it reduced the resale value of their Units.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs, who are members of the Residence Club, bring this action alleging breach of contract and unjust enrichment. A subgroup of the Plaintiffs also seek to rescind their purchase agreements. Defendants now move to dismiss all of Plaintiffs' claims. For the reasons set forth below, the motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Fifth and Fifty-Fifth Residence Club\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs are the purchasers of fractional timeshare interests in a landmark building on the corner of Fifth Avenue and East 55th Street in Manhattan. First Am. Compl. (\"FAC\") (Dkt. No. 41) \u00b6 1. The building is the site of the St. Regis New York Hotel (the \"St. Regis\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In 2006, Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, LLC (\"Starwood\"), as part of a joint venture with other entities, filed a condominium map on the St. Regis, dividing it into four components: the \"Hotel Unit,\" the \"Retail Unit,\" the \"Suite Units,\" and the \"Club Units.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. This action concerns the Club Units and the Suite Units, as they relate to ownership of the Club Units.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Suite Units and the Club Units are each \"governed by an offering plan filed with the New York State Department of Law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. The offering is known as the Fifth and Fifty-Fifth Residence Club (the \"St. Regis Residence Club\" or \"Residence Club\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1. The St. Regis Residence Club, New York, Inc. is the Residence Club Sponsor (the \"Sponsor\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"The Suite Unit offering allows Defendants to market and sell Suite Units, which are wholly-owned condominiums ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. The Club Unit offering, governed by the Fractional Offering Plan for the Residence Club (the \"Plan\") (Dkt. Nos. 41-7 through 41-22), allows Defendants to market and sell fractional \"Club Interests\" in the Club Units. Each purchaser of a Club Interest owns a 1/13\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   undivided portion of a specific Club Unit as a tenant-in-common with all other owners of Club Interests in the same Club Unit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 130. When a purchaser acquires a Club Interest in a Club Unit, the purchaser is entitled, subject to certain terms and conditions, to \"use and occupy a Club Unit for four weeks annually.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Persons who \"hold fee title, of record, to one or more Club Interests\" are known as \"Club Members.\" Plan, at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs purchased Club Interests pursuant to a standardized Purchase Agreement (the \"Purchase Agreement\") and the 748-page Plan, which was expressly made part of each Purchase Agreement. FAC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 131. As set forth below, Plaintiffs assert that the St. Regis Residence Club is a \"fractured\" offering-meaning that \"(a) the developer failed to sell many of the units, and (b) the value of the units has collapsed\"-because of Defendants' conduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Conversion of Suite Units Into Club Interests\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants began selling Club Interests in August 2006, and sales continued at a \"steady pace\" through 2007.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. In mid-2007 and 2008-including shortly after the collapse of Bear Stearns and the beginning of the recession-Defendants increased the inventory of Club Units (and therefore, of Club Interests), by converting a number of the Suite Units into Club Units.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 134. Although such conversion is permitted by the Plan, Plaintiffs maintain that Defendants were acting in bad faith to \"secretly flood\" the Residence Club with new inventory that they never intended to sell.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5, 127. According to Plaintiffs, \"but for\" these conversions, \"\n   <em>\n    the offering would have been fully sold by the middle of 2008\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 135(a) (emphasis in the original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Abandonment of Sales Efforts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that Defendants took other steps to impede the success of the offering. First, Defendants increased the price of the Club Interests and Club Members' annual fees. Id. \u00b6 142. Then, in mid-2009, they withdrew a seller financing option that had previously been offered to purchasers, and closed the Residence Club sales office.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants sold only a few Club Interests over the course of the next six and a half years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Plaintiffs, Defendants abandoned their sales efforts in order to pursue a large-scale rental program that, while detrimental to Plaintiffs' interests, has been lucrative for Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Rental Program\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In or around 2009, Defendants began renting to the general public the approximately 100 unsold Club Interests over which they retained ownership.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 140. Although Plaintiffs concede that they knew the Sponsor would offer \"some rentals,\" they maintain that the Plan \"made clear that these [rentals] were a very limited aspect of the fractional offering,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 152 (citing Plan, Club Reservation Procedures, at 90), and that they \"reasonably expected that access to the Club would be restricted to Club Members and\n   <em>\n    their\n   </em>\n   permitted users\"-not the Sponsor's tenants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 149 (quoting Plan, Special Risk Factors, at 3 \u00a7 1(c) (\"[u]se of the Club Units is limited solely to the personal, recreational and other use by a Club Member and Club Member's Permitted Users.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs filed the initial complaint in this action on December 5, 2016. Dkt. No. 1. The FAC was filed on March 6, 2017. Defendants seek to dismiss the FAC's allegations of breach of express and implied contract (Counts One and Three), Rescission (Count Six), and Unjust Enrichment (Count Seven).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs submitted supplemental authority in support of their opposition to the motion on August 1, 2018, Dkt.

For the reasons set forth below, the motion to dismiss Counts One and Three is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Plaintiffs Insufficiently Allege Breach of Express Contract Provision in Connection with Count One\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiffs' claim for breach of an express contract provision in connection with Count One cannot proceed because they have not identified any express provision imposing an obligation to sell Club Units. Plaintiffs allege that the Sponsor \"materially breached express and/or implied terms of the Purchase Agreement and Club Offering Plan by abandoning any effort to sell Club Interests.\" FAC \u00b6 191. They contend in their opposition that paragraph 132 of the FAC identifies the contractual provisions allegedly breached, namely the following: the \"Introduction\" at page 12, which provides that the \"Sponsor anticipates that twelve (12) Club Interests will be sold in each Club Unit\"; the section entitled \"General\" at page 103, which provides that, \"The Offering Plan does not knowingly omit any material fact or knowingly contain any untrue statement of any material fact. Sponsor believes that the Offering Plan contains a fair summary of the material provisions of the documents referred to in the Offering Plan ....\"; and the \"Certification of Sponsor and Principals\" at pages 733 to 734, which provides that \"We jointly and severally certify that the offering plan does ... not omit any material fact ....\" Pl.'s Opp., at 10; FAC \u00b6 132.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   None of these provisions is an express covenant requiring the Sponsor to sell a specific quantity of Club Interests. The representation that the Sponsor \"anticipates\" that twelve Club Interests will be sold in each Club Unit is a statement of expectation, not a commitment sufficient to impose an obligation to sell all twelve interests. Moreover, Plaintiffs identify no provision that requires the Sponsor to continue its sales efforts indefinitely, until a certain time, or until a certain number of Club Interests were sold. Plaintiffs argue that the Plan \"never once states that Defendants retain the right to abandon sales efforts.\" The absence of such a provision does not amount to an affirmative prohibition on abandoning sales efforts, however. Lacking express language prohibiting Defendants from abandoning sales efforts, the Court will not read such a provision\n   into the Plan. Accordingly, Defendants' motion to dismiss the claim for breach of an express contractual provision to sell all Club Interests, or a sufficient number of Club Interests to make the offering viable, must be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Plaintiffs Sufficiently Allege Breach of Implied Covenant in Connection with Count One\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Significantly for purposes of this motion, however, Plaintiffs allege that the Purchase Agreement and Plan include both an \"express\n   <em>\n    and/or implied\n   </em>\n   \" promise by the Sponsor \"to timely sell all of the Club Interests ... or at least a sufficient number of Club Interests to make this fractional offering viable.\" FAC \u00b6 188 (emphasis added). Although, as described above, Plaintiffs fail to allege that an express covenant to sell Club Interests was breached-or even that such a covenant existed-Plaintiffs sufficiently allege that the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was breached.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Under New York law, all contracts contain an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the course of performance.\n   <em>\n    511 W. 232nd Owners Corp. v.

Plaintiffs have done so here as well. Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Jennifer\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs plead that, based on the terms of the Purchase Agreement and Plan, they reasonably expected that the Sponsor \"would endeavor to timely sell all Club Interests, or at least a sufficient number to make the St. Regis Residence Club viable,\" and that it failed to do so. FAC \u00b6 189. According to the FAC, the Sponsor, acting in bad faith, engaged in conduct that had the effect of destroying or injuring a viable offering. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that the Sponsor's conduct-including the alleged abandonment of sales efforts-\"frustrated Plaintiffs' rights and reasonable expectations under the contract, deprived Plaintiffs of the value of their Club Interests, and allowed Defendants ... to profit at Plaintiffs' expense.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 190;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 146-147 (the \"ongoing program of halting sales in favor of renting the unsold units\" has \"destroyed the viability of the St. Regis Residence Club.\"). Plaintiffs also allege that the resulting \"massive inventory of nightly rentals\" hinders the viability of the offering because it allows the public to enjoy the same benefits as Club Members without the associated burdens of ownership-including the purchase price, annual maintenance fees, and other ownership expenses that Club Members are obligated to pay regardless of whether they actually make use of the Residence Club. FAC \u00b6 146.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Furthermore, the facts pleaded in the FAC support the allegation that the Sponsor failed to exercise good faith and deal fairly in satisfying that duty by, among other things, abandoning sales efforts and creating financial disincentives for prospective purchasers, including raising the price of Club Interests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jennifer\n   </em>\n   , 98 N.Y.2d at 154,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"282506\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/98/144/#p153\">\n    746 N.Y.S.2d 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"282506\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/98/144/#p153\">\n    773 N.E.2d 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"By spelling out the basis for their claim that the sponsor failed to exercise good faith and deal fairly in fulfilling\n   the terms and promises contemplated by the offering plan, plaintiffs pleaded a valid cause of action for breach of contract.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As Defendants observe, there are many distinctions between this case and\n   <em>\n    Jennifer\n   </em>\n   . \"In Jennifer, the sponsor converted a rent-regulated apartment house to a co-op and sold less than 38% of its shares to tenants who 'surrendered their rights pursuant to the Rent Stabilization Code ... but pa[id] more in monthly maintenance and cooperative loan payments than they had paid in rent as tenants.'

Here, by contrast, Plaintiffs allege that the Sponsor sold over 80% of its interests. FAC \u00b6 137. And, rather than the cooperative interests of formerly rent-stabilized tenants, the Club Interests here are timeshares in \"luxury units\" in which owners spend only a fraction of the year. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 1, 28-126, 151-52. The Club Units represent only a portion of the property located at the St. Regis hotel-the property is also supported by the hotel, and the Suite Units. These are meaningful distinctions, but the ultimate question whether the Sponsor's failure to sell 20% of the Club Interests actually undermined the \"viability\" of the offering is not before the Court at this time-the only question is whether Plaintiffs have adequately pleaded that the Sponsor had an implied duty to sell sufficient units to make the offering viable-they have.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   However, the Court declines to expand the holding of\n   <em>\n    Jennifer\n   </em>\n   , as Plaintiffs suggest, to imply an obligation that the Sponsor sell \"all\" of the Club Interests.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 189.\n   <em>\n    Jennifer\n   </em>\n   sustained a claim related to an implied obligation to sell a sufficient number of units.\n   <em>\n    Jennifer\n   </em>\n   does not support the contention that the Sponsor was under an obligation to sell all of the Club Units or Interests.\n   <em>\n    Bauer v.

Indeed, the Plan contains a defined term for \"Unsold Club Interests,\" Plan at 25, and it uses the term repeatedly to advise purchasers of the prospect that the Sponsor will not be able to sell all Club Interests, and to identify risks associated with that possibility. For example, the Plan states clearly that the \"Sponsor may have a large inventory of Unsold Club Interests.\" Plan, Special Risk Factors, at 3 \u00a7 1(a). The Plan identifies the potential impact of the Sponsor's failure to sell all Club Interests.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Plan at 3 \u00a7 1(a), 2 (\"Any Club Member attempting to rent or resell a Club Interest would have to compete, at a substantial disadvantage, with Sponsor in the rental and sale of its Unsold Club Interests ....

Purchasers were specifically advised that units should not be purchased with an expectation of resale at a profit.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Plan at 3 \u00a7 1(a) (\"The purchase of a Club Interest should be based upon its value as a vacation experience, for spending leisure time, or for other personal use, and not considered for purposes of acquiring an appreciating investment or with an expectation that the Club Interest may be rented or resold at a profit.\"). This express language does not permit the implication of an obligation on the part of the Sponsor to support the resale value of the Club Interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiffs do not expressly claim breach of such a duty, FAC \u00b6 189, but the complaint could be read to suggest that Plaintiffs believe that the offering would not be \"viable\" unless it resulted in sales sufficient for their Club Interests to maintain their value, or to appreciate in value. Such a foundation for their surviving claim cannot be sustained in the face of the clear statements in the Plan advising them of the illiquidity of the Club Interests, and that they should not be acquired for investment purposes. The Court cannot conclude here precisely what constitutes a \"viable\" offering in this context. However, given the clear cautionary language contained in the Plan regarding resales, the Court does conclude that Plaintiffs cannot reasonably have expected that the offering would only be viable if the Sponsor's sales were sufficient to support the price and resale value of their Club Interests. Increasing, or even stable, valuation of the acquired Club Interests was not the fruit of any Plaintiff's contracted purchase of a Club Interest; it was \"its value as a vacation experience, for spending leisure time, or for other personal use ....\" Plan at 3 \u00a7 1(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Plaintiffs Insufficiently Allege Breach of Express Contract Provision in Connection with Count Three\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiffs' claim that the Sponsor breached an express contract provision in connection with Count Three must fail because the negative covenants concerning Club Unit rentals that are identified by\n   Plaintiffs do not prohibit the Sponsor from renting Club Units to overnight tenants. To the contrary, the offering documents provide clear warning that the Sponsor may rent Club Units owned by it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In the FAC section entitled \"Third Claim for Relief,\" Plaintiffs fail to identify any express terms of the Plan that they allege were breached. FAC at 65-66. In their opposition to the motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs identify a number of provisions that, they contend, expressly limit the Sponsor's ability to rent out the Club Units. Only one of those provisions contains an express negative covenant concerning rentals, however. It states that \"[u]se of the Club Units is limited solely to the personal, recreational and other use by a Club Member and Club Member's Permitted Users.\" Plan, 3 \u00a7 1(c). As a result, they argue, use of the Club Units by individuals who are not Club Members\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   or Club Members' Permitted Users violates the terms of the Plan. But the Plan's definition of Permitted Users is expansive enough to permit overnight renters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \"Permitted Users\" are defined in the Plan as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   any of Declarants, Sponsor, Suite Sponsor, Unit Owners, the Condominium Board, the Club Board, Club Members (and any individual(s) designated by the Primary Owner who may make reservations of Club Weeks for a particular Club Interest) and their successors and assigns, and all officers, stockholders, principals, partners, employees, members, agents (including selling and managing agents),\n   <em>\n    guests\n   </em>\n   , exchangers, contractors,\n   <em>\n    tenants, invitees\n   </em>\n   , Permitted Mortgagees, invitees and licensees of any of the foregoing who has permission to use a Unit and/or the common Elements, subject to the terms of the Condominium Documents and the Club Documents, whether written or oral, granted by a Unit Owner or Club Member, the condominium Board, the Condominium Documents, the Club Board, the Club Documents, or the Offering Plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plan, Definitions, at 23 (emphases added). Thus, guests, tenants, and invitees of the Sponsor and Club Members are Permitted Users. This provision does not prohibit short term rentals of the Units-indeed, Plaintiffs acknowledge that such rentals by the Sponsor are permitted; Plaintiffs allege that \"Defendants' status as the owner of unsold inventory arguably makes them a Club Member entitled to rent like any other Club Member ....\" FAC \u00b6 158.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   However, Plaintiffs compare this to another provision of the Plan, which states that \"[t]he\n   <em>\n    Suite Units\n   </em>\n   may be used for ... transient hotel purposes,\" to conclude that the Plan contemplates that the Suite Units-and not the Club Units-were intended to be used for \"transient hotel purposes,\" like overnight rentals.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4040432,4034938\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/125/534/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 150 (citing Plan, Introduction, at 5 \u00a7 13(b) (emphasis added) ). If it were otherwise, Plaintiffs contend, the language regarding transient hotel purposes would have appeared in the provision about the use of Club Units. But the Court cannot convert language permitting the use of Suite Units for hotel purposes into an express covenant prohibiting the use of Club Units for that purpose. Because the express provisions of the Plan identified by Plaintiffs does not restrict use by overnight renters, Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for\n   breach of this express provision of the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The other provisions of the Plan that Plaintiffs point to as a basis for their claim for an express contractual breach also do not support the claim. Plaintiffs identify the provision of the Plan stating that \"[e]ach Club Interest includes the right to confirm the reservation of seven (7) consecutive days\" and \"the right to use a maximum of fifteen (15) weekdays and six (6) weekend days ... fox a maximum total of twenty one (21) days.\" FAC \u00b6 149 (citing Plan, Introduction, at 12). Given these limitations, Plaintiffs argue that the Plan makes clear that the use of the Club Units is \"strictly regimented\" and not intended to be used for unlimited nightly rentals. However, these limitations do not specifically constrain the Sponsor (or any other Club Member) from renting Units.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs point to paragraph 151 of the FAC, which cites to several provisions prohibiting the subdivision of Club Units. Paragraph 151 cites the Plan's Special Risk Factors and Introduction, which provide, respectively, that \"[u]nder the Club Declaration, each Club Unit included shall remain undivided,\" and \"Club Members are strictly prohibited from subdividing their Club Interest.\" FAC \u00b6 151 (citing Plan, Special Risk Factors, at 4 \u00a7 17; Plan, Introduction, at 13).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs characterize these provisions as protection \"against further timesharing.\" Pl.'s Opp., at 10. Again, however, the provision does not expressly prohibit the Sponsor from renting Units to overnight \"guests\" and \"invitees.\" Such overnight rentals cannot reasonably be considered to constitute subdivisions of the unit interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. Plaintiffs Do Not Sufficiently Allege Breach of Implied Covenant in Connection with Count Three\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that they \"could not reasonably have anticipated based on the Offering Plan, that Sponsor would retain a significant number of shares which it would itself rent on daily basis at market rates.\" Pls.' Opp., at 9 (citing FAC \u00b6\u00b6 155-57, 133-36). Plaintiffs allege that Defendants are \"frustrating\" Plaintiffs' rights under the Plan by engaging in those rentals. According to Plaintiffs, Defendants are\n   \"making it impossible for [Plaintiffs] to resell their shares while increasing their maintenance payments\" due to the increased wear and tear from the overnight tenants.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4040432,4034938\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/125/534/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing FAC \u00b6\u00b6 127, 142, 147);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 127 (\"This rental program has suppressed the value of Plaintiffs' Units. Adding insult to injury, Defendants have foisted the costs of the increased wear and tear caused by the rental program on Plaintiffs in the form of increased annual fees.\"). Plaintiffs have also pleaded that the rental program suppresses the value of the Club Interests, FAC \u00b6 127, and makes it difficult for Plaintiffs to access their Club Interests because they have to compete with renters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 148.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   While the Court has found that Plaintiffs have adequately pleaded an implied covenant on the part of the Sponsor to sell a sufficient number of Club Interests, Plaintiffs have not adequately alleged the existence of an independent duty not to rent units. To conclude that such an implied covenant existed here would run in the face of the express provisions of the Offering Plan that reserved to the Sponsor the right to rent units. Plaintiffs concede that the \"Offering Plan opens with a reference to Sponsor's rental ... of its Unsold Club Interests,\" that Plaintiffs knew \"there would be some rentals,\" and that the Sponsor, as owner of unsold Interests, is arguably \"entitled to rent like any other Club Member.\" FAC \u00b6\u00b6 152, 155, 158. The Plan clearly anticipates that the Sponsor will rent Club Interests.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Plan at 3 \u00a7 1(a) (\"Any Club Member attempting to rent or resell a Club Interest would have to compete, at a substantial disadvantage, with Sponsor in the rental and sale of its Unsold Club Interests.\"). The Court cannot, therefore, find in the Plan an implied covenant for the Sponsor not to rent units-such an implied term is contradicted by the contract's express language.

Defendants argue that \"[t]he Plan's definition of 'Purchasers' implements a right to rescind afforded under the Martin Act regulations to 'purchasers under contract.' \" Defs.' Br. at 20 (citing 13 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 24.5(a)(5) ). Defendants argue that their proposed construction of the contract is bolstered by the limited nature of the remedy available for those who opt to rescind; they are entitled to the return of their deposit-a remedy which, they reasonably argue, would not redress all harm to a person who has already closed their purchase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Defendants' argument that the language is clear and unambiguous, however, is foiled by an article-the word \"a\" in the definition of Purchaser. Unlike the language in the Martin Act regulation which Defendants cite, the definition of \"Purchaser\" here does not refer to a \"purchaser under contract\"-which in this context the Court might readily construe to be an unambiguous reference to a purchaser who is subject to the terms of a contract that has not yet closed. Instead, the definition refers to \"a purchaser of a Club Interest under a Purchase Agreement.\" This language, which introduces the article \"a\" and uses the defined term \"Purchase Agreement,\" rather than a generic reference to a contract, permits the alternative construction forwarded by Plaintiffs-namely that the term refers to any person who purchased a Club Interest pursuant to a Purchase Agreement with the Sponsor, as opposed to a purchaser from a third party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   When viewed in the context of the document as a whole, the term \"Purchaser\" is used variably in ways that support both Plaintiffs' and Defendants' proposed construction of the term. As an illustration, the Plan states that \"each Purchaser of a Club Interest will acquire a 4/52 undivided interest in a Club Unit, as tenant-in-common with all other Purchasers of Club Interests in such Club Unit.\" Plan at 12. This provision makes little sense if the term \"Purchaser\" is defined, as Defendants argue, to refer only to people currently under contract to buy a unit, but not to people who have closed the sale. While this may not have been the intent of the parties or the scrivener, as drafted, the text of the contract permits alternative constructions of the term \"Purchaser\" as used. Since the term as used here is ambiguous, the Court cannot dismiss the rescission claim on this ground.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Court fully appreciates Defendants' argument that the first sentence of the paragraph establishing the rescission right should inform the analysis of the contractual provision. Defendants present the provision as one that clearly relates solely to rights in the event of an exercise by the Sponsor of its expressly reserved right to revise sales terms \"prior to the First Closing of a Club Interest.\" Plan at 103. This is a valid argument, but one that is weakened by the contract's use of the defined term quoted above. For the \"First Closing of a Club Interest\" does not mean the first closing of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   Club Interest or Club Unit. Instead, it is defined as \"the Closing of Title with respect to the first Club Interest\n   <em>\n    in a particular\n   </em>\n   Club Unit.\" Plan at 22. Because of the use of this defined term, rather than natural language, the Sponsor's reserved right described in the paragraph can be argued to apply not only once at the outset of sales, but a multitude of times as it begins sales in each separate particular Club Unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Defendants also argue that the rescission claim must be dismissed because the preconditions for exercising the right to rescind have not been satisfied. As noted above, there must have been \"a substantial amendment to the Offering Plan that materially and adversely affects Purchasers\" to trigger the right to rescind. Plan, at 103. Here, the parties dispute whether the complaint sufficiently pleads the existence of such substantial amendments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, the alleged substantial amendments are (i) the conversions of Suite Units into Club Units and changes in expense allocations, which were endorsed formal amendments to the Plan-namely, the Seventh and Eighth Amendments; and (ii) the Sponsor's decision to abandon sales and instead pursue a large-scale rental program, which Plaintiffs classify as a \"\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   \" amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 201.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Defendants argue that these changes do not constitute \"substantive or material revisions\" sufficient to satisfy the rescission provision's preconditions. Defs.' Br. at 21. In particular, Defendants argue that the Plan \"plainly contemplates rescission only based on amendments that have been 'duly filed,' \"-which excludes the\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   amendments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The rescission provision provides that \"\n   <em>\n    [a]ll substantive or material revisions will be contained in a duly filed amendment to the Offering Plan\n   </em>\n   . If there is a substantial amendment to the Offering Plan that materially and adversely affects Purchasers, except as otherwise provided herein, Purchasers will have a right of rescission.\" Defs.'

It is reasonable to construe the plain language of the rescission provision to limit the right of rescission to Purchasers who have been subjected to \"substantive or material revisions\" that are contained in duly filed amendments. Plaintiffs do not propose another reading of this clause, and the Court does not find that the language is capable of a different interpretation. Accordingly, the Court grants the motion to dismiss with respect to rescission rights allegedly derived from the\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   amendments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Defendants' other substantive argument rests on selective quotation from the relevant contractual provision, and falls on the back of the ambiguous language of the complete text. Defendants argue that a \"substantial amendment\" for purposes of the rescission provision is one that \"materially and adversely affects Purchasers,\n   <em>\n    except as otherwise provided herein\n   </em>\n   ....\" Defendants then point to provisions in the Plan granting the Sponsor the \"right to create and add additional Club Units ... by subdividing ... and/or converting the Suite Units\" and noting that \"it is anticipated that the methods of allocation of [expenses] will be periodically adjusted.\" Plan, at 7-8 \u00a7 20(e), 42. Defendants argue that because of the fact that unit conversion and expense allocation are provided for elsewhere in the Plan, those actions cannot constitute substantial amendments that trigger the right to rescind. This argument is not implausible as presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   However, Defendants' argument rests on selective quotation from the contract. The full clause of the contractual provision at issue reads as follows: \"If there is a substantial amendment to the Offering Plan that materially and adversely affects Purchasers,\n   <em>\n    except as otherwise provided herein,\n   </em>\n   Purchasers will have a right of rescission for a period of fifteen (15) days ....\" In the complete text, the clause \"except as otherwise provided herein\" can be read to caveat the language that follows it-in other words, that the Purchasers will have a right of rescission for a period of time, except as otherwise provided in the agreement. This is a more natural construction of that language in context than Defendants' suggestion that the clause caveats what constitutes a material and adverse effect on Purchaser. Defendants' argument, which rests on its selective quotation from the contract, does not provide sufficient basis to dismiss this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

On October 28, 2015, Starwood announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to spin off its vacation ownership businesses, including VVO and the Sponsor, and to then merge these spun-off entities with a subsidiary of ILG, Merger Sub (the \"Spin-Off/Merger\").\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 25. The Spin-Off/Merger was completed by May 2016 and ILG became the owner of the Sponsor and its unsold Club Interests.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Defendants ILG, VVO, VSE, and Merger sub are referred to collectively in the FAC as \"ILG-Vistana.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 26. Defendant Marriott acquired Starwood in 2016.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 20. While these connections explain why the Non-Sponsor Defendants were named in this action, there is no factual basis from which the Court can discern that they were unjustly enriched.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    Because the unjust enrichment claim is dismissed on this ground, the Court need not address Defendants' remaining arguments-namely, that the unjust enrichment claim is conclusory, was released against the relevant defendants, and that it is untimely.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
