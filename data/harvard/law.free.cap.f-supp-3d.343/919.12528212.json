M. Pai # 2055, Deputy Steven Forsyth # 874, Deputy Colin Mason # 461, Deputy Kenneth Shelton # 1021, Deputy Reid Harris # 238, Deputy S. Barry # 828, and Deputy C.

(ECF No. 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After carefully considering the parties' briefing and for the reasons set forth below, the Court hereby GRANTS Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. (ECF No. 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that, on April 5, 2014, officers of the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department made a warrantless entry into her home and used excessive force against her while arresting her 18-year-old son in her home. (ECF No. 15 \u00b6\u00b6 23-59.) Plaintiff alleges she was arrested on April 5, 2014, and then released from the Sacramento County Jail the following day, April 6, 2014. (ECF No. 15 \u00b6\u00b6 23, 85.) On April 6, 2016, Plaintiff filed suit\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1.) The Court dismissed her suit with leave to amend, (ECF No. 3), and granted her motion to appoint counsel, (ECF No. 11). Plaintiff, now represented by counsel, filed her First Amended Complaint, (ECF No. 15), asserting 11 claims for violations of her constitutional rights pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" \u00a7 1983\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants moved to dismiss. (ECF No. 32.) Defendants argue that ten of Plaintiff's 11 claims are time-barred because Plaintiff filed her original complaint one day after the two-year statute of limitations expired. (ECF No. 32-1 at 9.) Defendants alternatively argue that Plaintiff fails to state a claim for each of her 11 claims for other reasons. (ECF No. 32-1.) Plaintiff opposes Defendants' motion to dismiss as to claims 1-10, arguing the limitations\n   period was tolled until her April 6, 2014 release from Sacramento County Jail. (ECF No. 38 at 5-6.) Plaintiff does not oppose dismissal of claim 11 for malicious prosecution. (ECF No. 38 at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff then served discovery on Defendants, including a request for the county to disclose information related to a juvenile court arrest warrant for Plaintiff's son that has been sealed by the state superior court. (ECF No. 43 at 2, 4.) Defendants moved to stay discovery arguing that the requests for discovery \"generate motions practice\" by \"raising difficult questions involving the Supremacy Clause, federalism, and comity\" which \"may be entirely mooted by [D]efendants' still pending motion to dismiss.\" (ECF No. 43 at 2.) Plaintiff opposed on the basis that Defendants' motion to dismiss will not dispose of the case entirely because (i) the motion likely will not be granted, (ii) if it were, Plaintiff would probably be given leave to amend, and (iii) Defendants' statute of limitation argument is frivolous. (ECF No. 43 at 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Magistrate Judge granted Defendant's motion to stay, finding Defendants' motion to dismiss may result in all remaining claims being dismissed as time-barred and is therefore \"potentially dispositive\" of the case. (ECF No. 48 at 3.) Plaintiff requests reconsideration of that order. (ECF No. 49.) Defendants oppose. (ECF No. 50.) For reasons set forth below, the Court grants Defendants' motion to dismiss and denies as moot Plaintiff's motion to reconsider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Furthermore,\n   <em>\n    Elliott\n   </em>\n   is factually distinguishable from the instant case because Plaintiff spent one night in county jail while the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Elliott\n   </em>\n   remained in uninterrupted custody from the time of his arrest until he was convicted and sent to state prison.

Because the stay was not a term of imprisonment in a state prison, her claims were not tolled while she was in the Sacramento County Jail. Thus, the Court finds Plaintiff's \u00a7 1983 claims stemming from her arrest were not statutorily tolled under \u00a7 352.1(a). The statute of limitations for Plaintiff's \u00a7 1983 claims ended on April 5, 2016. Accordingly, the Court dismisses with prejudice Plaintiff's claims filed April 6, 2016 as untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
