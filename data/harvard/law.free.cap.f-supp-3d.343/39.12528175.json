The Court will only briefly address arguments raised by Plaintiffs that are distinct from those addressed in the Lead Case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In support of their Contracts Clause claim, Plaintiffs rely on a Memorandum of Understanding executed on November 18, 1982 and a purported oral side deal pertaining to employees who retire on or after January 1, 1983.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 75 at 8-10. No reasonable finder of fact could conclude the existence of such a side deal because it was never memorialized in any agreement, including the 1982 Memorandum of Understanding or any of the CBAs at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 75-15 at 44. Indeed, the Memorandum of Understanding, by its plain terms, a memorandum of the parties' understanding, makes no mention of pertaining to those who retire on or after January 1, 1983, and nothing about premium contribution rates in retirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9368322\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/322/139/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As discussed in detail in the Lead Case, ordinary principles of contract interpretation require the Court to conclude that none of the CBAs at issue guaranteed a perpetually fixed premium contribution rate into retirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    M &amp; G Polymers USA, LLC v.

While the CBAs at issue all provide that retirees have the right to continue receiving health insurance through the NYSHIP, they are all silent as to the premium contribution rate to be paid by retirees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Serafino v. City of Hamtramck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=707%20Fed.%20Appx.%20345\">\n    707 Fed.

This conclusion is further supported by the legislation passed in 1983 providing that the State would continue to pay the full premium for pre-January 1, 1983 retirees. If retirees had a contractually vested perpetual right to the same contribution rates in effect at the time of their retirement, there would have been no need for an affirmative legislative carve-out specifically applicable to them. Finally, as set forth in the Lead Case, the undisputed facts establish that, even if Plaintiffs had a vested right to a perpetual fixed contribution rate, the small increase to the contribution rate was not a substantial impairment and the increase was reasonable and necessary in furtherance of an important government interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Donohue v.

The Sixth Circuit, however, recently reversed the district court, holding that language providing that, \"[u]pon the death of a retiree, the Company will continue coverage for the spouse and dependent children for their lifetime,\" neither indicated nor even implied that the agreement provided healthcare to retirees until their deaths; instead, it meant that the agreement provided \"lifetime healthcare for surviving spouses and dependents but not for the retirees themselves.\"\n   <em>\n    Fletcher v.

Plaintiffs rely on Article 9 of CSEA's 2007-11 CBA, and substantially similar provisions of prior CBAs going back to 1983, to support their argument that they have a vested right to a perpetually fixed premium contribution rate for their health insurance coverage.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 55 at \u00b6\u00b6 36, 43, 45, 70-71, 84, 109.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Section 9.1 of the 2007-11 CBA between CSEA and the State provides that \"[t]he State shall continue to provide all the forms and extent of coverage as defined by the contracts and in force on March 31, 2007 with the State's health insurance carriers unless specifically modified by this Agreement.\" Dkt. No. 93-12 at 4. This language clearly indicates that the State is promising the continuation of coverage. The introductory language simply establishes that the coverage in the previous CBA, to the extent that it is defined in the contracts between the State and the insurance carriers, will continue unless altered through negotiations. Therefore, what is continued are the benefits defined in the contracts with the insurance carriers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Additionally, to the extent that \"continue\" is read to mean continuation after the expiration of the CBA, the term \"coverage\" can only naturally be referring to the coverage that is defined in the \"contracts\" with \"the State health and dental insurance carriers.\" The State promised to continue to provide \"coverage,\" not as defined in the prior CBA, but in the State's contracts with the insurance carriers that provide coverage to State employees. As Defendants correctly note, premium contribution rates are not considered \"forms and extent of coverage\" under the State's Health Insurance Plan. Rather, the \"forms and extent of coverage\" are defined in the contracts with the health insurance carriers and those contracts do not define or set the premium contribution rates paid by the State and retirees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 93-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 18, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 40-41. As such, the term \"forms and extent of coverage\" does not include within its scope premium contribution rates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Also, to the extent that Plaintiffs claim that the word \"contracts\" in Section 9.1 refers to the CBA that was in effect on March 31, 2007, the argument must fail. First, as Defendants correctly note, Section 9.1 plainly refers to \"contracts,\" not a single contract. Second, the 2007-11 CBA and its predecessors refer to themselves as the \"Agreement,\" not the \"contract.\" Dkt. No. 93-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39. There is no plausible reason why Section 9.1 of the 2007-11 CBA would diverge from the language that had been used for decades and refer to a prior CBA as the \"the contracts\" rather than the \"Agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Defendants also correctly note that the sections of the 2007-11 CBAs that set forth the specific premium contribution rates further support the interpretation that the CBAs do not guarantee a perpetual specific premium contribution rate. Specifically, Section 9.23(a) provides that \"[t]he unremarried spouse and otherwise eligible dependent children of an employee, who retires after April 1, 1979, with ten or more years of active State service and subsequently dies, shall be permitted to continue coverage in the health insurance program with payment at the same contribution rates as required of active employees for the same coverage.\" Dkt. No. 93-12 at 21. This provision demonstrates that, when a specific contribution rate is meant to be guaranteed into retirement, it is set forth expressly in the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that two provisions read together support their position. Section 9.27(a) provides that \"[e]mployees covered by the State Health Insurance Plan have the right to retain health insurance after retirement upon completion of ten years of service.\" Dkt. No. 97-33 at 16. Further, Section 9.14(a) provides that \"[t]he State agrees to pay 90 percent of the cost of individual coverage and 75 percent of the cost of dependent coverage toward hospital/medical/mental health and substance abuse components provided under the Empire\n   Plan.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594426\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/926/#p937\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 93-12 at 16. Relying on the declaration of Ross Hanna, who has been CSEA's chief negotiator for the past twenty-nine years, Plaintiffs argue that these provisions entitle a post-1983 retiree to health insurance coverage with the State paying 90% of the cost of individual coverage and 75% of the cost of dependent coverage upon completion of 10 years of State service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17. Plaintiffs, through Mr. Hanna, contend that further evidence of the parties' understanding of this language is the fact that the State proposed during the negotiations in 1991, 2003, and 2007, to change the eligibility and contribution rates for retiree health insurance from the above language.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 97-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 12, 16-33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Contrary to Plaintiffs assertions, these provisions do not provide for a vested right to a perpetually fixed premium contribution rate and Mr. Hanna's declaration does not alter this conclusion. Section 9.27(a) simply provides that employees have the right to retain health insurance in retirement upon completion of ten years of service, but is silent as to contribution rates. Section 9.14(a) does not contain any reference to benefits in retirement. As such, while the CBAs guarantee health insurance in retirement to those with ten years of service, they do not guarantee any specific contribution rate in retirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cup v. Ampco Pittsburgh Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518565\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/903/58/#p63\">\n    903 F.3d 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 63 (3d Cir. 2018) (holding that a provision of a CBA guaranteeing health benefits for \"employees\" did not apply to former employees who retired before the date that the CBA went into effect).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Additionally, all of the CBAs at issue have durational limits. For example, Article 53 of the 2011-16 CBA provides that \"[t]he term of this Agreement shall be from April 2, 2011 to April 1, 2016.\" Dkt. No. 93-10 at 18. Similarly, the 2007-11 CBA provides that \"[t]he term of this Agreement shall be from April 2, 2007 to April 1, 2011.\" Dkt. No. 93-12 at 29.

In Fiscal Years 2009-10, 2010-11, and 2011-12, the State was required to adopt a range of measures to close the large budget gaps and achieve a balanced budget. The measures adopted in these years touched on a range of State activities, including: reductions in State payments for public schools, healthcare providers, local governments, social services and other services; imposition of cost controls on the operations of State agencies; increases in tax revenues, including personal income taxes, sales taxes, and other taxes; the deferral of required payments to the State pension system; and the use of non-recurring resources.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 98 at \u00b6 57. The Fiscal Year 2011-12 gap-closing plan consisted of a range of measures to moderate spending growth and increase receipts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59. This plan, which lowered spending by approximately $8.5 billion, included the following reductions: $2.8 billion in education aid; $2.7 billion for Medicaid; $1.5 billion for State agency operations; and $1.6 billion for various other programs and activities.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 60-61. The gap-closing plan also included approximately $860 million in actions that the Division of Budget characterized as non-recurring, including the use of certain fund balances and resources made available from state public authorities, as well as $324 million in increased revenues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 62. These are but a few of the actions that were taken to close the budget gap. In light of the considerable cuts made across all aspects of the State's spending, Plaintiff's argument that the extremely modest percentage increase in contribution rate is not narrowly tailored must be rejected.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ambrose\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201635498\">\n    2018 WL 1635498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *21 (finding that an increase in the health insurance contribution rate was reasonable and necessary, especially when considering the many measures taken before enacting the ordinance to address the city's fiscal crisis) (citations omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buffalo Teachers Fed'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3731151\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/464/362/#p368\">\n    464 F.3d at 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a wage freeze was reasonable and necessary because the city took \"more drastic measures\" to alleviate financial stress before turning to freeze).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Additionally, the Court rejects Plaintiffs' argument that the increase in the retirees' health insurance contribution rate was not\n   fiscally motivated. The State was required to identify $450 million in savings from workforce cost reductions. James Dewan indicated that the savings from the administrative extension of the increased contribution rates to retirees were projected to be $20 to $30 million.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 101-1 at \u00b6 6. To achieve the $450 million in workforce cost reductions, other proposals were implemented, including a temporary reduction in employee salary levels and certain changes to health insurance benefits, including increases to prescription drug copayments and deductibles for non-network physician visits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7. Additionally, several other proposals were considered but ultimately rejected. Examples of such rejected cost savings proposals include: changing the methodology used to calculate overtime compensation, location pay, and hazardous duty pay; eliminating longevity payments and performance advance increases; reducing workers' compensation benefits; increasing State employees' parking fees; increasing copayments due for certain medical services; increasing the coinsurance paid by enrollees for non-network medical services; changing the methodology used to reimburse claims incurred at non-network hospitals; eliminating Medicare Part B premium reimbursements for newly eligible retirees; and increasing the health insurance premium contributions paid by employees and retirees by one, three, four, five, six, or ten percentage points.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.
