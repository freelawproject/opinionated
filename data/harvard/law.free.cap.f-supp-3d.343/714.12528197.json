After coming home from school on January 26, 2017, Taye\n   committed suicide in his bedroom. (Doc. 21-1\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 90-94). Two days before his suicide, Tyus was knocked unconscious by a violent bully in a Carson bathroom.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Taye lay on the bathroom floor, unconscious, for over seven minutes while other students taunted and kicked him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 76-78). Eventually Defendant McKenzie responded to the incident in the bathroom. Taye was still lying on the floor unconscious and motionless when Defendant McKenzie arrived and simply stood over Taye. Other Carson staff including Defendant Jackson arrived later. Shortly after Defendant McLaughlin arrived, Taye regained consciousness. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 79-80). Nurse McLaughlin evaluated Taye, but did not call 911, even though the school's head injury nursing protocol required an emergency medical response whenever a student was unconscious/unresponsive for over one minute. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 102). An hour after the incident McLaughlin called Taye's mother, Cornelia Reynolds, and misrepresented to her that Taye had fainted. Reynolds asked McLaughlin if Taye needed to go to the hospital, but she was told that he needed no further medical treatment. Reynolds was not told that Taye had been knocked unconscious for over seven minutes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 81-82). Reynolds asked Taye what happened at school, but all Taye could remember was that he fell and that his stomach hurt. Taye suffered from stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting that night and Reynolds took him to the hospital. The hospital diagnosed him with likely gastrointestinal issues, but did not evaluate Taye for head trauma because the Carson Defendants\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   had told Reynolds that he had fainted, not that he had been knocked unconscious. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 84-85).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Taye went back to school on January 26, 2017, the day of his death. On that day, Taye suffered another incident of bullying in the school bathroom when two students stole his water bottle and flushed it down the toilet. Taye reported the incident to a teacher, but that teacher was unaware of the seriousness of the incident because the Carson Defendants had covered up the previous attack on Taye. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 88-90). Taye killed himself after returning home from school that night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Taye had been a victim of bullying and aggressive behavior throughout his years at Carson. Moreover, a number of incidents in which Taye was physically assaulted were concealed from his parents by the Carson Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 62-75).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that CPS Defendants fostered and covered up bullying and other aggressive behavior at Carson and created an unsafe environment for Carson students. (Doc. 21-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 20-61). Pursuant to O.R.C. \u00a7 3313.666, Defendant CPS was required to report any incidents of bullying. In the period of time that represented Taye's first half of third grade, Carson reported zero (0) bullying incidents. In the period of time that would have represented the second half of Taye's third-grade school year, Carson reported four (4) bullying incidents, but none involving Taye, including the bathroom attack. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29). Plaintiffs allege that there were significantly more bullying incidents at Carson,\n   but those incidents were covered-up by the CPS Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Carson behavior logs of ten students contain information of multiple occurrences of bullying and aggressive behavior, none of which were reported as bullying. The behavior logs specifically refer to several incidents as \"bullying.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 32, 33). Other incidents that were documented, but not reported as bullying, include the punching and choking of students; verbal and physical threats, including threatening to sexually assault a student at gunpoint; and racist tormenting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 34-54). Plaintiffs also highlight the bullying at Carson through statements of other parents with children at Carson who attest that officials at Carson were unresponsive to bullying at the school. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 55-59). One Carson parent states that CPS Defendants were aware that her child had expressed suicidal thoughts twice in school journal and she was not notified until the third time he expressed suicidal ideations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

(Doc. 21; Doc. 21-1). Plaintiffs propose to amend the complaint in the following ways: (1) add Carson nurse, Margaret McLaughlin, as a defendant and add a claim against her for negligence by a nurse (Count VII) and (2) add a new basis for a finding of municipal liability against the Defendants Cincinnati Board of Education and Superintendent Ronan (collectively \"Board Defendants\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   CPS Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' motion to amend the complaint should be denied because Plaintiffs' proposed amendments are futile and would not survive CPS Defendants' pending motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Yuhasz v.

Instead, Plaintiffs allege both that (1) CPS Defendants\n   <em>\n    affirmatively misrepresented\n   </em>\n   to Taye's mother that he had fainted at school even though the CPS Defendants were aware that Taye had been a victim of bullying and had been knocked unconscious (Doc. 21-1 at \u00b6 82) and (2)\n   <em>\n    concealed\n   </em>\n   information regarding bullying at Carson from Plaintiffs and others.

Here, Plaintiffs allege that CPS Defendants' acts increased danger to Taye because they prevented Taye's parents from getting an accurate medical diagnosis as Taye was not checked for head trauma. Moreover, the CPS Defendants' acts caused Taye's mother to send Taye back to school two days after the bathroom attack, whereupon he was bullied in the bathroom again.

Additionally, the amended complaint alleges that\n   CPS Defendants knew that one of the risks of bullying is suicide. (Doc. 21-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 94-98, 100-102).

Plaintiffs' opposition to the motion to dismiss cites numerous alleged actions that are conscience shocking, including (1) concealing and covering-up the level of violence Taye faced at Carson, (2) affirmatively mispresenting the bathroom attack and the extent and cause of Taye's injuries; (3) destroying surveillance recordings for the purpose of covering up the danger at Carson; (4) encouraging violence at Carson; and (5) encouraging injuries from violence to be minimized. (Doc. 19 at 21). Frankly, the allegations that the CPS Defendants were aware that Taye had been knocked unconscious for several minutes by an incident of bullying and then - instead of calling the ambulance (as CPS's policy on head trauma required) so Taye could receive medical care and notifying Taye's mother of what happened to her eight-year old son - they lied to his mother telling her that Taye had just fainted, shocks the conscience of the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Additionally, the Sixth Circuit has provided three factors to consider in determining whether deliberately indifferent actions shock the conscience: \"1) the voluntariness of the plaintiff's relationship with the government, 2) whether there was time for the government actor to deliberate, and 3) whether the government actor was pursuing a legitimate governmental purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Range\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180685\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/763/573/#p588\">\n    763 F.3d at 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, Taye's relationship with the CPS Defendants, while not a \"special relationship,\" was not voluntary as attendance at school was mandatory. Second, CPS Defendants had a considerable amount of time to deliberate their decision to affirmatively misrepresent the bathroom attack to Taye's mother, and they had a considerable amount of time to deliberate their continued covering up of bullying at Carson. Third, the Court can think of no legitimate government purpose for why the CPS Defendants would affirmatively misrepresent the bathroom attack to Taye's mother, would not follow school policy to contact emergency care when Taye suffered a head injury, and would cover up bullying at Carson. Therefore, the\n   <em>\n    Range\n   </em>\n   factors support the finding that the CPS Defendants' actions shock the conscience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, a jury could find that the alleged actions of the CPS Defendants shock the conscience. Accordingly, the CPS Defendants' motion to dismiss Count III is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Equal Protection (Count IV)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs allege that CPS Defendants violated Taye's equal protection rights. \"The Sixth Circuit recognizes two methods of proving an equal protection violation based on a school official's response to peer harassment: (1) disparate treatment of one class of students who complain about bullying as compared to other classes of students ... and (2) deliberate indifference to discriminatory peer harassment.\"\n   <em>\n    Stiles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4253268\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/819/834/#p854\">\n    819 F.3d at 851-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Here, the Plaintiffs allege that the CPS Defendants violated Taye's equal protection rights by treating students injured by bullying and aggression differently than students injured in accidents. Plaintiffs allege that \"[w]hile students who experience accidents at school are given appropriate and adequate medical treatment, and their parents are informed of the incident, students who are victims of bullying and student-on-student aggressive behavior are not protected, their medical needs are not\n   taken seriously, and their parents are not informed of the incident or the injury, thus depriving them of the ability to protect their son.\" (Doc. 21-1 at 36-37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   CPS Defendants argue that Plaintiffs do not identify any discrimination as between two different classes of students and only that Defendants treated Taye differently in two different situations. (Doc. 13 at 18). However, Plaintiffs complaint is rife with examples of bullying victims not receiving appropriate medical treatment and their parents not being informed of bullying incidents. (Doc. 21-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 56-60). While the amended complaint only contains one allegation of a student receiving disparate treatment from a non-bullying related injury (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 117-18), that is sufficient at the motion to dismiss stage. Moreover, CPS Defendants have not provided any rational basis for why the school would provide differential treatment to injured students based on the cause of the injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Accordingly, Plaintiffs have adequately plead an equal protection claim and CPS Defendants' motion to dismiss Count IV is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Cincinnati Public Schools Municipal Liability (Count V)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiffs also bring a municipal liability claim under \u00a7 1983 against the Board Defendants. Having already shown a \u00a7 1983 violation by CPS Defendants, in order to plead municipal liability against Board Defendants, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that the violation of their rights was caused by a policy, custom, or practice of the municipality.\n   <em>\n    Monell v.

A) are not facially unconstitutional.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs provides no legal support for why not including their definition of \"aggressive behavior\" in the CPS anti-bullying policy makes the policy unconstitutional.

Board Defendants' Custom of Inaction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   While the Court finds that the CPS anti-bullying policy is not unconstitutional, Plaintiffs have also alleged that the CPS Defendants developed a custom of covering up bullying and failing to act to prevent bullying at Carson. To state a municipal liability claim under an \"inaction\" theory, Plaintiffs must establish: (1) the existence of a clear and persistent pattern of \u00a7 1983 violations by the school employees; (2) notice or constructive notice on the part of the Board Defendants; (2) the Board Defendants' tacit approval of the unconstitutional conduct, such that their deliberate indifference in their failure to act can be said to amount to an official policy of inaction; and (4) the Board of Director's custom was the \"moving force\" or direct causal links in the constitutional deprivation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Second, the Plaintiffs allege that Defendants McKenzie and Jackson documented a pattern of bullying and aggression, including injuries to students, in their student behavior logs, which were available to the Board Defendants. (Doc. 21-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 20-61). Moreover, the fact that Carson officially reported zero (0) incidents of bullying in the first half of Taye's third-grade year, even though the behavior log documented several events described as bullying, may ultimately show that the Board Defendants were aware that bullying was being concealed at Carson. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29). Third, Plaintiffs allege that the Board Defendants' deliberate indifference is demonstrated in their awareness of bullying at Carson and their tacit approval of the CPS Defendants actions to conceal that bullying. Plaintiffs note that at the time of their filing of the initial complaint, the Board Defendants had not investigated the bullying, aggression, and violence that Taye suffered at Carson, including the bathroom attack. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 141). A reasonable juror could find this tacit approval of covering-up and failing to investigate incidents of bullying at Carson reflects recklessness and deliberate indifference on the part of Board Defendants. Fourth, Plaintiffs allege that the Board Defendants' custom of not investigating incidents of bullying and aggression, not treating victims, not notifying parents, and not reporting the bullying incidents were a moving force behind Taye's death. These allegations are sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Inadequate Training and Supervision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plaintiffs also contend that the Board Defendants failed to adequately train and supervise the Board Defendants and other Carson officials on how to respond to the aggressive behavior at Carson. (Doc. 19 at 29-31). \"To succeed on a failure to train or supervise claim, the plaintiff must prove the following: (1) the training or supervision was inadequate for the tasks performed; (2) the inadequacy was the result of the municipality's deliberate indifference; and (3) the inadequacy was closely related to or actually caused the injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Ellis ex rel.

As to the first prong, Plaintiffs state that the Board Directors failed to train or supervise their staff to ensure that they complied with their legal obligations and the CPS anti-bullying policy. There are a number of allegations in the amended complaint that suggest that the CPS Defendants were not adequately trained or supervised in how to respond to bullying at Carson, including how they reported bullying in behavior logs and how they reported bullying incidents pursuant to O.R.C. \u00a7 3313.666, how they communicated (or did not communicate) incidents of bullying to parents of bullied children, and how they treated the injuries of bullied students. Taken as true, Plaintiffs have successfully alleged that the Board Defendants did not adequately train and supervise school officials, including the Carson Defendants. Therefore, Plaintiffs' allegation that the Board Defendants inadequately trained/supervised Carson officials provides another basis for municipal liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Ratification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The final basis Plaintiffs allege for municipal liability is that the Board Defendants, as final policymakers, ratified the unconstitutional acts of the Carson Defendants. It is undisputed that the Board Defendants were final policymakers. The Sixth Circuit recognizes two methods for finding ratification: (1) when an individual with policymaking authority issues a final decision affirming a subordinate's decision on the merits or otherwise, and thereby adopting it as municipal policy,\n   <em>\n    Meyers v. City of Cincinnati\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531240\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/14/1115/#p1118\">\n    14 F.3d 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1118-19 (6th Cir. 1994), and (2) when a policymaker fails to meaningfully investigate the acts of a subordinate.\n   <em>\n    Leach v.

Plaintiffs allege that Board Defendants failed to investigate the unconstitutional acts of the Carson Defendants and therefore ratified their actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \"[E]vidence that a municipality inadequately investigated an alleged constitutional violation can be seen as evidence of a policy that would condone the conduct at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Otero v.

Ohio Aug. 22, 2013) (denying summary judgment in finding municipal liability based on ratification). Here, Plaintiffs allege that at the time of filing the initial complaint, Board Defendants had conducted no investigation into the events leading to Taye's suicide, including the bathroom attack. (Doc. 21-1 at \u00b6 109). Taken as true, Plaintiffs have clearly alleged that Board Defendants, as final policymakers, ratified the unconstitutional acts of the Carson Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   At this point, the Court finds that the Plaintiffs' allegations go beyond mere conclusory allegations in their municipal liability claim against the Board Defendants. It remains to be seen whether Plaintiffs will ultimately prevail on their municipal liability claim, or even survive summary judgment, but Plaintiffs are entitled to discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Laning v.

State Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege an array of state law claims against the Carson Defendants. As an initial matter, Defendants move to dismiss all these claims because they contend that they have political subdivision immunity. The Ohio Political Subdivision Immunity Act grants immunity from suit to any government employee sued in his individual capacity unless:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   (a) The employee's acts or omissions were manifestly outside the scope of the employee's employment or official responsibilities;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   (b) The employee's acts or omissions were with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   (c) Civil liability is expressly imposed upon the employee by a section of the Revised Code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   O.R.C. \u00a7 2744.03(A)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Court already found\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   (Section III(B)(1)(a)(iii) ) that the Carson Defendants alleged acts were, at a minimum, reckless. Therefore, the Carson Defendants do not have political subdivision immunity under the exception provided by O.R.C. \u00a7 2744.03(A)(6)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Wrongful Death (Count VI)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Plaintiffs bring a claim for wrongful death against the Carson Defendants.

(Doc. 21-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 95-99, 133). Defendants argue that, while bullying or a loss of consciousness can lead to suicide, \"[s]chool officials would have no reason to think it is\n   <em>\n    likely\n   </em>\n   that Taye would kill himself.\" (Doc. 13 at 28).

Plaintiffs have alleged not only that the Carson Defendants were aware that Taye was a victim of abuse and harassment, but that they concealed that abuse and harassment from Taye's parents.

The amended complaint alleges that Carson Defendants' reckless actions, which led to Taye's suicide, caused Taye and his parents severe emotional distress. (Doc. 21-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 200-01). Understandably, the Carson Defendants do not refute that the Plaintiffs have suffered severe emotional distress.

The Ohio statute mandating reporting of suspected child abuse or neglect provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   No person ... who is acting in an official or professional capacity and knows, or has reasonable cause to suspect based on facts that would cause a reasonable person in a similar position to suspect, that a child ... has suffered or faces a threat of suffering any physical or mental wound, injury, disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect of the child shall fail to immediately report that knowledge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   O.R.C. \u00a7 2151.421(A)(1)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Essentially, Plaintiffs argue that the bathroom attack by students at Carson\n   was an act of child abuse and the Carson Defendants failed to report that abuse to a children's services agency or law enforcement, as required. Defendants point out that putting Plaintiff's definition of child abuse into effect would lead to law enforcement or children's services being called for every incident of peer-on-peer violence. Defendants additionally note that no court has ever defined an altercation between elementary school students as child abuse. (Doc. 13 at 35). The Court agrees with Defendants. Plaintiffs' proposed reading of the child abuse statute is over-expansive and leads to absurd results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Accordingly, Defendants motion to dismiss Count XI is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    f. Spoliation (Count XII)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs allege that the CPS Defendants spoiled evidence. To adequately plead a claim for spoliation, Plaintiffs must show \"(1) pending or probable litigation involving the plaintiff, (2) knowledge on the part of defendant that litigation exists or is probable, (3) willful destruction of evidence by defendant designed to disrupt the plaintiff's case, (4) disruption of the plaintiff's case, and (5) damages proximately caused by the defendant's acts.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Howard Johnson Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1723921\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/67/28/\">\n    67 Ohio St.3d 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=615%20N.E.2d%201037\">\n    615 N.E.2d 1037\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1038 (1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Defendants' only argument is that Plaintiffs do not have any cognizable tort claims against Defendants and therefore Plaintiffs cannot show any damages resulting from the alleged spoliation. (Doc. 13 at 36-37). Again, the Court has found that Plaintiffs have adequately alleged several cognizable torts against CPS Defendants. The Court finds that Plaintiffs have pled each element of a spoliation claim. As the majority of Plaintiffs' claims survive Defendants' motion to dismiss, the CPS Defendants' alleged destruction of surveillance tapes will likely disrupt Plaintiffs' case going forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Accordingly, Defendants' motion to dismiss Count XII is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

These policies only define bullying as acts in which a student or group of students commit verbal or physicals acts more than once towards a particular student. Under these policies, one student committing violent acts against 100 other students one time each would not qualify as bullying. Inversely, 100 different students committing 100 acts of violence against one particular student would not qualify as bullying. The Court is skeptical that these policies in fact prevent the type of aggressive behavior that occurred at Carson and ultimately led to Taye's suicide.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
