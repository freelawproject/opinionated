Alexander Acosta, Secretary of Labor for the United States Department of Labor (\"Plaintiff\") commenced this action pursuant to the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , on January 5, 2018. (Dkt. 1). Plaintiff seeks to obtain relief for breaches of fiduciary duty under ERISA \u00a7 409 and to enjoin acts and practices which violate the provisions of Title I of ERISA from defendants Jeffrey Bratcher; Sarah Bratcher; Global Tradequest, Inc. dba Buyquest, Inc. (\"Global Tradequest\"); and Global Tradequest\n   401(k) PSP &amp; Trust (\"the Plan\") (collectively \"Defendants\") for allegedly failing to forward contributions withheld from employee wages to the Plan. (Dkt. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Presently before the Court is a proposed consent order and judgment (\"proposed Consent Judgment\") for approval. (Dkt. 16). For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds the proposed Consent Judgment to be acceptable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following alleged facts are drawn from the complaint. Jeffrey Bratcher was the President of Global Tradequest, and Sarah Bratcher was the General Manager of Global Tradequest. (Dkt. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9). The Plan was an employee benefit plan within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) and (3) and covered the employees of Global Tradequest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5). Both Jeffrey and Sarah Bratcher exercised discretionary authority or control respecting management of the Plan and its assets and had discretionary authority or responsibility in administering the Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 8, 10). Additionally, Sarah Bratcher was a limited trustee of the Plan, and Global Tradequest was the plan administrator. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 6, 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Plan's governing documents provided that participating employees would contribute to individual retirement accounts via payroll deductions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12). Global Tradequest and Sarah Bratcher were supposed to deposit the contributions withheld from the employees' paychecks into said individual accounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13). Employees could also apply for a loan from the Plan that they repaid with interest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14). Between November 16, 2014, and February 16, 2017, Global Tradequest, Sarah Bratcher, and Jeffrey Bratcher failed to deposit at least $23,612.19 in employee contributions and loan repayments into the Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15). This money was never segregated from Global Tradequest's general assets (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16), and as a result, the employees lost the opportunity to realize at least $872.28 in interest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 5, 2018, Plaintiff filed the instant lawsuit, asking for injunctive and monetary relief. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6). On August 14, 2018, the proposed Consent Judgment was filed.
