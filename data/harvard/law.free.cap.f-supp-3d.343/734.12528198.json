CRENSHAW, JR., CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Pending before the Court is ProCraft Cabinetry, Inc.'s (\"Procraft Cabinetry\") Motion to Stay Pending Appeal (Doc. No. 368) and Motion to Expedite Determination of Plaintiff's Motion to Stay Pending Appeal (Doc. No. 370). Defendants have filed an opposition. (Doc. No. 372.) Procraft Cabinetry has filed its reply. (Doc. No. 373.) For the reasons stated below, the Court will deny the motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On September 24, 2018, the Court entered a Memorandum Opinion granting summary judgment to Qiang Huang (\"Huang\") and Min Hua Lin (\"Lin\"), two shareholders in Procraft Cabinetry, on Count Five of their Third Party Complaint, demanding that Sophia Chen, the remaining Procraft Cabinetry shareholder, direct Procraft Cabinetry to withdraw the instant lawsuit. (Doc. No. 362.) In granting summary judgment, the Court determined that (1) the \"Shareholders' Agreement of Procraft Cabinetry, Inc. Company,\" entered into by Huang, Lin, and Chen, was valid and binding, giving Huang and Lin certain shareholders rights in Procraft Cabinetry; and, as a result, (2) Chen did not have authority to unilaterally direct Procraft Cabinetry to file the instant lawsuit. (Doc. No. 362 at 6-14.) Accordingly, the Court dismissed Procraft Cabinetry's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (Doc. No. 363.) Importantly, the Court's order also dissolved a previously entered temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") preventing Huang and Lin from exercising their rights as shareholders of Procraft Cabinetry to end the lawsuit. (Doc. No. 362 at 14-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Shortly after, on October 1, 2018, Procraft Cabinetry filed a notice, appealing the Court's grant of summary judgment, dismissal of the action, and dissolution of the TRO. (Doc. No. 367.) Nine days later, on October, 10, 2018, Procraft Cabinetry filed the instant motion, seeking a stay of this Court's summary judgment and dismissal order. (Doc. No. 368.) At heart, Procraft Cabinetry seeks to stay dissolution of the TRO in order to maintain the corporation's status quo during the pendency of the appeal. (Doc. No. 368 at 3-4.) Having considered Procraft Cabinetry's stay motion, the response, the reply, and submissions, the Court finds that Procraft Cabinetry has not demonstrated that a stay is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Applicable Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"A stay is an intrusion into the ordinary processes of administration and judicial review.\"\n   <em>\n    Dodds v.

Procraft Cabinetry's argument on this prong of the test consists of three parts: (1) the Shareholders' Agreement is latently ambiguous; (2) the parties to the Shareholders' Agreement (Huang, Lin, and Chen) were mutually mistaken as to its purpose; and (3) Chen was authorized and bound by law to unilaterally direct Procraft Cabinetry to file the lawsuit. (Doc. No. 369 at 6-14.) Procraft Cabinetry asserts that, because the Shareholders' Agreement is latently ambiguous and the result of mutual mistake, the Court erred in failing to consider extraneous evidence to determine the intent of the parties. Further, Procraft Cabinetry argues that, even if the Shareholders' Agreement was valid and binding, Chen was authorized to unilaterally file the lawsuit in the execution of her fiduciary duties as President of Procraft Cabinetry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As an initial matter, Procraft Cabinetry never specifically argued that the Shareholders' Agreement was latently ambiguous before the Court, and, therefore, it is unlikely that this argument will be considered before the Sixth Circuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thurman v. Yellow Freight Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9048968\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/90/1160/#p1172\">\n    90 F.3d 1160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1172 (6th Cir. 1996) (\"Issues that are not squarely presented to the trial court are considered waived and may not be raised on appeal.\"). While it is true that latent ambiguity and mutual mistake would allow the Court to review extraneous information to determine the intent of the parties, the Court has discussed the Shareholders' Agreement at length in its Memorandum Opinion and concluded that it was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   ambiguous. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 362 at 8-11.) Although Procraft Cabinetry acknowledges the Court's analysis, it has offered no new arguments to cast it in doubt. Further, Procraft Cabinetry still has not explained why Chen's unilateral action in directing the corporation to file suit, in the purported execution of her fiduciary duties, was preferable to initiating a derivative lawsuit on behalf of the corporation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 270 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Court's opinion was written after careful consideration of the parties' briefing of the issues and a thorough review of relevant precedent.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau v. Harbour Portfolio Advisors, LLC\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 16-14183,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205892227\">\n    2017 WL 5892227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 14, 2017) (finding respondents had not raised a meaningful challenge to the court's application of the applicable legal standard where they merely argued that one could reasonably contest the court's conclusion, and denying stay based upon failure to raise serious questions going to the merits);\n   <em>\n    Osborn v.

Ky. Nov. 2, 2016) (denying stay pending appeal where defendants focused \"their brief on the assertion that they will prevail on appeal, [and] their legal arguments in support of that proposition [we]re the same that th[e] [c]ourt has previously rejected\"). Furthermore, the Court disagrees with Procraft Cabinetry's fundamental assumption that, if our Court of Appeals were to review extraneous information to the Shareholders' Agreement, Procraft Cabinetry would prevail. (Doc. No. 369 at 6-12.) Because Procraft Cabinetry has not established a\n   strong likelihood of success on the merits of its appeal, this factor weighs against a stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Second, Procraft Cabinetry has not established irreparable injury absent a stay. Procraft Cabinetry argues that, without a stay, it will suffer irreparable harm because a shareholders' meeting, scheduled for October 16, 2018, will occur for the purpose of: (1) removing Chen as President of Procraft Cabinetry's President and replacing her with Lin; (2) terminating counsel for Procraft Cabinetry; (3) ceasing all interference with Huagn and Lin once they elect themselves as officers; and (4) demanding Chen's cooperation with Lin once he is elected President. Procraft Cabinetry contends that, once Lin and Huang are elected officers and counsel is replaced, the pending appeal before the Court of Appeals will be dismissed, leaving it no way to seek redress through a review of the Court's summary judgment order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The loss of a right to appeal may constitute irreparable harm, however, here, Procraft Cabinetry has an adequate, alternative remedy at law, a derivative suit in Tennessee state court, and, indeed, it is currently actively pursuing that remedy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 372-1.) In fact, Procraft Cabinetry is seeking a restraining order from the Tennessee state court to prevent Huang and Lin from acting at the October 16th shareholders' meeting. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 372-2.) If Procraft Cabinetry is successful, it will be granted the exact relief it seeks: enjoinment of Huang and Lin's shareholder rights, preservation of the status quo, and continued prosecution of its appeal before the Sixth Circuit. Therefore, because there is an adequate remedy at law, and Procraft Cabinetry is currently pursuing that remedy, it cannot demonstrate irreparable injury absent a stay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Becton v. Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11549654\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/48/747/#p762\">\n    48 F.Supp.2d 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 762 (W.D. Tenn. Apr. 22, 1999) (citing\n   <em>\n    CSX Transp. Inc. v. Ten. State Bd. Of Equalization\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"42799\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/964/548/#p551\">\n    964 F.2d 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 551 (6th Cir. 1992) ) (\"[A] plaintiff's harm is not irreparable if there is an adequate remedy at law.\"). This factor therefore also weighs against a stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Third, the Court considers the harm that the plaintiff will suffer in the absence of a stay against the harm defendants and third parties may incur. Procraft Cabinetry argues that Huang and Lin will not be harmed because (1) there will only be a negligible and \"short-lived\" delay on appeal and (2) the stay will prevent Lin and Huang from breaching their fiduciary duties, if any, to Procraft Cabinetry. (Doc. No. 369 at 15.) The Court is not persuaded by either of these contentions. As to the first point, any further delay prejudices Lin and Huang. The restraining order prohibiting them from exercising their shareholder rights was pending for over nine months before the Court's summary judgment order. It is impossible to predict how long the Court of Appeals may take to resolve this matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phoenix Global Ventures, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%202734562\">\n    2004 WL 2734562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 29, 2004) (\"Granting defendants a stay based solely on the possibility that the [appeals court] might decide the appeal quickly would remove the heavy burden placed on the moving party in justifying a stay by eliminating the rigor of the four-factor analysis.\"). Additionally, given the Court's previous order, the Court has been presented with little justification for interfering with Lin and Huang assuming their fiduciary duties. Indeed, some of the objectives at the scheduled shareholders' meeting include ascertaining the financial status of Procraft Cabinetry, reviewing financial records, and discussing monthly and quarterly financial update protocols. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 368-1 at 2.) Thus, the balance of harms weighs in Lin and Huang's favor, and, therefore, this factor also weighs against a stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Finally, in regard to the public interest, the Court looks to how the stay will affect the people of Tennessee. The Court is of the opinion that the people of Tennessee have a strong public policy interest in the favor of upholding contracts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Chao v. Hosp. Staffing Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9463714,9467530\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/270/374/\">\n    270 F.3d 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 389 (6th Cir. 2001). The Court has determined that the Shareholders' Agreement is valid and binding, Huang and Lin are shareholders in Procraft Cabinetry, and therefore, a continued enjoinment of Huang and Lin's contractual rights is not in the public interest. Moreover, the issue of the enjoinment of the activities of a shareholder meeting of a Tennessee corporation is appropriately being litigated now in a Tennessee state court. This factor weighs against a stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   On balance, the Court finds that Procraft Cabinetry has failed to meet its \"heavy burden of demonstrating that a stay is warranted. While [Procraft Cabinetry] did assert some problems [it] identif[ies] in the district court's legal conclusions, [the Court] ... cannot say that [Procraft Cabinetry] ha[s] carried [its] burden to make a \"\n   <em>\n    strong\n   </em>\n   showing that it is likely to succeed on the merits.\"\n   <em>\n    Husted\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266513\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/385/#p387\">\n    769 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   389 (citing\n   <em>\n    Nken\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p435\">\n    556 U.S. at 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p435\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) (emphasis in original). \"Moreover, [Procraft Cabinetry] did not carry [its] burden to demonstrate that [it] will suffer ... irreparable harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\"In contrast, [Huang and Lin] have demonstrated that they and the public will likely suffer significant harm if the stay is granted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p435\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p435\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Procraft Cabinetry's Motion to Expedite and Motion to Stay Pending Appeal (Doc.
