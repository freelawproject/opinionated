(\"A New Beginning\"), an immigrants' rights organization. Through A New Beginning, Davila participated in the Department of Justice's Recognition and Accreditation Program (\"R &amp; A Program\"), which permitted him to represent individuals in immigration proceedings as a non-attorney. The Department of Justice revoked Davila's accreditation pursuant to new program requirements governing the eligibility of non-attorney representatives after they learned that he had been convicted of first-degree manslaughter in 1988.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant Steven Lang is the Program Director of the Office of Legal Access Programs (\"OLAP\"), the federal entity tasked with administering the R &amp; A Program. Davila seeks to hold Lang, in his official capacity, liable for injuries that Davila allegedly suffered as a result of his accreditation being terminated. Specifically, Davila contends that his termination from the program violated his constitutional right to due process and was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20702\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Davila further argues that OLAP's decision to terminate him on the basis of his criminal history violates New York Correction Law Articles 23 and 23-a. In his opposition, Davila newly asserts that (1) Lang and OLAP are not entitled to sovereign immunity because the Government has consented to suit under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act; (2) Lang is not entitled to sovereign immunity because he is not a government employee; (3) Lang has defamed Davila; (4) OLAP's eligibility requirements for the R &amp; A Program violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; and (5) Lang is barred from enforcing OLAP's revocation decision under the doctrines of equitable estoppel and laches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant Lang moved to dismiss all claims pursuant to\n   Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted.

A court must first determine whether the claim \"presents a new\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   context.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1859.

In\n   <em>\n    Ziglar,\n   </em>\n   the Supreme Court affirmed the long-held precedent that a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy \"will not be available if there are 'special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ziglar,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/#p1857\">\n    137 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1857 (citing\n   <em>\n    Carlson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180250\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/14/\">\n    446 U.S. at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180250\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/14/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Davila's claims here are meaningfully different from prior\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   cases, and special factors counsel hesitation. Unlike\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Carlson\n   </em>\n   , Davila's claims did not include any form of search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment, nor did his claims include anything that could be construed to constitute cruel and unusual punishment towards Davila. While the\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   action brought in\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   included a due process claim under the Fifth Amendment, that claim was substantially different than the due process claim brought by Davila under the Fourteenth Amendment. The claim in\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   related to gender discrimination in the workplace, whereas the claim in the instant case relates to the revocation of a government accreditation. Thus, Davila's due process claims under the Fourteenth Amendment implicate a new context for the application of a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Because Davila's claim presents a new\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   context, the Court must analyze whether special factors counsel hesitation in expanding\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   \"in the absence of affirmative action by Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180250\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/14/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Ziglar\n   </em>\n   explained that the \"special factors\" inquiry \"must concentrate on whether the Judiciary is well suited, absent congressional action or instruction, to consider and weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action to proceed. Thus, to be a 'special factor counselling hesitation,' a factor must cause a court to hesitate before answering that question in the affirmative.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1857-58. That is, a court begins with the premise that the Judiciary should not readily extend a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy to new claims, and before a court does so, it should consider a number of factors to determine whether \"Congress would want the Judiciary to entertain a damages suit in a given case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Among those factors is whether alternative remedies exist for addressing the constitutional violations raised by the claims of a particular case. The Supreme Court suggested that \"if there is an alternative remedial structure present in a certain case, that alone may limit the power of the Judiciary to infer a new\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In this case, Davila asserts a claim under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, there is an alternative remedial structure in place. The letters that OLAP sent to Davila to inform him of A New Beginning's termination from the R &amp; A program explicitly provided that Davila had \"the opportunity to respond to this notice prior to the termination of full accreditation.\" Termination Letter. This alone counsels hesitation in extending a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Because Davila's claims present a new\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   context, and special factors counsel hesitation, the Court declines to recognize a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy for Davila's Fourteenth Amendment claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    G.

From the lack of such a time limit, the Court can infer that the modified guideline was intended to apply to any \"serious crimes\" committed by the individual at any time, even those which occurred prior to the enactment of the new guidelines in December 2016. Because the plain language of the applicable regulation, which envisions retroactive application, allows OLAP to terminate a person who has been convicted of a felony, and OLAP terminated Davila because he was convicted of a felony, as set forth in the May 10, 2017 letter to Davila, the Court concludes that OLAP examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for its action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State Farm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p42\">\n    463 U.S. at 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p42\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In addition, the Court notes that this basis for liability was raised for the first time in Davila's opposition briefing. This new theory and the related factual allegations with respect to it set forth in Davila's opposition contradict the legal theories and facts on which Davila relied in his complaint, many of which demonstrate that OLAP is a federal entity under the direction of the Department of Justice. See e.g., Compl. \u00b6 76 (\"Due process liberty interest at stake [sic] where the government has damaged a person's reputation In [sic] the process of taking significant action against that person....\"). The Court addresses the argument on the merits, nonetheless.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    It is not clear that Davila's complaint can be construed as making the argument that DOJ promulgated the new eligibility requirements in an arbitrary and capricious manner.

DOJ received 63 comments from various sources, including non-profit organizations, bar associations, government agencies, legal clinics, attorneys, and law students, and in response to those comments, DOJ revised the proposed rule.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"275\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2092346\">\n     81 Fed. Reg. 92346\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . DOJ articulated at length the bases for its rulemaking, including stating specifically that \"[r]egarding those convicted of a serious crime, this prohibition supplements the character and fitness requirement, as the Department has determined that individuals with serious crimes are not qualified to be accredited. Unlike with attorneys permitted to appear before EOIR and DHS, the Department has the authority to decide whether nonlawyers should be accredited and permitted to provide immigration legal services in the first instance and need not be limited to pursuing discipline against them based on a serious crime after they have been accredited.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"276\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2092353\">\n     81 Fed.

In light of this notice-and-comment rulemaking and the explanations that DOJ provided for the new eligibility requirements, Davila has failed to state a claim that DOJ's promulgation of the new eligibility criteria was arbitrary or capricious.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Chauffeur's Training School v.
