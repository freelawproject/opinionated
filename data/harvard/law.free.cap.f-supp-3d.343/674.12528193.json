Reagan is a commercial billboard company in the business of outdoor advertising. Am. Compl. [# 18] at 2. On March 8, 2017, Reagan submitted five sign permit applications to the City. Am. Mot. Summ. J. [# 24-2] (Sign Permit Applications). Three of these applications requested permission to install digital sign faces on three existing outdoor signs (the Digital Conversion Applications).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 2-16. The other two applications sought permits for the construction of two new signs (the New Sign Applications).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 17-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   To receive approval, permit applications must demonstrate proposed signs meet the requirements of the City's Sign Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   These requirements are contained in two articles. The first article-Article 13.01-is entitled \"On-Premises Sign Standards and Permits.\" Am. Mot. Summ. J. [# 24-5] Ex. 5 (Sign Code) at 1. The second article-Article 13.03-is entitled \"Off-Premises Sign Standards and Permits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Both Article 13.01 and Article 13.03 contain provisions which rely upon a distinction between on-premises and off-premises signs. An \"on-premises sign\" is defined as a \"sign identifying or advertising the business, person, activity, goods, products, or services located on the site where the sign is installed, or that directs persons to a location on that site.\" Sign Code at 4. By contrast, an \"off-premises sign\" is defined as a \"sign referring to goods, products or services provided at a location other than that which the sign occupies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. All five of Reagan's permit applications relate to off-premises signs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 14, 2017, the City denied all five of Reagan's permit applications. Am. Mot. Summ. J. [# 24-4] Ex. 4 (Denial Letters). Among other reasons, the New Sign Applications were denied because they proposed using light-emitting diode (LED) displays in off-premises signs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-10. Although the Sign Code allows LED displays to be incorporated into some on-premises signs, it bans the use of LED displays in off-premises signs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sign Code \u00a7 13.01.007(i)(4) (\"Electronically controlled changeable messages signs shall not advertise goods or services not offered on the premises on which the sign is located.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13.03.006(d) (\"No light emitting diode (LED) displays or signs shall be permitted.\"). The City likewise denied the Digital Conversion Applications because, like the New Sign Applications, the Digital Conversion Applications proposed installing LED displays in off-premises signs. Denial Letters at 1-6; Sign Code \u00a7\u00a7 13.01.007(i)(4), 13.03.006(d);\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 13.01.016(a), 13.03.007(a) (\"[N]o change or alteration shall be made [to existing signs] that would increase the degree of nonconformity [with the Sign Code].\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the City denied Reagan's permit applications, Reagan filed this action in state court arguing that the Sign Code's differing treatment of on-premises and off-premises signs constitutes content discrimination and that this content-based distinction cannot survive constitutional scrutiny. Notice Removal [# 1-1] Ex. 1 (Original\n   Pet.) at 4. On this basis, Reagan seeks to invalidate the entire Sign Code. Reply [# 31] at 3. The City later removed the action to this Court and now moves for summary judgment. Notice Removal [# 1]; Am. Mot. Summ. J. [# 24].
