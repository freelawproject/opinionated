Petitioner's siblings were released into the custody of their mother, while Petitioner was detained at the South Texas Detention Facility. Petitioner initially underwent an \"Expedited Removal Without Credible Fear\" processing and on June 2, 2018, was issued a Determination of Inadmissibility which charged that Petitioner was inadmissible pursuant to Section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"). (ECF No. 12-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to Petitioner, \"[s]ometime thereafter, [she] expressed her fear to return to El Salvador and desire to apply for asylum.\" (ECF No. 1 at 4). On June 20, 2018, Petitioner received a credible fear interview pursuant to \u00a7 1225(b)(1)(B); however, an asylum officer determined Petitioner's fear was not sufficient to qualify for asylum. Petitioner then sought review of this decision and on July 9, 2018, an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") affirmed the decision of the asylum officer and ordered that the case be returned to the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") \"for removal of the alien.\" (ECF No. 12-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 13, 2018, Petitioner filed a \u00a7 2241 Habeas Corpus Petition (ECF No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   1), along with an Emergency Motion for Injunctive Relief (ECF No. 2).

Petitioner seeks a stay of the removal proceedings \"until she has the chance to be included in her mother's asylum application before the Immigration Court.\" (ECF 2 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 16, 2018, this Court issued an Order directing that Respondents be served and that Petitioner not be transferred outside of this judicial district pending further orders from the Court.

However, Petitioner does not allege she requested to be included in her mother's asylum application and was precluded from doing so, either before Petitioner chose to proceed individually on an asylum claim or after she did so.
