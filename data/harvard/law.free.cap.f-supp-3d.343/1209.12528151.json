(Doc. 1, at \u00b6 20); (Doc. 1-1). Defendant is a third-party debt collector with which Excel Medical Imaging, P.L. placed Plaintiff's account for collection. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 21-22); (Doc. 1-1). In connection with collecting on Plaintiff's debt, on October 26, 2017, Defendant sent Plaintiff a collection notice (\"\n   <strong>\n    First Collection Notice\n   </strong>\n   \").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23; (Doc. 1-1). This collection notice was Defendant's first communication to Plaintiff with respect to the debt. (Doc. 1, at \u00b6 25). The notice explained that Plaintiff's debt with Excel Medical Imaging, P.L. in the amount of $1,743.75 had been referred to Defendant for collections. (Doc. 1-1). The notice further explained that Defendant had been \"authorized to use any means at [its] disposal, within the limits of the law, necessary to collect the full balance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The notice requested that Plaintiff contact Defendant via telephone to make payment, which Defendant explained could be made by credit card, check, or\n   money order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The notice advised that \"if [Defendant] did not receive payment promptly [it would] be forced to take additional action to [collect the debt].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The notice further advised:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   This is an attempt to collect a debt and any information obtained will be used for that purpose. Unless you notify this office within 30 days after receiving this notice that you dispute the validity of this debt or any portion thereof, this office will; [sic] assume this debt is valid. If you do notify this office in writing within 30 days from receiving this notice, this office will obtain verification of the debt or obtain a copy of a judgment and mail you a copy of such judgment or verification. If you request, in writing within 30 days after receiving this notice, this office will provide you with the name and address of the original creditor, if different from the current creditor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Because Plaintiff is disabled and on a fixed income, she was unable to remit payment of the debt. (Doc. 1, at \u00b6 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Subsequently, on December 20, 2017, Defendant sent Plaintiff a second collection notice (\"\n   <strong>\n    Second Collection Notice\n   </strong>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32; (Doc. 1-2). Defendant's Second Collection Notice was, in all relevant respects, identical to its First Collection Notice.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 1-1)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 1-2). Prior to sending the Second Collection Notice, Defendant had not taken any additional action to collect on the debt. (Doc. 1, at \u00b6 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff commenced this putative class action by filing a two-count, civil complaint on March 27, 2018 pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"\n   <strong>\n    FDCPA\n   </strong>\n   \") (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Act\n   </strong>\n   \"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 1). Count I alleges that the threat of additional action and demand for immediate payment in Defendant's First Collection Notice \"overshadowed\" Plaintiff's right to dispute and request verification of the debt within thirty days, violating 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g(b). (Doc. 1, at \u00b6\u00b6 63-79). Count II alleges that, by stating that Plaintiff had an additional thirty-day period in which she could dispute the debt, Defendant's Second Collection Notice is misleading or may confuse the \"least sophisticated consumer\" as to his or her rights, violating 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(10) (\"\n   <strong>\n    Verification Period Violation\n   </strong>\n   \" claim). (Doc. 1, at \u00b6\u00b6 80-85). Count II further alleges that, by advising that Defendant had been authorized to use any legal means necessary to collect the debt, and that, if it did not receive prompt payment, Defendant would take \"additional action\" to collect the debt, Defendant's First Collection Notice conveyed a \"false sense of urgency,\" violating 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(10), since Defendant did not actually take subsequent legal action but, instead, simply sent Plaintiff the Second Collection Notice two months later (\"\n   <strong>\n    False Sense of Urgency\n   </strong>\n   \" claim). (Doc. 1, at \u00b6\u00b6 86-90).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After an agreed upon extension of time, Defendant filed its answer and affirmative defenses to Plaintiff's complaint on May 23, 2018, denying the bulk of Plaintiff's allegations and raising one affirmative defense to liability.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 13). Defendant then filed its Motion on June 27, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 21). Through its Motion, Defendant contends that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because neither of its Collection Notices violated Section 1692g(b) or 1692e(10).\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 21). Specifically, Defendant argues that nothing in the First Collection Notice overshadowed the required statutory disclosures regarding Plaintiff's right to dispute the debt within thirty days in violation of Section 1692g(b).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    at 4-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant\n   further argues that sending successive collection notices, each of which contain thirty-day validation notices, does not mislead or deceive the \"least sophisticated consumer\" in violation of Section 1692e(10).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    at 5-6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, Defendant argues that the language contained in its First Collection Notice would not convey a false sense of urgency to the \"least sophisticated\" consumer in violation of Section 1692e(10).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    at 6-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff filed her Response on July 11, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 23). In opposition, Plaintiff argues that that the language in Defendant's First Collection Notice \"demanding immediate payment and threatening legal action overshadowed the [required statutory disclosures].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    at 3-6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff further argues that Defendant's Second Collection Notice, on its face, would tend to mislead the \"least sophisticated consumer\" into believing that he or she had an additional thirty days to dispute the debt.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    at 9-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, Plaintiff argues that Defendant's implicit threat of potential legal action in the First Collection Notice if prompt payment was not made would convey a \"false sense of urgency\" to the \"least sophisticated consumer,\" since Defendant, in fact, did not initiate subsequent legal proceedings, but merely sent a follow-up collection notice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    at 7-9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant's Motion is fully briefed and ripe for decision.

To that end, Section 1692g requires that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [w]ithin five days after the initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt, a debt collector shall, unless the following information is contained in the initial communication or the consumer has paid the debt, send the consumer a written notice containing:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (1) the amount of the debt;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (2) the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (3) a statement that unless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice, disputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (4) a statement that if the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, the debt collector will obtain verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment against the consumer and a copy of such verification or judgment will be mailed to the consumer by the debt collector; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (5) a statement that, upon the consumer's written request within the thirty-day period, the debt collector will provide the consumer with the name and address of the original creditor, if different from the current creditor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1692g(a)(1)-(5).

Indeed, several other district courts around the country have ruled likewise.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Vaughn v. CSC Credit Services, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   No. 93-cv-4151,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1995%20WL%2051402\">\n    1995 WL 51402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D.

Here, Defendant's First Collection Notice indicated that Plaintiff could (if not should) \"resolve [the] matter\n   <em>\n    immediately\n   </em>\n   \" by contacting Defendant to make payment. (Doc. 1-1) (emphasis added). Additionally, the notice advised of (if not threatened) \"additional action\" if Defendant did not \"receive payment\n   <em>\n    promptly\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8920680\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/389/1034/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Therefore, the Court finds that the First Collection Notice's request for immediate action and prompt payment, coupled with threats of legal action, overshadow and are inconsistent with the debt validation notice advising Plaintiff of her right to challenge the debt within thirty days. Because the First Collection Notice \"leaves the door open to an inaccurate, but reasonable, interpretation by an unsophisticated consumer, it \"is confusing and therefore violates \u00a7 1692g.\"\n   <em>\n    Francis v. Snyder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8920680\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/389/1034/\">\n    389 F.Supp.2d 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1040 (N.D.

Accordingly, Defendant is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Plaintiff's Section 1692g(b) claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Conversely, however, having no cause to look outside the four corners of the pleadings to decide that Defendant's First Collection Notice violated Section 1692g(b), it appears that it is, in fact,\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff\n   </em>\n   who is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on her Section 1692g(b) claim. But Plaintiff has not so moved. Accordingly, the Court will direct Defendant to show cause, as detailed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , why judgment should not be entered in Plaintiff's favor on her Section 1692g(b) claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiff's 1692e(10) Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated Section 1692e(10) in two distinct respects. The Court will address each sub-claim independently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    1. Plaintiff's Verification Period Violation claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendant's Second Collection Notice is misleading or may confuse the least sophisticated consumer as to his or her rights by stating that Plaintiff had an additional thirty-day period in which she could dispute the debt. (Doc. 1, at \u00b6\u00b6 80-85). The Court disagrees. As explained,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(10), \"[a] debt collector may not use any false representation or deceptive means to collect any debt[.]\" Plaintiff argues Defendant's Collection Notices violate this section because the Second Collection Notice misrepresents the thirty-day time period to dispute the debt (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that it gave Plaintiff the false impression that she had more than thirty days to dispute the debt). (Doc. 23, at 9-15). Several district courts, both in this circuit and others, have rejected this same contention and granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of the defendant debt collector.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gesten v.

Both Collection Notices provided the required statutory FDCPA disclosures and did not diminish Plaintiff's rights to dispute the debt; the Second Collection Notice \"only extended the 30-day period, and there is no factual allegation [in the complaint] to suggest otherwise.\"\n   <em>\n    Bridges\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%208773340\">\n    2015 WL 8773340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gesten\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4069163\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/57/1381/#p1385\">\n    57 F.Supp.3d at 1386-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.

Therefore, the Court finds that Defendant's Second Collection Notice did not violate Section 1692e(10).

(Doc. 1, at \u00b6\u00b6 86-90). This, Plaintiff alleges, is evidenced by the fact that Defendant\n   <em>\n    did not\n   </em>\n   take subsequent legal action when Plaintiff failed to remit payment after expiration of the thirty-day period, but merely sent Plaintiff the Second Collection Notice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4069163\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/57/1381/#p1385\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant argues that,\n   <em>\n    as a matter of law\n   </em>\n   , its Collection Notices did not create a false sense of urgency.

The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \" Section 1692e was enacted against a backdrop of cases in which courts held that communications designed to create a false sense of urgency were deceptive.\"\n   <em>\n    Peter v.
