The Court held a hearing on August 8, 2018. The primary issues are: (i) whether time that the Plaintiffs' counsel Mr. Olsi Vrapi spent in\n   connection with the administrative adjudication of the immigration petitions underlying the case is compensable; (ii) whether to approve the proposed hourly fee rates of the Plaintiffs' counsel, which are higher than the hourly rates the Plaintiffs' counsel billed to the Plaintiffs, and are higher than the prevailing market rate, because the Plaintiffs did not provide evidence that the hourly rates of the Plaintiffs' counsel are reasonable as\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   requires; (iii) whether to discount the paralegal fees to $55.00 an hour; (iv) whether certain alleged costs are compensable, such as clerical tasks; (v) whether to award fees for hours that would not ordinarily be billed to the client; (vi) whether to award fees for hours billed by Mr. John Boyd and Ms. Nancy Hollander, counsel from the Freedman Boyd Hollander Goldberg Urias &amp; Ward P.A. firm, with whom the Defendants' counsel never had any interactions; (vii) whether to award fees for the Plaintiffs' counsel Ms. Sarah Thomas, whose hourly rate, role in the case, and years of experience are not discussed in the Motion; and (viii) whether fees and costs related to the Plaintiffs' preparation of the Motion are compensable. The Court will award fees as the Motion requests but will reduce the award by: (i) lowering the paralegal fees by $1,230.00; and (ii) lowering the costs by $510.63. The Court will also adjust the total award request by applying the current gross receipts tax rate. Accordingly, the Court will grant in part and deny in part the Motion, and the Court will award fees and costs in the amount of $50,577.48. Gross receipts tax on this amount is $3,982.98. The total award is $54,560.46, and the Defendants shall pay that amount to the Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uni\u00e3o Do Vegetal in the United States (called \"UDV\" by its members and the Court) is a Christian spiritualist religious organization.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint for Declaratory Judgment, Injunctive Relief, and Writ of Mandamus \u00b6 15, at 7, filed November 14, 2017 (Doc. 1)(\"Complaint\"). Plaintiff Jose Carlos Garcia holds a high-level clerical position in UDV, \"akin to a Cardinal of the Catholic Church,\" and \"has been a member and leader in the organization for decades.\" Complaint \u00b6 16, at 7. Plaintiff Danielle Hounsell Silvia Garcia is his wife.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 17, at 7.

Collectively, they are the Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This case is about the Defendants' denial of the Plaintiffs' request, in a petition for a religious visa for Plaintiff Jose Carlos Garcia (\"Garcia\"), for an exemption under the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act of 1993 \u00a7 3, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-1 (2006) (\"RFRA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, at 1-2. UDV had twice successfully petitioned for Garcia to obtain a religious visa (\"R-1 visa\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and status\n   with the Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 1. Both petitions were approved with an implicit grant of an RFRA exemption, because United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") regulations require that ministers be compensated, whereas a central tenet of UDV's faith is the non-compensation of ministers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 1. When the Plaintiffs filed a third petition for an R-1 visa on behalf of Garcia, the Defendant USCIS issued a request for evidence challenging the compensation issue, as well as issues that had been foreclosed by the Supreme Court of the United States of America precedent concerning UDV.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 1. The Plaintiffs responded requesting an RFRA exemption, and the Defendants denied the third R-1 petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 1. On July 1, 2016, UDV also filed an I-360\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   immigrant religious worker visa petition (\"I-360 petition\") on behalf of Garcia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response to Plaintiffs' Motion for Attorney's Fees at 2, filed May 8, 2018 (Doc. 30)(\"Response\"). USCIS issued UDV a notice of intent to deny the I-360 petition because of \"inconsistencies in UDV's record\" and UDV's failure to satisfy the regulatory compensation requirement\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.5\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (m)(10).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 2. The I-360 petition was still under consideration when the Plaintiffs brought suit in federal court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 2. The Plaintiffs asked the Court to: (i) \"declare the decision denying the [R-1] petition illegal\n   and order Defendants to vacate the denial and grant the petition\"; and (ii) \"order Defendants to immediately adjudicate the delayed [I-360] petition.\" Complaint \u00b6 2, at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Plaintiffs filed their case in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico on November 14, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint at 1. On the same day, the Plaintiffs filed the Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order And/Or Preliminary Injunctive Relief and Request for Emergency Ex Parte Hearing, filed November 14, 2017 (Doc. 2)(\"TRO Motion\"). In the TRO Motion, the Plaintiffs ask the Court to grant a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") and/or a preliminary injunction ordering the Defendants to grant the most recent R-1 petition filed on Garcia's behalf, and to adjudicate Garcia's I-360 petition within fourteen days of the Court's order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 15. The Court held a hearing on the TRO Motion on November 21, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Transcript of Hearing (taken November 21, 2017), filed December 21, 2017 (Doc. 19). Elaine Duke, L. Francis Cissna, Kathy Baran, USCIS, and the United States of America (collectively \"the Defendants\") filed a response in opposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Response to Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order And/Or Preliminary Injunctive Relief, filed November 30, 2017 (Doc. 12)(\"Response to TRO Motion\"). The Court held a second hearing on the motion on December 1, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Transcript of Hearing (taken December 1, 2017), filed December 15, 2017 (Doc. 17). The Plaintiffs replied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' Reply to Defendants' Response in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order And/Or Preliminary Injunctive Relief, filed December 7, 2017 (Doc. 14)(\"Reply to TRO Motion\"). On December 15, 2017, the Court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order granting in part and denying in part the Plaintiffs' TRO Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum Opinion and Order, filed December 15, 2017 (Doc. 18)(\"TRO MOO\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the TRO MOO, the Court considers the following issues: (i) whether the procedural requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"APA\"), apply to the TRO Motion; (ii) whether the Plaintiffs' RFRA claim has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (iii) whether the Plaintiffs are likely to suffer irreparable injury absent a preliminary injunction; (iv) whether the threatened injury to the Plaintiffs outweighs the injury an injunction can cause the Defendants; (v) whether the injunction is adverse to the public interest; and (vi) whether the Plaintiffs have met a disfavored preliminary injunction's heightened requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TRO MOO at 1-2. The Court concluded that: (i) the APA's procedural requirements do not apply to the Plaintiffs' TRO Motion, because the TRO Motion seeks injunctive relief under the RFRA and not under the APA; (ii) the Plaintiffs' RFRA claim has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (iii) the Plaintiffs are likely to suffer irreparable injury absent a preliminary injunction; (iv) the threatened injury to the Plaintiffs outweighs the injury an injunction can cause the Defendants; (v) the injunction will not be adverse to the public interest; and (vi) the Plaintiffs meet a disfavored preliminary injunction's heightened requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TRO MOO at 2. Ultimately, the Court granted an injunction, requiring the Defendants to reconsider the Plaintiffs' R-1 petition without applying\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.5\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (m)(10) -- the compensation requirement which the Defendants applied to the petition when first considered -- because the Court determined that applying that requirement to the Plaintiffs' R-1 petition likely violates RFRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TRO MOO at 45. The Court did not order the Defendants to make any particular decision on either the R-1 petition or the I-360 petition, because \"it is not\n   willing to impose upon federal agencies its judgment regarding discretionary decisions[.]\" TRO MOO at 46. Finally, the Court required the Plaintiffs to post a bond of $250.00 pursuant to rule 65(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TRO MOO at 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Because of the Court's TRO MOO, the Plaintiffs continued to pursue their immigration applications, now exempt from the regulatory compensation requirement that USCIS previously applied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 3. On November 30, 2017, USCIS issued a notice of intent to deny for UDV's I-360 petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 3. On December 20, 2017, USCIS reopened and issued a request for evidence for the Plaintiffs' petition to extend Garcia's R-1 status.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 3. The Plaintiffs responded to the request for evidence and to the notice of intent to deny.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 4. After the Plaintiffs responded to the request for evidence and the notice of intent to deny, USCIS extended Garcia's R-1 visa status and approved UDV's I-360 visa petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In March 2018, the parties reached a resolution, and the Defendants filed an unopposed motion for entry of judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Unopposed Motion for Judgment, filed March 23, 2018 (Doc. 26)(\"Unopposed Motion for Judgment\"). In the Unopposed Motion for Judgment, the Defendants stipulate that they provided the Plaintiffs all the relief sought in the suit and therefore request entry of judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Unopposed Motion for Judgment at 2. The Court entered an Order and Judgment, filed March 26, 2018 (Doc. 27).

Plaintiffs' Timekeeping and Expense Tracking Table at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Plaintiffs assert that the attorneys' rates are reasonable and appropriate in light of their experience, their reputation, and the case's complexity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 3. The Plaintiffs further contend that all the work which the Plaintiffs' counsel expended in this case is in furtherance of the overall goals of the relief they sought in the Complaint, which they fully achieved in the Court's Final Judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 3. Mr. Vrapi asserts, in his declaration, that he charges his clients and routinely receives $300.00 per hour for his legal services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Vrapi Decl. \u00b6 13, at 4. Mr. Vrapi asserts, however, that the fair market value of the legal services which he rendered on the Plaintiffs' behalf is $350.00 and, therefore, the Plaintiffs should receive $350.00 per hour for legal services rendered. Mr. Davis asserts, in his declaration, that, in his estimation, an hourly rate of $350.00 for Mr. Vrapi's services is fair and reasonable \"insofar as it compares to the market rates for lawyers of comparable skill and experience in the New Mexico legal community.\" Davis Decl. \u00b6 12, at 5. Mr. Davis bases his judgment in this regard on his\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   personal knowledge of Mr. Vrapi's skill and experience and in particular his highly developed skill and experience in the unique and complex confluence of civil rights and immigration law as he so ably litigated in this case, his reputation in the legal community in New Mexico, and on the current prevailing hourly rates in the New Mexico legal community and [on] hourly rates set by the federal and state district courts in New Mexico in other fee award opinions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Davis Decl. \u00b6 12, at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Mr. Davis concedes that, in his experience, lawyers who have been awarded fees at the hourly rate of $350.00, as Mr. Vrapi requests, are lawyers with experience in the range of fifteen to twenty years, as compared to Mr. Vrapi's eleven years of experience as a lawyer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Davis Decl. \u00b6 16, at 7. Mr. Davis asserts, however, that\n   Mr. Vrapi's \"unique skills and demonstrable experience\" lead to the conclusion that his hourly rate should not be determined simply by looking at the number of years of experience he has. Davis Decl. \u00b6 16, at 7. By way of comparison, Mr. Davis -- who has been licensed to practice law in the State of New Mexico since 1978 -- offers that his current hourly rate is $425.00 and that, from 2015 through 2017, his hourly rate was $400.00.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Davis Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 13, at 1, 5.

When the Court granted the Plaintiffs preliminary injunctive relief, the Defendants contend, the Plaintiffs received everything to which they were entitled under the RFRA and could allege no continuing harm to any other statutory RFRA right.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 6-7. The Defendants argue, therefore, that subsequent administrative work that the Plaintiffs' counsel performed to apply for the visa petitions was not necessary \"to the vindication of Plaintiffs' RFRA right to apply for a visa petition without having to satisfy the regulatory compensation requirement.\" Response at 7. The Defendants assert that, because the Court held that it would \"not order the Defendants to make any particular decision on either petition,\" USCIS' administrative adjudication of the Plaintiffs' visa petitions after the Court issued the TRO MOO is not relevant to the litigation of the TRO.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 7.

The Defendants argue that the fee applicant -- the Plaintiffs -- bears the burden of showing that his or her attorneys' hourly rates are reasonable through \"satisfactory evidence -- in addition to the attorney's own affidavit -- that the requested rates are in line with those prevailing in the community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably compared skill, experience, and reputation.\" Response at 9. The Defendants assert that the Supreme Court has stated that novel and complex issues, and special skill and experience of counsel, cannot warrant an increased fee award.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 9. The Defendants argue that where, as here, the litigating attorney's charged rates are incommensurate with comparable lawyers' rates, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has held that evidence of the rates charged only at the litigating firm and at one other firm is unsatisfactory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 9-10. The Defendants argue that the Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of establishing a reasonable hourly rate for their attorneys, because the only document which the Plaintiffs provide to establish a market rate is an affidavit which admits that $350.00 is the prevailing market rate for lawyers with approximately four to nine years more experience than Mr. Vrapi has.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 10. The Defendants also note that the Plaintiffs do not provide evidence that $350.00 is the prevailing rate for Albuquerque, New Mexico and, accordingly, that the Defendants argue that the Plaintiffs' requested rate of $350.00 is per se unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Defendants contend that the prevailing market rate on which the Court should rely is $230.00 an hour.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 10. The Defendants reference a study that the State Bar of New Mexico commissioned, which found that $217.00 is the mean hourly rate for New Mexico immigration attorneys and that $238.00 is the median rate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 10 (citing Research &amp; Polling, Inc.,\n   <em>\n    The Economics of Law Practice in New Mexico\n   </em>\n   49 (May 2017), https://www.nmbar.org/nmbardocs/pubres/reports/2017LawyerCompensationSurvey.pdf).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Defendants also allege, based on the same study, that the mean hourly rate for civil rights attorneys in New Mexico is $237.00 and that the median hourly rate for New Mexico civil rights attorneys is $227.00.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 10 (citing Research &amp; Polling, Inc.,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6208981\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/6/#p15\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Defendants argue that the Court should reject the Plaintiffs' request for attorneys' fees at a rate of $350.00 an hour, because Mr. Vrapi charged the Plaintiffs $300.00 an hour.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 10. To award $50.00 more an hour, the Defendants contend, would award Mr. Vrapi a windfall, contrary to Congress's intentions in enacting \u00a7 1988.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 10. The Defendants argue that, if a party chooses to pay an attorney more than the prevailing market rate, it cannot recover that difference through fee-shifting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 11. The Defendants assert that Mr. Vrapi has provided no evidence that he has particular experience in RFRA or civil rights litigation, warranting a reduction in his rate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 12. The $150.00 hourly rate for paralegal work, the Defendants argue, should also be discounted, because the Plaintiffs submit no evidence of the market rate for paralegals, and because the Honorable William Lynch, United States Magistrate Judge for the District of New Mexico, has found $150.00 to be a reasonable hourly rate for a law firm partner, not a paralegal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 12. The Defendants also argue that, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201920\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and D.N.M.

Additionally, the Defendants contend that clerical tasks such as proofing, organizing files, picking up documents, printing, photocopying, faxing, mailing, and converting documents to PDF format are not recoverable as attorneys' fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 13.

About Mr. Boyd and Ms. Hollander, the Defendants assert that they have not submitted declarations and that the spreadsheets regarding their work in this case are too vague to substantiate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 14. Further, the Defendants allege that their counsel of record never interacted with Mr. Boyd or Ms. Hollander.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 13. About Ms. Thomas, the Defendants also argue that the Motion fails to discuss Ms. Thomas' hourly rate, role in this case, and years of experience, and that therefore, Ms. Thomas's hourly rate lacks support, and that the Court should reduce or reject her fee request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Finally, the Defendants ask the Court to reject attorneys' fees and costs that the Plaintiffs seek for work done in relation to Plaintiffs' Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 15.

Because of paralegal support, Mr. Vrapi alleges, he was able to prepare for litigation in a short time and prevent his fees from becoming substantially higher.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Vrapi Decl. \u00b6 6, at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     The Hearing\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Court held a hearing on August 8, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Draft Transcript of Hearing (taken August 8, 2018)(\"Tr.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court began by indicating that it is inclined to award close to the hourly rate that the Plaintiffs request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 3:1-3 (Court). In support of its inclination, the Court noted that Mr. Vrapi has been a fairly significant civil rights attorney in New Mexico for many years and that the hourly rates for some of the top civil rights attorneys in New Mexico are now over $400.00 per hour.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 3:3-10 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Court next noted that $150.00 per hour appears to be high for paralegal rates and stated that it is inclined to award at the top end of what the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Mexico routinely awards for paralegal rates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 3:20-4:1 (Court). The Court referenced the Modrall Sperling firm, which the Court reviewed in the course of another dispute about paralegal fees and noted that the Modrall Sperling firm bills their paralegals at around $85.00 an hour, which the Court believed to be at the high end of paralegal rates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 4:2-6 (Court). The Court stated that it would require justification before awarding paralegal fees at a rate close to $150.00 per hour.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 4:7-9 (Court). The Court next stated that it is inclined to make some reductions for the clerical tasks, but that some of the administrative costs are likely recoverable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 4:12-17 (Court). Finally, the Court indicated\n   that, if the Plaintiffs consulted with Mr. Boyd and Ms. Hollander, the Court would not require much more than their representations that they did that work, to justify awarding fees for the legal services that Mr. Boyd and Ms. Hollander provided in connection with this litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 4:22-5:5 (Court). The Court stated its inclination to award fees and costs in an amount closer to the amount the Plaintiffs seek, than to the amount the Defendants propose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 5:6-9 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Plaintiffs responded by stating that $150.00 is the hourly rate that Mr. Vrapi's firm bills for paralegals and which the Plaintiffs paid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 5:20-24 (Vrapi). Mr. Vrapi then asked the Court if the Plaintiffs should produce a community survey, and then submit a pleading or notice to the Court describing what paralegal rates are routinely charged in the community.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 6:3-7 (Vrapi). The Plaintiffs informed the Court that they would leave determination of the clerical and administrative costs to the Court in its discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 6:8-10 (Vrapi).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As for Mr. Boyd's and Ms. Hollander's involvement, the Plaintiffs informed the Court that Mr. Boyd and Ms. Hollander have been representing UDV for many years, are familiar with the organization, and have a liaison at the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") with whom they attempt to reach informal resolutions of issues involving UDV.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 6:14-7:7 (Vrapi). The Plaintiffs asserted that Ms. Hollander communicated \"quite a bit\" with the DOJ liaison and reviewed with that liaison what the Plaintiffs planned to file in this case. Tr. at 7:10-13 (Vrapi). The Plaintiffs asserted that Mr. Boyd was involved in briefing, especially on the Reply to TRO Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 7:15-17 (Vrapi). The Plaintiffs argued that, because of Mr. Boyd's and Ms. Hollander's expertise, they were invaluable to the Plaintiffs in the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 7:17-24 (Vrapi).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Court then asked the Plaintiffs which fees incurred in connection with administrative work should be compensable and which should not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 8:11-14 (Court). The Plaintiffs responded that the paralegal work for preparation and productions for the hearing should be compensable, as should the administrative work in putting together the fee sheets for the Court's review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 9:1-16 (Vrapi). The Court clarified that its question concerned pre-litigation compensable work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 10:4-5 (Court). The Plaintiffs responded that work which the Defendants' conduct created, and which resulted in litigation, should be compensable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 10:18-20 (Vrapi). Here, the Plaintiffs argue, all the administrative filings are prerequisites of the litigation, because the Plaintiffs could not file suit without a USCIS decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 12:14-17 (Vrapi). Further, the Plaintiffs argue that the administrative work is important to the litigation, because, if the Plaintiffs had not completed it, the case would have been mooted and denied for failure to prosecute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 12:18-22 (Vrapi).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Court next asked the Plaintiffs why Mr. Vrapi billed them at $300.00 per hour, when Mr. Vrapi valued his work at $350.00 an hour.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 13:16-18 (Court). Mr. Vrapi responded that the Plaintiffs are valued clients and that their relationship with Mr. Vrapi is long, so the rate reflects client service, and not the work's value.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 13:19-14:1 (Vrapi). The Court clarified that the Plaintiffs interpret \u00a7 1988 as a fee-shifting statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 14:2-5 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Defendants then asserted that \"the Government's Number 1 issue\" is with the compensability of fees related to the administrative proceedings. Tr. at 14:15-18 (Genova). The Defendants argued that the Plaintiffs' right to be exempt from the regulatory compensation requirement, as the TRO MOO grants, was vindicated, and\n   that administrative proceedings after that vindication involve only the normal adjudication of the Plaintiffs' visa petitions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 14:21-15:3 (Genova). Those proceedings, the Defendants argue, are not related to the present litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 16:5 (Genova). The Court then asked the Defendants how it should determine which administrative fees are compensable and which are not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 17:12-23 (Court). The Defendants argued that the Court should award fees directly related to the litigation of the preliminary injunction and the Plaintiffs' requested exemption from the regulatory compensation provision but should not award fees for work done after the Court ruled on the TRO, and should not award fees for work done before the Complaint's filing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 18:5-12 (Genova).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Defendants next argued that the Plaintiffs have not done enough to substantiate an hourly rate of $350.00 per hour for Mr. Vrapi, when he billed $300.00 per hour, and when attorneys with four to nine years more experience than Mr. Vrapi routinely bill at $350.00 per hour.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 18:23-19:7 (Genova). The Defendants asserted that, reviewing the information from the State Bar of New Mexico, Albuquerque has some of the lower rates in the state of New Mexico and in the nation and, on average, immigration and civil rights attorneys bill at $230.00 per hour.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 19:7-13 (Genova). The Defendants argued that awarding $350.00 per hour would be a windfall for the Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 19:14-16 (Genova). According to the Defendants, the \"uneconomic choice to hire an attorney that is more than the market rate is not an expense that should be placed on the Government.\" Tr. at 20:1-3 (Genova). The Defendants asked the Court to award fees at a rate lower than $300.00 per hour, but noted that, even if the Court awards $300.00 per hour fees, the Plaintiffs' award would be reduced by about $18,000.00.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 20:7-12 (Genova).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Defendants allege that they are not aware of a DOJ liaison contact and received no communication from the DOJ.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 21:2-5 (Genova). The Defendants argue, therefore, that payment for work performed by Mr. Boyd and Ms. Hollander in connection with the administrative proceedings is not warranted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 21:9-12 (Genova). Regarding Ms. Thomas, the Defendants argue that her fees are related to administrative proceedings, so they should not be compensable, and further that the Defendants do not have information about her length of time as an attorney or what her standard hourly rate might be.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 21:13-19 (Genova). Alleging that more than half of the Plaintiffs' requested fees are for the administrative proceedings, and factoring in the reductions for administrative and clerical duties, as well as the proposed fee reductions for the attorneys, the Defendants allege that the Plaintiffs' requested award should be reduced by more than $37,000.00.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 21:20-22:1 (Genova).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Court noted that in civil rights and RFRA cases, the client does not typically pay the full hourly rate, because civil rights attorneys work on a contingent basis, and while they attest to a certain hourly rate for themselves, they do not ask that their clients pay it in full.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 20:13-17 (Court). The Court asked the Defendants where the rate paid by the client is relevant in this situation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 23:8-11 (Court). The Defendants respond that, in this case, there is evidence of the prevailing market rate, and that the case law permits the Court to use the prevailing rate as a starting point, as well as to look to what the attorney billed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 24:1-5 (Genova). The Defendants suggest that this case, therefore, is distinguishable from cases without a clear market rate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 24:6-10 (Genova). The market rate, the Defendants contend, should be a reasonable\n   rate to hire a reasonably competent attorney rather than a particularly high-cost counsel's rate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 24:14-18 (Genova).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Plaintiffs then replied that the administrative work was necessary to the litigation, because, although the Court ruled on the TRO, the case was still live before the Court when the administrative proceedings began.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 25:22-26:1 (Vrapi). The Plaintiffs argue that the administrative work was necessary to avoid further litigation and to ensure that the Plaintiffs' visa petitions were approved, and that the parties did not need to return to the Court for a review of another denied petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 26:4-9 (Vrapi).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Plaintiffs allege that the information for which the Defendants ask in their requests for evidence relate to payroll records and tax return information that would relate to compensation -- a requirement from which the Court determined that the Plaintiffs are exempt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 26:11-20 (Vrapi); TRO MOO at 45. The Plaintiffs allege that the requests for evidence and the Plaintiffs' responses to those requests in administrative proceedings arose from the Defendants' actions in the litigation -- refusing to apply the RFRA exemption to Garcia's third R-1 petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 26:24-27:2 (Vrapi).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Plaintiffs next argue that the Plaintiff's counsel, Mr. Vrapi, is the only person in New Mexico who handles federal court litigation of immigration cases and that he is one of the only people in the nation who handles RFRA/immigration law cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 27:12-17 (Vrapi). Accordingly, the Plaintiffs argue that they could not have picked their counsel from a wide selection of counsels offering different hourly rates for their legal services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 27:22-28:1 (Vrapi). The Plaintiffs argue that Mr. Vrapi's immigration experience is uniquely valuable and that, given his expertise, the fact that Mr. Vrapi billed the Plaintiffs at a rate of $300.00 per hour does not change the market valuation of his services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 27:12-17 (Vrapi). The Plaintiffs also offered to identify the individual in the DOJ with whom Ms. Hollander liaised.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 20:1-3 (Vrapi).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Court then asked the Plaintiffs how the administrative proceedings that took place after the Court issued the TRO relate to the enforcement or vindication of the Plaintiffs' RFRA rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 29:6-17 (Court). The Plaintiffs responded that their violated right is \"the right of the church to choose its minister and how they compensate or don't compensate that minister.\" Tr. at 30:18-22 (Vrapi). The Plaintiffs also alleged that the Defendants, after the Court issued its TRO MOO, issued a new request for evidence on a new issue, namely, the minister's experience, and for payroll records to prove that experience.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 31:10-21 (Vrapi). The Plaintiffs argue that this request gives rise to the same issue that the Court decided -- whether a minister must be compensated to be eligible to receive an R-1 visa.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 30:22-31:2 (Vrapi). The Plaintiffs argue that the Defendants also asked for the recapture of time, so that the petition would not become moot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 31:3-7\n   (Vrapi). In summary, the Plaintiffs argued, the administrative proceedings are directly related to the litigation and are directly related to the vindication of the Plaintiffs' right.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 31:10-13 (Vrapi).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Defendants responded that \u00a7 1988 limits compensable fees and costs to those expended on the present litigation, and that the litigation concluded when the Court directed USCIS to adjudicate the Plaintiffs' R-1 petition without the regulatory compensation requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 31:21-32:2 (Genova). The Defendants also argued that the Complaint raises an APA cause of action and not an RFRA cause of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 32:6-10 (Genova). The Defendants argue that the Complaint does not allege that any of the other USCIS requirements for the grant of an R-1 visa which would allow a minister to enter and remain in the United States are RFRA issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 32:15-18 (Genova). The Defendants allege that, if the Plaintiffs next contend that another USCIS requirement for the grant of an R-1 visa is an RFRA issue, they would have to amend the Complaint or to raise the issue in an entirely separate case and, therefore, the Defendants allege, the Plaintiffs' right is not about having the right to a specific minister, but rather is narrowly focused on the right to be exempt from the USCIS regulatory compensation requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 32:20-33:2 (Genova). The Defendants argue that the request for pay stubs constituted a request for proof of full-time employment, which is a separate USCIS requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 33:5-10 (Genova). The Defendants concede that the Plaintiffs offered different evidence of full-time employment, but the Defendants allege that the evidence offered was not sufficient for USCIS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 33:8-11 (Genova). The Defendants also contend that USCIS fully complied with the Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 33:12-13 (Genova). It is USCIS' routine practice, the Defendants contend, that it will rely on a single ground for requesting evidence or for rejecting a visa application rather than listing everything which it finds wrong in an application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 33:18-23 (Genova). The Defendants state that, although USCIS eliminated the compensation requirement, they did not eliminate the two-prior-years-of-full-time-employment-evidence requirement, and although that issue with Garcia's application was not stated earlier, it was not stated because of the USCIS practice of relying on a single ground rather than listing every issue with an application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 33:24-34:2 (Genova). The Defendants assert, ultimately, that the litigation ceased for the purposes of determining what litigation fees and costs are compensable under \u00a7 1988 with the December 15, 2017, TRO MOO.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 34:15-18 (Genova).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Plaintiffs respond that the two-years-experience requirement is directly related to the compensation requirement, because the relevant USCIS regulation provides only three ways to prove that a visa applicant has the necessary two years of R-1 experience: the first way discusses salaried compensation, the second discusses non-salaried compensation, and the third allows for no salary, but the visa applicant presents evidence in his or her own support.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 34:22-35:10 (Vrapi).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Plaintiffs contend that, because receiving consistent compensation constitutes proof of a visa applicant having the two requisite years of R-1 experience, the issue whether Garcia had the two years' experience is directly related to the compensation issue on which the Court ruled in the TRO MOO, and to the present litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 35:10-17 (Vrapi). Additionally, the Plaintiffs contend that it is not true that USCIS denies only on one ground, and that, if there is more than one ground on which USCIS can deny an application, USCIS lists all the reasons for denial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 35:20-25 (Vrapi).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Court requested that the Plaintiffs submit Mr. Vrapi's and Ms. Thomas' resumes to the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 36:9-10 (Court). The Court also requested that the Plaintiffs call Paul Fish at the Modrall Sperling firm and ascertain what the Modrall Sperling firm bills for their paralegals, and what range for paralegal fees the Bankruptcy Court routinely approves.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 36:14-22 (Court). The Court also asked the parties to ascertain what other firms bill for paralegals, including the Peifer, Hanson &amp; Mullins, P.A. firm, and the Rodey, Dickason, Sloan, Akin &amp; Robb, P.A. firm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 36:22-37:2 (Court). The Court also asked for more information from the Plaintiffs regarding the DOJ contact person with whom Ms. Hollander liaised.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 37:9-12 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Plaintiffs raised the issue of fees related to the litigation of the attorneys' fees issue, and the Defendants responded that those fees should not be billed to the Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 38:4-11 (Vrapi, Genova). The Court asked why the Defendants believed the Court should not award fees for the attorneys' fees litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 38:16-22 (Court). The Defendants replied that Supreme Court caselaw indicates that fees on fees are not permissible to the extent that the Defendants are able to trim some of that amount based on differences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 38:23-39:2 (Genova). In other words, the Defendants stated, the Defendants should not be charged for litigation related to the Plaintiffs seeking higher rates for attorneys' fees and costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 39:2-7 (Genova).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Plaintiffs then provided the Court with the contact information for the DOJ contact, Julie Straus Harris, and an associated address, Federal Programs Branch Room 6118, 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, D.C. 20530.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 39:13-17 (Vrapi). The Court then asked that the Defendants call Ms. Harris to ask her if she was contacted and to submit to the Court any additional information obtained from that conversation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 39:18-22 (Court). The Plaintiffs agreed to this process and informed the Court that Ms. Harris received a FedEx package on September 28, 2017, from Ms. Hollander, and that Ms. Harris and Ms. Hollander exchanged telephone calls before September 28, 2017, regarding this matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 40-1:4 (Vrapi). The Defendants responded that the September 28, 2017, date precedes the filing of the Complaint, and so the Defendants suggest that those conversations may not relate to this litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 40:5-9 (Genova). The Plaintiffs contend that the September 2017, communications relate to pre-litigation work in anticipation of the ensuing litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 40:10-14 (Vrapi).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Court reiterated that the Defendants could provide the Court with information following their conversation with Ms. Harris, and then the Court indicated to the parties that it intended to deliver an opinion in the October 2018, timeframe.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 41:4-12 (Court).

Whatever relief the plaintiff secures must directly benefit him at the time of the judgment or settlement. Otherwise the judgment or settlement cannot be said to affect the behavior of the defendant toward the plaintiff. Only under these circumstances can civil rights litigation effect the material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties and thereby transform the plaintiff into a prevailing party.

The Plaintiffs argue that, in issuing the notice of intent to deny and the request for evidence, USCIS was pursuing a new potential rationale for denial of Garcia's visa petitions, although USCIS earlier denied Garcia's third R-1 visa petition and his I-360 petition on only one ground -- that he had not provided evidence of compensation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 3:10-16 (Vrapi).

The Plaintiffs argue, therefore, that the administrative proceedings that took place after the Court granted the TRO and before the Court issued a Final Judgment, were \"square on point [with vindicating] that RFRA right.\" Tr. at 31:11-13 (Vrapi). The Defendants argue that USCIS sought information whether Garcia could prove two years of full-time employment and that, while having pay stubs is an easy way to provide that proof, in this case, the Plaintiffs were able to present other evidence of full-time employment which USCIS ultimately accepted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 33:5-11 (Genova).

Either way, however, responding to USCIS' notice of intent to deny and request for evidence was useful work \"of a type ordinarily necessary\" to secure the final result obtained from the litigation -- the vindication of the Plaintiffs' right to be free from the regulatory compensation requirement typically applied to R-1 visa applications.\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania v.

The Plaintiffs could not be certain, upon receiving USCIS' notice of intent to deny and request for evidence, that USCIS was not attempting to subvert the TRO's requirements by demanding proof of compensation through the guise of another requirement. The Plaintiffs needed to engage in administrative proceedings with USCIS to ascertain that the rights the Court granted in the TRO would be vindicated. The work that the Plaintiffs' counsel performed in connection with these administrative proceedings was necessary to the litigation and is compensable. The Court, therefore, awards all the Plaintiffs' requested fees for work in connection with the administrative proceedings before USCIS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    B. MR.

For example, one of Lopez' entries which the Defendants argue is clerical states: \"Call district court for Judge information, edit summons, and re-submit to clerk.\" Plaintiffs' Timekeeping and Expense Tracking Table at 6 (stating Lopez' entry for Nov. 16, 2017). While not always the case, paralegals, more often than secretaries or legal secretaries, submit summons to the clerk and call the court for judge information, and there is no reason to assume that these are non-compensable administrative tasks. Even more so, editing\n   the summons is a compensable and non-clerical task. The Defendants argue that the Court should disallow the fee for some entire time entries, because they include clerical or administrative tasks which are not compensable as attorneys' fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Proposed Attorneys' Fees at 2. Block billing, however, does not call for disallowing the entire sum, although the Court may reduce the overall amount.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

Dec. 1, 2007) (Browning, J.)(reducing block billed time by 30 percent). Many of the entries that appear, at first glance, to document mostly non-compensable tasks reveal that, on careful scrutiny, the few compensable tasks likely took up much more time than the many non-compensable ones;\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"[e]dit declarations and email to client for signing.\" Plaintiffs' Timekeeping and Expense Tracking Table at 6 (stating Lopez' entry for Nov. 30, 2017). Although emailing documents may not be compensable -- if that task is all which the paralegal did -- that task does not take much time and maybe no time or seconds; however, the clearly compensable task -- editing the declarations -- no doubt required more time than the non-compensable task. The Defendants specifically contest the Plaintiffs' request for fees for:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   1. 5.2 hours for a paralegal's attendance at court hearings,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   2. 15.8 hours from two paralegals preparing documents for the court hearing, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   3. 7.0 hours to redact documents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Response at 13-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The Court will award paralegal fees for attendance at court hearings, preparing documents for the hearing, and redacting documents. The Court concludes that these tasks are not clerical or administrative, but rather are fundamental to the role of a paralegal and are compensable. For example, the Defendants contest Norez' entry from November 21, 2017: \"Redact client information from Court exhibits.\" Plaintiffs' Timekeeping and Expense Tracking Table at 2 (stating Norez' entry for Nov. 21, 2017).
