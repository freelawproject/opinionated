Christensen, Chief District Judge\n   In this Order, the Court vacates the June 30, 2017 Final Rule of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service delisting the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem population of grizzly bears, and restores Endangered Species Act status to the Greater Yellowstone grizzly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court is aware of the high level of public interest in this case, as well as the strong feelings the grizzly bear evokes in individuals, from ranchers and big-game hunters to conservationists and animal rights activists. The policy implications of the Greater Yellowstone grizzly delisting are significant, but they cannot affect the Court's disposition. Although this Order may have impacts throughout grizzly country and beyond, this case is not about the ethics of hunting, and it is not about solving human- or livestock-grizzly conflicts as a practical or philosophical matter. These issues are not before the Court. This Court's review, constrained by the Constitution and the laws enacted by Congress, is limited to answering a yes-or-no question: Did the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (hereinafter \"Service\") exceed its legal authority when it delisted the Greater Yellowstone grizzly bear?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Fully briefed and at issue here,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Plaintiffs challenge the delisting decision under the Endangered Species Act (\"ESA\") and Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") on two primary grounds\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   : (1) the\n   Service erred in delisting the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem grizzly bear without further consideration of the impact on other members of the lower-48 grizzly designation; and (2) the Service acted arbitrarily and capriciously in its application of the five-factor threats analysis demanded by the ESA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court finds for the Plaintiffs on both grounds. By delisting the Greater Yellowstone grizzly without analyzing how delisting would affect the remaining members of the lower-48 grizzly designation, the Service failed to consider how reduced protections in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem would impact the other grizzly populations. Thus, the Service \"entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem.\"\n   <em>\n    Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

First, by dropping a key commitment-the commitment to ensure that any population estimator adopted in the future is calibrated to the estimator used to justify delisting-the Service illegally negotiated away its obligation to apply the best available science in order to reach an accommodation with the states of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. Second, the Service relied on two studies to support its determination that the Greater Yellowstone grizzly can remain independent and genetically self-sufficient. However, the Service's reliance is illogical, as both studies conclude that the long-term health of the Greater Yellowstone grizzly depends on the introduction of new genetic material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Congress amended the ESA in 1978 by defining \"species\" to include \"any distinct population segment of any species of vertebrate fish or wildlife which interbreeds when mature.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201532\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the continental grizzly bear was listed prior to the 1978 amendment establishing the distinct population segment, it was listed as the lower-48 \"species,\" even though the grizzlies living in the lower 48 states are not taxonomically distinct from those found in Alaska, which have never enjoyed protected status under the ESA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Plaintiffs contend that the Service violated the APA's reasoned decisionmaking standard when it designated the Greater Yellowstone grizzly as a distinct population segment, carving it out of the lower-48 listing, and simultaneously delisted the segment. They argue that the ESA obligates the Service to analyze how the delisting of the Greater Yellowstone grizzly affects other continental grizzly populations, which may depend on the Greater Yellowstone grizzly for continued genetic health. The Service represents that the lower-48 designation is nothing more than a \"historical artifact.\" (Doc. 203 at 44.) It goes on to argue that its decision to delist the Greater Yellowstone grizzly without conducting further analysis of the existing populations is to the grizzly's benefit, as the grizzly remains protected everywhere else in the continental United States, even in those regions in which grizzlies do not and never will live.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Plaintiffs have the better argument. As the D.C.

The Service's approach-evidenced first by this delisting and by its proposal to delist the other significant population, the Northern Continental Divide population-does not square with the ESA as a matter of statutory interpretation or policy.

Moreover, it is illogical for the Service to determine that, because the populations have not interbred for many generations-making them biologically distinct from one another-it is appropriate, without further analysis, to reduce the chance that they will interbreed in the future.

Second, it found that loss of the Greater Yellowstone grizzly \"would represent a significant gap in the range of the taxon\" because it \"constitutes approximately half of the estimated number of grizzly bears remaining in the conterminous 48 states\" and \"represents the southernmost reach of the taxon,\" extending approximately 200 miles south of the nearest population.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2057%2C698\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"[B]ecause there are several other naturally occurring populations of grizzly bears in North America,\" the Service concluded that the third factor-whether the segment is the only surviving population segment within its historic range-was inapplicable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2057%2C698\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2057%2C698\">\n    at 30,518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, for purposes of this Order, the Court assumes that the Service has the legal authority to create and delist a segment in one fell swoop. Rather, the Court's inquiry focuses on whether it must vacate the Final Rule because the Service did not consider whether delisting the Greater Yellowstone grizzly bear would\n   impact other grizzlies living in the continental United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Service concedes that it did not analyze the impact of delisting on grizzly bear populations outside the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, rationalizing this decision on the fact that the remainder of the lower-48 designation is still listed. The Service and the Intervenor-Defendants raise several arguments against application of\n   <em>\n    Humane Society\n   </em>\n   , contending that: (1) the Plaintiffs' arguments grounded in\n   <em>\n    Humane Society\n   </em>\n   are moot; (2)\n   <em>\n    Humane Society\n   </em>\n   was wrongly decided, and the Court should refuse to apply its logic; and (3)\n   <em>\n    Humane Society\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable.

The Service argues that these claims are mooted by its Regulatory Review of the Final Rule, issued following a comment period on April 30, 2018, after\n   <em>\n    Humane Society\n   </em>\n   was decided and the Plaintiffs initially filed suit.

The Plaintiffs have not explained why the Court can second-guess the states' but not the federal government's intentions.

The Service acted arbitrarily and capriciously by determining that the final Conservation Strategy need not provide for a recalibration mechanism.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   On one point, the Plaintiffs' challenges regarding regulatory mechanisms are distinguishable from those presented in\n   <em>\n    Greater Yellowstone\n   </em>\n   . As to the failure to include a recalibration provision, the Service could not \"reasonably conclude that adequate regulatory mechanisms exist to protect the Yellowstone grizzly bear.\"\n   <em>\n    Greater Yellowstone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3863025\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/665/1015/\">\n    665 F.3d at 1032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Under the ESA, the Service must make listing and delisting determinations in consideration of \"the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms,\" and it must do so \"solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201533\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(D), (b)(1)(A). Here, the Service recognized that recalibration was a matter of significant concern. However, rather than rationally consider and apply the best available science, as demanded by the APA and the ESA, it made a concession to the states to secure their participation in the Conservation Strategy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   As the Service explains, \" 'recalibration' refers to calibrating a new model's estimates for a given year (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 1000 bears in 2020) to the Chao2 population estimates generated for the 2002-2014 time period (average of 674 bears).\" (Doc. 203 at 91 n.17.) The Plaintiffs raise the concern that the states are free to adopt a new model, in which case the baseline population estimates upon which the Final Rule depend would no longer be relevant. In other words, if a new model estimates 1000 bears where Chao2 found 700, the states will be able to treat the jump in population as they would treat it on paper-as if 300 new individuals had moved into the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In the Final Rule, the Service represented that the Chao2 model may not remain the best available science but that it \"will continue to be the method [for estimating the population] until a new population estimator is approved.\" The Service argues that the Plaintiffs fail to recognize (1) that the Service and the states committed to choosing an estimator based on the best available science well into the future and (2) that the Interagency Study Team must agree to adopting a new estimator. However, the danger is not that a better estimator will become available and the state will choose to adopt it. The danger is that when science and technology progress, the better estimator will be indifferent to the estimates upon which the Final Rule stands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The Service was aware that recalibration was a matter of significant concern; as staff members wrote, settling upon a method of recalibration was a \"key commitment,\" and failure to do so would be a \"show-stopper,\" likely to result in a \"biologically and legally indefensible\" delisting determination. FWS_Emails_008087, 008546-47, 008455-56. A provision need not be overly detailed; it would be enough \"to just state clearly if the population estimator is changed [the agencies] will recalibrate.\" FWS_Emails_008546-47. In response to political pressure from the states, the Service dropped the provision despite its recognition of its importance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FWS_Emails_007744, 063366, 063383. As the Service's former grizzly bear coordinator wrote at the time, the Service's willingness to negotiate away this important provision constitutes \"a violation of the mandate of the ESA that the Service implement adequate regulatory mechanisms prior to delisting. There cannot be a vote by other agencies to determine if the Service follows the ESA ....\" FWS_Emails_063377.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The Service argues that Plaintiffs' arguments fail because: \"Chao2 applies for the foreseeable future, experts cannot 'recalibrate' numbers based on an estimation method that has not been identified, and appropriate safeguards exist to ensure that any future changes accord with the science and grizzly bear recovery.\" (Doc. 203 at 103.). Although the Court agrees as to the first point-that the Conservation Strategy anticipates continued use of the Chao2 estimator for an unidentified period of time-it disagrees that the Service's arguments save the failure to address recalibration in the Conservation Strategy. First, the Final Rule is equivocal about the commitment to Chao2, which has recognized limitations.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2057%2C698\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. at 30513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, while it is likely true that the mathematical formula for recalibration cannot be determined until a new estimator is selected, that has no bearing on the parties' ability to address recalibration as a general matter-even if it is only to state a commitment to recalibration. And finally, the Court does not question the commitment of the Service and each of the states to continued grizzly recovery; however, the general good intentions of the parties do not override the ESA's mandate that decisions\n   be made in accordance with the best available science.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Nor is the Court convinced that the risk posed by the potential adoption of a new estimator is too speculative or distant to require discussion within the Conservation Strategy. While it is true that the Court's review under the ESA cannot be speculative,\n   <em>\n    Bennett v. Spear\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651295\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/154/#p176\">\n    520 U.S. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 176,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651295\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/154/#p176\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651295\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/154/#p176\">\n    137 L.Ed.2d 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997), here the risk presented by recalibration is beyond mere speculation. As the Service continually asserts throughout its brief and at the hearing held by the Court, the Chao2 estimator is \"highly conservative\" and likely to underestimate population size. (Doc. 203 at 83-84.) Given that Chao2 is known to create low estimates, it stands to reason that a more accurate model would generate a higher population estimate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Further, the Service was well aware of the threat presented by the parties' failure to prospectively dispose of recalibration. Rather than maintain heightened protections in the face of a recognized threat to the health of the Greater Yellowstone grizzly, the Service accepted a \"compromise\" that was in effect a capitulation. FWS_Emails_007721-22, 63366. Because it was \"the strongest agreement the Service can get,\" the parties agreed that they would ignore recalibration and delete the \"best available science\" requirement for changing the estimator.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651295\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/154/#p176\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In return, the states agreed to continue to use Chao2 \"for the foreseeable future.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651295\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/154/#p176\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Service contends that the Plaintiffs misconstrue the record, which shows only that there was a healthy, robust debate about recalibration. (Doc. 203 at 59, 101.) However, the Service points to nothing that suggests that it considered the best available science when it dropped the recalibration commitment from the final Conservation Strategy. Nor does it point to any record evidence suggesting that concerns about recalibration were overstated. Indeed, all the evidence cited by the parties supports the Plaintiffs' position that (1) the Service and other scientists viewed a recalibration provision as essential; and (2) the Service chose to forego such a provision in order to get a deal with the states.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The failure to address recalibration is irreconcilable with the ESA and the APA. Of course, the Court cannot second-guess reasoned decisionmaking and must defer to the agency's designation and interpretation of the best available science. However, here all available evidence demonstrates that the Service made its decision not on the basis of science or the law but solely in reaction to the states' hardline position on recalibration. The Service cannot negotiate away its obligation to make decisions \"solely on the basis of the best available science.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201533\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The Service appropriately recognized that the population's genetic health is a significant factor demanding consideration under the ESA threats analysis.

As discussed above, the Service refused to analyze the issue of connectivity between the Greater Yellowstone grizzly and other populations, determining that it could isolate and delist the Greater Yellowstone grizzly because the other populations remained listed. Thus, for the Rule to survive scrutiny under the APA and the ESA, the Service must have reasonably considered that the Greater Yellowstone population is sufficiently diverse to support future generations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The Court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the Service, and it must reject the Plaintiffs' challenge to the degree that the Plaintiffs seek to substitute their interpretation of the scientific data for that of the Service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alaska Oil &amp; Gas Ass'n v.

Thus, it does not support the Service's reading that 100 individuals constitute \"the minimum effective population size suggested in the literature.\" (Doc. 203 at 110.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The Kamath study is similarly limited. It only states that effective population size may equal 42 to 66 percent of the total population, rather than the approximately 25 percent applied in Miller and Waits. FWS-Lit_005979. In the Final Rule, the Service applied the high end of the range listed in Kamath-66 percent-to determine that the Greater Yellowstone grizzly's current effective population size is 469.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2030%2C536\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. 30,536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Service offers no data supporting its conclusion that this number is sufficiently high that no intervention should occur unless scientists prove that the Greater Yellowstone grizzly's genetic health has already shown signs of compromise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Indeed, the Service admits these limitations, stating in the Final Rule that the current estimated effective population size is \"adequate to maintain genetic health in this population\" but that natural connectivity or translocation \"would maintain or enhance this level of genetic diversity and, therefore, ensure genetic health in the long term ... and benefit the [population's] long-term persistence ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2030%2C536\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Despite its recognition that continued isolation poses a threat to the Yellowstone grizzly, there is no regulatory mechanism in place to address the threat, only Montana's commitment to \"manage discretionary mortality\" between populations in order to \"retain the opportunity for natural movements of bears between ecosystems.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2030%2C536\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Of course, those natural movements have not yet occurred. Thus, it is illogical to conclude that the same opportunities for connectivity will produce different results in the future, particularly if one or both populations are delisted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   In short, the Service has failed to demonstrate that genetic diversity within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, long-recognized as a threat to the Greater Yellowstone grizzly's continued survival, has become a non-issue. Although the Kamath study suggests that the situation is not as dire as was once predicted, it does not support the Service's conclusion that translocation should be implemented only after the Greater Yellowstone grizzly's genetic health is demonstrably weakened. The Service's determination is arbitrary and capricious because it is both illogical and inconsistent with the cautious approach demanded by the ESA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The Service failed to make a reasoned decision, as required by the APA, when it delisted the Greater Yellowstone grizzly. By refusing to analyze the legal and functional impact of delisting on other continental grizzly populations, the Service entirely failed to consider an issue of extreme importance. Moreover, the Service's analysis of the threats faced by the Greater Yellowstone grizzly segment was arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   (1) the Plaintiffs' motions for partial summary judgment and motions for summary judgment (Docs. 75, 89, 182, 185, 188, 189, 191, and 193) are GRANTED;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   (2) the Defendants' and Intervenor-Defendants' cross-motions for summary judgment (Docs. 202, 208, 210, 212, 213, 217, and 219) are DENIED;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   (3) the Final Rule delisting the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem grizzly bear is VACATED and REMANDED; and\n   (4) The Plaintiffs' motions for a preliminary injunction (Docs. 251 and 252) are DENIED as moot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   (5) Plaintiff Aland's motion to supplement the final administrative record and allow limited discovery (Doc. 171) is DENIED as moot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    As an effort to resolve the present claims prior to a fall hunting season, on May 14, 2018, the Court bifurcated and stayed proceedings on all claims other than those brought under the Administrative Procedure Act and Endangered Species Act.
