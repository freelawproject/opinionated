Familiarity with the general background of this case as provided in previous opinions of the Court is assumed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The present case is a consolidation of many separate actions brought before this Court pursuant to the transfer order of the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (the \"MDL Panel\"), which was entered on October 4, 2012. On February 28, 2013, following the Consolidation Opinion, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint, which alleged violations of Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the \"Securities Act\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77k, 771(a)(2) and 77o.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Plaintiffs' consolidated class action complaint alleged, among other things, that certain disclosures made by Defendants, in registration statement effective at the time of its IPO (the \"Registration Statement\"), were materially false or misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 11, 2013, the Court denied Defendants' motion to dismiss in its Opinion of that date. Discovery commenced and, on December 29, 2015, the Court\n   granted Plaintiffs' motion for class certification pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, classifying two subclasses, one for retail investors (the \"Retail Investors\") and one for institutional investors (the \"Institutional Investors,\" and together, the \"Class\"), with certain exclusions as detailed in the Class Certification Opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Class Certification Opinion,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4140163\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/312/332/#p337\">\n    312 F.R.D. at 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Facts\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 1, 2012, Facebook, a worldwide social media company, filed its initial Form S-1 Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") in preparation for an initial public offering (\"IPO\"). (Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 1; Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 22.) At the end of the first quarter of 2012, Facebook had nine hundred million monthly active users (\"MAU\"), constituting approximately 13% of the world's population; of those MAUs, 45.8% accessed Facebook through personal computers only, 45.0% accessed Facebook on both personal computers and mobile devices, and 9.2% accessed Facebook only on mobile devices. (Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Around the end of 2011 and beginning of 2012, Facebook's senior management observed that Facebook users were using Facebook on mobile devices as a substitute for personal computer use.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 14, 21, 26.) Mobile devices allowed non-personal computer users to access Facebook and increased the ability of users to consume Facebook content more often and from more locations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 76-77.) Prior to March 2012, however, Facebook did not have any advertisements shown for users accessing the website on mobile devices, which limited direct revenue from mobile users. (Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 80, 88.) Up to that point, the majority of Facebook's revenue came from desktop advertising and fee payments associated with personal computer advertising as well as virtual and digital goods sales. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 11; Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.) Around the end of 2011 and beginning of 2012, Facebook had begun investigating the impact of mobile usage and its potential to cannibalize or supplement personal computer usage. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 18; Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 85-87; Pls.' 56.1 Response \u00b6\u00b6 85-87.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the months leading up to its IPO, Facebook adjusted downward its internal forecasted revenue numbers. On December 8, 2011, Facebook's Board of Directors (the \"Board\") discussed the IPO, selected Morgan Stanley, along with J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs, as lead underwriter for the IPO, and set Facebook's internal revenue forecast for 2012 at $6.6 billion with second quarter 2012 revenue forecasts at $1.53 billion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 19; Individual Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 4.) The Board met several times during the end of January 2012,\n   during which time Board directors discussed Facebook's latest draft registration statement, asked questions, and discussed disclosures. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Individual Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 6-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   By February 1, 2012, Facebook's annual internal revenue forecast was reduced to $6.23 billion. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 22.) On February 16, 2012, Facebook's Board was informed that revenue was tracking below expectations for several reasons, including that \"Canvas\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   traffic has declined, negatively impacting Payments and Ads revenue,\" \"[s]lower than planned uptake on Sponsored Stories driven by limited amount of 'sponsorable' content,\" \"Facebook mobile use increasing,\" and \"[p]otential softness in advertiser demand.\" (Rizio-Hamilton Decl., Ex. 34;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 23.) At the February 16 meeting, the Board also created a Pricing Committee for the IPO, which was composed of Andreessen, Breyer, and Thiel. (Individual Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On March 19, 2012, Facebook's annual internal revenue forecast was reduced to $5.6 billion. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 25.) When informed that this number was likely to drop further to $5.2 billion, Sandberg stated that this was a \"real problem.\" (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 29.) Around this time, in response to the observed revenue growth and revenue forecast decline, Facebook established a \"war room\" to analyze and address the trend. (Pis.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.) Members of the \"war room\" looked, in part, at the financial impact of existing and new Facebook users accessing Facebook on mobile devices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In late March 2012, Kurt Runke (\"Runke\"), Facebook's Advertising Inventory Manager and participant in the \"war room,\" circulated analysis regarding the declining revenue growth using data from late 2011 and early 2012. (Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 96.) As part of his analysis, Runke wrote that users who increased Facebook use on mobile devices varied in how their use impacted Facebook's revenue growth, but also wrote that \"the short-term impact of encouraging existing users to become active on mobile is that it will decrease our revenue\" and that it is \"likely that increased mobile adoption over the last year has reduced FB revenue by a few percentage (based on rough analysis of data, underway).\" (Pls.' 56.1 Response \u00b6 96.) Runke also stated that, as the number of desktop users increased, determining the \"impact of mobile on web monetization [was] not clear.\" (Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 97.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Members of the \"war room\" presented their initial analysis to Sandberg, Facebook's Chief Operating Officer (\"COO\"), and Ebersman, Facebook's Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\"), on March 29, 2012, which was subsequently circulated to Facebook's senior officers, including Zuckerberg. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 29-30, 34-35.) Shortly thereafter, on April 4, Zuckerberg wrote that \"everything here is going really badly\" and that Facebook's \"revenue projection has gone down so much we now think we might go public at less than $50b if things continue.\" (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 37.) A few days later, on April 9, Zuckerberg wrote to Ebersman that Zuckerberg was \"scared that we're just way behind in a few key areas. Mobile is the biggest, where Wilde will dig us out of the hole we're in but otherwise not be particularly amazing.\" (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On April 12, 2012, Zuckerberg and other Facebook management discussed the mobile usage trend with the Board at a dinner meeting. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Individual Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 13.) The \"initial analyses\" of the \"war room\" examined first quarter revenue \"drivers\" and stated, among other things, that the \"shift from web to mobile - can hurt revenue per user by as much as 25%\" and that Facebook \"see[s] a drop in revenue among users that increase their mobile usage (versus similar users that keep their mobile constant).\" (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On April 13, 2012, Facebook's Board received a presentation entitled \"2012 Financial Forecast Update,\" which noted that \"revenue was running lower than plan\" and indicated Facebook would issue a downward revenue forecast. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 39.) The presentation listed factors that \"ha[d] driven this change,\" one of which was an \"ongoing shift to mobile usage\"; the presentation did not state a quantification of the lost revenue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Defs.' 56.1 Response \u00b6 39.) Facebook's management presented to the Board a revenue forecast of $5.16 billion for 2012 and some of the \"war room\" analysis. (Individual Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 14; Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 65;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 42.) Members of the Facebook Board received a copy of the presentation and management's updates, which were reviewed at the Board meeting. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 38-40; Individual Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On the same day, Sandberg distributed a \"2012 Revenue &amp; Growth Analysis\" presentation to Facebook's Business Operations group that included slides stating that while MAUs increased, users were shifting to mobile, and that such a shift \"could hurt revenue per user as much as 25%.\" (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On April 16, 2012, Ebersman met with investment bank analysts underwriting Facebook's IPO (the \"Syndicate Analysts\") and informed them that Facebook had revised its 2012 annual revenue estimate to around $5 billion, with second quarter revenue earnings estimated to be between $1.1 and $1.2 billion. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 46; Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On April 23, 2012, Facebook filed an Amended Form S-1, which reported first quarter 2012 revenue of $1.058 billion, a 44.7% growth from 2011's first quarter revenue but a 6.8% decline from 2011's fourth quarter revenue of $1.131 billion. (Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 7; Pls.' 56.1 Response \u00b6 7; Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 51.) The Amended Form S-1 noted in numerous locations that Facebook's advertising revenue \"may\" or \"could\" be affected by users switching from using Facebook on personal computers to mobile devices. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' 56.1 Response \u00b6 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On May 3, 2012, Runke shared additional mobile usage revenue analysis, similar to prior analysis but with more data, with Susan Li (\"Li\"), Facebook's Finance Manager. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 55.) This analysis modeled a hypothetical number of Facebook users moving from a desktop computer to a mobile device, which appeared to result in a reduction in revenue site-wide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In the succeeding days, members of Facebook's management discussed amongst themselves how to address Facebook's reduced 2012 annual estimate to $4.9 billion and that revenue numbers had been declining week over week. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 56-60.) For example, on May 5, 2012, Li emailed Sandberg, Ebersman, and others, stating that \"we have been seeing ongoing softness since Tuesday evening causing revenue to be down roughly 5% week over week and the ads team plus analytics folks are actively investigating as we speak.\" (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 56.) That same day, Ebersman left a voicemail for Sandberg, observing that \"[r]evenue is actually down week over week which to my experience we haven't seen very often.\" (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In anticipation of its IPO, Facebook organized a \"roadshow,\" which began on May 7, 2012, through May 17, 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 62; Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 21.) Facebook's roadshow allowed Facebook's senior executives an opportunity to make presentations and market its IPO to potential investors around the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At the start of the roadshow, Facebook's senior management continued to discuss Facebook's revenue trends internally and concluded that the IPO should continue. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 64-67.) At the start of the roadshow, members of Facebook senior management, including Zuckerberg, Sandberg, Ebersman, and Li discussed the IPO; during the meeting, Zuckerberg texted his fiancee that \"[w]e still haven't figured out the revenue issue yet\" and that it \"may be a real issue\" because the \"decrease was as big as we thought but it is not continuing to decline ... it hasn't returned [to baseline] ... [i]t just hasn't gone down further.\" (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 65.) The parties disagree about the nature of Facebook's revenue projections at this time, specifically whether the estimated 2012 revenue figure was stabilizing at around $5 billion based on short-term \"levers\" used by Facebook's management to increase revenue in the short-term or if Facebook's strategy with regard to mobile was succeeding as a longer-term business solution. (Rizio-Hamilton Decl., Ex. 11 at 120:20;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 49, 66; Defs.' 56.1 Response \u00b6\u00b6 64-67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   During the roadshow, Facebook's executives, including Ebersman, Cipora Herman (\"Herman\"), Facebook's Treasurer, and Michael Grimes (\"Grimes\"), Morgan Stanley agreed to provide Facebook's most recent projections only to the Syndicate Analysts and, publically, to issue a free writing prospectus (\"FWP\") that would supplement a preliminary prospectus released by Facebook back on May 3, 2012. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 70.) On May 8, 2012, Grimes also spoke with Li and discussed Facebook's updated revenue estimates and Facebook's rationale for the revisions to the registration statement.

Later that day, Facebook filed an Amended Form S-1 Registration Statement (the \"May 9 Registration Statement\") and the FWP, both of which stated that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n    We believe this increased usage of Facebook on mobile devices has contributed to the recent trend of our daily active users (DAUs) increasing more rapidly than the increase in the number of ads delivered.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n    * * * *\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n    As an example, we believe that the recent trend of our DAUs increasing more rapidly than the increase in the number of ads delivered has been due in part to certain pages having fewer ads per page as a result of these kinds of product decisions.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n    * * * *\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n    Based upon our experience in the second quarter of 2012 to date, the trend we saw in the first quarter of DAUs increasing more rapidly than the number of ads delivered has continued. We believe this trend is driven in part by increased usage of Facebook on mobile\n    devices where we have only recently begun showing an immaterial number of sponsored stories in News Feed, and in part due to certain pages having fewer ads per page as a result of product decisions. For additional information on factors that may affect these matters, see \"Risk Factors-Growth in use of Facebook through our mobile products, where our ability to monetize is unproven, as a substitute for use on personal computers may negatively affect our revenue and financial results\" and \"Risk Factors-Our culture emphasizes rapid innovation and prioritizes user engagement over short-term financial results.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    (Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 13; Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 76.) Earlier drafts of the FWP written by Grimes had included additional language stating that: \"As a result of these trends and based on our experience in the second quarter to date, our current expectation is that revenue for the second quarter will be between $1.1 billion and $1.15 billion.\" (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 71.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    The same afternoon as the FWP's release, Herman made 19 calls to the Syndicate Analysts and read from a script that Grimes and she had prepared (the \"Herman Calls\"). (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 83; Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 29.) The script stated:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n    I wanted to make sure you saw the disclosure we made in our amended filing. We provided an update on certain trends in monetization-questions near term are the Q1 trends and if they are sustaining. The upshot of this is that we believe we are going to come in the lower end of our $1.1 to $1.2 bn range for Q2 based upon the trends we described in the disclosure. A lot of investors have been focused on whether the trend of ad impressions per user declining (primarily as a result of mobile) was a one-time, or continuing, occurrence. As you can see from our disclosure, the trend is continuing. Trends/headwinds over [the] next 6-9 months as this runs through the rest of the year, this could be 3-3.5% off of $5B target. You can decide what you want to do with your estimates, our long term conviction is unchanged, but in the near term we see these trends continuing, hence our being at the low end of the $1,100-$1,200 range.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Ebersman, Zuckerberg, and Sandberg were aware of the Herman Calls. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 84.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    As a result of the Herman Calls and Facebook's lowered revenue guidance, which the Syndicate Analysts understood to be caused by increasing mobile usage, the Syndicate Analysts reduced their revenue models; Facebook's lead underwriters similarly revised their marketing materials based on the new revenue estimates. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 87-88.) Retail Investors were generally not informed of Facebook's revised revenue estimates. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs.' 56.1 Response \u00b6 94.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    On May 13, 2012, in anticipation of the upcoming May 17 Board meeting, a presentation entitled \"Advertising Update for the Board\" was circulated amongst Facebook management, including Zuckerberg, Sandberg, and Ebersman (the \"May 17 Board Presentation\"). (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 115; Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 102.) The presentation contained analysis from McCombs, which stated,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , that: \"Mobile only users have grown rapidly while Desktop-only user growth has flattened,\" \"This is a key driver of which desktop PVs [page views] per user are down 12% vs. last year,\" and \"Estimated revenue loss from this migration of $200MM to $300MM in 2012.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) The $200 to $300 million estimate was a projected loss for all of 2012, and McCombs indicated that the presentation's estimates with regard to revenue loss from the platform migration was his \"swag at an\n    estimate,\" or a \"scientific wild-ass guess.\" (Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 103, 105.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    On May 15, 2012, during the roadshow, Facebook increased its anticipated price range for its IPO shares to between $34 and $38 per share, an increase from its earlier set price range of between $28 and $35 per share. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 108.) This adjustment aligned with Facebook's strategy to implement \"price integrity,\" which was an attempt to have the post-IPO trading price approximate the IPO price, within a discrete percentage band. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 104, 108; Defs.' 56.1 Response \u00b6 104.) Specifically, \"price integrity\" involves pricing an IPO high enough so that many top investors lose interest in participating, which would result in the stock price not rising as much following the IPO. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 104-06.) The following day, May 16, 2012, Facebook also increased the size of its IPO offering. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 110.) By this time, Facebook was generating revenue from mobile usage, although the parties dispute the degree to which Facebook was certain it would sustain mobile use as a revenue source. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 88-91; Pls.' 56.1 Response \u00b6\u00b6 11, 88-91.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    On May 17, 2012, the Board discussed the May 17 Board Presentation, which included McCombs' analysis. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 118, 121; Individual Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 23-24.) The Board learned at the same meeting that Facebook's revenue projections for the second quarter of 2012 and full year of 2012 were $1.1715 billion and $5.057 billion, respectively. (Individual Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 21.) On the same day, Facebook conducted its IPO at a price of $38 per share. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 112; Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 8.) In connection with its IPO, Facebook's Form S-1 Registration Statement became effective. (Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 10.) The Officer Defendants were involved in the drafting of, and reviewed portions of, the Registration Statement. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Individual Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 51-54.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    The Facebook IPO was scheduled to start at 11 AM on May 18, 2012.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    (Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 132.) Prior to NASDAQ's opening that day, orders to buy Facebook shares surpassed orders to sell Facebook shares. (Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 133.) Trading started late that morning, however, due to programming errors in NASDAQ, sell orders had outpaced and surpassed buy orders. (Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 134-36.) One consequence of NASDAQ's technical errors was a failure to deliver order confirmations timely, and as a result, certain orders became \"stuck\" and were only fulfilled several hours after being made and, sometimes, even after being cancelled; other \"stuck\" orders later put on the market ended up cancelled because they were no longer marketable. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 124; Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 139, 144-46.) NASDAQ's failure to process cancelled orders resulted in a short-sell order imbalance of Facebook stocks. (Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 147.) NASDAQ's technological malfunctions were fixed by approximately 1:50 PM that same day. (Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 139.) At the end of its opening day, Facebook's stock closed up, at $38.23 a share. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    )\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Starting after close of trading on May 18 and continuing through May 22, 2012, news media published articles stating that Facebook had reduced its revenue guidance during its roadshow. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 131-32, 140-44; Pls.' 56.1 Response \u00b6 162.) On May 18, 2012, after the close of Facebook's first day of public trading,\n    <em>\n     Reuters\n    </em>\n    stated: \"Facebook also altered its guidance for research earnings last week,\n    during the road show, a rare and disruptive move.\" (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 131.) In addition, Defendants identify articles, starting back on May 10, 2012, and published up until the IPO, that stated that Facebook was unlikely to \"meet their most optimistic projections\" and similar language. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 175-90.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    In the days following the IPO, Facebook's closing stock price fell. On May 21, 2012, the price closed at $34.03; on May 22, 2012, the price closed at $31.00. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 124, 133, 152.) Facebook's stock price remained below its $38 IPO offer price through August 2013.

The settlement provides for a $35,000,0000 cash payment to resolve the securities class action brought against defendants Facebook, Zuckerberg, Sandberg, Ebersman, Spillane, Andreessen, Bowles, Breyer, Graham, Reed Hastings, and Peter Thiel, along with the Underwriter Defendants.

The Complaint was\n    filed in 2013 (ECF No. 71), putting class members on notice of the strategic decision to exclude '34 Act claims. Neither Hayes nor the other Retail Subclass members brought an individual action against Facebook under the '34 Act on these facts, nor did the other class members.

Pls.' Reply at 14.

Hayes Objection at 1, 3-4. Because purchases and sales of securities are often executed by Nominees and not individual shareholders, Notice Packets could not have been sent to shareholders until they were identified. Pls.' Reply at 15. Following requests sent by Lead Counsel, over 325,000 potential class members were identified by Nominees for the first time after Notice Packets were sent to them.

Litig.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11075976\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/127/418/#p425\">\n     127 F.Supp.2d 418\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 433 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (considering the risk of non-recovery associated with contingency fee representation). This case, like others taken on a contingency fee basis, could have been dismissed or decertified at least once prior to settlement-resulting in no compensation for Lead Counsel. For that reason, and the reasons discussed above (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    discussion \u00a7\u00a7 II(iv)-(vi) ), the risks of litigation are established. They weigh in favor of approving the fee award.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    d. The Quality of Representation\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    The quality of representation in this case has been evident from the start. The two firms comprising Lead Counsel are nationally recognized as having substantial experience and expertise prosecuting complex class actions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Parties' Joint Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 130-136. The quality of Plaintiffs' representation is evident from the fact that Plaintiffs survived motions to dismiss filed by some of the nation's preeminent law firms. This factor, too, supports approval of the fee award.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    e. The Attorneys' Fees Requested in Relation to the Settlement\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    \"In determining whether the Fee Application is reasonable in relation to the settlement amount, the Court compares the Fee Application to fees awarded in similar securities class-action settlements of comparable value.\"\n    <em>\n     In re Marsh &amp; McLennan, Co. Sec. Litiq.\n    </em>\n    , No. 04 MDL 8144,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%205178546\">\n     2009 WL 5178546\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *19 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2009). As set forth above, courts in this Circuit have approved fee awards totaling well over 25 percent.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 VII(a) (collecting cases). This factor favors fee approval.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    f. Public Policy Considerations\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    \"When class counsel in a securities lawsuit have negotiated an arm's-length agreement with a sophisticated lead\n    plaintiff possessing a large stake in the litigation, and when that lead plaintiff endorses the application following close supervision of the litigation, the court should give the terms of that agreement great weight.\"\n    <em>\n     In re WorldCom\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8922795\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/388/319/#p344\">\n     388 F.Supp.2d at 353\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The public interest supports enforcement of fair and reasonable agreements that are the product of arm's-length negotiation by competent counsel and independent third-parties.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    For that reason, and the reasons set forth above, the fee award of 25 percent of the Settlement Fund is approved.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    ii.\n    <em>\n     Litigation Expenses\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    \"It is well-settled that attorneys may be compensated for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred and customarily charged to their clients, as long as they were incidental and necessary to the representation of those clients.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Indep.

Throughout this litigation, Lead Counsel understandably consulted with at least five testifying experts whose reports were submitted to this Court.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206971424\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    Other experts were retained to assist in gathering evidence, assessing damages, and conducting mock jury exercises. These fees, along with travel fees totaling over $300,000, are sizeable.
