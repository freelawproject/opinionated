Dkt. 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A number of Magana's arguments rely on his position that drivers who agreed to binding arbitration may now be \"deemed\" to have opted out of arbitration so long as a single driver opted out of arbitration, and so long as that driver is a named plaintiff in a putative class action.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 32; Dkt. 31. Magana seeks to add Jared Roussel, who allegedly opted out of the arbitration provision of the Agreement, as a named plaintiff in this action for that reason. Dkt. 31. The court first addresses this novel legal argument, as it underlies many of Magana's arguments with respect to the pending motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Magana's argument in support of this unintuitive proposition relies on a single case from the Georgia Supreme Court,\n   <em>\n    Bickerstaff v. Suntrust Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12441391\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/299/459/\">\n    299 Ga. 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12441391\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/299/459/\">\n    788 S.E.2d 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). But that case does not support his position for at least two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   First, the Ninth Circuit recently rejected a nearly-identical argument similarly based on\n   <em>\n    Bickerstaff\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-27\">\n   The first reason is that even if the arbitration agreements would otherwise be enforceable, Plaintiffs argue they are irrelevant here because the lead plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    O'Connor\n   </em>\n   constructively opted out of arbitration on behalf of the entire class. The sole authority offered by Plaintiffs for this proposition is a Georgia Supreme Court decision,\n   <em>\n    Bickerstaff v. Suntrust Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12441391\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/299/459/\">\n    299 Ga. 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12441391\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/299/459/\">\n    788 S.E.2d 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). The argument is unpersuasive for multiple reasons. Nothing gave the\n   <em>\n    O'Connor\n   </em>\n   lead plaintiffs the authority to take that action on behalf of and binding other drivers. Nor did\n   <em>\n    Bickerstaff\n   </em>\n   hold that individuals in the lead plaintiffs' position had the authority to make such an election for others. Perhaps more importantly, Plaintiffs provide no federal case law that has relied on\n   <em>\n    Bickerstaff\n   </em>\n   , nor could they. That decision rested exclusively on state law grounds and did not discuss the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    O'Connor v. Uber Techs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518618\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/1087/#p1093\">\n    904 F.3d 1087\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1093 (9th Cir. 2018). As the Ninth Circuit noted,\n   <em>\n    Bickerstaff\n   </em>\n   was based on Georgia's state contract law and the state's class action statutes, neither of which are applicable here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Second,\n   <em>\n    Bickerstaff\n   </em>\n   held only that filing the class complaint \"tolled the required time period for giving notice\" of putative class members' decisions to opt out of the class \"until a [class] certification decision is made[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Bickerstaff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12441391\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/299/459/\">\n    299 Ga. at 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12441391\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/299/459/\">\n    788 S.E.2d 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the decision tolled the right to opt out starting the day the complaint was filed, it could not allow putative class members to opt out whose opportunity to do so had already expired by the time the complaint was filed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12441391\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/299/459/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"Any member of the certified class who remains and does not opt out of the class will be deemed to have brought suit at the same time Bickerstaff's complaint was filed, which was within the deadline for rejecting arbitration for ... the class Bickerstaff seeks to represent.\"). Even if the Georgia Supreme Court's decision under Georgia state law to alter contractual deadlines to opt out of arbitration applied to the Agreement, the facts are materially different for Magana. Magana does not allege that he filed his complaint within the 30-day period during which he was permitted to opt out of arbitration. Nor does he argue that Roussel filed a complaint during Magana's opt-out period. Because Magana was unable to opt\n   out when the complaint was filed, Magana would not benefit from the tolling period that the logic of\n   <em>\n    Bickerstaff\n   </em>\n   , if applied, would support.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Magana does not dispute that he entered into the Arbitration Agreement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Plaintiff filed a response to defendant's statement of recent decision, in which he advanced arguments addressing\n    <em>\n     O'Connor\n    </em>\n    .

Compl. at 9; Dkt. 31-1 at 8. Those claims have the primary purpose and effect of redressing and preventing harm to DoorDash's employees. Indeed, plaintiff's argument makes clear that the injunctive relief he seeks would be entirely opposite of what\n    <em>\n     McGill\n    </em>\n    requires-any benefit to the\n    <em>\n     public\n    </em>\n    would be derivate of and ancillary to the benefit to DoorDash's\n    <em>\n     employees\n    </em>\n    (in the form of, for example, the company's increased tax payments and employees' possible decreased dependence on assistance from the state government). Therefore, Magana does not assert a claim for public injunctive relief under state law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Even if the complaint did seek public injunctive relief, the Arbitration Agreement does not prevent adjudication of public injunctive relief in any forum, because the arbitrator may adjudicate a claim for such relief.

First, the record is not sufficiently clear at this early stage of litigation to weigh the potential interference with the rights of the parties, especially considering the substantive, merits-based findings plaintiff's argument would require the court to make. Second, even if it violated the labor code, DoorDash's communication is not confusing or misleading-nor does it raise any of the other usual concerns weighing in favor of restrictions-and therefore does not merit a corrective notice under Rule 23(d).\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-76\">\n     For the reasons stated at the hearing, and because the filing does not comply with this court's local rules, plaintiff's notice of supplemental authority filed at Docket Number 43 is STRICKEN from the record.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"5\">\n    <p id=\"p-77\">\n     Adding Roussel as a plaintiff is not futile because he alleges that he opted out of the arbitration provision of the Arbitration Agreement. As such, it appears that he can bring his claims against DoorDash in court rather than through arbitration. Moreover, at this stage it does not appear to be futile for Roussel to attempt to allege claims on behalf of a putative class of those who have, like him, opted out of agreements to arbitrate claims against DoorDash.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
