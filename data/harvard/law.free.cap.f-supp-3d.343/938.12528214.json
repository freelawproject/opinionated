The Court has every indication that USCIS will deny the naturalization applications based on the notices of intent to deny. Thus, remanding to USCIS in this matter for a determination would only serve to further delay the district court's review of this matter and add an additional layer of administrative review through the administrative appeal process in a case where Plaintiffs have already been subjected to a lengthy delay and an appeal to the Ninth Circuit. \"Congress gave the last word to the district courts for delayed or denied applications.\"\n   <em>\n    Hovsepian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9287080\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/359/1144/#p1164\">\n    359 F.3d at 1164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The facts and reasons that were available to the Government have not changed since the initial inquiry by Plaintiffs. Nothing about those facts or reasons explains either the secrecy or the delay, and that delay caused unnecessary emotional trauma to Plaintiffs, as well as wasted legal fees and costs to file the instant case. The Government can and should do better than it did in this factual scenario.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    ECF No. 50 at 22-23.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    The Ninth Circuit in\n    <em>\n     Hovsepian\n    </em>\n    discussed generally that Congress' intent in enacting the Immigration Act of 1990, including\n    <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b), was to: (1) reduce the waiting time for naturalization applicants; (2) streamline the process of applying for naturalization and reduce the burden on courts and the INS; (3) promote consistency and fairness of naturalization decisions; and (4) afford naturalization applicants the power to choose the forum that will adjudicate their applications.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n     at 1163-64\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Defendants' opposition also argue that Plaintiffs have not met the safe harbor provisions of Rule 11(c)(2) which requires that the motion be served on Defendant at least 21 days to provide the opposing party an opportunity to withdraw or correct the challenged filing.

This is not the first time the Court has reprimanded counsel for circumventing the Court's rule on page limitations by filing lengthy declarations of counsel wherein he adds additional factual information and elaborates on legal arguments.

Much of the supplemental filings are repetitive and have caused unnecessary expenditure of judicial resources. If Counsel continues such practices, the court will not hesitate to sanction such conduct as this serves as Mr. Leitchy's second warning.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
