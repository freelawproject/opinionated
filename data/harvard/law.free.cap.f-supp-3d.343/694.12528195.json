Findings of Fact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff Philpot is a professional concert photographer, shooting approximately 150 shows per year. On October 4, 2009, he took a photograph of Willie Nelson during a Farm Aid concert in Saint Louis, Missouri (the \"Nelson photograph\"). Philpot registered the Nelson photograph with the U.S. Copyright Office on September 5, 2012, and received Certificate of Registration No. VAu 1-132-411 for a collection of works known as \"2009 Musician Photos.\" [R. 44-1 at pp. 4-5, Page ID#: 472-73] He published the Nelson photograph online on Wikipedia in 2011 as a way to boost his reputation as a professional concert photographer and increase his access to shows. Philpot offered a license to use the Nelson photograph free of charge for any online users who comply with the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic License (\"Creative Commons license\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   These terms include proper attribution to Philpot, that the licensee reference the Creative Commons license, and that the licensee provide attribution to the copyright holder in the manner specified, including name, title, and uniform resource identifier, all of which are provided in connection with the photograph file shared on Wikipedia. Though he could have, Philpot opted not to include a watermark on the Nelson photograph he submitted to Wikipedia, since Wikipedia discourages placing a watermark on images it uses for its website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant LM Communications is a media company that owns Bridge 105.5, a radio station in South Carolina.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lynn Martin (\"Martin\") is 100% stockholder and president of LM Communications. LM Communications also operated the website 1055thebridge.com. The defendant is a relatively small company, with only 4 or 5 employees during the relevant time period, although Martin owns several other radio stations and has been in the radio business for over 30 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In February, 2014, LM Communications received a request from AEG Live, a concert promoter, for on-air advertising for a May 8, 2014 concert featuring Alison Krauss and Willie Nelson. The agreed net compensation to LM Communications for that advertising was $382.50. AEG Live later purchased additional on-air advertising of the concert for gross compensation to LM Communications in the amount of\n   $500.00. Later in February,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant LM Communications posted a copy of the Nelson photograph on its website, 1055thebridge.com, as part of an announcement for the upcoming concert. The announcement included a copy of the Nelson photograph identical to the one from the Wikipedia page. LM Communications had a commercial interest in the concert, having sold on-air advertising to AEG, the promoter of the concert, but was not under contract to provide promotional posts on its website. Nonetheless, in anticipation of that concert, LM Communications posted the Nelson photograph on the community events page of its website along with other notable community events. LM Communications did not otherwise copy or publish the photograph.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Philpot did not provide permission to LM Communications to use the Nelson photograph outside of the scope of the Creative Commons license. There is no evidence that LM Communications posted the Nelson photograph on its website with attribution or referenced the Creative Commons license in connection with the Nelson photograph posted, even though it is clearly the same image shared on Wikipedia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Philpot discovered that LM Communications had used the Nelson photograph on April 29, 2014. Philpot took a screen shot of the image on the LM Communications' website, but did not contact LM Communications until November 18, 2014, when he sent a cease and desist letter. In this letter, Philpot asked LM Communications to stop using his photograph on its website and to take steps to assure that information regarding its use was not altered, deleted, or otherwise tampered with.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [R. 44-3 at p. 52, Page ID#: 542] LM Communications alleged that neither the announcement nor the Nelson photograph was visible on the LM Communications' website after May 8, 2014. Philpot contested this, but put forth no evidence to refute this statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Once LM Communications received the letter, the company immediately took steps to remove the Nelson photograph from its website. Kelly Bazzell, a now-former employee of LM Communications, either deleted the photograph from the website or instructed the company's website host to do so after the cease and desist letter was received. Bazzell made two screenshots of the Nelson photograph and the related items on the computer screen before deleting the post from the website. LM Communications never determined who made the original post, and neither party fully investigated whether the original source of the Nelson photograph contained attribution to Larry Philpot. Both parties acknowledged that the Nelson photograph in question most likely came from the Wikipedia page, and there is some evidence that the person responsible for copying it onto the website was an unpaid intern at LM Communications.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   LM Communications concedes that the photograph is the same image in which a copyright is claimed by Philpot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   LM Communications had no written policies or procedures in place regarding the use of potentially copyrighted materials. There is no evidence that a manager or someone familiar with U.S. Copyright laws supervised the use of photographs or other potentially copyrightable materials on the company's website, 1055thebridge.com. Given the small size of LM Communications, its employees were generally expected to go through Martin to get advice from counsel related to legal issues such as copyright protected materials. Still, there is no evidence that any employee contacted Martin prior to using the Nelson photograph. There is also no evidence that the person responsible for the original post knew that the image was copyright protected or knew that the action would constitute copyright infringement pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20501\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

He also sought an award of attorney's fees and costs under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20505\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   From the onset, this case has been wrought with discovery and other disputes.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   [R. 14; R. 17; R. 18-19; R. 21-23; R. 25; R. 36-37; R. 39; R. 42; R. 44] The Court resolved many of these issues in its Memorandum Opinion and Order dated July 10, 2018 (the \"July Order\") [R. 80] and granted summary judgment to Philpot on the issue of copyright infringement alone. In the July Order, the Court also denied LM Communications' motion for sanctions, denied Philpot's motion for attorney's fees, and denied Philpot's motion for summary judgment on LM Communications' alleged violation of the Copyright Management and Contributory Copyright Infringement Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the July Order, Philpot withdrew his claim for damages under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The parties also waived their rights to a trial by jury and requested to resolve the issue of the amount of damages via a bench trial. At the bench trial, the only issues before the Court were the amount of statutory damages to award Philpot pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), and whether to award reasonable attorney's fees under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20505\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court will address each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Conclusions of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Under the Copyright Act, a copyright owner may elect to receive \"instead of actual damages and profits, an award of statutory damages for all infringements involved in the action, with respect to any one work.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1).

Pursuant to \u00a7 504(c)(1), the Court may award a copyright owner statutory damages for each copyright infringed \"in a sum of not less than $750 or more than $30,000 as the court considers just.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). However, if the plaintiff\n   proves that the infringement was willful, the statute authorizes damages up to $150,000.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 504(c)(2).

May 9, 2017) (plaintiff, Larry Philpot, recovered $5,000 in \"willful\" statutory damages where the defaulting defendant published two of Philpot's copyrighted celebrity photographs on its website).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   With these factors in mind, the Court finds that an award of $3,500.00 is sufficient under \u00a7 504(c)(1) to serve the goals of the Copyright Act. First, the uncontroverted testimony and evidence at trial established that LM Communications reaped no profits from publishing the Nelson photograph and saved no expense. In anticipation of the upcoming concert, LM Communications posted the Nelson photograph on its community events web page along with other upcoming community events, but was not paid to do so. The gross compensation LM Communications received from AEG Live, the concert promoter, for promoting the concert via\n   <em>\n    on-air radio advertising\n   </em>\n   was a paltry $500.00. [R. 104, Def. Findings of Fact, Concl. of Law., and Op., at p. 2, \u00b6 7] LM Communications saved no expense by using the Nelson photograph because compliance with the Creative Commons license would have cost it\n   <em>\n    nothing.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Further, Philpot provided no evidence regarding the license fee he typically charged for use of the Nelson photograph, no doubt because the Creative Commons license required no financial payment whatsoever, but rather required only that the user provide attribution upon republication of the image.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is at least conceivable that the omission of attribution by defendant may have cost Philpot the loss of potential business since viewers of the Nelson photograph on defendant's community events web page were not made aware of the copyright owner's name, website and other information. However, there is no evidence in the record supporting the value of such lost opportunities. Consequently, the Court has no way to estimate actual damages, as a baseline for then assessing the appropriate amount of statutory damages. Indeed, Philpot's post-trial brief leaves blank the requested damages amount, and at trial he argued only that damages should be at least $30,000.00 given defendant's wealth and experience in the radio industry. [R. 104, Def. Findings\n   of Fact, Concl. of Law., and Op., at pp. 13-14]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Given that defendant reaped no profit and saved no expense by use of the Nelson photograph, and Philpot has failed to provide any evidence concerning actual damages or revenues lost, these factors weigh in favor of a reduced award. The fact that defendant's conduct was not willful also weighs in favor of reduced damages. Even applying the \"de facto treble\" award (or more) followed by other district courts, the award here would be small. Nevertheless, the Court is mindful that an award of statutory damages also serves the purpose of deterring wrongful conduct. Given that defendant's owner, Martin, owns several radio stations and has experience with copyright and licensing issues, the Court awards statutory damages in the amount of $3,500.00 as a deterrent to wrongful conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

While the prevailing party need not prevail \"in full\" to be awarded attorney's fees, the prevailing party must succeed on \"a significant issue in the litigation\" and \"a party's success on a claim that is purely technical or\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   does not qualify him as a 'prevailing party.' \"\n   <em>\n    Thoroughbred Software\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046100\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/488/352/#p362\">\n    488 F.3d at 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2007) (citing 4 Nimmer on Copyright \u00a7 14.10[B] ) (other citations omitted).

The Court's July Order was not a clear \"win\" for Philpot. The Order partially granted and partially denied Philpot's motion for summary judgment. [R. 80]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Fogerty\n   </em>\n   factors also weigh against an award of attorney's fees to Philpot.

The Court will also not opine as to Philpot's motivation, though the defendant has urged the Court to view Philpot's ulterior motives in bringing suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court instead will focus on the reasonableness of the suit and the parties' actions, along with the deterrence value of an award of attorney fees. Philpot's claims throughout this case suffered from underdeveloped evidence and discovery. A scan at public filings across the federal judiciary reveals that Philpot is no stranger to the federal courtroom. He has filed many lawsuits to enforce his copyright, often representing himself\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , so he is not a novice. And while the Court makes no judgment one way or another on this history, the Court notes that Philpot's evidentiary woes in this case are largely his own doing from the period of time when he was representing himself\n   <em>\n    pro se.\n   </em>\n   The parties and the Court have expended considerable time, energy, and resources to an action that is not complicated, but was made so due to the actions of the parties. Both parties filed numerous discovery and sanctions-type motions, necessitating the Court's constant involvement and oversight.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , [R. 14; R. 17; R. 18-19; R. 21-23; R. 25; R. 36-37; R. 39; R. 42; R. 44] At one point, Philpot was ordered to show cause for failing to appear for a telephonic status conference before Magistrate Judge Atkins. [R. 22] The Court also warned the plaintiff that \"failure to appear for a deposition or to otherwise fail to respond to discovery requests as ordered by the Magistrate Judge ... may result in his case being dismissed ...\" [R. 33] Likewise, both parties dropped various claims that were largely unsubstantiated, but only after the other party expended time and fees to address those claims. On this record, and after weighing the relevant case law and\n   <em>\n    Fogerty\n   </em>\n   factors, the Court declines to award attorney's fees and costs. Such an award would serve no deterrent value, consistent with the principles of the Copyright Act, but instead might\n   <em>\n    incentivize\n   </em>\n   the kinds of acrimonious and unreasonable litigation conducted in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The plaintiff's Motion for Attorney's Fees and Costs [R. 105] is therefore\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
