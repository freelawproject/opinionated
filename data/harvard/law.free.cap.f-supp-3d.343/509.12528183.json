Plaintiff, Freedom Medical Inc., is a Pennsylvania-based medical equipment sales company; Defendants are: Med One Equipment Services (\"Med One\"), a medical sales company; a family of corporations linked to Med One (\"Corporate Affiliates\"); and three individual (\"Individual Defendants\"), all of whom recently left the employ of Plaintiff to take new roles with Med One. The dispute arises out of allegations that the Individual Defendants misappropriated Freedom Medical's confidential and proprietary information to solicit customers for Med One; and, that Med One facilitated the misappropriation by poaching Freedom Medical's employees. On September 26, 2018, Freedom Medical filed both a Complaint and a Motion for a Temporary Restraining (TRO) and Preliminary Injunction. On October 4, 2018, the Court granted in part and denied in part the TRO. Specifically, the Court enjoined the Individual Defendants from divulging or using Freedom Medical's trade secrets, and ordered the Defendants to return any confidential or proprietary information to Freedom Medical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Presently before the Court is Freedom Medical's Motion for Preliminary Injunction. Based upon the parties' submissions and testimony elicited at a hearing held on October 23 and 25, 2018, Plaintiff's motion will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Freedom Medical\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Freedom Medical is in the business of renting and selling medical equipment to\n   hospitals, nursing homes and other healthcare providers. Particularly important to Freedom Medical's business is the relationships it has with healthcare providers that are members of Group Purchasing Organizations (\"GPO\"), entities that aggregate purchasing volume among member-healthcare-providers and leverage that volume to negotiate discounts with manufacturers, distributors and other vendors. Freedom Medical is a \"preferred provider\" of medical equipment for three of the four largest GPOs in the nation. As a preferred provider, Freedom Medical may submit bids in response to a GPO's request for proposals; if the bids are accepted, then Freedom Medical signs an Agreement with the GPO, guaranteeing that Freedom Medical will provide goods and services to GPO members under the terms set forth in the Agreement. Such GPO Agreements contain pricing and servicing information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   To maintain an advantage in the competitive healthcare industry, Freedom Medical has developed certain information related to its business, which it contends is both confidential and proprietary, including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , pricing information, business plans and customer lists.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Freedom Medical takes several affirmative steps to safeguard this confidential information. First, Freedom Medical requires all employees to acknowledge and agree to comply with an Acceptable Use Policy that restricts the use of digitally stored confidential information. Second, Freedom Medical requires all employees with access to confidential information to sign restrictive covenants at the inception of their employment. The restrictive covenants prohibit unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information. Furthermore, the restrictive covenants contain a global non-compete clause that prohibit employees from working for any competitor for a one-year period following the end of employment with Freedom Medical.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff brings suit against two sets of Defendants. The first group of Defendants consists of Med One, a Utah-based seller of medical equipment, and various corporate entities tied to Med One.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Like Freedom Medical, Med One is in the business of selling and renting medical equipment to hospitals and other healthcare providers. Although not a preferred provider for GPOs, Med One nevertheless sells and rents medical equipment to healthcare providers that are members of GPOs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The second group of Defendants consists of three former employees of Freedom Medical who left to take roles at Med One, namely Gerry Whitman, Joshua Oderlin, and Jason Cavanaugh (\"Individual Defendants\"). All three Individual Defendants\n   worked as regional branch managers at Freedom Medical before leaving to join Med One: Whitman served as regional branch manager of the Atlanta Branch Office; Oderlin served as regional branch manager of the San Diego Branch Office; and Cavanaugh served as regional branch manager of the San Francisco Branch Office. As regional branch managers, Individual Defendants had access to Freedom Medical's confidential information, including customer lists, pricing schedules, and Freedom Medical's business plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant Cavanaugh was the first to leave Freedom Medical, resigning on February 12, 2018. On April 3, 2018, Defendant Whitman left, and, finally, on July 6, 2018, Defendant Oderlin resigned. All three were hired to be sales representatives for Med One. Both Defendant Cavanaugh and Defendant Oderlin remained in their respective territories. Defendant Whitman, however, moved territories, switching to the Florida Panhandle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As of October 24, 2018, Defendant Cavanaugh was no longer employed at Med One. Defendant Oderlin, while still employed, was on unpaid leave pending an investigation related to this case. Defendant Whitman remains employed at Med One.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On September 26, 2018, Freedom Medical filed suit against Defendants, bringing the following claims: (1) Violation of the Defend Trade Secret Act (DTSA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201836\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , against all Defendants; (2) Misappropriation of Trade Secrets and Confidential Information in violation of the Pennsylvania Uniform Trade Secrets Act (PUTSA), 12 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 5301, against all Defendants; (3) Breach of Contract against Defendants Cavanaugh, Whitman, and Oderlin; (4) Tortious Interference with Contractual Relations against Med One; and (5) Breach of Fiduciary Duty against Defendants Cavanaugh, Whitman, and Oderlin. Plaintiff petitioned for various forms of injunctive relief, including asking the Court to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Enjoin, temporarily, preliminarily and permanently thereafter, Cavanaugh, Whitman and Oderlin from directly or indirectly using, disclosing or retaining any confidential, proprietary or trade secret information of Freedom Medical;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Enjoin, temporarily, preliminarily and permanently thereafter Cavanaugh, Whitman and Oderlin from soliciting, doing business with, selling to, renting to or servicing any current or prospective client, customer or account, who has been solicited or serviced by Freedom Medical or any affiliate of Freedom Medical within one (1) year prior to the termination of their employment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Enjoin, temporarily, preliminarily and permanently thereafter for a one (1) year period following a final order of this Court Cavanaugh, Whitman and Oderlin from working for any of the Med One Defendants, or any of their affiliated entities or any other person whether as an employee, consultant, owner, agent, or in any other capacity or manner whatsoever, for their own account or for the benefit of any person, that is engaged in any business or any service that, directly or indirectly, is in competition with, similar to or the same as the business of Freedom Medical;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 Enjoin, temporarily, preliminarily and permanently thereafter Cavanaugh, Whitman and Oderlin from soliciting any employee of Freedom Medical to leave his or her employment with Freedom Medical;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 Enjoining the Med One Defendants and each of their affiliated entities from continuing to employ Cavanaugh, Whitman and Oderlin in violation of the restrictive covenants contained in their employment agreements;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 Order Cavanaugh, Whitman and Oderlin to return to Freedom Medical all Freedom Medical confidential, proprietary or trade secret information and produce for inspection and analysis all their personal computers, smart phones, thumb drives and any other digital media storage devices;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 Order Cavanaugh, Whitman and Oderlin to provide Freedom Medical with a full, detailed and complete accounting of all communications each of them has had with current or prospective customers of Freedom Medical or any employee of Freedom Medical since the end of their employment with Freedom Medical;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 Order Cavanaugh, Whitman and Oderlin to provide a detailed accounting of all revenues attributable directly or indirectly to the activities of Cavanaugh, Whitman and Oderlin since they became employed by Med One.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On October 4, 2018, following a hearing, the Court granted in part and denied in part Freedom Medical's TRO. Specifically, the Court enjoined the Individual Defendants \"from divulging to Defendant Med One or any other person, company, or entity or using for any purpose any trade secrets, proprietary information, or confidential information belonging to Plaintiff,\" and further ordered the Individual Defendants to \"immediately return to Plaintiff any ...confidential or proprietary information of Plaintiff that is in their possession or control, in whatever form that information exists, including, but not limited to any physical or electronic documents and copies thereof, with the exception of documents and information pertaining to Defendants Whitman, Oderlin and Cavanaugh's personal compensation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court held hearings on Freedom Medical's motion on October 23 and October 25, 2018. At the hearings, the parties elicited testimony from the following witnesses: Michael Boylan, Chief Executive Officer for Freedom Medical; Jim Acker, Senior Vice President (SVP) for Freedom Medical; Phil Henry, SVP for Freedom Medical; Eric Wenzel, Chief Financial and Operations Officer for Freedom Medical; Brad Johnson, Regional Manager for Med One; Defendant Whitman; and, Defendant Oderlin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Winter v.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Freedom Medical moves for preliminary injunctive relief across a broad front, seeking to enjoin all Defendants for misappropriating trade secrets, enjoin the Individual Defendants for breach of contract and breach of a fiduciary duty, and enjoin Med One for tortious interference with contractual relations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Misappropriation of Trade Secrets\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Freedom Medical claims that all of the Defendants-Med One, the Corporate Affiliates, and each of the Individual Defendants-misappropriated its trade secrets in violation of both the DTSA and PUTSA. Accordingly, it seeks to enjoin all of the Defendants for the alleged misappropriation. The evidence, however, differs as to each of the Defendants-different Defendants are alleged to have taken different information. Therefore, an individualized determination is necessary as to whether Freedom Medical carried its burden of showing an injunction should issue.\n   <em>\n    Certainteed Ceilings Corp. v.

Jan. 29, 2015) (\"Determining whether particular information is a trade secret is a fact- and context-specific process.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Defendant Whitman\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Freedom Medical claims that Defendant Whitman misappropriated its trade secrets, when on April 2nd, 2018-the day before he left Freedom Medical-he sent himself an email, attaching four Excel spreadsheets that contained Freedom Medical's price schedules. There is no evidence that Defendant Whitman took or used any other information that Freedom Medical considered trade secrets. Thus, the question is whether the email and the four attachments are sufficient to support an injunction against Defendant Whitman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    i. Likelihood of Success on Merits\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   To be entitled to an injunction against use or disclosure of confidential information, Freedom Medical must show:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (1) that the information constitutes a trade secret; (2) that it was of value to the employer and important in the conduct of his business; (3) that by reason of discovery or ownership the employer had the right to the use and enjoyment of the secret; and (4) that the secret was communicated to the defendant while employed in a position of trust and confidence under such circumstances as to make it inequitable and unjust for him to disclose it to others, or to make use of it himself, to the prejudice of his employer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    SI Handling Sys., Inc. v.

Trade Secret\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The first question is whether the spreadsheets containing Freedom Medical's pricing information constitutes a trade secret. \"Although the DTSA and the PUTSA use different wording to define a trade secret, they essentially protect the same type of information.\"\n   <em>\n    Teva Pharm. USA, Inc. v. Sandhu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523502\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/291/659/#p675\">\n    291 F.Supp.3d 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 675 (E.D. Pa. 2018). That is, both define a\n   protected trade secret as information that: \"(a) the owner has taken reasonable means to keep secret; (b) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from being kept secret; (c) is not readily ascertainable by proper means; and (d) others who cannot readily access it would obtain economic value from its disclosure or use.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523502\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/291/659/#p675\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201839\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3) ; 12 Pa. Stat. \u00a7 5302).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Here, Freedom Medical has taken reasonable steps to keep its price schedules secret. In its Acceptable Use Policy, Freedom Medical defines pricing information as the company's confidential information and restricts the disclosure of such information. Further, Freedom Medical's employment agreements contain restrictive covenants that prohibit employees from taking or using confidential information, including price schedules, once they leave Freedom Medical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Second, Freedom Medical also derives independent economic value from having its pricing schedules kept secret. Boylan testified that the pricing schedules are based on Freedom Medical's understanding of the healthcare-equipment market and the company's own economics. As Henry explained, the pricing schedules are valuable because they are the baseline from which Freedom Medical negotiates with healthcare providers to sell and rent medical equipment. Widespread-publication of the pricing schedules would allow competitors to undercut Freedom Medical's bids to GPO members and other healthcare equipment purchasers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Relatedly, having access to Freedom Medical's price schedules would be of value to Med One because that information could be used to undercut Freedom Medical's offers to healthcare providers, and allow Med One to steal sales. Although Johnson testified that the prices charged by Freedom Medical were not relevant to Med One's pricing model, it is not credible to suggest that having a potential competitor's pricing would not be of some value for Med One. After all, as Wenzel testified, healthcare providers seeking to obtain movable medical equipment- whether by renting it or purchasing it-are price sensitive because the products are, in effect, fungible. Thus, knowing another provider's price would allow Med One to consistently undercut Freedom Medical's offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Whether price schedules are protected trade secrets, then, turns on if the pricing schedules were \"readily ascertainable by proper means.\"\n   <em>\n    Teva Pharm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523502\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/291/659/#p675\">\n    291 F.Supp.3d at 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Generally, pure pricing information is not protectable because that information is known to the customer, \"who has every right to disclose this information, if it so chooses, to inquiring competitors of the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Tyson Metal Prod., Inc. v. McCann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"702793\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/376/461/\">\n    376 Pa.Super. 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"702793\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/376/461/\">\n    546 A.2d 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 122 (1988). The Third Circuit, however, has distinguished between pure pricing information, readily obtainable from other sources, and proprietary pricing formulae derived from a \"range of data relat[ed] to materials, labor, overhead, and profit margin,\" which is entitled to protection as a trade secret.\n   <em>\n    SI Handling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"292655\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/753/1244/#p1255\">\n    753 F.2d at 1260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, courts have afforded greater protection to \"the\n   <em>\n    compilation\n   </em>\n   of [pricing] information-its aggregation and organization into the spreadsheets\" where \"the compilation of information is not readily obtainable from publicly available sources.\"\n   <em>\n    Amerisourcebergen Drug Corp. v.

Wenzel testified that the pricing schedules are the product of Freedom Medical's proprietary financial model. Freedom Medical factors in the cost of equipment, cost of overhead, and depreciation costs to set monthly cash-on-cash return targets (return in months or RIMs) for each of its products. Freedom Medical's finance team then works with sales teams to adjust prices based on what market conditions will bear. The adjusted prices and RIMs are then then used in Freedom Medical's capital budgeting process. More than \"pure price information,\" the price schedules are instead the product of a comprehensive budgeting process. As such, the pricing schedules are protected trade secrets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In addition, the compilation of Freedom Medical's pricing information into aggregated and organized pricing schedules renders the information protected trade secrets. Although Freedom Medical's customers-and thus, also its competitors-can access Freedom Medical's price information for a given product, the full compilation of pricing information is not readily obtainable from publicly available sources. As Henry testified, Freedom Medical's sales representatives would not include a full price list in a bid; rather, reps would include only the pricing information for the products relevant to the bid. And while any GPO member may access Freedom Medical's pricing information through an online portal, Wenzel testified that members do not have access to the compiled pricing information organized into readily accessible spreadsheets. Thus, the compilation of Freedom Medical's pricing information into organized schedules further supports the conclusion that the schedules are protected trade secrets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   b. Value to the Employer\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The second question is whether the price schedules \"[were] of value to [Freedom Medical] and important in the conduct of [its] business.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"292655\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/753/1244/#p1255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"292655\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/753/1244/#p1255\">\n    at 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This inquiry is largely redundant with the inquiry into whether the price schedules are a protected trade secret. As noted, Freedom Medical's price schedules are critical to its business because they are the baseline from which Freedom Medical negotiates with healthcare providers to sell and rent medical equipment. The price schedules ensure that Freedom Medical remains profitable in its rental and sales business, and are therefore valuable to Freedom Medical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   c. Right to Use and Enjoyment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The third question is whether \"by reason of discovery or ownership [Freedom Medical] had the right to the use and enjoyment of the secret.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"292655\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/753/1244/#p1255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The pricing schedules are produced and owned by Freedom Medical.

Here, Freedom Medical has not carried its burden to show that Defendant Whitman actually misappropriated its trade secret. The only evidence offered by Freedom Medical of appropriation was the email Defendant Whitman sent to himself on the eve of his resignation. Freedom Medical argues that the timing of the email is evidence that Defendant Whitman intended to use the pricing information in his role with Med One. And indeed, Defendant Whitman had received an offer from Med One before he officially left Freedom Medical's employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Defendant Whitman, however, testified that he sent the email only so that he could wrap-up client work for Freedom Medical. Specifically, he explained that he used the pricing schedules to complete client work to ease the burden on his successor. He further stated that he deleted the email from his personal account within twenty-four hours-that is, before his employment with Freedom Medical officially came to an end. Finally, Defendant Whitman testified that in his current role with Med One, he has no need for the pricing schedules. Although the timing of the email is suspicious, the Court finds Defendant Whitman's testimony credible, and concludes that Freedom Medical has not carried its burden of showing actual misappropriation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Where there is no actual misappropriation of trade secrets, \"courts applying Pennsylvania law\" are nevertheless \"empowered to enjoin...the threatened misappropriation of trade secrets.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3704296\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/613/102/#p110\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3704296\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/613/102/#p110\">\n    at 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Freedom Medical took reasonable steps to keep its business plan secret. Wenzel testified that business plans are covered by Freedom Medical's Acceptable Use Policy, and that business plans are not shared outside the company. Further, Freedom Medical derives economic value from business plans being kept secret, as such plans identify current customers, identify prospect customers, set forth actions plans on how to move non-customers to customers, and include general strategy for the upcoming year. Boylan testified that, if Freedom Medical's business plans were disclosed to its competitors, then Freedom Medical's business would be threatened because competitors could take preemptive steps to foil Freedom Medical's objectives. Freedom Medical's business plans are also not readily ascertainable because, as Wenzel testified, they are not shared outside the company. Finally, as noted, if business plans were disclosed to Freedom Medical's competitors, those competitors could obtain economic value from that disclosure by crafting strategies to counteract Freedom Medical's objectives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Second, Freedom Medical's business plans and price schedules are important to its commercial success. Boylan testified that Freedom Medical's business plans are the roadmap for the company's financial success, and the pricing schedule, as the basis from which its sales teams negotiate with customers, are the tools its employees use to execute on that plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Third, Freedom Medical enjoys the right to use its business plans and price schedules because both are fully produced and owned by the company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Fourth, and finally, Freedom Medical introduced evidence that Defendant Cavanaugh actually misappropriated its trade secrets. Defendant Cavanaugh, like Defendant Whitman, had a contractual duty not to disclose the secrets of Freedom Medical.\n   <em>\n    BIEC Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7409883\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/791/489/#p548\">\n    791 F.Supp. at 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nevertheless, Freedom Medical produced emails showing Defendant Cavanaugh did just that. First, Freedom Medical introduced an email Defendant Cavanaugh sent from his Freedom Medical email address to his personal email address that had pricing information and business plans attached. In addition, Freedom Medical produced emails Defendant Cavanaugh sent as a Med One employee to other Med One sales representatives that included Freedom Medical's pricing schedule and business plans. In one such email, Defendant Cavanaugh attached a copy of Freedom Medical's business plan and stated: \"Attached is the So Cal report for 2017 it will give you an idea of whats going on in your territory\n   on Freedoms side.\" In another, Defendant Cavanaugh sent a Med One co-worker a copy of Freedom Medical's pricing schedule and then compared Freedom Medical's prices to those offered by Med One: \"Below is the pricing for Med-One compaired to Freedom....I also attached Freedom's pricing.\" Finally, the emails suggest that Defendant Cavanaugh may have used the information to try to poach Freedom Medical customers. In the email comparing prices, Defendant Cavanaugh says, \"I was able to get all the numbers together for the UC Davis Proposal,\" which was a customer of Defendant Cavanaugh during his time at Freedom Medical. Thus, Freedom Medical is likely to succeed on its misappropriation claims against Defendant Cavanaugh.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    ii. Irreparable Harm\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   For an injunction to issue, Freedom Medical must also establish that it stands to suffer immediate irreparable harm, absent the issuance of preliminary relief. In the context of trade secrets, the Third Circuit has stated that \"an intention to make imminent or continued use of a trade secret or to disclose it to a competitor will almost certainly show immediate irreparable harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Campbell Soup Co. v. ConAgra, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10512139\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/977/86/#p92\">\n    977 F.2d 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 92-93 (3d Cir. 1992).

Defendant Cavanaugh's past misappropriation is insufficient, without more, to support the issuance of a preliminary injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Continental Group, Inc. v. Amoco Chems.

Nor will an injunction be issued to restrain one from doing what he is not attempting and does not intend to do.\") (internal quotation marks omitted). Freedom Medical produced no evidence to establish that it is likely to suffer immediate irreparable harm from Defendant Cavanaugh's future misappropriation of trade secrets. Thus, no preliminary injunction will issue against Defendant Cavanaugh on the misappropriation of trade secret claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Defendant Oderlin\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The story is different as to Defendant Oderlin. Freedom Medical produced evidence that Defendant Oderlin misappropriated its trade secrets, specifically by sharing Freedom Medical's pricing schedules with employees at Med One.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    i.

In one email, Defendant Oderlin sent another Med One employee a copy of Freedom Medical's agreement with a GPO that included, as an attachment, a price schedule for all of Freedom Medical's equipment. Another email, with the subject line \"Competitive Pricing,\" shows Defendant Oderlin telling another Med One sales representative that: \"Freedom is currently charging the rates below on the [GPO],\" followed by a table of prices for Freedom Medical's prices. The table corresponds exactly to a Freedom Medical GPO pricing schedule that Defendant Cavanaugh had in his possession as of September 20, 2018. While Defendant Oderlin testified that he did not use Freedom Medical's price schedule and, instead, recalled those price figures from memory, such testimony is not credible. Thus, Freedom Medical has demonstrated it is likely to succeed on the merits of its misappropriation claim against Defendant Oderlin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    ii. Irreparable Harm\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The evidence introduced by Freedom Medical demonstrates that Defendant Oderlin has \"an intention to make imminent or continued use of a trade secret or to disclose it to a competitor.\"\n   <em>\n    Campbell Soup,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10512139\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/977/86/#p92\">\n    977 F.2d at 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant Oderlin remains employed by Med One as a sales representative. Unlike Defendant Cavanaugh, Defendant Oderlin remains in a position to take advantage of Freedom Medical's trade secret. Thus, Freedom Medical has carried its burden of showing that it stands to suffer immediate irreparable harm from Defendant Oderlin's actual or threatened misappropriation of its trade secrets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    iii. Balance of Equities\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Balancing of the equities requires evaluating whether the harm done to Freedom Medical through the misappropriation of its trade secrets outweighs the potential harm done to Defendant Oderlin through the issuance of a preliminary injunction.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bimbo Bakeries\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3704296\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/613/102/#p110\">\n    613 F.3d at 118-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As noted, Freedom Medical stands to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction. While Defendant Oderlin will suffer no harm if enjoined from using trade secrets that he has no legal authority to use, \"even a temporary injunction prohibiting someone from pursuing his livelihood in the manner he chooses operates as a severe restriction on him that a court should not impose lightly.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3704296\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/613/102/#p110\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3704296\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/613/102/#p110\">\n    at 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, Defendant Whitman no longer works in the Georgia or Alabama region. Instead, his work with Med One is limited to the Florida Panhandle, a region of the country where, according to Wenzel, Freedom Medical has no customers. Thus, Defendant Whitman's employment with Med One has not caused irreparable harm to Freedom Medical. As to Defendant Cavanaugh, he is no longer employed with Med One. Because Defendants Cavanaugh is not employed by a competitor, Freedom Medical does not stand to suffer irreparable harm from the breach of his restrictive covenant. Defendant Oderlin, on the other hand, remains employed as a sales representative in the same territory in which he worked for Freedom Medical. Freedom Medical stands to suffer irreparable harm from Defendants Oderlin's continued violation of the restrictive covenant. Thus, no preliminary injunction will issue against Defendants Whitman and Cavanaugh on the breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <em>\n    ii. Balance of Equities\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   To determine whether an injunction should issue against Defendant Oderlin, the Court must weigh his interests against that of Freedom Medical. As noted, Freedom Medical has an interest in enforcing the terms of its employment agreement and protecting its business from harm that will result from the breach of that agreement. Defendant Oderlin, though, has an interest in \"pursuing his livelihood in the manner he chooses.\"\n   <em>\n    Bimbo Bakeries\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3704296\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/613/102/#p110\">\n    613 F.3d at 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On balance, however, the equities tilt toward the issuance of an injunction. Defendant Oderlin took employment with Med One in the region in which he previously worked, and seemingly tried to poach Freedom Medical's customers in that region. The equities, then, weigh in favor of an injunction \"where, as here, the facts demonstrate that the restriction is necessary to prevent greater irreparable harm from befalling another party.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3704296\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/613/102/#p110\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <em>\n    iii.

Thus, to the degree that Defendant Oderlin breached the terms of his non-compete, public interest weighs in favor of issuing a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   In sum, then, a preliminary injunction will be granted against Defendant Oderlin to enforce the terms of the restrictive covenant, limited to the sales areas in which he worked as Freedom Medical employee. No preliminary injunction will be issued to enforce the terms of Defendant Whitman's restrictive covenant because he took active steps to avoid infringing upon that covenant. Finally, no preliminary injunction will issue on Freedom Medical's breach of contract claim against Defendant Cavanaugh because he is no longer employed, and thus no longer in breach of his restrictive covenant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Finally, Freedom Medical seeks injunctive relief related to Individual Defendants' breach of their fiduciary duty to Freedom Medical. Pennsylvania law permits a limited cause of action for a breach of fiduciary duty to an employer as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   Pennsylvania law permits an agent or employee to \"make arrangements to compete,\" but prohibits him from using \"confidential information peculiar to his employer's business and acquired therein.\" Within this framework, an employee may properly inform customers of his current employer that he is leaving the employer to work elsewhere in the field, or to start his own competing business. In contrast, an employee who, while still working for her employer, makes improper use of her employer's trade secrets or confidential information, usurps a business opportunity from the employer, or, in preparing to work for a rival business, solicits customers for such rival business, may be liable for a breach of the duty of loyalty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <em>\n    Bro-Tech Corp. v. Thermax, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3751915\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/651/378/#p414\">\n    651 F.Supp.2d 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 414 (E.D.Pa.2009) (internal citations omitted). Again, though, Freedom Medical has failed to establish that it stands to suffer irreparable harm absent the issuance of an injunction because any harm Freedom Medical suffered occurred entirely in the past. All of the Individual Defendants have already left Freedom Medical's employment. There is no ongoing or threatened breach of a fiduciary duty. Therefore, no preliminary injunction\n   will issue on Freedom Medical's breach of fiduciary duty claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   In conclusion, the Court will grant Freedom Medical's motion for a preliminary injunction as to Defendant Oderlin on Freedom Medical's misappropriation of trade secrets claim and breach of contract claims. The Court will deny the remainder of Freedom Medical's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   An appropriate order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    Freedom Medical defines its confidential information to include \"marketing strategies, contact lists, group purchasing organization relationships, supplier relationships and agreements, internal rates of return, product pricing, product costs, customer lists, customer preferences, customer patient demographics, product rental and sales information by customer, average rental terms, inventory by product and location, rental and sales revenue, variable costs, specialized training and servicing methodologies and knowhow associated with the proprietary products and services offered by the company.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    The employment contracts contain a choice-of-law clause providing that Pennsylvania law shall apply.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    The Corporate Affiliates are: Med One Equipment Rental-California, L.P.; Med One Equipment Rental-Georgia, L.P.; Med One Equipment Rental - Pennsylvania; L.P Med One Capital Funding - California, L.P.; Med One Capital Funding - Georgia, L.P.; and Med One Capital Funding - Pennsylvania, L.P.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    Membership in a GPO does not preclude a healthcare provider from seeking one-off deals with vendors like Med One.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    On October 15, 2018, Freedom Medical also moved for an Order to Show Cause, alleging that Defendant Whitman violated the TRO by failing to return four Excel spreadsheets that he had emailed to himself on the eve of resigning. However, Freedom Medical withdrew that motion in order to submit a broader motion based on the discovery of additional evidence of non-compliance leading up to the October 23, 2018 hearing. Therefore, there is presently no motion to show cause pending before the Court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    Although Freedom Medical brought separate claims for misappropriation of trade secrets under the DTSA and PUTSA, the analysis as to the likelihood of success is the same because the DTSA and PUTSA effectively proscribe the same conduct.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Mickey's Linen v.

Freedom Medical, however, has failed to show that the contact list was a protected trade secret. Defendant Oderlin testified that upwards of \"75%\" of the contact information concerned his personal contacts that were unrelated to Freedom Medical. Further, Wenzel testified that Freedom Medical kept its customer information in a separate database called Zoho that was not integrated with Outlook. It is far from clear, then, that the contact list is information that Freedom Medical \"derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from being kept secret.\"\n    <em>\n     Teva Pharm.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523502\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/291/659/#p675\">\n     291 F.Supp.3d at 675\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    Of course, the denial of a preliminary injunction does not preclude Freedom Medical from pursuing a claim against Med One once a fuller record is developed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    Wenzel testified that, as to the restrictive covenants, all three employment contracts were, in effect, identical.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    Defendant Whitman does not make a similar argument as to Georgia law.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    There is no need to evaluate Med One or the Corporate Affiliates interests because Freedom Medical limited its breach of contract claim to the Individual Defendants.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    To prevail on a tortious interference of contract claim, the Freedom Medical must establish: \"(1) a contractual relation; (2) purpose or intent to harm the plaintiff by preventing the relation from occurring; (3) the absence of any privilege or justification on the part of the defendant; and (4) damage resulting from defendant's conduct.\"\n    <em>\n     Gundlach v.
