STANTON, U.S.D.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this consumer fraud class action, the plaintiffs claim that, by marketing Diet Coke as \"diet,\" The Coca-Cola Company\n   (\"Coca-Cola\") misleads consumers into believing that drinking Diet Coke will assist in weight loss or healthy weight management.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The plaintiffs filed the original complaint on October 16, 2017, which Coca-Cola moved to dismiss. In response to the motion to dismiss, the plaintiffs filed the first amended complaint (\"FAC\" or \"complaint\") on April 30, 2018 (Dkt. No. 28). Coca-Cola now moves for dismissal of that complaint. For the following reasons, Coca-Cola's motion (Dkt. No. 29) is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The complaint alleges that using the word \"diet\" to market Diet Coke is false, misleading, and unlawful. According to the plaintiffs, Coca-Cola's representation that Diet Coke is \"diet\" implies it will assist in weight loss or weight management. The plaintiffs cite scientific studies to show that the opposite is true: nonnutritive sweeteners like aspartame interfere with the body's ability to properly metabolize calories, leading to increased risk of weight gain and health problems. They also rely on a consumer survey to show that a majority of consumers expect diet soft drinks to help them lose weight or maintain/not affect their weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiffs assert claims for unfair and deceptive business practices under New York General Business Law (\"NYGBL\") \u00a7 349, false advertising under NYGBL \u00a7 350, negligent misrepresentation, intentional misrepresentation/fraud, breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty of merchantability, breach of implied warranty of fitness, and restitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Parties\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The named plaintiffs are Evan Geffner and Ivan Babsin, both of whom have been frequent purchasers of Diet Coke and, for many years, have struggled with obesity. They both \"purchased and consumed Diet Coke in large part because [they] believed, based on Coca-Cola's advertising the product as 'Diet,' and the manner in which Coca-Cola markets Diet Coke, that it would contribute to healthy weight management, and, due to its lack of calories, would not cause [them] to gain weight.\" FAC \u00b6\u00b6 66, 68 (alterations added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Coca-Cola introduced Diet Coke in 1982 as a low-calorie alternative to sugar-sweetened soft drinks, and it continues to sell and market Diet Coke today. Diet Coke is sweetened with aspartame and other sweeteners instead of sugar. It contains zero calories per serving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Advertisements for Diet Coke\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Coca-Cola has run several advertisements for Diet Coke, which the plaintiffs claim reinforce the message that Diet Coke will help consumers lose or maintain weight. One longstanding 1980s advertising campaign claimed that Diet Coke \"will not go to your waist\" and is \"suitable for carbohydrate and calorie-reduced diets.\" FAC \u00b6 17. Multiple television advertisements from the 1990s and 2000s show groups of women running to watch physically fit men drink Diet Coke.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-23. Print advertisements have similar themes: one depicts a slim Diet Coke bottle with its label hanging loose, while several others show thin and physically fit men and women drinking Diet Coke.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The American Beverage Association, of which Coca-Cola is a member, has also promoted messages regarding diet soft drinks and weight loss. In 2014, it funded a study of soft drinks which purported to show that \"diet beverages can help with weight loss,\" (FAC \u00b6 34), and published an\n   article claiming that \"low-calorie-sweeteners can help reduce calories and sugar intake and aid in maintaining a healthy weight - or even dropping some weight\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Plaintiffs' Survey\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In April 2018, the plaintiffs conducted a survey of 400 California diet soft drink consumers and 400 nationwide soft drink consumers, with the following results:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-23\"><strong>California</strong> <strong>Nationwide</strong> <strong>California</strong> <strong>Nationwide</strong> <strong>Diet Coke</strong> <strong>Diet Coke</strong> <strong>Consumers</strong> <strong>Consumers</strong> <strong>Consumers</strong> <strong>Consumers</strong> <strong><em>400 Respondents</em></strong> <strong><em>400 Respondents</em></strong> <strong><em>330 Respondents</em></strong> <strong><em>336 Respondents</em></strong> Expect drinks 12.5% 15.0% 11.8% 15.2% labeled \"diet\" to help you lose weight Expect soft 63.3% 62.0% 63.9% 62.5% drinks labeled \"diet\" to help you maintain/not affect your weight Expect soft 3.3% 2.0% 3.0% 2.4% drinks labeled \"diet\" to make you gain weight Don't have 21.0% 21.0% 21.2% 19.9% any expectations</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   FAC \u00b6 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Plaintiffs' Cited Studies\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The first amended complaint relies on studies to support the contention that non-nutritive sweeteners (\"NNS\") like aspartame cause risk of weight gain. Those studies include thirteen studies and review articles cited in the original complaint, as well as several studies added to the first amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The originally cited studies contain findings such as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 \"The addition of NNS to diets poses no benefit for weight loss or reduced weight gain without energy restriction.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 \"Data from large, epidemiologic studies support the existence of an association between artificially-sweetened beverage consumption and weight gain in children.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 \"While people often choose 'diet' or 'light' products to lose weight, research studies suggest that artificial sweeteners may contribute to weight gain.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The newly cited studies contain findings such as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 Aspartame consumption alters the intestinal microbes in a way that causes glucose intolerance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 Aspartame consumption by rats \"resulted in hyperglycemia and an impaired ability to respond to insulin.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 \"There now exists a body of evidence, from a number of investigators, that animals chronically exposed to any of a range of LCSs [low-calorie sweeteners] - including saccharin, sucralose, acesulfame potassium, aspartame, or the combination of erythritol + aspartame - have exhibited one or more of the following conditions: increased food consumption, lower post-prandial thermogenesis, increased weight gain, greater percent body fat, decreased GLP-1 release during glucose tolerance testing, and significantly greater fasting glucose, glucose area under the curve during glucose tolerance testing, and hyperinsulinemia, compared with animals exposed to plain water or - in many cases - even to calorically-sweetened foods or liquids.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 \"frequent use of diet beverages has been associated prospectively with increased long term risk and/or hazard of a number of cardiometabolic conditions usually considered to be among the sequelae of obesity : hypertension, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, depression, kidney dysfunction, heart attack, stroke, and even cardiovascular and total mortality.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 \"Using different models and approaches to account for initial 'indication' and changing usage patterns, we consistently found low-calorie sweetener use associated with weight gain and expanding waistline.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 \"The absence of evidence to support the role of ASBs [artificially sweetened beverages] in preventing weight gain and the lack of studies on other long-term effects on health strengthen the position that ASBs should not be promoted as part of a healthy diet.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Statutory Scheme\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In 1978, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") first authorized use of the term \"diet\" for products that qualified as \"low calorie\" or \"reduced calorie\" and were labeled as such.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20105.66\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 105.66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), (d), (e).

This argument fails. The FDCA merely exempts soft drinks using the term \"diet\" from certain labeling requirements; it does not affirmatively approve or require it. Coca-Cola claims that the \"use of a double negative to create a positive authorization, reader-unfriendly though it may be, is endemic to the FDCA.\" Coca-Cola Br. (Dkt. No. 30) at 18. Yet unlike the statutes interpreted in the cases that Coca-Cola relies on for support, Section 343(r)(2)(D) does not require the use of the term \"diet\" for soft drinks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Coca-Cola further argues that the plaintiffs' state law claims would impose additional requirements that are not identical to the FDCA's prohibition of false or misleading claims. This argument is inconsistent with the FDCA. Coca-Cola reads subsection 343(a) to prohibit only statements that are false or misleading as to the drink's calorie content. But subsection 343(a), which prohibits statements that are false or misleading \"in any way,\" is not so limited. Thus, false or misleading statements regarding the term \"diet\" in labeling soft drinks are not limited to statements regarding calorie content.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Coca-Cola also argues that the plaintiffs' claims under NYGBL \u00a7\u00a7 349 - 350 are barred by the \"safe harbor\" clauses of those statutes.
