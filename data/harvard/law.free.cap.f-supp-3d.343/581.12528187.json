P. 12(b)(6). ECF Nos. 1, 12. In its Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant has infringed one or more claims of United States Patent No. 9,875,590, entitled \"Automated Entry\" (\"the '590 patent\"). ECF No. 1 \u00b6 9. The issue before the Court is whether the '590 patent claims patentable subject matter under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 17 - 35. According to the '590 patent's description, the \"system provides automated entry to a prospective buyer or renter of properties\" and \"automates the tour registration process,\" which \"eliminates the need to arrange a tour with an agent or landlord\" and \"eliminates the need for an on-site representative of the property.\" '590 patent, ECF No. 1-1, Ex. 1 at 19.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   For the above reasons, the Court holds that the asserted claims of the '590 patent at issue are invalid because they are directed to an abstract idea and thus ineligible for patent protection under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As such, Plaintiff fails to state a claim for relief. Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the Motion to Dismiss as to the claims asserted in the Complaint, ECF No. 12, and\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Complaint\n   <strong>\n    WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   , ECF No. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Clerk is\n   <strong>\n    DIRECTED\n   </strong>\n   to forward a copy of this Opinion and Order to all Counsel of Record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The Court limits the scope of this ruling to the claims asserted and set forth in Plaintiff's Complaint. The Court does not have jurisdiction to rule on unasserted claims.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Fox Group, Inc. v.

Cir. 2012) (\"There was no case or controversy with respect to the unasserted claims ...; therefore the district court did not have jurisdiction over the unasserted claims.\"). As Defendant notes, \"Claim 7 of the '590 Patent... is the sole asserted independent claim.\" ECF No. 13 at 11. Therefore, this Opinion and Order only applies to the asserted claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
