Byrne, who was killed in the line of duty. In 2017, for the first time in the history of the program, the U.S. Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") and Attorney General (collectively, \"Defendants\") imposed three immigration-related\n   conditions that grantees must comply with in order to receive funding. Plaintiffs bring this suit challenging these new conditions. Consistent with every other court that has considered these issues, the Court concludes that Defendants did not have lawful authority to impose these conditions. For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment is GRANTED, and Defendants' motion for partial summary judgment or in the alternative to dismiss is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Court explained that PASPA operated \"as if federal officers were installed in state legislative chambers and were armed with the authority to stop legislators from voting on any offending proposals,\" which was a \"direct affront to state sovereignty.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   , the supporters of PASPA argued that commandeering occurs only when Congress \"command[s] 'affirmative' action as opposed to imposing a prohibition,\" but the Supreme Court rejected that distinction as \"empty.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"The basic principle-that Congress cannot issue direct orders to state legislatures-applies in either event.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   There are two important limits on the anticommandeering doctrine. First, \"[t]he anticommandeering doctrine does not apply when Congress evenhandedly regulates an activity in which both States and private actors engage.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, Congress may enact laws that \"appl[y] equally to state and private actors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1479.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Second, commandeering does not occur when Congress validly preempts state law through the Supremacy Clause. In preemption, \"Congress enacts a law that imposes restrictions or confers rights on private actors; a state law confers rights or imposes restrictions that conflict with the federal law; and therefore the federal law takes precedence and the state\n   law is preempted.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1480. To qualify as a preemption provision, the law \"must represent the exercise of a power conferred on Congress by the Constitution,\" and it \"must be best read as one that regulates private actors\" because \"the Constitution 'confers upon Congress the power to regulate individuals, not States.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1479 (quoting\n   <em>\n    New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480961\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/144/#p157\">\n    505 U.S. at 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480961\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/144/#p157\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Although a preemption provision that prohibits contrary state law \"might appear to operate directly on the States,\" in fact, it \"confers on private entities ... a federal right to engage in certain conduct subject only to certain (federal) constraints\" and \"to be free from any other ... requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1480-81. In sum, \"every form of preemption is based on a federal law that regulates the conduct of private actors, not the States.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1481. Thus, the PASPA provision prohibiting state authorization of sports gambling, which did not confer any federal rights nor impose any federal restrictions on private actors, could not be understood \"as anything other than a direct command to the States,\" which put it firmly in the category of impermissible commandeering and not permissible preemption.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.

The political subdivisions experience the same injuries described earlier, which necessarily flow to the States by virtue of the subdivisions' position within the States' geographic boundaries and political systems, and which are compounded insofar as the States must make and monitor compliance with subdivisions' subgrants with unlawful conditions. Accordingly, the Court agrees that in order to accord complete relief to the States, an injunction must protect both the States and their political subdivisions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     California ex rel.
