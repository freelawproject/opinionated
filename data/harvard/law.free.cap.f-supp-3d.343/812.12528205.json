Acting as their next friend, Joanna Christopoulos (\"Christopoulos\"), their mother, brought this action, shortly after Wertz's death, in the Circuit Court of Cook County against the company that issued the policy, Prudential Insurance Company of America (\"Prudential\"). Prudential removed the suit to this court and, due to the existence of competing claims, deposited (interpleaded) the proceeds in the court's registry, so the court could settle the dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 36, 38. The case was stayed pending related litigation in state court. That litigation has concluded.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Wertz v.

She asks the court to find that Wertz's children are entitled to the proceeds and to impose a constructive trust on 50% of them for P. Wertz's benefit. A group of nineteen claimants, aligned here as third-party plaintiffs and referred to as \"named beneficiaries,\" oppose the motion and argue in the alternative that the court should defer the motion's consideration until they have had an opportunity to conduct discovery on their equitable defense of laches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts are undisputed, though the parties disagree about the legal effect of two orders entered by the state court in divorce proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. to Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 22 (sole disputed fact as to \"characterization\" of state court's order). In 2013, two years before he died, Wertz began divorce proceedings against Christopoulos in state court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. The state court did not enter an order of marriage dissolution before Wertz's death.\n   <em>\n    Wertz v. Christopoulos\n   </em>\n   , 2017 IL App 160560-U, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 2, 2014, Wertz submitted a designation of beneficiary form to Prudential.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. The form named neither Christopoulos nor Wertz's children as beneficiaries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Group Universal Life Beneficiary Designation Form &amp; attach., ECF No. 19-1. Rather, Wertz apportioned various percentages of the proceeds to people identified as his nieces and nephews (1% each), siblings (7% each), and the remaining\n   52% to Linda Trout (\"Trout\"), one of Wertz's sisters.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   attach. In sum, Trout stands to receive 59% of the proceeds under the designation form.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   About a month later, in December 2014, Christopoulos filed an emergency petition in the divorce proceedings seeking an order requiring Wertz to designate his children as the policy's beneficiaries.\n   <em>\n    Wertz\n   </em>\n   , 2017 IL App 160560-U \u00b6 11. The state court entered a handwritten \"Domestic Relations Order\" on December 16, 2014, providing, among other things, that \"the children of the parties, D. Wertz, and P. Wertz, shall be designated as irrevocable beneficiaries, share and share alike, until further order of court without prejudice.\" Resp. to Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 14 (quoting ECF No. 19-3 at 3). Wertz did not comply before his death in March 2015.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-15;\n   <em>\n    Wertz\n   </em>\n   , 2017 IL App 160560-U \u00b6 12. The state court dismissed the divorce proceedings twice after Wertz's death-once due to his death in June 2015 and again for want of prosecution in September 2015.\n   <em>\n    Wertz\n   </em>\n   , 2017 IL App 160560-U \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In October 2015, Christopoulos filed in the divorce proceedings a motion to clarify nunc pro tunc the December 2014 order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. The motion recited that \"[t]he Plan Administrator of Wertz's life insurance policy may be governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and if so, there would be a question as to whether the December 16, 2014 order is a 'qualified domestic relations order' (QDRO) under ERISA, and QDRO status is necessary for Prudential to comply with the December 16, 2014 order.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The motion further stated that \"in order to effectuate the interest of the December 16, 2014 order, the order must be clarified nunc pro tunc to provide that it is a QDRO as defined under ERISA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Trout objected that the state trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter such an order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 53 Ex.

Whether this order qualifies as such an order under ERISA is disputed, so it will be referred to as the \"February 2016 order,\" ECF No. 53 Ex. B. The February 2016 order made stylistic changes to the text of the December 16, 2014, order and added the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   4.

This Order shall be administered and interpreted in conformity with the provisions thereof which shall preempt any provisions of state law inconsistent therewith.

The\n   <em>\n    Blue\n   </em>\n   court justified its rule this way:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   ERISA's allocation of functions-in which state courts apply state law to the facts, and pension plans determine whether the resulting orders adequately identify the payee and fall within the limits of benefits available under the plan-is eminently sensible. Pension plan administrators are not lawyers, let alone judges, and the spectacle of administrators second-guessing state judges' decisions under state law would be repellent. Unsuccessful litigants would refile their briefs from the state litigation with pension administrators, in the hope that lightning may strike as laymen review the work of judges. Far better to let the states' appellate courts take care of legal errors by trial judges. Pension plans are high-volume operations, which rely heavily on forms, such as designations of beneficiaries. Administrators are entitled to implement what the forms say, rather than what the signatories may have sought to convey. E.g.,\n   <em>\n    Hightower v. Kirksey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11677382\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/157/528/\">\n    157 F.3d 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 1998). So, too, plans may mechanically implement orders from state courts. Reviewing the substance of these orders would increase the costs of pension administration (costs ultimately passed on to beneficiaries), increase the error rate (to the detriment of participants and their loved ones), and cause delay as plans carried out the additional inquiries (again to the detriment of beneficiaries, who may need the income quickly).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11677382\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/157/528/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 386 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kennedy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679152\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/285/#p300\">\n    555 U.S. at 301-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679152\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/285/#p300\">\n    129 S.Ct. 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If this court may pierce a facially valid QDRO when a plan administrator could not, a different spectacle emerges-one in which who gets insurance proceeds depends, not on the objective criteria set forth in ERISA for deciding whether an order is a QDRO, but instead on whether a court or the plan administrator decides. ERISA should not be interpreted to encourage a plan administrator to bring an interpleader action when paying benefits according to the plan would not subject the administrator to liability.\n   <em>\n    Wheaton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7417352\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/42/1080/#p1084\">\n    42 F.3d at 1085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the named beneficiaries get their way, they would be incentivized to argue that their ability to challenge a QDRO in an interpleader action means that the administrator should be liable for nonpayment if it does not interplead disputed proceeds.
