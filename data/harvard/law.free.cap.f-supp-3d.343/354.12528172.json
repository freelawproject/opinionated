Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Gebrial Rasmy, also known as Kamal, was born in Egypt and is a Coptic Christian. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 1. Defendant Marriott manages the JW Marriott Essex House (\"the Essex House\"), located at 160 Central Park South, where Plaintiff has worked as a banquet server since the 1990s. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 7. Efstratiou, born in Greece, Tehrani, born in Iran, and Pongpanta, born in Thailand, also work as banquet servers at the Essex House. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 4-6. Doherty, born in the United Kingdom, is the Director of Human Resources for the Essex House. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 3. At all relevant times, the banquet servers' employment was governed by a collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\") negotiated with the New York Hotel and Motel Trades Council, AFL-CIO (the \"Union\"). Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 8. The banquet servers elect their own coworkers to serve as delegates to the Union; the delegates act as intermediaries between the workers and the Union and Essex House management, but receive no additional compensation for these duties. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11-12. At all relevant times, Efstratiou and Tehrani served as union delegates for the senior banquet servers, including Rasmy. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Initial Complaints (2012-2013)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In or around September 2012, Marriott took over the management of the Essex House, and soon after conducted training for the banquet team on the company's policies prohibiting discrimination and harassment. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 18, 20. In late 2012, Rasmy told Doherty that associates were abusing scheduling practices, abusing their \"power,\" and engaging in practices that caused Marriott to lose money. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 24-25. Doherty and others investigated these charges. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 26. According to Doherty, based on her investigation, she informed Rasmy that the concerns he raised were permitted past practices under the CBA and would continue. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 27.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rasmy claims Doherty told him \"I am sick and tired of this shit, and I'm sick and tired also because of you I have to send tons of fucking documents to [Arne Sorenson]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   because you have called the corporate about possible overcharging.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties dispute the authority given to and exercised by the Union delegates. According to Marriott, when they took over management of the Essex House, they asked the delegates to assist in getting Marriott managers up to speed on banquet department pay practices to ensure Marriott complied with the CBA and past practices, but that non-delegates like Rasmy were unaware of this. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 22-23. Rasmy claims that the delegates did not just help but were given supervisory authority, including the power to send employees home, and that the granting of such authority was made clear to him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Marriott insists that delegates have no authority to fire, hire, discipline, or otherwise exercise supervision over associates, including Rasmy. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 13. After Doherty's investigation, Rasmy remained unhappy that Tehrani, one of the delegates, was \"abusing his 'power.' \" Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 29. Defendants claim Rasmy got into an altercation with Tehrani on June 5, 2013, and an eyewitness stated that \"it looked like there was a risk of escalation to physical contact.\" Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 30-31. Rasmy denies this.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Shortly after this \"dispute,\" Rasmy attended a grievance meeting with the Union regarding an unrelated altercation that occurred the same day, at which meeting Rasmy publicly accused the delegates of overcharging the Essex House and of wage theft. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 32-33. One month later, Rasmy raised the same theft complaints to Doherty again. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 36. Doherty gave Rasmy the contact information for Marriott's Business Integrity Line, and continued an investigation into the \"dispute\" between Rasmy and Tehrani. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 37-38. In September 2013, Rasmy and others told Doherty that they heard Efstratiou tell Tehrani to \"send the old man home,\" referring to an older banquet server, and although Marriott's investigation could not substantiate the allegation, Doherty reminded Efstratiou that such language was improper. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 39-41. In October 2013, Rasmy delivered a letter to management reiterating his belief that Tehrani should not be making changes to the service diagrams. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   According to Marriott, in October 2013, the company \"reinforced\" its Policy Prohibiting Harassment and Unprofessional Conduct to the entire banquet staff, including holding a special training meeting on or about October 25, 2013. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 44-50. Rasmy disputes that this meeting occurred, but does not dispute that he received the anti-harassment policy from Doherty and acknowledged receipt by signing the document. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 48. One week later, Marriott claims it delivered a PowerPoint presentation and discussed the behavior standard with the entire banquet staff, at which presentation Rasmy publicly accused Efstratiou and Tehrani of manipulating schedules and engaging in wage theft, charges which management answered. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 51-56. Plaintiff denies having participated in this meeting.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In November 2013, Rasmy called the Business Integrity Line, and Area Director of Associate Relations Sue Birnie investigated Rasmy's renewed allegations of wage theft, concluding that they were unfounded. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 59-61. Additionally, Rasmy approached Doherty with allegations that Efstratiou and Tehrani called him a \"rat,\" although Rasmy alleges that he reported broader on-going discrimination in the workplace, and not just the one epithet. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 62. Doherty conducted an investigation, which Plaintiff claims was lackluster and ineffective, and could not substantiate the allegations;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   nonetheless she claims to have warned Efstratiou and Tehrani that such behavior was prohibited by company policy. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 63-64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Further Investigations and Alleged Altercations (2014-2016)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In or about May 2014, Rasmy called the Business Integrity Line again and Birnie again investigated and found no wrongdoing by the delegates. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 65-66. That summer, Doherty investigated a claim Efstratiou asserted against Rasmy, namely that Rasmy allegedly threatened him. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 67. During her investigation, Rasmy told Doherty for the first time that Efstratiou had called him \"fucking Egyptian,\" \"camel,\" and \"mummy,\" although Rasmy claims Doherty knew or should have known of the on-going harassment well before late 2014. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 68. Rasmy never reported being physically threatened by the small Efstratiou, and Doherty, who was unable to substantiate Rasmy's claims, nonetheless warned the delegates that name-calling would not be tolerated. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 69-71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In January 2016, Rasmy drove to Marriott's corporate headquarters in Maryland and spoke with Keith Wallace, Senior Director of Global Investigations, about his allegations of wage theft. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 72. Rasmy also claims he made allegations of harassment and retaliation to Wallace that Wallace did not investigate. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 72-73. Wallace investigated Rasmy's wage theft claims and was unable to substantiate them. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 73-74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On May 9, 2016, Rasmy and Pongpanta worked at an event together, and near the end of the night, a dispute arose between them in the hallway between the restaurant and the kitchen. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 75-76. According to Marriott, the surveillance cameras point into the restaurant and kitchen and did not capture footage of the hallway, although Rasmy disputes this fact. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 77-78. Marriott promptly investigated the incident; Pongpanta reported that Rasmy tried to strike him with a wooden board, called him a \"piece of shit,\" threatened to take him \"outside,\" took a swing at him, and spat in his face and Rasmy reported that Pongpanta spat in\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   face and told Rasmy that he was going to get his gun and \"finish\" Rasmy. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 79-80. The primary eyewitness to the altercation told Marriott that Rasmy was \"speaking profanity to\" Pongpanta and \"verbally harassing\" him \"in a violent angry manner.\" Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 81. Rasmy claims that Pongpanta yelled at him \"You got no fucking witnesses. I got witnesses,\" Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 81, and the eyewitness claims Rasmy became \"very aggressive\" toward the eyewitness, approached him \"in an intimidating manner and stated, 'Are you going to be witness for him now?' \" Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 81-82. Rasmy and Pongpanta filed reports against each other with the local police precinct. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On May 14, 2016, Marriott suspended Rasmy and Pongpanta pending further investigation. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 84. After the suspensions were implemented, Marriott received letters from Rasmy's peers raising past instances of unprofessional conduct. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 86. Plaintiff disputes the specific instances and suggests that these coworkers were coerced or threatened into signing petitions against him, but does not dispute the letters' existence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiff's Termination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Marriott terminated both Rasmy and Pongpanta for the May 9 incident, effective May 24, 2016. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 87. Both Rasmy and Pongpanta were treated the same, and the decision to terminate them, while recommended by Doherty, was\n   made by the business leaders. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 88-89. Pongpanta filed a grievance through the Union and Marriott refused to reinstate Pongpanta at the first-step grievance meeting nor at the second-step grievance mediation. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 90-92. When mediation was unsuccessful, the Union pursued arbitration over Pongpanta's termination. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 93. Rasmy failed to appear at the arbitration despite service of a subpoena, and over Marriott's objections, and due largely to Rasmy's absence, the arbitrator ordered Pongpanta's reinstatement. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 94. Rasmy never filed a grievance through the Union and instead filed this lawsuit on June 22, 2016. Pl.'s 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 96-97.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

While Pongpanta was later reinstated by the ruling of an arbitrator - over Marriott's objections - both men were treated identically. Mr. Pongpanta is neither Christian nor Egyptian. In cases in which multiple employees are terminated for the same infraction, courts generally find that the plaintiff has failed to meet the fourth element - that circumstances give rise to an inference of discriminatory intent.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morales v.

Rasmy claims that Doherty complained that his repeated allegations of wage theft created more work for her, but no reasonable juror could find that this suggests Doherty harbored an animus against Egyptians or Coptic Christians.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clemente v.

In his opposition to summary judgment, Plaintiff recounts allegations that Doherty accused him of attempted murder and refused to show Rasmy footage of the incident she claimed was captured on camera and concludes that this alleged harassment \"can only logically be attributable to discriminatory animus,\" but accepting Plaintiff's version of events as true, no reasonable jury could find that the allegations support a reasonable inference of discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff does allege that co-workers Pongpanta and Efstratiou made comments to Plaintiff relating to his national origin and religion, but Plaintiff offers no evidence - disputed or undisputed - connecting the comments to his termination.

The Second Circuit has explained that \"there are two distinct ways for a plaintiff to prevail - either by providing that a discriminatory motive, more likely than not, motivated the defendants or by proving that the reasons given by the defendants are not true and that discrimination is the real reason for the actions.\"\n   <em>\n    Gordon v.

Rasmy must offer \"not simply some evidence, but sufficient evidence to support a rational finding that the legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons proffered by the defendant were false, and that more likely than not discrimination was the real reason for the employment action.\"\n   <em>\n    Weinstock v.

In opposing summary judgment on his discrimination claims, Plaintiff simply states in a conclusory manner that he \"has put forth sufficient evidence that would allow the jury to determine whether Defendants acted with discriminatory animus when terminating Plaintiff's employment.\" Opp. at 22. He adds a few more details in opposing summary judgment with respect to his retaliation claims, elaborating that Marriott's proffered reason for termination is pretextual because: \"(1) Defendants' proffered reason\n   <em>\n    did not happen\n   </em>\n   ; (2) Defendants suspended and terminated Plaintiff because\n   Plaintiff opposed Pongpanta's unlawful behavior; (3) Defendants have proved to be inconsistent and arbitrary when doling out discipline for similar offenses and; (4) Defendants refused to investigate or take disciplinary action when Plaintiff complained, yet were more than willing to haphazardly investigate, suspend, and terminate Plaintiff.\" Opp. at 16 (emphasis in original). Nonetheless, despite the addition of a few scant details, for substantially the same reasons Rasmy failed to establish his\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of discrimination, Rasmy has also not offered sufficient evidence to support a rational finding of pretext.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Specifically, Rasmy invites the inference that because, in his telling, he was not the aggressor in the altercation and then was suspended prior to Marriott conducting a \"meaningful investigation,\" that this course of events suggests a pretextual reason for termination. Opp. at 16-17. However, Rasmy does not specify how Marriott's investigation was insufficient, and the record reflects that Marriott reviewed the incident reports both Pongpanta and Rasmy provided, reviewed available video surveillance,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   interviewed Pongpanta, Rasmy, and the eyewitness, reviewed the eyewitness's written statement, and interviewed an additional potential witness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 3-4 (detailing the steps taken). Plaintiff has not explained how this investigation was deficient or a departure from the business's normal protocol such that it might support an inference of discriminatory animus. Plaintiff also asserts that Doherty attempted \"to dissuade Plaintiff from reporting discrimination.\" Opp. at 15. But that allegation suggests a retaliatory motive, not a discriminatory motive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In sum, even drawing all inferences in Rasmy's favor, no reasonable jury could conclude that Marriott acted with discriminatory animus in suspending and terminating Rasmy after the altercation. \"A plaintiff's self-serving statement, without direct or circumstantial evidence to support the charge, is...insufficient.\"\n   <em>\n    Risco v.

As Plaintiff states in his brief, \"[a] plaintiff may prove that retaliation was a but-for cause of an adverse employment action by demonstrating weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate, nonretaliatory reasons for its action.

However, Plaintiff has not offered sufficient evidence that would allow a reasonable juror to make a rational finding of pretext. The statements he points to as suggesting retaliatory motive, such as Doherty's alleged comment that Plaintiff \"better keep [his] fucking mouth shut if [he] want[s] to keep [his] job here,\" do not connect to any discriminatory animus linked to any protected status, and Plaintiff's conclusory statement that \"Defendants' haphazard, inconsistent, and disparate investigation methods indicate\" pretext is not based on any evidence in the record.
