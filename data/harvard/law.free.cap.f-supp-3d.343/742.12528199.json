Discovery has been difficult, to say the least, entailing extended motion practice and increasing court supervision and involvement [\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. ## 130, 135, 138, 142, 167, 170, 173, 185, 207, 209, 212, 223, 224, 225, 227, 229, 231, 239, 241, 252, 254, 255, 256, 262, 263, 264, 267, 270, 271, 313, 315, 325, 326], including two pending sanctions recommendations. [Dkt. ## 229, 340].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At issue are defendant, Capital Premium's document requests nos. 28 and 29 from its second set of document requests. The requests and plaintiff's objections are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Request No. 28\n   </strong>\n   : Documents sufficient to identify the proportion of BankDirect's revenue, loan volume, and profits that are attributable to BankDirect's relationship with Capital Premium.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BankDirect's Response to Request No. 28\n   </strong>\n   : BankDirect objects to Request No. 28 as not reasonably calculated to the discovery of admissible evidence. The proportion of BankDirect's revenue, loan volume, and profits that are attributable to its relationship with CPFI are not in any way related to any claim, counterclaim, defense, or other factual dispute in this litigation. There are no provisions in the MTA or other Transaction Facility Documents which would entitle CPFI, as a borrower, to the financial information of BankDirect, its secured creditor. As such, Request No. 28 constitutes nothing more than an impermissible and harassing fishing expedition into BankDirect's non-CPFI related business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Request No. 29\n   </strong>\n   : BankDirect's audited financial statements for the years 2010 to present.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BankDirect's Response to Request No. 29\n   </strong>\n   : BankDirect objects to Request no. 29 as not reasonably calculated to the discovery of admissible evidence. BankDirect's audited financial statements are not in any way related to any claim, counterclaim, defense, or other factual dispute in this litigation. Moreover, there are no provisions in the MTA or other Transaction Facility Documents which would entitle CPFI, as a borrower, to the audited financial statements of BankDirect, its secured creditor. As such, Request No. 28 constitutes nothing more than an impermissible and harassing fishing expedition into BankDirect's non-CPFI related business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [Dkt. # 345, at 1-2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   It's not clear from Capital Premium's motion whether it ever attempted to comply with Local Rule 37.2 (or Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(a)(1) ) and meet and confer in good faith with BankDirect regarding this dispute. There is no certification from Capital Premium\n   - although one is required - and, it would appear from BankDirect's response that the parties have done no more than exchange emails on this matter. That, as the rule and case law make clear, is insufficient. Letters do not count.\n   <em>\n    In re Fluidmaster, Inc., Water Connector Components Prod. Liab.

Emails and letters are not enough under Rule 37.2.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   That's reason enough to deny Capital Premium's motion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Local Rule 37.2; but the one email the parties did exchange, dated November 21\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   , resolves this dispute. In it, BankDirect informed Capital Premium that is does not have audited financial statements. In other words, there are no documents responsive to Capital Premium's request no. 29. As to request no. 28, BankDirect offered to produce the ratios Capital Premium requested if Capital Premium would withdraw its motion to compel. Capital Premium declined without explanation. [Dkt. # 354-1]. That's unacceptable, even if the exchange occurred in person. The Local Rule's requirement of \"good faith\" is not without meaning.\n   <em>\n    Chicago Reg'l Council of Carpenters Pension Fund v.

But, apparently, Capital Premium prefers to maintain a motion to compel, take up the court's time, and waste taxpayer money rather than accept the ratios they requested.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chicago Observer, Inc. v.

Ind. June 3, 2016) ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On the other hand, it is unfathomable why BankDirect did not produce the ratios responsive to request no. 28 at any point in the last 12 months. If it is willing to produce the ratios now, it is clear that its objections were no more than the garden-variety, tactical boilerplate that have been improperly affixed to discovery responses for decades.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gunn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201737518\">\n    2018 WL 1737518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 ;\n   <em>\n    Duracell U.S. Operations, Inc. v.

Ill. Feb. 5, 2018) (collecting cases). The materials are relevant to Capital Premium's\n   claim for damages resulting from BankDirect's alleged breach of the parties' Marketing Collaboration Agreement by failing to market Capital Premium's products as required. Beyond that, BankDirect's reference to a requirement that to be permissible discovery must be \"reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence\" is mystifying. That requirement was interred in 2015, when Rule 26 was amended. Today, parties may obtain discovery regarding any \"nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party's claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case....\" The objection thus ignores the applicable Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(B)(1) (advisory committee notes, 2015 Amendment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Finally, the objection that there is no provision in the MTA or other Transaction Facility Document which would entitle Capital Premium to the financial information of BankDirect borders on the absurd. Discovery in this and almost all other federal civil cases is governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. If there is some disputed provision regarding disclosure it can easily be handled under the terms of the protective order in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Capital Premium's motion [Dkt. # 345] as to request no. 28 is denied. BankDirect is ordered to produce immediately the ratios it agreed to produce in its email of November 21\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
