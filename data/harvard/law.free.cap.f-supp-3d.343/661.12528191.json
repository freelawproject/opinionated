(Dkt. 11). Also before the Court is Plaintiffs' Motion to Strike Defendant's Exhibit D (\"Motion to Strike\"). (Dkt. 16). Having considered the parties' briefs, the evidence, and the relevant law, the Court denies Plaintiffs' Motion to Dismiss. Because it does so without relying on Defendant's Exhibit D, Plaintiffs' Motion to Strike is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs N.P.U., Inc. and Casey McKee (together, \"Plaintiffs\") filed this copyright action against Defendant Wilson Audio Specialties, Inc. (\"Wilson Audio\"). (Am. Compl., Dkt. 8). Plaintiffs sell and service audio equipment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8). On their website, they list companies whose products they sell on a page titled \"What We Carry.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9). At one point, that list included Wilson Audio. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). When Plaintiffs stopped selling Wilson Audio products in 2014, they changed the \"What We Carry\" list to read \"(formerly) Wilson Audio.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiffs' website also includes two photographs of Wilson Audio products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12). In 2018, Wilson Audio asked Plaintiffs to remove \"(formerly) Wilson Audio\" from their website. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14). Plaintiffs then filed this action, seeking a declaratory judgment that their use of \"(formerly) Wilson Audio\" on their website does not infringe Wilson Audio's trademark or other rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Wilson Audio included a set of counterclaims in their answer: (1) trademark infringement under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (2) unfair competition under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ; (3) unfair competition under Texas common law; (4) breach of contract; and (5) unjust enrichment. (Answer, Dkt. 9, at 8-11). Plaintiffs contend that these counterclaims are subject to dismissal pursuant to the Texas Citizens' Participation Act (\"TCPA\"). (Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 11, at 1). The TCPA provides for dismissal of legal actions based on, relating to, or in response to a party's exercise of the right of free speech, right to petition, or right of association. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code \u00a7 27.003(a). Wilson Audio filed a timely response. (Dkt. 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The TCPA provides that \"[i]f a legal action is based on, relates to, or is in\n   response to a party's exercise of the right of free speech, right to petition, or right of association, that party may file a motion to dismiss the legal action.\" Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code \u00a7 27.003(a). A court \"shall dismiss a legal action against the moving party if the moving party shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the legal action is based on, relates to, or is in response to the party's exercise of: (1) the right of free speech; (2) the right to petition; or (3) the right of association.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 27.005(b). However, \"[t]he TCPA's purpose is to identify and summarily dispose of lawsuits designed only to chill First Amendment rights, not to dismiss meritorious lawsuits.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Lipsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6872091\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/579/#p589\">\n    460 S.W.3d 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 589 (Tex. 2015). To that end, a court \"may not dismiss a legal action under this section if the party bringing the legal action establishes by clear and specific evidence a prima facie case for each essential element of the claim in question.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6872091\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/579/#p589\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 27.005(c). Even if the party bringing the legal action meets its burden, however, the moving party can secure dismissal if it \"establishes by a preponderance of the evidence each essential element of a valid defense to the nonmovant's claim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6872091\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/579/#p589\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 27.005(d). Plaintiffs seek dismissal of Wilson Audio's counterclaims under these provisions. (Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 11, at 6-26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The threshold question is whether the TCPA applies to some or all of Wilson Audio's claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 14, at 5-10). \"Under the\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   doctrine, federal courts sitting in diversity apply state substantive law and federal procedural law.\"\n   <em>\n    Gasperini v. Ctr. for Humanities, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1729749\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/415/#p427\">\n    518 U.S. 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 427,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1729749\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/415/#p427\">\n    116 S.Ct. 2211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1729749\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/415/#p427\">\n    135 L.Ed.2d 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996). The same rule applies to state law claims over which a federal court exercises supplemental jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Songcharoen v. Plastic &amp; Hand Surgery Assocs., P.L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4297582\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/561/327/#p332\">\n    561 F. App'x 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 332 (5th Cir. 2014) ;\n   <em>\n    Sommers Drug Stores Co. Empl. Profit Sharing Tr. v.

Even if an\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   analysis determines a state rule of law to be substantive, \"if there is a direct collision between a state substantive law and a federal procedural rule that is within Congress's rulemaking authority, federal courts apply the federal rule and do not apply the substantive state law.\"\n   <em>\n    Block v. Tanenhaus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275328\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/585/#p589\">\n    867 F.3d 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 589 (5th Cir. 2017) (cleaned up). The Court previously held that two of the TCPA's procedural provisions, the hearing requirement and the 30-day-ruling requirement, are procedural and do not apply in federal court. (Order, Dkt. 20 (referring to Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code \u00a7\u00a7 27.004(a), 27.005(a) ) ). The Court must now determine whether the TCPA contains substantive provisions that apply in federal court and, if so, to which of Wilson Audio's counterclaims the TCPA applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As an initial matter, the TCPA does not apply to Wilson Audio's two counterclaims arising under federal law, (Answer, Dkt. 9, at 8-9), even assuming that the law expressed in Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code \u00a7 27.005 (\" Section 27.005\") is substantive. The Court is not sitting in diversity; Plaintiffs' sole claim arises under federal law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl., Dkt. 8, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 18-20). The Court exercises federal question jurisdiction over that claim and the two counterclaims arising under the Lanham Act.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court does not apply state law to those claims. The TCPA therefore provides no basis for dismissing Wilson Audio's counterclaims arising under federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The more complex issue is whether the TCPA applies to Wilson Audio's state-law counterclaims. Because the Court exercises supplemental jurisdiction over those claims,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), state substantive law applies to those\n   claims.\n   <em>\n    Sommers Drug Stores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10528728\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/883/345/#p353\">\n    883 F.2d at 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The questions are (1) whether the law expressed in Section 27.005 is substantive and (2) if so, whether there is a direct collision between those parts of the TCPA and federal law. For the reasons discussed below, the Court finds that Section 27.005 does not apply to Wilson Audio's state-law counterclaims because it is procedural rather than substantive, and that even if it is substantive, it directly collides with federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Fifth Circuit has not decided whether the TCPA applies in federal court when a court exercises its diversity or supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Block\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275328\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/585/#p589\">\n    867 F.3d at 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The applicability of state anti-SLAPP statutes in federal court is an important and unresolved issue in this circuit.\");\n   <em>\n    Cuba v.

The Court declines to do so because it is not persuaded by the\n   reasons articulated in those nonbinding decisions. For example, the Magistrate Judge in\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   found that \"the [TCPA] itself is functionally substantive\" because \"it ultimately provides a basis for dismissal that is inextricably tied to the substantive nature of Plaintiff's claims.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207971294\">\n    2016 WL 7971294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. The Court disagrees that the TCPA's dismissal rules are \"inextricably tied to the substantive nature\" of a plaintiff's (or counter-plaintiff's) claims. In this case, for example, Plaintiffs contend that Wilson Audio's counterclaims relate to their right to petition not based on the counterclaims' substance but simply because they were filed in response to Plaintiffs' amended complaint. (Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 11, at 8-9). If the TCPA were to require dismissal of those counterclaims, it would likewise be for no reason tied to the substance of Wilson Audio's counterclaims because dismissal under the TCPA is based on a lack of sufficient evidence no matter what the substance of a claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Moreover,\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   's analysis does not consider whether the TCPA is substantive under the \"outcome determination\" test or the \"twin aims\" of\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   , which are used in this circuit to determine whether a state rule of law is procedural of substantive.\n   <em>\n    All Plaintiffs v.

Plaintiffs offer no argument that the TCPA is substantive based on these tests. Applying those tests to this case, the Court does not find that the TCPA's dismissal provisions are substantive.

Before concluding that \"[t]here is no material difference between the Louisiana and Texas anti-SLAPP statutes,\" the court explains its finding that the TCPA's dismissal rules are substantive despite appearing procedural in nature: \"these procedural features are designed to prevent substantive consequences-the impairment of First Amendment rights and the time and expense of defending against litigation that has no demonstrable merit under state law regarding defamation.\"\n    <em>\n     Williams\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202611746\">\n     2014 WL 2611746\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *1-2.
