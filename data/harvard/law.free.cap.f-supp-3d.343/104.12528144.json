Pike, Jr. (now deceased) brought this action against Kennedy, PC Law Offices, a debt collection firm, alleging claims of unfair debt collection practices pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq. Familiarity with the procedural history of the matter is presumed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After six years of litigation, following which a single claim remained, the parties settled that claim by stipulation (the \"Settlement\") dated August 21, 2018. (Dkt. # 85-1). Pursuant to the Settlement, defendant agreed to pay Eades' costs and reasonable attorney's fees, as determined by the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   To that end, on September 28, 2018 (Dkt. # 87), plaintiff moved for an award of attorney's fees in the amount of $130,850.00, representing over 370 billable hours, plus $6,243.26 in expenses. Defendant opposes the motion, arguing that plaintiff's two sets of counsel engaged in duplicative efforts, incurred unnecessary costs, and protracted the litigation by failing to file a pleading which stated a viable cause of action until three-and-a-half years into the action, after the majority of the attorney's fees that are now sought had already been incurred. Defendants also emphasize that the amount of attorney's fees requested is grossly disproportionate to the $13,500.00 settlement amount.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the Second Circuit, \"[t]he lodestar approach governs the initial estimate of reasonable fees.\"\n   <em>\n    Grant v.

Rather than weighing the reasonableness of each individual time entry, the Court may exclude excessive and unreasonable hours from a fee request by making an across-the-board reduction in the amount of hours for which compensation is sought.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kirsch v.

Plaintiff's counsel are experienced and well-versed in prosecuting debt collection cases in federal court, yet the overwhelming majority of the 370+ hours of billable time spent by counsel in this matter was directed toward the prosecution and/or appeal of claims that were insufficiently stated or untimely. While the law in the Second Circuit is clear that a plaintiff may recover attorney's fees for \"hours spent on unsuccessful claims ... if the claims are inextricably intertwined and involve a common core of facts,\" such circumstances were not present here, where the successful claim related solely to defendant's having brought an action against plaintiffs in an improper venue, while the several unsuccessful claims related to specific debt collection practices by the defendant.\n   <em>\n    Reiter,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%202775144\">\n    2007 WL 2775144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *9,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2071008\">\n    2007 U.S. Dist.

It was toward those unsuccessful claims that the majority of the discovery, motion practice and appellate practice in this matter were directed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Submissions by counsel also testify to some duplication of effort by plaintiff's two law firms, including joint attendance at multiple conferences, parallel review of discovery, and attendance by multiple attorneys at court-ordered mediation, all of which disproportionately increased the number of attorney hours and costs requested herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I therefore find that the number of hours expended by counsel was excessive, as the bulk of the work performed in this matter was duplicative and/or misdirected toward meritless claims. As such, the hours for which compensation is\n   sought should be reduced by no less than 50%, for a rough total of 187 hours.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barfield v.

Considering that this case initially involved just two plaintiffs (and now involves one) and was not unusually complex, the Court finds that a reasonable average rate for the partners who worked on this matter is $300/hour, and that the reasonable average rate for associates is $225/hour.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Godson v.
