ALTONAGA, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS CAUSE\n   </strong>\n   came before the Court on Defendants, Dustin Pillonato and Justin Ramsey's Response and Objections to Receiver's Motion to Compel Turnover of Personal Laptop Computers and Personal Cell Phones [ECF No. 108] (the \"Motion\"). On July 17, 2018, Receiver, Jonathan E. Perlman, filed a Reply to Defendants Dustin Pillonato and Justin Ramsey's Response [ECF No. 129] (the \"Response\"). On July 26, 2018, Defendants filed an Answer to Receiver's Reply [ECF No. 140] (the \"Reply\"). Later, the Receiver filed a Notice of Filing Newly Discovered Evidence [ECF No. 146], to which Defendants filed a Reply [ECF No. 160]. After a Hearing [ECF No. 171], Magistrate Judge Barry S. Seltzer entered his Report [ECF No. 176] on September 12, 2018, recommending the Court deny Defendants' Motion and instruct the Clerk of Court to turn over to the Receiver the laptop computers and cell phones currently in the Clerk's possession. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Report). Defendants timely filed Objection to Magistrates [sic] Report and Recommendation [ECF No. 179] (the \"Objections\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   When a magistrate judge's \"disposition\" has properly been objected to, as is the case here, district courts must review the disposition\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   . Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3). Defendants filed timely objections to the Report (\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Objs.), and so the Court reviews the record\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   . The Court has carefully reviewed the written submissions, the record, and applicable law. For the reasons that follow, Judge Seltzer's Report is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants' Motion arises out of a dispute between the Receiver and Defendants over Defendants' obligations under the Court's Temporary Restraining Order (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   May 8, 2018 Order [ECF No. 12] 19) (the \"TRO\") and Preliminary Injunction (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   June 7, 2018 Preliminary Injunction [ECF No. 64] 21) to turn over certain electronic devices the Receiver contends contain business records and data belonging to the Receivership. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Receiver's Motion to Compel Turnover and for an Order to Show Cause [ECF No. 49] ). As is relevant here, the Receiver asked the Court to compel Defendants to turn over \"their laptop computers and cellphones for imaging.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the Preliminary Injunction Hearing [ECF No. 60] held on June 6, 2018, Defendants objected to turning over their cell phones and laptops, asserting a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Preliminary Injunction Hearing Transcript [ECF No. 117] 63:6-22). To resolve the parties' dispute over the compelled turnover while preserving Defendants' asserted constitutional objections, the Court entered an Order [ECF No. 62] instructing Defendants, Pillonato and Ramsey, to turn over their laptop computers and cell phones to the Clerk's Office. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   1). The Clerk's Office would \"maintain control of the property while the parties brief issues relating to Defendants' asserted claim to the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The parties have completed extensive briefing on Defendants' constitutional objections to the Receiver's requested compelled turnover. Defendants' Motion is thus ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In his Report, Judge Seltzer thoroughly analyzes Defendants' Fifth Amendment (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Report 6-10) and Fourth Amendment (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   11-22) objections to the Receiver's request for turnover of Defendants' property. Judge Seltzer rejects both objections, recommending the Court instruct the Clerk to turn over Defendants' laptop computers and cell phones to the Receiver. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   22). The Court addresses Defendants' Fifth Amendment and Fourth Amendment objections in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Fifth Amendment Objection\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   First, Judge Seltzer finds Defendants' surrender of electronic devices is not a testimonial communication for which Defendants can successfully invoke a Fifth Amendment objection. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   10 (alterations added) ). As Judge Seltzer notes (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   8), the Supreme Court has consistently held the Fifth Amendment does not apply to the contents of voluntarily prepared and previously generated documents, even though they may contain incriminating information.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hubbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413147\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/27/#p35\">\n    530 U.S. 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 35,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413147\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/27/#p35\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2037\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413147\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/27/#p35\">\n    147 L.Ed.2d 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000). Because the Receiver requests the production of records (stored in electronic devices) that were voluntarily prepared, Defendants do not enjoy Fifth Amendment protection to those records. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report 9). Nor does the act of producing the devices in question require Defendants to reveal the contents of their minds or to exercise any judgment or discretion to comply with the requests. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413147\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/27/#p35\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   9-10 (citing cases) ). In sum, Defendants' release of electronic devices is not a testimonial communication for which Defendants can invoke their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413147\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/27/#p35\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing cases) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants do not raise any objections to Judge Seltzer's findings regarding application of the Fifth Amendment. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Objs.). The undersigned has reviewed the Report, the record, and the\n   applicable law. In the light of that review, the undersigned agrees with the analysis in the Report and rejects Defendants' asserted Fifth Amendment defense to the Receiver's requested turnover of Defendants' laptop computers and cell phones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Fourth Amendment Objection\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Judge Seltzer also finds \"there is sufficient probable cause to order the turnover and search ... of the electronic devices in the custody of the Clerk and that such an order would satisfy the Fourth Amendment's requirement of reasonableness.\" (Report 21-22 (alteration added) ). Judge Seltzer concludes (1) Defendants did not waive their right to raise a Fourth Amendment objection (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   11-13); (2) Defendants have standing to assert Fourth Amendment objections because they have a legitimate expectation of privacy in their laptops and cell phones (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   13-15); and (3) there is probable cause that the business operations of the Receivership Entities will be found on Defendants' laptop computers and cell phones (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   15-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court agrees with Judge Seltzer's findings that Defendants did not waive their right to raise a Fourth Amendment objection and have standing to raise their Fourth Amendment objection. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Objs.). The Court thus reviews the merits of Defendants' Fourth Amendment objection\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , in light of Defendants' Objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants contend the Receiver cannot seize and search their electronic devices without a search warrant, or at a minimum, a showing of probable cause. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Mot.;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Objs.). As Judge Seltzer notes (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Report 16), although the Fourth Amendment's protections against unreasonable searches and seizures extend to civil matters, reasonableness is assessed less stringently in the civil context than in the criminal context.\n   <em>\n    Owens v. Swan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12003788\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/962/1436/#p1440\">\n    962 F.Supp. 1436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1440 (D. Utah 1997) (\"Although notions of probable cause and specificity guide courts in the determination of the overall reasonableness of a civil search, they do not apply strictly in the case of an administrative or civil order of seizure.\" (citations omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Judge Seltzer concludes probable cause exists that Defendants used their personal cell phones and laptops to conduct business activity pertaining to the Receivership for two reasons: (1) Plaintiff's evidence in support of the Court's TRO and Preliminary Injunction; and (2) forensic examination of the messages sent and received from Defendants' cell phones, which the Receiver obtained from Ricardo Diaz's voluntary turnover of his own cell phone. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report 17-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants raise the following objections to Judge Seltzer's Report: (1) Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   motion for a temporary restraining order was not supported by oath or affirmation and did not with particularity describe the place to be searched or the persons or things to be seized (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Objs. 3); (2) Plaintiff's unsworn\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   motion for a temporary restraining order cannot serve as a substitute for an application under oath in support of a search warrant nor as a substitute for an actual search warrant, which is required here (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   4); (3) the Receiver never enumerated the specific concerns about the fraudulent information on Defendants' laptop computers, thus failing to show the probable cause necessary to seize and search the computers (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   4); and (4) Judge Seltzer improperly relies on illegally obtained evidence -- Pillonato's other cell phone recovered at Pillonato's business -- to justify the search of Defendants' cell phones in dispute here (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants' objections all implicate the showing necessary for the Court to compel Defendants to turn over electronic devices to the appointed Receiver, as part of the\n   Federal Trade Commission's investigation into Defendants' alleged unfair or deceptive acts or practices. (\n   <em>\n    See generally id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendants assert the Fourth Amendment requires the Receiver to obtain a search warrant, as this case does not present an exception to the warrant requirement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court is not persuaded by Defendants' demand for more compelling evidence, and a formal warrant, to support the TRO and Preliminary Injunction compelling Defendants to turn over their electronic devices to the Receiver. \"[N]o court has ever held that the equivalent of a warrant must be issued in order for a receiver to be permitted to seize the property of the subject entity.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Setser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654203\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/568/482/#p488\">\n    568 F.3d 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 488 (5th Cir. 2009) (alteration added). Indeed, \"particularity is not translatable to the receiver context [because] once appointed, the receiver often takes possession of the distressed or distrusted entity\" and the \"seizure of all assets on behalf of the court is a central purpose for the appointment of a receiver.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654203\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/568/482/#p488\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (alteration added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Judge Seltzer's reliance on Plaintiff's supporting evidence justifying the Court's TRO and Preliminary Injunction is well-founded. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report 17). The Fifth Circuit made the following pertinent observation about the role of receivers, equally applicable here:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   A receiver takes over property only after a court has agreed with the arguments and evidence that such a takeover is necessary ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Because the receiver was taking possession of everything in those categories that had been the property of the defendants for whom the receivership was authorized, further particularity would have served no purpose. After the seizure, the receiver had possession of the property only because had had been authorized by court order. We find no basis to support the argument that more was needed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Setser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654203\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/568/482/#p488\">\n    568 F.3d at 487-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court entered its TRO and Preliminary Injunction compelling Defendants to turnover their laptop computers and cell phones only after it \"agreed with the arguments and evidence that such a takeover [was] necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654203\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/568/482/#p488\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654203\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/568/482/#p488\">\n    at 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration added). As Judge Seltzer aptly notes, Plaintiff provided substantial evidence to warrant the TRO and Preliminary Injunction compelling Defendants to turn over their electronic devices to the Receiver. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report 17). The Receiver thus articulated probable cause, without need for a search warrant, that the cell phones and laptops at issue contain information related to the Receivership.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    F.T.C. v. Credit Bureau Ctr., LLC,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522867\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/284/907/#p909\">\n    284 F.Supp.3d 907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 909 (N.D. Ill. 2018) ( [T]he evidence submitted in support of the temporary restraining order and the preliminary injunction was more than sufficient to establish probable cause authorizing the Court's entry of an order permitting seizure or turnover of the materials in question.\" (alteration added) ). The digital forensic examination of Defendants' cell phones only further bolsters the compelled turnover. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report 20-21). The Court thus affirms Judge Seltzer's recommendations as to Defendants' Fourth Amendment objections to the compelled turnover.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, it is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED AND ADJUDGED\n   </strong>\n   that the Report\n   <strong>\n    [ECF No. 176]\n   </strong>\n   is\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   .

Additionally, the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination does not apply to incriminating evidence that was generated prior to the demand that this evidence be produced.\n   <em>\n    Fisher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178158\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/391/#p408\">\n    425 U.S. at 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178158\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/391/#p408\">\n    96 S.Ct. 1569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that papers which were voluntarily prepared prior to the issuance of the summons could not contain compelled testimonial evidence). Thus, once an individual chooses voluntarily to prepare a written account, the act of preparation serves as an effective\n   waiver of the Fifth Amendment protections, and the resulting document is a physical object that can be acquired. In this instance, the Receiver is seeking the production of business records that were voluntarily prepared prior to the entry of the TRO. Pillonato and Ramsey, therefore, do not enjoy any Fifth Amendment protection in the content of these business records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Ramsey and Pillonato appear to suggest that their very act of production - their turning over the devices to the Receiver - would be testimonial in nature. The Eleventh Circuit has described those circumstances in which the act of production would - and would not - have a testimonial quality sufficient to trigger the protections of the Fifth Amendment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   [A]n act of production can be testimonial when that act conveys some explicit or implicit statement of fact that certain materials exist, are in the subpoenaed individual's possession or control, or are authentic. The touchstone of whether an act of production is testimonial is whether the government compels the individual to use \"the contents of his own mind\" to explicitly or implicitly communicate some statement of fact.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Put another way, the Court has marked out two ways in which an act of production is not testimonial. First, the Fifth Amendment privilege is not triggered where the Government merely compels some physical act, i.e. where the individual is not called upon to make use of the contents of his or her mind. The most famous example is the key to the lock of a strongbox containing documents, but the Court has also used this rationale in a variety of other contexts. Second, under the \"foregone conclusion\" doctrine, an act of production is not testimonial-even if the act conveys a fact regarding the existence or location, possession, or authenticity of the subpoenaed materials-if the Government can show with \"reasonable particularity\" that, at the time it sought to compel the act of production, it already knew of the materials, thereby making any testimonial aspect a \"foregone conclusion.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    In re Grand Jury Subpoena\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5710844\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/670/1335/#p1342\">\n    670 F.3d at 1345-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In this matter, Pillonato and Ramsey's act of producing the devices - their compliance with the Court's order directing that they turn over the devices to the Receiver - is not a question of testimony but of surrender.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fisher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178158\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/391/#p408\">\n    425 U.S. at 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178158\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/391/#p408\">\n    96 S.Ct. 1569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Where the existence and location of the subpoenaed documents are a 'foregone conclusion' and the witness 'adds little or nothing' by conceding he has the documents, there is no Fifth Amendment privilege against production because the production becomes a 'question ... not of testimony but of surrender.' \"). Further, the act of producing these devices does not require Pillonato and Ramsey to reveal the contents of their minds or to exercise any judgment or discretion to comply with the requests; they are merely surrendering the laptops and cellphones to the Receiver as required by the Court's Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The district court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Sallah v.

In\n   <em>\n    Sallah\n   </em>\n   , the court held that a defendant's act of producing of certain documents did not violate her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The defendant had objected to several requests for production on Fifth Amendment grounds. The court interpreted \"the contents of his own mind\" to mean an exercise of discretion and decision-making and overruled the defendant's objection on the ground that neither the production of tax records nor of the contracts required the defendant to make any judgment calls or exercise discretion in determining what is responsive to the request.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564225\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/855/1364/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564225\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/855/1364/\">\n    at 1374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In sum, because the information on the electronic devices was voluntarily created prior to the Receiver's request for turnover and because compliance with the turnover order does not require that Ramsey and Pillonato exercise any judgment or discretion, their surrender of the devices is not a testimonial communication for which they can successfully invoke a Fifth Amendment objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Fourth Amendment Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Ramsey and Pillonato additionally raise a Fourth Amendment objection to turning over their electronic devices. They assert that the Receiver has sought a court order to force them to turn over their personal cellphones and laptop computers so that he can then conduct a warrantless and illegal search and seizure of the information contained therein. Objections at 8-9 [ECF No. 108]. Ramsey and Pillonato assert that they have a reasonable expectation of privacy in these personal devices, which gives them standing to contest the search and seizure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Ramsey and Pillonato reason that a warrant or a showing of probable cause is therefore required to seize and download the content of their devices. They argue that such a showing has not been made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Receiver argues that Pillonato and Ramsey have waived their right to even raise a Fourth Amendment claim, that they would not have standing to assert such a claim, and that, in any event, probable cause has been established to seize and search these devices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Waiver\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Receiver first argues that Ramsey and Pillonato waived their right to raise a Fourth Amendment claim by not doing so during the hearing on the Preliminary Injunction. On June 6, 2018, the Court held an evidentiary hearing on the Preliminary Injunction, and Defendants were given the opportunity to present evidence and argument contesting its entry and scope. According to the Receiver, Ramsey and Pillonato failed to object to the entry of the Preliminary Injunction, which includes the turnover of \"[a]ll computers, electronic devices, mobile devices, and machines used to conduct the business of the Receivership entities ....\" Section XV. Preliminary Injunction [ECF No. 64]. In their Objection, Ramsey and Pillonato now collaterally attack as Fourth Amendment violations the very provisions of the Preliminary Injunction to which they had previously failed to object. According to the Receiver, this belated invocation of the Fourth Amendment to prevent the turnover of the electronic devices is untimely. The Receiver argues that Pillonato and Ramsey have waived any Fourth Amendment claim, and on that basis alone their claim should fail. In support of this argument, the Receiver relies on\n   <em>\n    FTC v.

[ECF No. 117]. The Receiver is correct in asserting that Ramsey and Pillonato did not expressly identity the \"Fourth Amendment\" as a basis for their objections to the turnover. They expressly identified only the \"Fifth Amendment.\" [ECF No. 117 pp. 59, 63]. Yet, counsel for Ramsey and Pillonato was unequivocal in stating that the devices were \"their cell phones\" and \"their laptops\" - \"not corporate cell phones\" and \"not corporate laptops\" - and therefore \"in order to search a cell phone, I know, you need a search warrant. In order to search a computer, you need a search warrant.\" [ECF No. 117 p. 63]. By arguing to the District Court that the electronic devices were personal to Ramsey and Pillonato and that a warrant was therefore required to search their contents, counsel for Ramsey and Pillonato was (by clear implication) raising a Fourth Amendment objection to the turnover order. Accordingly, the undersigned declines to conclude that Ramsey and Pillonato waived their Fourth Amendment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   At the hearing conducted before the undersigned, the Receiver argued that Ramsey and Pillonato lack standing to assert a Fourth Amendment claim because they failed to claim ownership of the electronic devices in financial affidavits completed earlier in this litigation and, despite representations that they would do so, never amended those affidavits to reflect the claimed ownership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Ramsey and Pillonato counter that they not only had purchased the electronic devices with their own funds but that they have continually asserted this position throughout the litigation, including (through counsel) at the Preliminary Injunction hearing. Furthermore, they argue that irrespective of the party that made the purchase, they have established an undeniable possessory interest in these devices - they have taken them home and have been using them as their own - that gives rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

To establish a reasonable expectation of privacy, the defendant must manifest a subjective expectation of privacy in the items searched or seized, and society must be prepared to recognize that expectation as legitimate or objectively reasonable. In other words, a defendant must establish both a subjective and an objective expectation of privacy. The subjective prong is a factual inquiry, requiring a person exhibit an actual expectation of privacy, ... The objective prong is a question of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Determining the legitimacy of a privacy expectation entails a balancing of interests; no single factor is determinative. Factors courts generally consider include property ownership, whether the defendant has a possessory interest in the things seized or place searched, whether the defendant has the right to exclude others from the place, whether he has exhibited a subjective expectation the place would remain free from governmental\n   invasion, whether he took precautions to maintain his privacy, and whether he was legitimately on the premises.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326236\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/158/1303/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326236\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/158/1303/\">\n    at 1308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Although the Receiver notes Ramsey and Pillonato's failure to list these devices on their financial affidavits, the record is clear that they have consistently asserted that these are personal devices that they purchased with their personal funds; and the Receiver has not suggested evidence to the contrary. Moreover, these were devices that Ramsey and Pillonato had been keeping in their personal possession and, indeed, had with them inside the Ramsey residence when they were served with the TRO demanding their turnover; they instead fled with the devices. Furthermore, according to the Receiver's own allegations, Ramsey and Pillonato had actually been utilizing these devices for business purposes. Indeed, taking the Receiver's allegations (set forth more fully below) as true, Pillonato and Ramsey had been utilizing their cell phones to send and/or receive thousands of text messages. The undersigned, therefore, finds that Ramsey and Pillonato manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in their laptop computers and cell phones and that in light of their strong possessory - if not ownership - interest in the electronic devices, society is prepared to recognize their expectation as legitimate or objectively reasonable. Accordingly, the undersigned concludes that Ramsey and Pillonato have standing to raise a Fourth Amendment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Probable Cause\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Ramsey and Pillonato argue because they enjoy a reasonable expectation of privacy in their electronic devices, the Receiver cannot seize and search - that is, download the content of - their electronic devices without a search warrant or, in this context, a showing of probable cause.

As demonstrated by Defendants' business records; Defendants' banking and payment processing records; declarations/testimony from a Google employee; consumer declarations/testimony; transcripts of calls; records of undercover calls and an undercover purchase; and the additional documentation filed by the FTC, the FTC has established a likelihood of success in showing that Defendants (1) used false claims of affiliation with Google, false threats of removal from Google, and false promises of prominent placement in search results to sell Google listing and search engine optimization services; and (2) without authorization, took money from consumers' bank accounts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Preliminary Injunction at 4 [ECF No. 64].

The undersigned does not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Preliminarily, the undersigned notes that in the TRO, the District Court made the same findings that it did in the Preliminary Injunction. TRO at 2 [ECF No. 12]. And in that TRO, the Court ordered Defendants, including Ramsey and Pillonato, to turnover any electronic devices in their possession containing business records of Receivership Entities:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   If any Documents, computers, or electronic storage devices containing information related to the business practices or finances of the Receivership Entities are at a location other than those listed herein, including personal residence(s) of any Defendant, then, immediately upon receiving notice of this order, Defendants and Receivership Entities shall produce to the Receiver all such Documents, computers, and electronic storage devices, along with any codes or passwords needed for access.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   TRO at 24 [ECF No. 12]. The TRO, therefore, clearly contemplated that business records of the Receivership Entities would be found on computers and electronic storage devices at Defendants' personal residences, irrespective of whom may have purchased those devices, and it directed that such devices be turned over to the Receiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Moreover, the Receiver has articulated probable cause to believe that the laptops at issue contain information related to the Receivership Entities. First, the Receiver notes that Ramsey and Pillonato, both of whom are principals of the Receivership Entities, have never denied - at the Preliminary Injunction hearing or elsewhere - that their laptop computers contain business\n   records of these Entities. Indeed, given the realities of running a modern business - in this instance, a digital or internet business - logic would dictate that there is at least a \"fair probability\" that principals of such a business would have records of their business activity not only on their personal cellphones (a fact that forensic examinations have now established), but also on their personal laptop computers. Were there any doubt that the laptops contained business records of the Receivership Entities, Ramsey and Pillonato seemingly removed that doubt by immediately fleeing from Ramsey's residence with the laptops upon being served with the TRO commanding that they turn over the laptops to the Receiver.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Receiver, in turn, was seeking to image the laptops to preserve the data as required by the Court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Receiver additionally argues that Ramsey and Pillonato used their cell phones, much like they used their laptops, to conduct business activity. According to the Receiver, their use of the cell phones for Receivership business activity is confirmed by digital forensic examinations. More specifically, the Receiver examined the cell phone belonging to Defendant Ricardo Diaz, who had voluntarily surrendered his cell phone to the Receiver and consented to the device being imaged and searched. Reply at 13 [ECF No. 129]. The data extraction confirms that from December 1, 2016, to February 26, 2018, a total of 2,976 text messages were exchanged between Ramsey and Diaz and that from December 14, 2016, to April 11, 2018, a total of 1,235 text messages were exchanged between Pillonato and Diaz. The Receiver represents that his cursory review of the texts confirms that the overwhelming majority of the 4,202 exchanged text messages concern the business operations of the Receivership Entities. By way of example:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   Between Diaz and Ramsey -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   \"But if dustin [sic] and I can't make a profit no one can\" (no. 202);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   \"Ricardo how many total deals we do last week\" (no. 574);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   \"We make 100k a month\" (no. 795); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   \"Next week we are Pointbreak\" (no. 957).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   Between Diaz and Pillonato -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   Numerous texts regarding \"chargebacks\" (nos. 67, 226, 227, 230, 426, 479, 740); Numerous texts regarding \"upsells\" (nos. 295,454,593); and \"first time in point break google history where an office lot [sic] money\" (no. 673).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12003788\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/962/1436/#p1440\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That Pillonato and Ramsey extensively used their personal cell phones to conduct business activity lends further support to the Receiver's contention that they similarly used their personal laptops to conduct business activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In sum, viewing the evidence in its totality, there exists here more than a fair probability that evidence of the business operations of the Receivership Entities will be found on the laptop computers and cell phones currently in the possession of the Clerk of the Court.

[ECF. No. 64 at 2].\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    The undersigned notes that Ramsey and Pillonato appear to have complied with \u00b6 2 of the Court's Order [ECF No. 62], directed to the passwords, the backpacks, and the identity and contact information of the unidentified individual. The only matters for the undersigned's consideration, therefore, are the constitutional issues with respect to the turnover and download of the electronic devices.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    The Receiver argues that the assertion by Ramsey and Pillonato that they had purchased the electronic devices with their own personal funds is offered without evidentiary support. Neither Ramsey nor Pillonato identified any of the electronic devices in his respective sworn financial disclosure form. The Receiver notes that he brought this omission to the Court's attention at the hearing on the preliminary injunction, but despite representations that each would amend his financial disclosure form, neither Pillonato nor Ramsey have done so.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    The Receiver acknowledges that to the extent any of the electronic devices contain data or communications generated only after the TRO was entered and which consist of valid individual attorney-client communications, such communications must be walled off from review, and production of the devices would not constitute a waiver of any such valid individual attorney-client communications.

Lopez observed that the unidentified man was carrying two unzipped laptop computer bags on his right shoulder with a visible laptop inside each bag and three Louis Vuitton backpacks (that are property of the Receivership estate) on his right forearm.
