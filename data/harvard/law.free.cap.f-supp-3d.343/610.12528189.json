Certain federal entitlement programs contemplate lifetime benefit payments, Am. Compl. \u00b6 15. These include programs administered by the Social Security Administration (\"SSA\"), the Office of Personnel Management (\"OPM\"), the Railroad Retirement Board (\"RRB\"), and the Department of Veterans Affairs (\"VA\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The recurring benefit payments from these agencies are intended to cease once the person receiving the payments (the \"Recipient\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   dies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Relator Edward Hendrickson (\"Relator\") alleges that, due to fraud by Defendants, the payments often continue long after the Recipient has died and that a large percentage of the overpayments are never returned to the Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The process by which federal agencies make recurring benefit payments entails several steps. First, the agencies transmit the funds to the Automated Clearing House (\"ACH\") network. Am. Compl. \u00b6 19. The bank where the Recipient has an account receives the funds from the ACH network and then deposits the payment into the Recipient's account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. The banks participating in the ACH network are referred to as \"Receiving Depository Financial Institutions\" (\"RDFI\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. All of the banks named as defendants in the instant case are RDFIs. When an RDFI accepts a benefit payment, it agrees to be bound by applicable Department of Treasury (\"Treasury\") rules and regulations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. The main sources of such regulations are 31 C.F.R. Part 210 (\"Part 210\") and the \"instructions and procedures\" issued under Part 210, including the Treasury Financial Manual and the Green Book.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20210.3\">\n    31 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Am.

For claims arising prior to March 23, 2010, the bar is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   No court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or Government Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, unless the action is brought by the Attorney General or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(A) (1986). On March 23, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act amended the bar to read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   The court shall dismiss an action or claim under this section ... if substantially the same allegations or transactions as alleged in the action or claim were publicly disclosed ... (i) in a Federal criminal, civil, or administrative hearing in which the Government or its agent is a party; (ii) in a congressional, Government Accountability Office, or other Federal report, hearing, audit, or investigation; or (iii) from the news media, unless the action is brought by the Attorney General or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(A) (2010). The Fifth Circuit applies the 1986 version to allegations based on conduct that occurred prior to March 23, 2010, and applies the 2010 version to allegations based on conduct occurring on or after that date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Lockey v. City of Dallas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4178118\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/576/431/#p435\">\n    576 F. App'x 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 435, 437 (5th Cir. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   There are several differences between the two versions, none of which alter the outcome of this Court's analysis. First, the bar no longer contains jurisdictional language; instead it requires a court to dismiss barred actions. This is a difference without a distinction in the instant case. Prior to the 2010 amendments, courts viewed a jurisdictional challenge under the FCA as \"the equivalent of a motion for summary judgment because it [was] necessarily intertwined with the merits.\"\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Solomon v. Lockheed Martin Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263695\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/139/#p143\">\n    878 F.3d 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 143 (5th Cir. 2017). It is unclear whether the 2010 version of the public-disclosure bar is still a jurisdictional barrier or whether it is now an affirmative defense. If it is an affirmative defense, it would require Defendants to \"establish beyond peradventure\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the essential elements of the defense.\"\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Lockey v. City of Dallas\n   </em>\n   , Civ. A.

Jan. 23, 2013) (citation omitted). The Fifth Circuit has yet to address this issue. But, even if the amendments contemplated converting the jurisdictional inquiry into an affirmative defense, the ultimate outcome remains the same-if there has been a disqualifying public disclosure, the lawsuit will be dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lockey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%20268371\">\n    2013 WL 268371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *13 (\"Even with this change in statutory language, because this jurisdictional threshold must be resolved preliminarily, the Court's analysis, as a practical matter, remains the same.\" (citing\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Osheroff v. Humana, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 10-24486-cv-SCOLA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204479072\">\n    2012 WL 4479072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 28, 2012) ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court would reach the same conclusion in the instant case regardless. If the Court required Defendants to carry the affirmative defense burden of proof, Defendants would still prevail, and the public-disclosure bar would prohibit Relator from moving forward with his lawsuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the Court need not, and declines to, decide whether the 2010 amendment changes the public-disclosure bar from a jurisdictional inquiry to an affirmative defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Second, the action no longer is required to be \"based upon\" publicly disclosed transactions-it must instead be \"substantially the same.\" This change has no real impact, as courts considering the term \"based upon\" interpreted it to mean \"substantially the same.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lockey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%20268371\">\n    2013 WL 268371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *13-*14 (noting that inquiry under 2010 version \"essentially remains the same\" as inquiry under 1986 version);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Osheroff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204479072\">\n    2012 WL 4479072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (declining to \"labor unnecessarily to draw narrow distinctions, to the extent there are any, between [the two] standards\" in case that did not present close call). Third, state court hearings are no longer considered\n   sources of public disclosures. This change only disqualifies one of Defendants' proffered disclosures, as noted below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Finally, the definition of \"original source\" differs between the two versions. Under the 1986 version, an original source is someone \"who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the Government before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(B) (1986). Under the 2010 version, an original source is someone \"who either (i) prior to a public disclosure ..., has voluntarily disclosed to the Government the information on which allegations or transactions in a claim are based, or (2) [sic] who has knowledge that is independent of and materially adds to the publicly disclosed allegations or transactions, and who has voluntarily provided the information to the Government before filing an action under this section.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(B) (2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Fifth Circuit employs an overarching, three-part test to guide the analysis of whether the public-disclosure bar applies: \"1) whether there has been a 'public disclosure' of allegations or transactions, 2) whether the qui tam action is 'based upon' such publicly disclosed allegations, and 3) if so, whether the relator is the 'original source' of the information.\"\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

Some courts have analyzed only the original complaint in determining whether jurisdiction exists under the 1986 version of the public-disclosure bar.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jamison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5715809\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/649/322/#p327\">\n    649 F.3d at 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that when original \"complaint did not establish jurisdiction, it should have been dismissed; [the relator's] amendments cannot save it\"). However, in the instant case, Defendants have directed their jurisdictional arguments to the Amended Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Br. 24 n.11 [ECF No. 93]. The Court finds that nothing precludes its ability to consider the argument that \"this Court lacks jurisdiction, regardless of whether the original Complaint fails to provide a basis for jurisdiction in the first instance.\"\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

Abbott Labs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4003149\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/864/499/#p514\">\n    864 F.Supp.2d 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 514 (N.D.

Thus, this Court will focus only on the Amended Complaint in analyzing whether it has jurisdiction under the 1986 version of the public-disclosure bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.\n    <em>\n     Public Disclosure of Allegations or Transactions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The first issue for this Court to consider is whether there was a public disclosure of the allegations or transactions at issue that predated the filing of Relator's complaint.

The Court will consider the first two elements here. The Court will then consider the last element in conjunction with its \"based upon\" inquiry below.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jamison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5715809\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/649/322/#p327\">\n    649 F.3d at 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[C]ombining the first two steps can be useful, because it allows the scope of the relator's action in step two to define the 'allegations or transactions' that must be publicly disclosed in step one.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendants identify a litany of public disclosures that they contend are in the form specified by the FCA, including state and federal court cases, government administrative reports, and news articles.

Relator's work at the VA may have provided him with direct and independent knowledge of VA payments, but it is difficult to imagine how he would have gained such knowledge of payments from other agencies. Only one of the examples in the Amended Complaint involves a loss by an agency other than the VA, yet the Amended Complaint purports to disclose a widespread fraudulent scheme impacting the SSA, OPM, and RRB, in addition to the VA.

Further, the Court finds that Relator's knowledge does not materially add to the publicly disclosed transactions.

Although\n   <em>\n    Grubbs\n   </em>\n   involved a claim under \u00a7 3279(a)(1) of the FCA, the Court finds the standard announced in that case both relevant to and useful in the instant case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The scheme alleged by Relator is as follows: \"(1) The Banks received DNEs for deceased individuals that kept getting Government payments; (2) The Banks had an obligation to return those funds and tell the Government agency to stop paying because the person died; (3) The Banks did not do so; and (4) The Banks acted with the requisite False Claims Act 'knowledge[.]' \" Rel.'s Suppl.

Further, the examples Relator does provide are insufficient evidence from which the Court can infer a scheme to violate the FCA. And, despite alleging that the RRB and OPM were defrauded pursuant to the alleged scheme, the Amended Complaint is almost completely devoid of details relating to any agency other than the VA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The Amended Complaint also lacks necessary details with regard to the \"what\" and \"how.\" Critically, Relator omits particular details about the allegation upon which the entire scheme alleged by Relator relies: that Defendants received notice of Recipients' deaths through the receipt of DNEs. \"In accordance with SSA DNE procedures,\" Relator contends, \"the Defendant banks receive a SSA DNE on the day after a death termination is displayed.... By virtue of this procedure, each Defendant bank would have been in possession of an electronic record notifying it of the beneficiary's death.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 39. Relator does not, and cannot, allege that a DNE was indeed sent or received every time Defendants failed to stop accepting payments and notify federal agencies that a Recipient had died. Instead, he relies on the SSA's policy, as reflected in the agency's POMS, GN 02408.605.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' App. Ex. M.

Further, the manual states that, \"On the day after a death termination is displayed ..., SSA passes a DNE to the Richmond Federal\n   Reserve Bank (RFRB) .... RFRB then passes the information through the [ACH] to the [RDFI].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 141. Then, the RDFI is supposed to \"return[ ], within three days, any additional government benefit payments that arrive for this [Recipient].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For already-posted payments, the RDFI \"has the option of waiting for a [NOR] before returning the funds to the agency.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Defendants repeatedly counter that the DNE process is woefully inadequate because not all agencies issue DNEs and because the Government has a difficult time keeping track of Recipient deaths. And, in the examples provided by Relator, there is no allegation that a DNE was sent to or received by any of the Defendants. Without more information, the Court cannot assume that a DNE is sent and received every time a Recipient dies.

Thus, Relator argues, \"[i]t is certainly reasonable for this Court to infer ... that ... the Banks knew how to follow ACH regulations, were more than capable of doing so, failed to do so on a routine basis, and benefitted as a result of such misconduct.\" Rel.'s Mem. in Opp'n 33 [ECF No. 102].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   As noted above, the Court finds that Relator has insufficiently pleaded the alleged misconduct. Therefore, the Court cannot conclude that there was any routine misconduct. Relator fails to identify which banks' representatives allegedly confirmed misconduct to investigators, so that alleged fact also does not support an individualized finding of scienter. And, as Defendants note, RDFIs have an incentive\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to continue receiving payments. The competing incentives faced by RDFIs undercut Relator's argument that the Court can infer scienter based on what Defendants stand to gain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The argument that Defendants are knowledgeable ACH participants has weaknesses as well. While Relator points to one provision of the Green Book, 5-8, that requires RDFIs to\n   <em>\n    immediately\n   </em>\n   return payments after a Recipient dies, Defendants point to another provision of the Green Book, 5-9, that uses more lenient language. FCA liability does not attach when a defendant reasonably, yet erroneously, interprets its legal obligations.\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Purcell v.

Because of this deficiency, along with those discussed above, the Court grants Defendants' Motion to Dismiss based on Rules 12(b)(6) and 9(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     Arguments not Reached\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Defendants also allege that many of the examples of specific misconduct are time-barred under Part 210 and that that the claims against Citibank, M &amp; T Bank, PNC Bank, Frost Bank, American National Bank, Centrue Bank, and Amarillo National Bank should be dismissed. Because the Court has already elucidated two separate and independent grounds for dismissal, the Court declines to reach these arguments and expresses no opinion on them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    c.\n    <em>\n     Conflict of Interest\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Defendants argue that Relator's request for a share of any monetary relief won should be stricken pursuant to federal conflict-of-interest rules. Because the Court grants Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, it need not consider this request and finds that it is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Statute of Limitations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Defendants move for dismissal of all claims arising more than before six years before Relator filed his complaint on February 2, 2016. At the hearing held on May 10, 2018, counsel for Relator stipulated that Relator was not \"seeking damages prior to six years from the filing of the original complaint.\" Hr'g Tr. 85:18-19. Thus, only claims that arose on or after February 2, 2010, remain at issue in this case, and Defendants' Motion to Dismiss on limitations grounds is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Motion to Dismiss on standing grounds. The Court denies as moot Defendants' Motion to Dismiss on statute of limitations grounds. The Court grants the Motion to Dismiss on public disclosure grounds and for failure to state a claim. Because there has been a disqualifying public disclosure, the Court finds that amendment would be futile and dismisses Relator's lawsuit with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    The defendants in this case are Bank of America, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Citibank, N.A., Comerica Bank, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company, Seacost National Bank, Fifth Third Bank, PNC Bank, N.A., The Northern Trust Company, Frost Bank, The American National Bank of Texas, Centrue Bank, Amarillo National Bank, and Wachovia Bank, N.A.
