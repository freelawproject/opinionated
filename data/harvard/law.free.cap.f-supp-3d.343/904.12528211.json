Approximately a week before the attack, Mr. Shuhada directed Mr. Masharipov to launch the attack.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 343.

Plaintiffs responded by filing their FAC, which was their opportunity to address any deficiency in proximate cause. At the hearing, Plaintiffs rested their argument on their legal interpretation of proximate cause and did not suggest they could amend the complaint to allege materially different facts. Plaintiffs did not contend, for instance, that they could allege Mr. Masharipov viewed ISIS materials or communicated with ISIS through any of Defendants' social platforms.
