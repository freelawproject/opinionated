Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This civil action concerns the planned demolition of the East Avenue Bridge,\n   which is owned by the City of Erie and commonly known as the \"McBride Viaduct.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 23, 29, Doc. 1. The case was commenced on April 30, 2018 by Plaintiffs Erie CPR\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Erie CPR members Beary Clark, Harry Euell, Michael Keys, Judy Lynch, Minister Luchetta Manus, Reverend Charles Mock,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cynthia Muhammad, Noel Remigio, Abdulla Washington, Adam Trott, Lisa Austin, and Taquanta Gray (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\"). In their complaint, Plaintiffs request the entry of an order enjoining the Viaduct's removal and granting Plaintiffs a public hearing for the purpose of challenging the demolition plan. To that end, Plaintiffs have filed a motion for preliminary injunction (ECF 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In June and July 2018, following a delay in service of the Complaint, the \"City Defendants\" - i.e., the City of Erie, Pennsylvania (at times herein, the \"City\"), Erie Mayor Joseph Schember (\"Schember\"), and the City Council of Erie (the \"City Council\") -- and the \"State Defendants\" - i.e., the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (\"PennDOT\"), the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission (\"PA PUC\" or the \"Commission\") -- filed their respective motions to dismiss the Complaint (ECF Nos. 21 and 29). Plaintiffs then sought, and received, an extension of time for purposes of filing their brief in opposition to the State Defendants' motions to dismiss, which was submitted on August 2, 2018 (ECF 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 18, 2018, the undersigned was assigned this case, following appointment as a United States District Judge. The Court's initial intent, particularly upon learning of the City's imminent demolition plans, was to schedule a hearing on the preliminary injunction. To that end, the Court held several telephonic status calls to discuss the procedural posture of the case and the practical logistics for scheduling either a preliminary injunction hearing or a final hearing on the merits. (ECF Nos. 38, 40, 41.) In the meantime, however, because the pending motions to dismiss were potentially dispositive and could moot the issue of injunctive relief, the Court undertook a careful and thorough review of the pleadings in light of Defendants' pending Rule 12(b)(6) motions. The Court also carefully considered which materials outside of the pleadings could be appropriately considered under Rule 12(b)(6) without the need for converting the Defendants' motion to a Rule 56 motion and thereby creating further delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The gravamen of the Complaint is that the City should maintain the Viaduct for continued pedestrian and bicycle use, so as to maintain connectivity between certain Eastside communities and provide what Plaintiffs consider to be a safer and preferable corridor of travel. Plaintiffs fault the City and State Defendants for engaging in a decision-making process that, in their view, involved insufficient outreach to the affected community members. As a result, Plaintiffs maintain, the Defendants failed to understand the importance and utility of the Viaduct as a corridor for non-vehicular traffic. Plaintiffs also fault the Defendants for an alleged lack of transparency which, they claim, precluded interested citizens and organizations like Erie CPR from having a full and fair opportunity to present a case for continued use of the Viaduct as a corridor for walkers and bicyclists. At bottom, Plaintiffs seek an order from this Court that would require the Defendants\n   to abandon their demolition plans and hold a hearing at which Plaintiffs can state their case for maintaining the Viaduct and the decision can be considered anew. In the course of its analysis, the Court concluded that the Plaintiffs' claims do not establish a basis for the relief they are seeking. Accordingly, for the reasons stated herein, Defendants' motions to dismiss the complaint will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Report outlined various \"project needs,\" which included the following considerations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 The McBride Viaduct is considered structurally deficient and functionally obsolete and has been closed since June 2, 2010.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 The typical Viaduct traffic utilizes posted detours and alternative routes, causing an increase in travel time for the general public.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 The existing roadway network surrounding the McBride Viaduct is not adequately designed to accommodate the increased traffic especially for large trucks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 Connectivity issues exist for the adjacent roadways within the project area.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 Missing links in pedestrian and cyclist connectivity exist within the surrounding vicinity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 Existing and future traffic delays exist within the project area.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A.A.

By Opinion and Order entered on July 18, 2017, the PUC denied the petition. ECF No. 21-2. In its Opinion, the PA PUC noted, in relevant part, the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   The Petitioner argues that Erie's reasoning for the abolition of the subject crossing was based entirely upon the recommendations and results of the Feasibility Study,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   which the Petitioner alleges, is flawed because it failed to consider the alternative of rehabilitating the crossing for use as a \"pedestrian-only bridge.\" According to the Petitioner, the Feasibility Study failed to properly evaluate the McBride Viaduct for pedestrian-only usage because it wrongly limits Viaduct pedestrian use to only the bridge sidewalks, and not to the entire roadway which would be available for use by pedestrians. In citing to several exhibits from the Feasibility Study, the Petitioner argues that the Feasibility Study failed to include an impact assessment of hazards for pedestrians with respect to noise, debris, and the cumulative impact of those pedestrians using the route at least two times per day. In the Petitioner's view, if the alternative of using the crossing as a pedestrian-only bridge is fully considered, it would significantly alter several key finding of the Feasibility Study, most notably the project cost, which the Petitioner states was a major consideration in the Feasibility Study's final recommendation. Petition at 3-6.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   In its Answer to the Petition, Erie refutes the Petitioner's assertion that the Feasibility Study failed to properly consider the alternative of using the\n   crossing as a pedestrian-only bridge. According to Erie, the Feasibility study examined eleven alternatives, including the alternative championed by the Petitioner, but found that the cost of rehabilitation of the bridge for pedestrian-only use was not materially different from usage of the bridge by vehicles. As a result, Erie submits that the Complainant's suggested rehabilitation alternative provides no advantages because it would serve fewer needs, thereby supporting the validity of the feasibility Study's recommendation for abolition of the crossing. In addition, Erie contends that the proposed project has been the topic of study and of public meetings for a number of years and the Petitioner has failed to provide a valid reason for overturning the Commission's determination that the project can be approved on an expedited basis. Erie Answer at 2-3.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   .... Erie submits that it has engaged in an exhaustive Feasibility Study, which was approved by PennDOT and the Federal Highway Administration, and held three public meetings and four citizen advisory committee meetings on the subject.

ECF No. 1. Count I of the Complaint asserts a claim for intentional race-based discrimination in violation of \u00a7 601 of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VI\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d (Compl. \u00b6 162-165); Count II alleges that Defendants violated regulations set forth at 49 C.F.R.

Three years later, however, a PennDOT official distributed McBride Viaduct documents from which these two measures had been omitted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44. Plaintiffs complain that the changes were made \"without prior public notice or discussion at a public hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45. Elsewhere in Subsection \"B,\" Plaintiffs aver that the City Defendants' failed to clean the McBride Viaduct's storm drains which fostered slow 'demolition by neglect.' \" Compl. \u00b6 46.

The gravamen of Plaintiffs' grievances\n   is that, from a procedural perspective, the Defendants failed to structure an \"appropriate\" and \"transparent\" public outreach program that would have more fully engaged social justice populations in the McBride area and thereby produced a more informed Feasibility Study. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 75, 123.

However, Plaintiffs characterize these efforts as \"very limited,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , and they object that Defendants \"failed to recognize the importance of on-site interviews of the actual impoverished users of the bridge to determine its value\" to those users.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 130. Plaintiffs further claim that Defendants should have prepared \"public involvement materials\" in other languages,\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 139, and should have utilized interpretative services, such as PennDOT's \"INTERPRETALK\" service, to ensure effective communication with non-English speaking citizens.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 141-43.

Plaintiffs contrast this treatment with: (a) the scheduled demolition of the McBride Viaduct and (b) the demolition of the Division Street railroad underpass, which occurred in 2016 in connection with the City's Metropolitan Transit Authority garage and parking lot construction project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Absent from the Complaint is any averment that the construction projects situated in allegedly white communities are otherwise similarly situated to the McBride Viaduct project. Indeed, as Plaintiffs acknowledge in their Complaint, the McBride Viaduct is a 1170-foot structure - the length of nearly four football fields. Compl. \u00b6 30. According to L.R. Kimball, the bridge requires 23 spans \"to accommodate business activity and the railroad underneath,\" and \"[r]eplacing the bridge requires excavating and rebuilding all the spans.\" A.A. Report at 121. As is evident from the Alternative Analysis Report, L.R. Kimball recommended demolition of the Viaduct only after undertaking a detailed cost/benefit analysis that considered a host of engineering and environmental factors that were unique to the Viaduct and the surrounding area. The Complaint, however, lacks any factual content to suggest that the comparator projects in allegedly white communities presented the same kinds of issues or considerations that ostensibly drove L.R. Kimball's recommendation. Nor are there any allegations to suggest that the City ignored or overrode recommendations that the comparator bridges in allegedly white communities be demolished. In short, without some factual content to suggest that similar considerations were at play when the Defendants approved the refurbishment of the comparator bridges or roadways, the Complaint cannot support a plausible inference that\n   the Defendants were motivated by racial considerations when they approved the demolition of the McBride Viaduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Finally, the Court is not persuaded that Plaintiffs have pled a \"pattern of intentional discrimination\" that can sustain their \u00a7 601 claim. As part of the Defendants' alleged pattern of intentional racial discrimination, Plaintiffs aver that two \"compensatory measures\" that had originally been proposed for the benefit of bikers and pedestrians in 2014 were later omitted from project documents that were distributed by an unidentified PennDOT official three years later. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 43-44. Though Plaintiffs complain that the changes were made \"without prior public notice or discussion at a public hearing,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45, the mere fact that certain aspects of construction plans changed over time without formal notice to the public is not indicative of discriminatory motive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Plaintiffs further allege, as part of the pattern of discrimination, that the City Defendants regularly maintained and cleaned bridges in majority white neighborhoods while failing to do the same in predominantly black communities. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 46-47. The Complaint does not offer any factual content to support this \"naked assertion,\"\n   <em>\n    Iqbal,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the only other reference to bridges in white communities concerns the previously discussed Norman Way Bridge and the Millcreek Drift Catcher Erie Zoo Train Bridge. For the reasons stated, Plaintiffs have not alleged facts that suggest these supposed comparator bridges are otherwise similar to the Viaduct in all relevant respects; therefore, one cannot plausibly infer from the Complaint that the City's actions relative to the McBride Viaduct were motivated by race.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Plaintiffs also alludes to a remark that the City's engineer allegedly made in 2018 to the effect that he had \"been planning to demolish the McBride Viaduct for over a decade.\" Compl. \u00b6 48. No factual content is offered that would suggest a nexus between this individual and the relevant decision-makers for the City or PennDOT. Moreover, even if Plaintiffs' allegation about the engineer is credited, his statement in no way implies that his desire to demolish the Viaduct was the product of discriminatory intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Plaintiffs' Title VI claims are even more tenuous as they relate to Defendant PA PUC. The Complaint's only allegations concern the Commission's approval of the City's demolition plans, as expressed in its February 17, 2017 Secretarial Letter, its July 18, 2017 denial of Trott's petition for reconsideration, and its Secretarial Letter of December 20, 2017. Although Plaintiffs generally characterize the Commission's decision-making as hurried and predetermined, nothing in the Complaint lends any support to an inference that the PA PUC acted with a racially discriminatory intent. Nor does the Complaint plausibly establish the Commission's deliberate indifference toward a third party's intentional discrimination. For reasons already discussed, no plausible inference of intentional discrimination on the part of the City or PennDOT has been stated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Based upon all of the foregoing considerations, the Court finds that, despite its length, the Complaint lacks sufficient factual content to support a claim of intentional race-based or national origin-based discrimination under \u00a7 601. Accordingly, the motions to dismiss will be granted insofar as they relate to Count I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <em>\n    Count II of the Complaint\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Section 602 of Title VI empowers \"[e]ach Federal department and agency\" to \"effectuate the provisions of section [601] ... by issuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability\" relative to federally assisted\n   programs or activities. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d-1.

In addition, Plaintiffs have failed to plead facts suggesting that the City or its policymakers were deliberately indifferent to intentional discrimination relative to the Viaduct's removal. Although Plaintiffs have pointed to putative comparator projects in white communities, Plaintiffs have failed to plead that those projects were similarly situated to the Viaduct in all relevant respects. At most, Plaintiffs have pled facts that establish that the demolition of the Viaduct will have a disparate impact on a primarily non-white community; however, that is not enough to state a claim for race discrimination claim under either the Equal Protection Clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3864316\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/665/524/#p557\">\n    665 F.3d at 551-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2011) (\"[E]ven conscious awareness on the part of the [decisionmaker] that the [policy] will have a racially disparate impact does not invalidate an otherwise valid law, so long as that awareness played no causal role in the adoption of the policy.\") (internal quotation mark omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Plaintiffs' equal protection claim is even more tenuous as it relates to the PA PUC. As alleged in the Complaint, PA PUC's only involvement in this case was to approve the City's application for permission to demolish the Viaduct. Plaintiffs fault the PA PUC for not affording them an opportunity to participate in the July 2017 hearing, wherein the PA PUC allegedly reached a predetermined decision to deny Mr. Trott's petition for reconsideration of the Commission's prior approval of the demolition project. Nothing in the record before the Court supports a plausible inference that the PA PUC was motivated by considerations of race or national origin. Nor can the Court plausibly infer on this record that PA PUC was aware of, and deliberately indifferent to, intentional discrimination on the part of PennDOT and/or the City Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Based on the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs' Complaint fails to state claims upon which relief can be granted. When a civil rights complaint is dismissed for failure to state a claim, plaintiffs should be granted the opportunity to amend the complaint unless amendment would be inequitable or futile.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

In this case, the defects that the Court has highlighted appear to be irremediable. Consequently, the Complaint will be dismissed with prejudice, since further amendment would be futile. From a procedural standpoint, the Court notes that this dismissal will afford Plaintiffs an immediate right of appeal and will avoid the expenses that would inevitably be incurred in connection with an injunction hearing including, potentially, counsel fees, expert witness fees, costs of bond (unless waived), and significant delay costs for the City if work on the Viaduct cannot proceed due to the ensuing winter months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Finally, in reaching its ruling, the Court notes that it is not unsympathetic to the concerns expressed by Plaintiffs who are no doubt sincere in their opposition to removal of the McBride Viaduct. Nevertheless, the Court must be guided in its decision-making at all times by the controlling legal standards that govern this case. Here, for the reasons stated above, the Court is of the view that Plaintiffs' claims are legally insufficient.
