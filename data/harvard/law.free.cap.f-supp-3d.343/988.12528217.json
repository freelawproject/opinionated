Because the Court finds that the same actor inference applies to Maybin's discrimination claims, and that Maybin has not made the strong showing necessary to overcome the inference on the facts presented, Hilton's Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment as to Count I is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural background in this matter, as described in prior Court orders, the Court recounts only those matters material to the issues raised by Hilton's renewed Motion as to Count I.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Maybin was hired by Hilton as a timeshare sales agent in September 2015 when he was 55 years old, following a series of job interviews with Hilton personnel. He first interviewed with Derek Kanoa, Vice President of Sales, and then with Julia Montenegro, a senior member of Hilton's Human Resources department. 1/11/18 Decl. of Carl Maybin \u00b6 3, Dkt. No. 26-1. Maybin then interviewed with Dave Colton, and finally, with Joshua Kannel, the Hawaii Director of Sales. Maybin Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4. Based upon Kannel's recommendation and request, Montenegro hired Maybin on September 14, 2015. 12/8/17 Decl. of Joshua Kannel \u00b6 7, Dkt. No. 21-1; 6/13/18 Montenegro Decl. \u00b6 7, Dkt. No. 46-1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Maybin failed to meet sales quotas for several consecutive months, he was subject to progressive written warnings, and then eventually terminated by Montenegro, at Kannel's recommendation. 12/8/17 Kannel Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 19-20; 6/13/18 Montenegro Decl. \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to Maybin, however, shortly after he was hired, Kannel demonstrated animus towards older sales agents by making negative comments about their abilities at sales meetings. For example, Kannel said older agents \"were too slow, can't learn, have a different way of doing things, are hard to teach new ways of sales, are too old to change, and don't have the energy necessary for sales.\" Maybin Decl. \u00b6 6. Kannel made such comments at sales meetings from the time that Maybin first\n   started \"and continued [making them] throughout [his] employment\" with Hilton. Maybin Decl. \u00b6 6. Although Hilton contends that Maybin was terminated because he was not performing his job adequately as measured by objective performance standards, Maybin asserts, without additional evidence, that from the inception of his employment until the beginning of February 2016, his sales were strong, and at times he \"was number 2 or 3 in sales,\" compared to his peers. Maybin Decl. \u00b6 7. From the end of February 2016, however, Maybin acknowledges that his sales numbers declined, and he attributes that decline, in part, to being \"given less tours,\" and intentionally assigned fewer potential customers. Maybin Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In March 2016, Maybin was assigned a new sales manager, James Tony Wilson, who treated Maybin \"in a very hostile manner\" from their first interaction. Maybin, however, does not specifically attribute age-based animus to Wilson in his Complaint or Declaration filed in this matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maybin Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 13-14. Wilson made inappropriate comments to Maybin, \"interfer[ing] with [his] sales by making sarcastic remarks about [his] clients.\" Maybin Decl. \u00b6 15. Maybin lost sales because Wilson \"would refuse to meet with [his] customers after [Maybin] gave them a tour to talk to them about purchasing.\" Maybin Decl. \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Maybin received his first written job performance warning in May 2016 for failure to meet Hilton's job performance standards.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   12/8/17 Kannel Decl. \u00b6 13; Ex. 2 (6/25/16 Performance Management Review Document), Dkt. No. 21-3. The consequences of failure to meet minimum performance guidelines after the three-month introductory period are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Starting in the fourth month of a Sales Executive's employment[,] if a Sales Executive fails to meet the required MPS, they were subject to a system of progressive written warning documenting their lack of performance and failure to satisfy the MPS (\"Job Performance Warning System\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Under the Job Performance Warning System[,] the progression is as follows: (1) written warning, (2) a second/final written warning, and (3) termination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   12/8/17 Kannel Decl. \u00b6 12(a)-(b) (citing Ex. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   According to Hilton, during the final four months of his employment, Maybin did not meet any of its performance standards. That is, he failed to have a VPG of at least $2,200 on the basis of current sales or an average of the prior three months of sales.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Maybin received a second and final written warning when he did not meet his VPG for June 2016. 12/8/17 Kannel Decl. \u00b6 15; Ex. 3 (7/26/16 Performance Management Review Document), Dkt. No. 21-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Maybin acknowledges that during April, May, and June of 2016, he did not meet sales quotas, but says that he \"was intentionally given less tours which kept [his] sales numbers down and [his] sales manager was refusing to meet [with his] customers.\" Maybin Decl. \u00b6 17. Hilton maintains that Maybin always received at least 15 tours per month-even after February 2016-and that \"[o]nly 15 tours are required each month for a sales executive to meet his sales quotas.\" 1/25/18 Decl. of Julia Montenegro \u00b6 5, Dkt. No. 29-1. According to Hilton HR's Montenegro, in May 2016, Maybin was not required to attend any training and had 19 tours. 1/25/18 Montenegro Decl. \u00b6 9. After he received his first written warning, he was \"placed into remedial training for\n   <em>\n    June 2016\n   </em>\n   ,\" and that month, his tours increased from 19 to 29. 1/25/18 Montenegro Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-10. In July, Maybin received 23 tours and \"was given an extra month of remedial training.\" Montenegro Decl. \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   According to Maybin, in July 2016, he was ordered to attend mandatory training at the Pan Am Building on Kapiolani Boulevard. Maybin Decl. \u00b6 18. As a result of the required training, Maybin claims to have only received one tour per day at 8:00 a.m., and had no sales in July 2016. According to Maybin, he \"could not possibly have met quota because he was in mandatory training.\" Maybin Decl. \u00b6 18. When Maybin did not meet his VPG in July 2016, he was terminated the following month. 12/8/17 Kannel Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-18; Ex. 4 (8/23/16 Performance Management Review Document), Dkt. No. 21-5; Ex. 5 (8/29/16 Personnel Authorization Form), Dkt. No. 21-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Kannel avers that he recommended termination to Hilton HR solely due to Maybin's sales performance and that \"Maybin's age had no part in [his] decision to recommend Mr. Maybin's termination.\" 12/8/17 Kannel Decl. \u00b6 20. Montenegro, the ultimate decisionmaker, likewise avers that \"age had no part in [her] decision to terminate Mr. Maybin.\" 1/25/18 Montenegro Decl. \u00b6 22;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   6/13/18 Montenegro Decl. \u00b6 10 (\"Mr. Maybin's age played no part in my decision to either hire or fire Mr. Maybin.\"). Maybin disagrees, and contends instead that he was wrongfully terminated in August 2016 due to age discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On September 27, 2017, Maybin filed his Complaint alleging three counts under the ADEA: (1) age discrimination; (2) hostile work environment; and (3) retaliation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-28, Dkt. No. 1. The Court previously denied Hilton's request for summary judgment on Count I, finding that genuine issues of material fact persisted with respect to pretext. Of particular note to the instant Motion, the Court determined that Hilton had not established, for purposes of invoking the \"same actor inference,\" that the same person with decision-making authority was responsible for both hiring and firing Maybin. The prior summary judgment record was insufficient because, at that time-\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Hilton argue[d] that Kannel is \"the same manager who allegedly discriminated against Plaintiff by firing him, [and also] interviewed Plaintiff and approved his hiring in the first instance.\" Mem. in Supp. at 16, Dkt. No. 20-1. Maybin contend[ed] that he interviewed with several Hilton managers before he was hired, including Montenegro, notwithstanding Kannel's assertion that it was his recommendation that led to Maybin's hiring. [However], Kannel did not have the independent authority to hire or fire Maybin-he could only recommend as much-because that power resided solely with Montenegro and Boulanger in Hilton HR.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Maybin v.

Haw. Mar. 6, 2018). The Court thus denied Hilton's motion, noting that \"whether the same actors were responsible for Maybin's hiring and the events leading to his termination is not beyond dispute on this factual record.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201177914\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court noted, however, that \"[i]f Hilton subsequently demonstrates that the same actor was responsible for both Maybin's hiring and termination, Maybin may only prevail if he makes the 'extraordinarily strong showing of discrimination' required to rebut the 'same actor' inference.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201177914\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *8 (citing\n   <em>\n    Coghlan v.

Decisions regarding hiring and firing employees in [Maybin's] capacity (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , as real estate salespersons) were the responsibility of myself and my colleague, John Boulanger.\" 6/13/18 Montenegro Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5. In light of the updated record, the Court again considers Hilton's request for summary judgment on Maybin's\n   ADEA discrimination claim, limited in scope to whether the parties have met their respective burdens to establish (1) the applicability of the same actor inference, and (2) the requisite strong showing of discrimination necessary to rebut the inference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a), a party is entitled to summary judgment \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" The moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law when the nonmoving party fails to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of a claim in the case on which the nonmoving party has the burden of proof.\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

Because Hilton has sufficiently established that Montenegro, at Kannel's recommendation, was the same decisionmaker who hired and fired Maybin within a short period of time, the same actor inference creates an inference of no age-based animus or discriminatory motive. Moreover, Hilton offers a non-discriminatory reason for the termination, with Maybin acknowledging that his monthly sales numbers fell below Hilton's minimum requirements during the relevant time period. Maybin, however, argues that the cited reason is pretextual, and attributes his sales shortages to being deliberately set-up for failure and points to the age-related comments of Kannel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Because the same actor inference applies, and the limited evidence cited by Maybin does not amount to the \"strong case of bias necessary to overcome this inference,\"\n   <em>\n    Coghlan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8972678\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/413/1090/#p1097\">\n    413 F.3d at 1098\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Hilton is entitled to summary judgment on Count I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Legal Framework: Age Discrimination and the Same Actor Inference\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The federal ADEA prohibits discrimination based on age.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20623\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (\"It shall be unlawful for an employer to ... discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's age\").

Maybin, however, is unable to offer admissible evidence to support his latest assertions. To the extent he relies upon the declaration of Ruby Richardson, another Hilton sales agent, he does not establish that she has personal knowledge of Hilton's Human Resources practices or even which employees have independent hiring and firing authority.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4). In any event, whether the Court were to consider the relevant decisionmaker to be Montenegro (as Hilton advances), or Kannel (as Maybin asserts), the outcome would be unchanged-the same decisionmaker was responsible for both Maybin's hiring and his termination within a short time period, and the same actor inference would apply.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Notably, Hilton did not previously present Montenegro's statements that she hired and terminated Maybin.
