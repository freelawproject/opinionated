Brown, United States District Judge\n   Defendant Weatherly, Inc. (\"Weatherly\") moved for partial summary judgment. (Dkt. 29). The Court granted Plaintiff US Nitrogen, LLC's (\"USN\") request for oral argument on the motion and held a hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 50. For the reasons below, the Court grants Weatherly's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This is a breach of contract case arising from the design and construction of an ammonium nitrate solution plant. USN hired Weatherly to provide engineering services related to the construction. Dkt. 33-1 at \u00b6 2; Dkt. 29-3. The parties entered into a contract for those engineering services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The parties agree that they are sophisticated business entities, that they engaged in arm's-length negotiations over the contract, and that they had several individuals, including attorneys, review the contract before signing it. Dkt. 29-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 21-26; Dkt. 33 at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 21-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Constructing the plant cost more money and took longer than the parties initially anticipated. Dkt. 18 at \u00b6\u00b6 33, 34. And after construction was complete, USN discovered cracks in the concrete foundations of compressors used in the production of the ammonium nitrate solution. Dkt. 18 at \u00b6 56;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 29-2 at \u00b6 32. USN notified Weatherly of the problem, and Weatherly recommended several repairs or modifications. Dkt. 18 at \u00b6 67. USN also sought advice from two other engineering companies, both recommending that USN remove and redesign the entire plant foundation rather than simply making the repairs Weatherly suggested.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 62-63; Dkt. 33-1 at \u00b6 27. The engineering companies also concluded that Weatherly's initial design for the compressor foundations could not support the dynamic motion of the compressors during production. Dkt. 33-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 29, 33. USN hired other companies (not Weatherly) to redesign and reconstruct the compressor foundations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At about the same time, USN determined that Weatherly's design for certain piping systems within the plant was incomplete and erroneous. Dkt. 33-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 37-39. USN instructed Weatherly to stop working on the piping design.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It then hired another company to complete that work. Dkt. 33-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 39-42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   USN believes that Weatherly is responsible for design defects in the plant and for the more than $30 million in costs and expenses that USN incurred correcting them. Dkt. 18. at \u00b6 74. USN sued Weatherly asserting claims for breach of contract, professional negligence, negligent or fraudulent misrepresentation, bad faith, and breach of express warranty. No motions to dismiss were filed. After conducting discovery, Weatherly moved for partial summary judgment on the application of a limitation of liability provision purportedly capping the damages USN may seek against Weatherly.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 29. Weatherly requests a ruling that the contract contains an enforceable limitation of liability provision, the provision caps the damages USN may seek to $2,203,800, and the contract prevents USN from recovering consequential damages. Weatherly is correct on all accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Georgia, however, has an anti-indemnification statute that precludes some limitations of liability related to construction contracts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   An ... an agreement ... in connection with ... a contract or agreement relative to the construction, alteration, repair, or maintenance of a building ... purporting to require that one party to such contract or agreement shall indemnify, hold harmless, insure, or defend the other party to the contract ... against liability or claims for damages ... arising out of bodily injury to persons, death, or damage to property caused by or resulting from the sole negligence of the indemnitee ... is against public policy and void and unenforceable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   O.G.C.A. \u00a7 13-8-2(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The contract that USN and Weatherly negotiated has a provision that purports to limit Weatherly's liability to USN resulting from the construction project. Section 5-1-23 states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Weatherly's total aggregate liability to [USN], except with respect of Weatherly's cost of performing the Work under the Contract, for all causes including defects, Weatherly defaults, default of any warranties, or guarantees, patent infringement, or otherwise,\n   <strong>\n    shall not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the Price\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Dkt. 29-3 (emphasis added).

USN disagrees and argues that the provision is an indemnification provision that violates Georgia law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Georgia's anti-indemnification statute prevents a building contractor, subcontractor, or owner from \"contracting away liability for accidents caused solely by his negligence, whether during the construction of the building or after the structure is completed and occupied.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

The Georgia Supreme Court has explained that it prevents one party to a construction contract from relieving another party to that contract from liability for injuries to third parties. In\n   <em>\n    Lanier At McEver, L.P. v. Planners And Engineers Collaborative\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    , Inc.\n   </em>\n   , a construction company sued an engineering company for damages arising from the alleged negligent design of a storm-water drainage system.

(emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The construction company argued that the provision was unenforceable under Georgia law. The Georgia Supreme Court agreed.

The Court found the contract at issue violated this rule because it required the construction company to indemnify the engineer for all liability, including liability to third parties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 243 (it is an indemnity \"particularly regarding claims for which [the engineer] may be solely negligent for injuries to third parties\"). The Supreme Court explained that \"[t]his complete avoidance of liability to third parties for sole negligence in a building contract is exactly what O.C.G.A. \u00a7 13-8-2(b) prohibits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Lanier\n   </em>\n   decision turned on that issue - whether the clause eliminated liability to third parties for all claims. Indeed, the Court held that \"[n]othing in O.C.G.A. \u00a7 13-8-2(b) permits a construction party to shift its\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     third-party liability\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   for its sole negligence to another contractor, no matter how savvy the parties or how high the damages cap.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).

In doing so, the Court noted that the\n   <em>\n    Valhal\n   </em>\n   provision - like the provision USN and Weatherly negotiated - only limited one party's liability to the other party (and subcontractors) but not its liability to other third parties.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7412899\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/44/195/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7412899\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/44/195/\">\n    at 243-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (parties \"did not agree that it would limit the liability of the architect regarding 'any third parties for any and all claims' \").

USN, for example, argues that Georgia law allows no party to indemnify another party against building code violations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 33-2 at 1-4. USN cites no Georgia case or other controlling authority to support this proposition. Any such cases would also be irrelevant as Section 5.1.23 is not an indemnification or \"hold harmless\" provision. The Court also rejects USN's argument that the provision is unenforceable because it exculpates Weatherly for bad faith and gross negligence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 33-2 at 19-25. Again, Section 5.1.23 is a cap on damages, not a hold harmless clause. This distinction is important. While the law does not favor a party's attempt to\n   <em>\n    exonerate\n   </em>\n   itself for willful acts or gross negligence, sophisticated business entities may\n   <em>\n    limit their liability\n   </em>\n   for such acts arising out of performance of the contract.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Jacobson Warehouse v.

USN contends that the term \"Price\" is not defined in that way and that the dollar figure in the contract was merely the initial estimated price. USN also claims the parties intended for the cap on damages to be based on the actual final price paid to Weatherly.

Ct. App. 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The contract between Weatherly and USN is not ambiguous. Section 1.1.1 of the contract is entitled \"Price.\" It states that \"Weatherly proposes to offer Detailed Engineering for an estimated price of\n   $14,692,000 (the \"Price\") (Fourteen Million Six Hundred Ninety-Two Thousand US Dollars).\" Dkt. 29-1 at 9. It then provides details about costs that are and are not included in the Price.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12123437\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/293/60/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The contract assigns a value to the term \"Price.\" First, the contract states the numerical value ($14,692,000), and then, it writes out the numerical figure. There is no other plausible interpretation of the contract. In the limitation of liability provision, the parties then agreed to limit Weatherly's exposure to fifteen percent of the \"Price.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The contract language supports USN's contention that the term \"Price\" was based on an estimated price at the beginning of the contract. But nothing suggests they intended to expand Weatherly's liability exposure to fifteen percent of the final price as USN asks this Court to rule. The plain language of the contract shows that the parties agreed to limit Weatherly's exposure to fifteen percent of that \"Price,\" even if it was an estimate of the amount Weatherly would ultimately be paid under the contract. Had the parties intended otherwise, they would not have used the defined term \"Price\" in the limitation of liability provision. Instead, the parties would have drafted that provision to state that Weatherly would be liable for 15% of the final price or the amount it ultimately received under the contract. They did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   These sophisticated parties executed an unambiguous contract that limits Weatherly's liability to fifteen percent of the defined term \"Price.\" When the language of a contract is plain and unambiguous, no additional construction by the Court is required and \"the terms of the contract must be given an interpretation of ordinary significance.\"\n   <em>\n    Fernandes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2237897\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/261/429/\">\n    582 S.E.2d at 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Weatherly's aggregate liability to USN is, therefore, capped at $2,203,800.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Limitation of Liability Applies to Repair and Redesign Costs.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The limitation provision at issue limits Weatherly's liability to USN \"except with respect of Weatherly's cost of performing the Work under the Contract.\" USN argues that this exception allows it to recover everything it paid to other companies to correct or repair Weatherly's defective designs. Dkt. 33-1 at \u00b6 18. Thus, USN argues, Weatherly is still liable beyond the limitation for the millions of dollars it spent making the plant operable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 33-2 at 13-17. Weatherly disagrees and argues that the exception relates to Weatherly's\n   <em>\n    internal\n   </em>\n   costs associated with any re-engineering in the form of salaries or hourly wages paid to Weatherly's own engineers. Dkt. 38-1 at 9. According to Weatherly, it does not include costs USN decided to pay others for the work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   If this was ambiguous, the parties' inconsistent interpretations might preclude summary judgment. But again, the language is clear, and the construction of an unambiguous contract is a question of law for the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CareAmerica\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"419125\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/229/878/\">\n    494 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   722 ;\n   <em>\n    Avion Systems, Inc. v.

USN cannot rely on language that excepts \"Weatherly's cost\" to except its own costs incurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   USN claims that the contract should be construed against Weatherly, the alleged \"drafter.\" But both parties drafted the contracted. To be sure, Weatherly provided the initial draft, but the parties then engaged in negotiations and revisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkts. 29-11, 29-12;\n   <em>\n    Stonegate Bank v.

The Contract Bars Consequential Damages.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In its final argument, Weatherly contends that USN has waived its right to recover consequential damages. Section 5.1.20 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Weatherly shall not be liable to [USN] for consequential or contingent damages, or loss of production, business, or profits for any reason. [USN] shall not be liable to Weatherly for consequential or contingent damages, or loss of production, business, or profits for any reason.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Dkt. 29-3 at 51.
