Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This is a products liability suit. Plaintiff Melody Bryant had a HeartMate II heart pump implanted at the University of Alabama Birmingham (\"UAB\") in 2015. The device, the HeartMate II Left Ventricular Assist System (\"LVAS\"), consists of a left ventricular assist device (\"LVAD\"), which is the actual heart pump, along with other parts, including a system controller, drive or percutaneous lead, and batteries or\n   power source. The controller checks the pump and sends alarms and messages to the patient and medical personnel at UAB. The driveline connects the pump and the controller, and is located both internally and externally. The driveline is made up of several wires or cable, and it is intended to have a material to insulate the cables from contact with the metal sheath.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After implantation, Melody received training about the use of the LVAS and received a Patient Handbook developed by Defendant Thoratec. The Handbook and training did not provide warnings that the insulation on the driveline could wear out over time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 24, 2016, Ms. Bryant presented at UAB with a controller connection issue. Plaintiff alleges that she was off the pump for two minutes while trying to change to her back-up controller when she had an acute and subacute stroke. The personnel at UAB switched out her controller. On October 15, 2016, the LVAS experienced \"several slow-speed events and pump stoppages,\" and \"a short-to-shield phenomenon.\" First Am. Compl. \u00b6 16, ECF No. 9 (hereinafter \"FAC\"). Plaintiffs allege that \"insulation of one or more of the driveline wires was either missing, had worn off, or was otherwise damaged, thereby allowing a wire or wires to contact the metallic shield enveloping them,\" resulting in an ischemic stroke.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs also submit that the controller did not notify Ms. Bryant of any issues with the driveline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs filed suit on October 13, 2017, alleging products liability, negligence per se and a loss of consortium claim for Ms. Bryant's husband. On November 3 and November 10, 2017 Defendants' counsel Jenny Covington and Plaintiffs' counsel, Robin E. Blackledge Blair spoke on the phone. Covington Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, ECF No. 40. Ms. Covington informed Ms. Blair that her clients' claims were likely preempted because the HeartMate II LVAS had received pre-market approval from the FDA. Blair Aff \u00b6 1, ECF No. 42-1. Because Ms. Blair was unaware of the federal law, the two agreed that Plaintiffs could file an amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They also agreed to extend the deadline for Defendants to file responsive pleadings and \"otherwise defend the operative Complaint filed against them.\" Agreed Stip. Extens. Time 1, ECF No. 8. Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint on December 29, 2017 and Defendants filed their Motion to Dismiss [10] on January 23, 2018, raising preemption. Plaintiffs then requested a month extension to their filing deadline, citing the complexity of the case and scheduling issues. Mot. Extension Time to File Resp., ECF No. 16. Defendants agreed to a two-week extension. Covington Aff. \u00b6 4, ECF No. 40. The Court granted a two-week extension. Order, ECF No. 22. Each party filed a motion for judicial notice in connection with the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A week after briefing on the Motion to Dismiss was completed, Plaintiffs filed their Motion for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint [35] in attempt to address Defendants' preemption arguments. Defendants have opposed this request arguing that Plaintiffs have been dilatory and acting in bad faith, that granting leave to amend would be unduly prejudicial to Defendants, and that such amendments would be futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Defendants' Exhibits A through E and Exhibit J include actions taken by the FDA, including that the HeartMate II LVAS is a Class III medical device that received pre-market approval, and other information disseminated by the FDA. Plaintiffs' Exhibits D through F, and Exhibits H through K show various recalls and safety alerts sent out by the FDA. Defendants have not contested that these are proper for judicial notice. Therefore, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    grant\n   </strong>\n   both of the parties' motions to the extent that they request these documents be judicially noticed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendants contest the remaining documents that Plaintiffs have submitted. The Court finds that such documents are not proper to be judicially noticed or are not relevant to the Court's analysis. Two of Plaintiffs' proposed documents are scholarly articles regarding key issues in dispute in this action: the potential outcomes after a repair of HeartMate II leads (Ex. B), the potential for malfunction when transitioning the device's power source (Ex. L), and the potential for malfunction in the HeartMate II (Ex. M). Plaintiffs simply cite\n   <em>\n    Scales v.

July 27, 1993) where the court took judicial notice of some scholarly publications, but Plaintiff has not shown that factual substance in these articles can be \"accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\" Therefore, Plaintiffs' motion is\n   <strong>\n    denied\n   </strong>\n   as to these motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Next, Defendants take issue with Plaintiffs' request that the Court take the facts listed in the FDA's MAUDE database to establish that Defendants did not report Ms. Bryant's stroke to the FDA. The Court finds that it is not proper to judicially notice such, as these facts cannot be \"accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned\" as the FDA cautions that the \"incidence or prevalence of an event cannot be determined from this reporting system alone.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, Plaintiffs' motion is denied to this extent. The Court will however, take Plaintiff's allegations as true when ruling on the motion to dismiss,\n   <em>\n    infra.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Several of the documents presented by both parties had no bearing on the Court's analysis in ruling on these motions. Plaintiffs submit several documents from\n   <em>\n    Bush v. Thoratec Corporation\n   </em>\n   and asks that the Court take judicial notice of the facts stated in these documents, not the documents' existence. The Court finds that the facts of this case are not relevant to the dispute at hand, as the underlying alleged facts took place seven (7) years ago. Furthermore, the documents regarding the relationship between Abbott and Thoratec are not relevant to the Court's analysis, so the Court will deny both parties' motions to the extent that it asks that those documents be judicially noticed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Motion to Amend: Bad Faith, Delay, and/or Unfair Prejudice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Defendants cite the above procedural history and assert that Plaintiffs' actions are dilatory, as they had notice that Defendants were asserting preemption as a defense to their claims as of early November 2017. Both parties have submitted affidavits regarding the conversation between Ms. Covington and Ms. Blair.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants assert that Plaintiffs are acting in bad faith in attempting to \"move the goal posts\" by filing their motion to amend after briefing was completed on the motion to dismiss and that the First Amendment Complaint \"was merely a placeholder to buy time for a Second Amended Complaint and to draw out all legal theories challenging their claims.\" Thoratec's Resp. Opp Pls.' Mot. Leave File Second Am. Compl. 4, ECF No 39. They further suggest that to permit Plaintiffs another chance to amend their complaint would unduly prejudice them, since they have already briefed a motion to dismiss. In response, Plaintiffs suggest that Defendants acted in bad faith by suggesting that Plaintiffs file an amended complaint and that Ms. Covington misled Ms. Blair into thinking Defendants would answer an amended complaint, not file a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   A review of the affidavits does not show bad faith on the part of either party. The fact that Plaintiffs requested a month-long extension to respond to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and that they waited until briefing was complete to file their motion to amend does not suggest to the Court that they have intentionally tried to delay this case, especially given the complexity of the law surrounding FDA preemption of Class III medical devices. Furthermore,\n   the Court finds that there was no bad faith on the part of Defendants in earlier giving Plaintiffs the opportunity to amend their complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Nor is there any prejudice to Defendants in permitting the amendments, as this case is in the very early stages. No case management order has been entered. As Defendants have argued that such amendments are futile, the Court will consider Plaintiffs' proposed amendments in their Second Amended Complaint in conjunction with their allegations in the First Amended Complaint to determine whether Plaintiffs have stated a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

To the extent that Plaintiffs attempt to assert a claim that Defendants should be liable for a design defect despite the FDA's approval of the HeartMate II's design, their claims are preempted and should be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Claims Relating to Recalls\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   A claim related to a recall is preempted to the extent it attempts to add additional or different requirements from what the FDA required in a recall. A claim related to a recall is not preempted, however, if it alleges that the manufacturer failed to comply with the FDA's requirements and regulations related to that recall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In a few different sections, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants should have issued additional recalls for the HeartMate II's driveline, that healthcare professionals should have been instructed not to use the driveline after the recall, and that Defendants should have sooner issued a recall on the controller for its failure to signal a hazard when the driveline is damaged. FAC \u00b6 33(k), (n); SAC \u00b6 57 (h), (o). Plaintiffs submit that manufacturers may self-police and initiate their own recalls; thus,\n   the claim is parallel. Plaintiffs state no facts that support their arguments that Defendants failed to comply the FDA's regulations, as they conceded that the FDA has overseen all of the recalls of the HeartMate II. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 33-41. Furthermore, the fact that the FDA permits voluntary recalls does not make Plaintiffs' claim parallel. The Court finds that this claim is expressly preempted as requiring Defendants to issue another or different type of recall would be an \"additional or different\" requirement from what the FDA required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Failure to Report and Failure to Warn\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Plaintiffs have also asserted claims that fall under the Mississippi Products Liability Act's failure to warn provisions. Their claims may be divided into two categories: a failure to report serious injuries or malfunctions of the device to the FDA and a more traditional failure to warn Ms. Bryant of the risks related to use of the HeartMate II. A state law claim for failure to warn is preempted if it \"challenge[s] the sufficiency of FDA-approved warnings and labels.\"\n   <em>\n    Carlson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%2011514911\">\n    2014 WL 11514911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. However, such claims are not preempted when they allege \"the manufacturer failed to comply with federal regulation regarding reporting and warning, or failed to label the device as required by the FDA when it granted pre-market approval.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%2011514911\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Failure to Report\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Plaintiffs' failure to warn claim primarily stems from her allegations that Defendants did not report Ms. Bryant's strokes to the FDA; therefore, Plaintiffs argue, Defendants have violated FDA regulations and they have stated a parallel claim. Plaintiffs compare their case to\n   <em>\n    Hughes v. Boston Scientific Corp.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   alleged that the manufacturer \"developed an 'algorithm' regarding reportable events caused by the [the medical device] according to which Boston Scientific[, the manufacturer,] reported some, but not all burns.\" 631 F.3d at 766. The Fifth Circuit held that a manufacturer's \"failure to report 'serious injuries' and 'malfunctions' of the device as required by the applicable FDA regulation\" could state a parallel claim for failure to warn.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 769. The Court noted that Hughes's causation theory was that if the manufacturer had reported the true number of device malfunctions and injuries caused by the medical device, such \"would have appeared on the FDA's MAUDE internet database\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and in medical journals, and with this information [Hughes's doctor] would not have recommended the [medical device] to Hughes for treatment, nor would Hughes have chosen the [medical device] as a treatment option.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 776.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Turning to Plaintiffs' FAC, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants' actions constitute a failure to comply with the Medical Device Reporting requirements of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360i(a)(1) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20803.50\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 803.50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and a failure to report serious injuries and malfunctions of the device as defined in the Medical Device Reporting regulations. FAC \u00b6 33(e), (h). Plaintiffs' proposed amendment adds: \"On information and belief, Defendants did not report either of Ms. Bryant's events. If they were not reported, there are [sic] no doubt that others were not reported, thereby preventing the\n   FDA from effectively monitoring the efficacy of the device.\" SAC \u00b6 57(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Plaintiffs' allegations do not state a claim and their proposed amendment would be futile. This case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   in several regards. First, the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   alleged that the manufacturer had, in a widespread manner, failed to report numerous serious incidents, as a part of a flawed algorithm the manufacturer used to decide which events were \"reportable.\"\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085490\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/631/762/\">\n    631 F.3d at 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Plaintiffs here have only alleged that Defendants did not report her own incident. As Defendants have pointed out, such cannot give rise to a failure to warn claim, as there is no causation between the alleged violation of FDA regulations and Plaintiffs' purported injury. Furthermore, Plaintiffs' only allegation as to a more widespread failure to report, that since Defendants purportedly did not report her injury so other events were likely not reported, is speculative. The Court need not take unwarranted inferences or speculation as true when ruling on a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3793972\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/624/201/#p210\">\n    624 F.3d at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Failure to Warn\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Plaintiffs' other allegations arise out of Defendants' alleged failure to inform her of the risks of wear and tear on the driveline in her HeartMate II. Plaintiffs' FAC alleges that Defendants failed \"to adequately label and/or warn of the inherent risk of the device as contemplated by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360f.\" FAC \u00b6 33(p). Plaintiffs' proposed amendment adds: \"Defendants did not change the labeling,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   nor adequately warn the Plaintiffs of the inherent risks concerning the driveline, which is subject to become damaged due to wear and fatigue overtime.\" SAC \u00b6 57(k). Plaintiffs also allege that the device was \"misbranded\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20352\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as she did not receive warnings regarding driveline's potential to wear out over time and that the Patient Handbook only suggests that driveline damage could occur when the wires are twisted or bent. FAC \u00b6 33(s); SAC \u00b6 57(m). They also submit that Defendants were negligent in their communication in the 2008 recall under 21 C.F.R. \u00b6\u00b6 7.46, 7.49, and/or 7.53, and that Ms. Bryant \"received a HeartMate II that was not accompanied by the appropriate warnings and/or that had not been properly corrected or destroyed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   FAC \u00b6 33(l); SAC \u00b6 57(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   As Defendants point out, the fact that Ms. Bryant herself did not receive warnings regarding the driveline is not sufficient to state a parallel claim for failure to warn.

First, in\n   <em>\n    Funk v. Stryker Corp.\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision to dismiss a complaint based on inadequate pleading. For his manufacturing defect claim, the plaintiff alleged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   [3.] The hip prostheses contained a manufacturing defect in that it was manufactured in such a manner that impurities, residues and bacteria remained on the prosthesis in violation of the FDA standards and requirements and in violation of the manufacturing processes and design approved by the FDA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   [4.] The hip prosthesis deviated, in its construction or quality, from the specifications or planned output.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   631 F.3d at 782.
