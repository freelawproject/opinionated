GONDAL'S APPLICATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Plaintiff was born in Pakistan on January 1, 1988. At some point prior to September 2012, Gondal entered the United States. In September 2012, Gondal applied for deferred action under DACA. Three months later, USCIS approved the Plaintiff's request and granted him deferred action for two years. In 2014, Gondal's deferred action renewal was granted for a three-year period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In July 2015, Gondal applied for advance parole, an immigration document issued by USCIS which enables an alien to be paroled into the United States. USCIS granted the application and provided the Plaintiff with an advance parole document, which allowed him to take a trip to Pakistan in September 2015. Upon his return, Gondal was paroled into the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On or about January 16, 2016, Gondal and a friend, Arshad Mohammad, departed the United States at the Niagara Falls Rainbow Bridge. He carried with him a false identification document with a birthdate of December 20, 1982. The Plaintiff was denied admission to Canada at the Canadian port of entry for presenting false documents. Gondal and his friend then returned to the United States port of entry and requested admission back into the United States. A search of his fingerprint records revealed that the birthdate listed on his fake identification document did not match the birthdate listed in his deferred action materials. During discussions with USCIS, Gondal indicated that he obtained the false document in order to seek a Canadian immigrant visa. The Plaintiff was not issued advance parole prior to that day. Despite this, Gondal was paroled into the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(5)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In September 2017, Gondal filed a DACA renewal request.

As the memo describes, the decision to grant or deny deferral is entirely a matter of agency discretion. Although, as Gondal points out, the decision to deny a DACA request does impact other potential liberty or property interests, any benefit he or other DACA recipients receive arise from the decision to grant deferred action. If the Plaintiff is not entitled to the receipt of renewed deferred action, he is not entitled to any additional interests that are contingent on such a decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Batalla Vidal II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523475\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/291/260/#p283\">\n    291 F.Supp.3d at 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Accordingly, the Plaintiff does not possess a liberty or property interest in a particular decision under DACA nor an employment authorization card.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Even if liberty or property interests were at stake, Gondal failed to allege that the procedure USCIS followed was constitutionally insufficient. As the Defendants argue in their papers, the complaint fails to allege any facts that plausibly suggest that USCIS failed to afford him a constitutionally sufficient process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bryant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3515461\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/692/202/#p218\">\n    692 F.3d at 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   To the extent that Gondal seeks deferred action, this Court is unable to grant such relief. It would be inappropriate given the nature of his only cause of action. A procedural due process claim does not guarantee a particular result; it protects against procedural unfairness.\n   <em>\n    McDonald v. Bd. of Educ. of City of New York\n   </em>\n   , No. 01 Civ 1991,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20WL%20840254\">\n    2001 WL 840254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (S.D.N.Y.

Therefore, even if the Plaintiff has alleged the rest of a procedural due process claim, he fails to request proper relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Further, the only potential procedural deficiency the Plaintiff cites with respect to his deferred action is the failure of USCIS to provide him with sufficient explanation. However, he fails to identify any procedure that USCIS failed to follow that violated the Fifth Amendment. The Plaintiff's pleading fails to plausibly suggest that the due process clause was violated by USCIS's current procedure. Further, the\n   record reflects the opposite. The Plaintiff received a letter informing him of the reasons for the denial and allowed him to respond. Gondal sent USCIS additional documentation regarding the incident at the Canadian border, including sworn statements by those involved. He has not articulated any basis for this Court to find that a DACA recipient is entitled to more than notice of failure to renew a deferral and an opportunity to meaningfully respond to that notice prior to the revocation of deferred action status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Accordingly, the Plaintiff's Fifth Amendment procedural due process claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    E. AS TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT CLAIM\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Finally, the Plaintiff attempts to amend his complaint by adding a claim under the Administrative Procedures Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"APA\") through his motion papers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   While the Plaintiff references the APA in his jurisdictional statement, the complaint is devoid of any other mention of an APA cause of action. Without even conclusory statements reciting the bare elements of a potential claim, even in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, the Court is unable to conclude that Gondal asserts an APA claim in his complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In his opposition memorandum, the Plaintiff devotes a portion of his brief to an argument concerning purported APA claims. The Court notes that this is procedurally improper and refuses to construe such a claim as an attempt to amend his complaint. At no point in his motion papers did Gondal request permission from the Court to amend his Complaint to add an APA cause of action. Yet, even if he did make such a request, \"a party is not entitled to amend its complaint through statements made in motion papers[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Soules v.
