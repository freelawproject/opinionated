Docket no. 1. In a prior order, this Court granted Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and gave Plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint. Docket no. 14. Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint on January 4, 2018. Docket no. 19. Plaintiffs are the designated Primary Next of Kin (\"PNOK\") of Army service members who died in the Philippines serving their country in World War II.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs bring claims for substantive and procedural due process violations, a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   violation, a violation of the Administrative Procedures Act (\"APA\"), and violations of the Free Exercise Clause and Religious Freedom Restoration Act (\"RFRA\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Plaintiffs further seek mandamus relief for recovery of the remains at issue, mandamus relief for identification of the remains and further efforts, a declaratory judgment finding Plaintiffs have a right to possess the remains, a declaratory judgment to return the remains to Plaintiffs, and a declaratory judgment finding that Defendants have violated Plaintiffs' First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendment rights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs' claims relate to their deceased family members whose remains went unidentified after World War II and who were buried as Unknowns in the Manila American Cemetery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-13. Plaintiffs seek the return of their family members' remains so that the families can secure what they believe is a proper burial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Plaintiffs allege that, due to successful prior litigation to obtain government records pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, \"information has been brought to light that allows Plaintiffs to identify where these seven service members are currently buried.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eakin v.

Patterson of Rhode Island alleges are the remains of his uncle First Lieutenant Alexander R. \"Sandy\" Nininger; (2) X-3629, which Plaintiff John Boyt of California alleges are the remains of his grandfather, Colonel Loren P. Stewart; (3) X-618, which Plaintiff Janis Fort of California alleges are the remains of her uncle, Brigadier General Guy O. Fort; (4) remains from Cabanatuan Grave 822, which Plaintiff Ruby Alsbury of Texas alleges are the remains of her brother, Private Robert R. Morgan; (5) remains from Cabanatuan Grave 704, which Plaintiff Raymond Bruntmyer of Texas alleges are the remains of his brother, Private First Class Lloyd Bruntmyer; (6) remains from Cabanatuan Grave 407, which Plaintiff Judy Hensley of New Mexico alleges are the remains of her uncle Private First Class David Hansen; and (7) remains from Cabanatuan Grave 717, which Plaintiff Douglass Kelder of Wisconsin alleges are the remains of his uncle Private Arthur H. \"Bud\" Kelder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-13. Plaintiffs identify where the remains are currently buried or rest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants, in their answer, disagree that the remains have been positively located or identified according to DPAA standards. Docket no. 25 at 7-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants aver that the DPAA is currently processing requests to disinter grave X-3629 (alleged by Plaintiffs to contain\n   the remains of Colonel Stewart) and grave Leyte # 1 X-618 (alleged by Plaintiffs to contain the remains of Brigadier General Fort).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, 11. Additionally, Plaintiffs allege that the DPAA has recommended the disinterment of Cabanatuan Grave 822 (alleged by Plaintiffs to contain the remains of Private Morgan) and Cabanatuan Grave 704 (alleged by Plaintiffs to contain the remains of Private First Class Bruntmyer), but that the recommendations have not been finalized and are currently under review by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower and Reserve Affairs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12; Docket no. 31 at 18. The DPAA affirmatively denied a request to disinter grave X-1130, alleged by Plaintiffs to contain the remains of First Lieutenant Nininger. Docket 25-3 at 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Compel Production of Remains or, in the Alternative, for Physical Examination on April 13, 2018. Docket no. 28. They seek to disinter certain graves in the Manila American Cemetery for DNA testing as part of the discovery process for this action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3. Defendants refused Plaintiffs' initial request for production and now oppose the Motion to Compel on the grounds that Plaintiffs' Motion fails to overcome a presumption against disinterment, exceeds Rule 26(b)(1)'s limitations on discovery, and fails to meet Rule 35's requirements of real controversy and good cause. Docket no. 34. Defendants filed a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings on April 20, 2018, arguing that each of Plaintiffs' claims fail as a matter of law.

Defendants argue \"Plaintiffs must bring a valid claim for an independent cause of action that provides the Court with subject matter jurisdiction.\" Docket no. 31 at 57. Defendants argue that because the independent actions which could potentially confer jurisdiction here-claims pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   , the Mandamus Act, and the APA-must all be dismissed, the Court has no jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   As discussed above, the Court has found that Plaintiffs fail to state a valid\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims and any valid claims for mandamus relief.

Defendants argue that Plaintiffs fail to meet additional requirements of Rule 35, namely that Plaintiffs must establish that a person's mental or physical condition is in controversy and that there is good cause for the examination, which\n   requires \"far more than mere relevance.\" Docket no. 34 at 22-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendants' Arguments that Plaintiffs' Motion Exceeds Discovery Constraints\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Defendants do not appear to dispute that Rule 34 specifically or discovery tools generally have sufficient breadth to accommodate the request at issue, but they object on other grounds, namely that a presumption against the disinterment of remains applies (and is not overcome by Plaintiffs) and that the request exceeds the external constraints imposed on discovery by Rule 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Presumption Against Disinterment of Remains\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Defendants argue that \"there is a well-established presumption against removing the remains of a deceased person\" that \"is found throughout disinterment jurisprudence.\" Docket no. 34 at 8 (citing\n   <em>\n    Maffei v.

To overcome this presumption, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs must show that justice requires production of the remains. Docket no. 34 at 9 (citing\n   <em>\n    Brewer v. Am.

Further, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs must show that examination will establish the facts sought. Docket no. 34 at 9 (citing\n   <em>\n    Stephens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4004605\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/685/847/#p847\">\n    685 F.Supp. at 847-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Disinterment for the purpose of examination or autopsy will be ordered upon a showing of good cause and urgent necessity and upon a strong showing that the examination or autopsy will establish the facts sought.\"); 25A C.J.S.

Docket no. 34 at 8. First, Defendants argue Plaintiffs have not shown justice requires disinterment and testing because the information that DNA testing would reveal is not relevant to Plaintiffs' claims, which turn on currently available information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. Nor can Plaintiffs show urgency, Defendants argue, because there is no showing that meaningful deterioration would occur while this case is pending.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Second, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not shown that examination will establish the facts sought because Plaintiffs have not established that the Plaintiffs' relatives will be among the requested remains, that the remains will likely provide adequate DNA samples, that Plaintiffs' consultant has the necessary capacity and experience, and that the results will establish the relevant service members' identities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that a presumption against disinterment arises only when remains are suitably buried, but that such a presumption does not apply here, where the graves in question are unmarked and temporary and where the government intends to disinter each grave eventually. Docket no. 35 at 3. If it does apply, Plaintiffs argue, then the Fifth Circuit requires only that the discovery is in the interest of justice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs contend they meet this standard because DNA testing is the most effective tool available for providing additional evidence of the remains' identities, which is the primary factual dispute in this case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Further, even if additional requirements apply, Plaintiffs argue they have shown that the discovery is necessary (because it is the only way to obtain the information sought,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5), urgent (because each day risks more deterioration,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6), and will establish the facts sought (because it will establish the remains' genetic profile, which will assist in their identification,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Rule 26 Constraints\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Here, the Court need not decide whether any or all of Rule 34, Rule 35, and common-law discovery principles allow the disinterment and testing requested here. Nor is it necessary for this Court to decide whether a presumption against disinterment is recognized in the Fifth Circuit or, if such a presumption does apply, what requirements need be alleged to overcome it. It is sufficient that, as discussed below, Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel exceeds the constraints on discovery imposed by Rule 26(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Rule 26(b)(1) sets out the scope of permissible discovery, stating that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   [p]arties may obtain discovery regarding discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party's claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties' relative access to relevant information, the parties' resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   FED. R. CIV. P. 26(b)(1). If the Court determines that proposed discovery is outside this scope, the Court \"must limit the frequency or extent of discovery otherwise allowed by these rules[.]\" FED. R. CIV. P. 26(b)(2)(C)(iii). \"Trial courts are afforded substantial discretion in determining whether to grant or deny a motion to compel discovery.\"\n   <em>\n    Escamilla v. United States\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-246,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2012732889\">\n    2015 WL 12732889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (W.D. Tex. Apr. 13, 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Here, Defendants argue that disinterment exceeds the scope of discovery set out in Rule 26(b)(1) because (1) it would reveal nothing relevant to Plaintiffs' claims and (2) it is not proportional to the needs of the case. First, Defendants argue that the request is irrelevant because Plaintiffs' challenge to agency action or inaction should be limited to the administrative record. Docket no. 34 at 14. To the extent the claims are not so limited, Defendants argue, the relevant dispute is not the remains' ultimate identity, but whether the facts before the Court are sufficient to require the agency to take specific action, rendering disinterment irrelevant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. Plaintiffs, in turn, argue that this is an attempt by Defendants to use the APA to limit discovery for all of Plaintiffs' claims, including those not rooted in the APA. Docket no. 35 at 9. Plaintiffs also argue that Defendants, as the party resisting discovery, bear the burden to show a given request is irrelevant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Nerium Skincare, Inc. v. Olson\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:16-CV-1217-B,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20277634\">\n    2017 WL 277634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (N.D. Tex. Jan. 20, 2017) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   As the Court found above in its order on Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, several of Plaintiffs' claims survive, including some not based in the APA. Thus, even if Plaintiffs' APA claims are determined to be limited to the administrative record, it is clear that not all of Plaintiffs' claims will be limited in this way. Here, the disinterment and testing of the remains at issue is relevant within the meaning of the Federal Rules to, at minimum, any of Plaintiffs' claims not entirely limited to the administrative record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Second, Defendants argue that disinterment is not proportional to the needs of the case because it seeks ultimate relief under the guise of discovery, improperly intrudes on government and third-party interests, and imposes burdens not outweighed\n   by the litigation benefits. As an initial matter, the Court notes that several of the proportionality factors set out in Rule 26(b)(1), to the extent they are relevant, support Plaintiffs' request: the constitutional issues at stake-related to the return of fallen service members to their families for proper burial-are highly important and the governmental Defendants have significant resources and sole access to the information sought.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   However, the final factor, \"whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit,\" proves decisive in this case. The likely benefit of this discovery is obvious, as disinterment and testing would likely clarify the identities of the remains in question. The Court suspects that if the remains are disinterred and identified as belonging to the Plaintiffs' relatives, Defendants at that point would not begrudge Plaintiffs the dignity of proper burials. But if the remains are identified as belonging to fallen service members other than the Plaintiffs' relatives, the Court also suspects that Plaintiffs would no longer pursue this action or would pursue it in a different manner. This likely benefit, however, must be weighed against the burden. And while the Court is sensitive to the interests of the families and notes the oddity of the Defendants' refusal of Plaintiffs' offered assistance in identifying the remains of fallen service members, Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel fails on the grounds of proportionality because of the significant burden its granting would incur on Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Many of the burdens imposed by Plaintiffs' request are obvious and relate to the costs of disinterment and production, even if Plaintiffs conduct the testing themselves once the remains are produced. This burden includes the significant financial expenses that would result from conducting the disinterments, shipping the remains (with an escort to ensure dignified transfer), securing and equipping a facility in San Antonio for proper treatment of the remains, and monitoring Plaintiffs' access and testing. Docket no. 34 at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In addition to these burdens on funds and resources, Defendants argue an order to disinter and test inappropriately intrudes on third-party interests and governmental duties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As to third-party interests, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel seeks resolution of Plaintiffs' interests at the expense of other families, docket no. 34 at 18, and that Plaintiffs are not in a position to protect the interests of other families whose relatives are among the remains at issue, docket no. 34 at 20-21. Plaintiffs request for production seeks family DNA and genealogies in Defendants' possession, which Defendants allege was provided to Defendants under the assurance that it would be protected. Docket no. 34 at 20. Another factor is that Plaintiffs do not commit to a specific mode of DNA testing, and thus intend to select which bones to sample and which tests to perform. Defendants argue this would grant Plaintiffs authority to \"destroy a portion of the remains of service members to whom Plaintiffs are not related.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20277634\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This intrudes on third-party interests, Defendants argue, as well as on Defendants' interests, as this would limit DPAA's options in its own testing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20277634\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Relatedly, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' request intrudes on the duties of DOD and DPAA. As detailed by Defendants, these duties include ensuring the respectful handling of the remains of service\n   members, implementing and enforcing policies that ensure only those remains likely to be identified are exhumed, and accounting for unidentified service members (using DNA testing as well as work from historians, anthropologists, and others). Docket no. 34 at 20-21. For their part, Plaintiffs argue that the government does not have a monopoly on identifying fallen service members using DNA testing. Docket no. 44 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Relevant to this part of Defendants' burden-disruption of Defendants' duties-is whether Defendants have expressed an intention to disinter all remains eventually, regardless of this suit's disposition. The parties disagree on this point. Plaintiffs argue that because DPAA has recommended disinterment of the remains from Cabanatuan Common Graves 822 and 704, the parties do not dispute that these remains-alleged to belong to relatives of three Plaintiffs-should be disinterred. Docket no. 28 at 7. Defendants dispute this characterization, arguing that their answer states only that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   DPAA has an ongoing project to identify unknown remains from Camp Cabanatuan interred in the Manila American Cemetery, and has been proposing the disinterment of Cabanatuan remains one common grave at a time ..., provided that the standards set forth in Directive-type Memorandum-16-003 (DTM-16-003) are met; it is DPAA's intention to disinter all Cabanatuan remains in turn.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Docket no. 47 at 3 (citing [Docket no. 26] ). Defendants argue that Plaintiffs seek disinterment of remains unrelated to Camp Cabanatuan, and that therefore Plaintiffs' contention that the government has admitted most of the relevant facts is incorrect.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. Instead, Defendants concede that records associate four of the Plaintiffs' relatives with specific common graves, but they dispute Plaintiffs' claim that this association is enough to consider these remains identified or to demand disinterment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   With respect to the other remains at issue, Plaintiffs point out that Defendants have already disinterred Kelder's remains, have recommended disinterment of Bruntmyer's and Morgan's, and would recommend disinterment of Hansen's if there were additional eligible family reference samples. Docket no. 35 at 12. In deciding this discovery dispute, however, it makes little difference whether Defendants intend to disinter these remains eventually-this Court must credit Defendants' contention that Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel would alter their planned execution of statutorily delegated duties and thus adds to the burden that must be considered under Rule 26(b). The Court notes that whether Defendants' ultimately intend the eventual return of all fallen service members buried in the graves at issue or similar graves, and whether Plaintiffs' resources will hasten that return and provide relief to these service members' families, could well prove relevant as this case progresses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Court notes that Plaintiffs offer, in their advisory, to bear many of the necessary costs and burdens themselves. Docket no. 40. Plaintiffs stress that this offer is intended to show what they\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   do if no cooperation is offered by Defendants, not what they\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   do; ideally, in Plaintiffs' view, Defendants would extend their cooperation, but Defendants have not done so. Of course, should the Court allow Plaintiffs to undertake this operation themselves, alleviating much of the\n   <em>\n    financial\n   </em>\n   burden disinterment places on Defendants, the intrusion on Defendants' statutorily delegated responsibilities would become more acute (as would the risk of intrusion on third-party interests). Defendants make this argument in response to Plaintiffs' advisory, stating that this offer shows Plaintiffs improperly seek to entirely displace\n   governmental functions and that Plaintiffs' request is thus akin to, among other examples, a request for the court to order the Secretary of Defense to outsource a military operation to a private company. Docket no. 43 at 2. Thus, whether Plaintiffs or Defendants bear the brunt of the expense and responsibility in disinterring and testing, Defendants are burdened regardless, either with respect to their delegated duties or their resources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Another of Defendants' arguments as to proportionality is that disinterment and testing inappropriately constitute ultimate relief under the guise of discovery. This is because Plaintiffs' claims, Defendants argue, \"boil down to whether any legal authority permits Plaintiffs to force Defendants to disinter unidentified remains on Plaintiffs' timetable and to prioritize identification of those specific remains over Defendants' other accounting efforts.\" Docket no. 34 at 17. Plaintiffs frame the ultimate relief sought as proper burials of their relatives, not the creation of a timetable that prioritizes their cases over others. Plaintiffs argue disinterment and DNA testing is only a prerequisite for the relief sought, docket no. 35 at 11, while Defendants argue it is the core relief sought, docket no. 34 at 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Discovery motions may not seek \"all the disclosure to which [plaintiffs] would be entitled in the event they prevail on the merits,\"\n   <em>\n    Cheney v.

Ohio June 12, 2017). Here, although the point is well taken that the purpose of Plaintiffs' suit is to secure proper burials, the ultimate relief sought from the Defendants is production of the remains. The Court notes, as do the Plaintiffs, docket no. 44 at 6, that after testing the remains could be returned to the Defendants' custody during the pendency of the suit. On this point, Plaintiffs contend that discovery would erase all doubts as to the identity of the remains at issue-if the remains are identified as Plaintiffs' relatives, Defendants would concede and allow a proper burial, and if they are not so identified Defendants could maintain custody and the case could move to trial. Docket no. 44 at 6. Nevertheless, Plaintiffs' request likely does seek ultimate relief (or at least relief beyond the normal bounds of discovery), and this fact weighs against granting Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel. If at this stage Defendants are unwilling to accept Plaintiffs' offer of assistance, this Court is not able to use discovery tools to override Defendants' decision-making authority with respect to which graves to disinter and on what timeline. That relief will come, if at all, later in these proceedings, through a dispositive motion or at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Accordingly, the Court GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and DENIES Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Each individually named defendant is being sued only in his or her official capacity.
