(Administrative Record (\"AR\"), Dkt. No. 21, at 34, 73.) This case arises out of\n   Plaintiff's separate attempts to acquire a green card on the basis of employment-based applications by her mother, Jeannette Schwebel, to secure lawful permanent resident status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Application-1\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On January 12, 2007, Plaintiff became the derivative beneficiary of an employment-based Form I-140 visa petition filed on her mother's behalf by her mother's employer, Quick Buy, Inc. (\"Quick Buy\"), with a priority date of September 14, 2006. AR at 203, 222. Plaintiff was sixteen years old at that time. (AR at 18, 34 \u00b6 1, 74.) On June 12, 2007, while Application-1 was still pending before the USCIS, the U.S. Department of State released Visa Bulletin No. 107, announcing that applications for employment visas would be made available to individuals in the vast majority of employment-based categories - including the category applicable to Plaintiff's mother - starting July 1, 2007 through August 17, 2007 (\"July 2007 Bulletin\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Department of State,\n   <em>\n    Visa Bulletin for July 2007\n   </em>\n   (June 12, 2007),\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-bulletin/2007/visa-bulletin-for-july-2007.html.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Following this announcement, the Schwebel family's attorney, Michael H. Markovitch, Esq., advised that Plaintiff, and Plaintiff's family, should file for an adjustment of status to legal permanent residents as derivative beneficiaries of Jeannette Schwebel based upon the Form I-140 submitted by Quick Buy. (AR at 34 \u00b6 5, 40.) Based on his experience and purported understanding of USCIS's practices, Markovitch believed that an application should be submitted prior to July 1, 2007, the commencement of the filing period, to account for the delay it would take for USCIS to process the application after it was delivered, as well as in anticipation of the \"many filings\" that were likely to be submitted pursuant to the July 2007 Bulletin. (AR at 40.) Accordingly, on June 25, 2007, Markovitch mailed to USCIS a completed Form I-485 on behalf of Plaintiff and Plaintiff's family (\"Application-1\"). This mailing was sent by Federal Express and was received by Defendants two days later. (AR at 187;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Response and Counter-Statement of Material Facts Pursuant to Local Civil Rule 56.1 (\"Defs.' Rule 56.1 Stmt\"), Dkt.

(Declaration of Justyn J. Gydesen in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, Dkt. No. 28, \u00b6\u00b6 9-11.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendants' failing, coupled with a May 2011 report published by the Office of the Inspector General for DHS, writing that USCIS management reported a \"monthly average of 257,000 missing [Alien Registration Files] in all facilities,\" U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Office of Inspector general, OIG-11-85, at 7-8 (May 2011), \"overwhelmingly\" establishes that Defendants simply lost Application-1. (Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Plaintiff's Mem. of Law for Summ. J.\"), Dkt No. 32 at 3.) Plaintiff was not aware at the time that Defendants failed to generate a receipt upon delivery of Application-1, leaving her unaware that there might be issues with her submission. (AR at 35, \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On August 9, 2007, Markovitch supplemented Application-1 by submitting a medical report on behalf of Plaintiff, documentation that was needed to perfect her visa application filing. (AR at 217-19.) This submission was also mailed by Federal Express, and - unlike with respect to the earlier mailing of Application-1 - was\n   marked as received by USCIS personnel on August 13, 2007. (AR at 217, 220.) USCIS further generated an \"Interfiling\" memorandum documenting Plaintiff's medical exam submission. (AR at 208.) These delivery confirmations gave Plaintiff the impression that all was well with the submission of Application-1. (AR at 34-35, \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   But this was not so. Plaintiff did not hear back from Defendants for nearly three years, despite making repeated inquiries. (AR at 59-61.) On February 19, 2010, following a pointed letter from Plaintiff's counsel, Defendants finally responded, stating that they had no record of Application-1's filing, and that Plaintiff would need to file a new application once immigrant visas were made available again at a later date. (AR at 61-62, 65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Application-2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On March 1, 2012, Jeannette Schwebel became the beneficiary of an employment-based Form I-140 visa petition filed on her behalf by Connexxions International USA, Inc. (\"Connexxions\"), which sought to employ her as a permanent resident alien worker. (AR at 151.) Jeannette Schwebel's prior employer, Quick Buy, went out of business in 2010. (AR at 173.) Connexxion's visa petition had a priority date of September 14, 2006, the priority date of Quick Buy's visa petition, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.5\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1), which provides that an alien worker who is the beneficiary of an approved employment-based visa petition may transfer the priority date of that petition to any future employment-based visa petition filed on behalf of the same alien by a different employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Based on the September 14, 2006 priority date, a visa number permitting Jeannette Schwebel to file a visa petition became available in September 2012. (Complaint (\"Compl.\"), Dkt. No. 1, \u00b6 24); Answer, Dkt. No. 20, \u00b6 24.) Markovitch advised Jeannette Schwebel to file a new visa application, but informed Plaintiff that she was ineligible to file as a derivative dependent of her mother because she was twenty-two years old at the time. (AR at 35, \u00b6 9.) Accordingly, on September 6, 2012, Plaintiff's mother filed a renewed Form I-485 seeking an adjustment of status on the basis of the visa petition filed by Connexxions. (AR at 112.) Jeannette Schwebel's petition was approved, and lawful permanent resident status was conferred, on January 4, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff's father accompanied his wife as a derivative spouse and was granted adjustment of status on the same date. (AR at 112, 114.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Shortly after securing lawful permanent resident status for Plaintiff's parents, Markovitch initiated a congressional inquiry with USCIS on Plaintiff's behalf. (AR at 70-71.) By letter dated April 23, 2013, a congressional liaison representing Plaintiff's home district shared Defendants' response. (AR at 71.) USCIS reiterated that it had no record of Application-1 and stated that \"[w]ithout definitive evidence of the filing of [the Schwebel's] I-485 applications during the only time a visa was available between July 1, 2007 and August 17, 2007, [USCIS] would have no means to consider [Plaintiff] under the [CSPA],\" because Plaintiff was over 21 years old and, thus, \"no longer qualified as a derivative child under the CSPA.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Plaintiff, Defendants' response was the first time she learned that Application-1 was submitted prior to July 1. (AR at 35, \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After consulting two other attorneys, present counsel instructed Plaintiff to file a new application for adjustment of status under the CSPA, advising that she was eligible to do so in light of the affirmative steps she undertook to file Application-1 and of the extraordinary circumstances\n   surrounding that filing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) Accordingly, on September 22, 2015, Plaintiff filed Form I-1485, along with a supporting memorandum of law, seeking derivative lawful permanent resident status through her mother's employment with Connexxions (\"Application-2\"). (AR at 7-14, 22-23.) On October 17, 2017, USCIS, noting that her situation was \"unfortunate,\" denied Application-2 on the basis that Plaintiff did not meet the CPSA's definition of a \"child\" and, thus, did not qualify as a derivative dependent of her mother. (AR at 1-3.) In so concluding, it reasoned that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201153\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)\"necessarily limits the immigrant visa petition reference in [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201153\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h) ] to the petition that is the basis for the parent's adjustment.\" (AR at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On November 3, 2017, this lawsuit followed.

Dec, at 821-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, Plaintiff satisfies all three requirements described in USCIS's 2015 policy memorandum, as each of these circumstances was beyond her control, directly related to the filing issues associated with Application-1, and resulted in reasonable delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiff's efforts suffice to establish the CSPA's \"sought to acquire\" condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    2. Plaintiff is Aged Seventeen Years, Two Months, and One Day Under the CSPA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As noted, the CSPA provides that, so long as one \"sought to acquire [lawful permanent resident status] within one year\" of an immigrant visa becoming available, an alien's immigration age is calculated by subtracting the number of days \"the applicable [visa] petition\" was pending from her age on the date in which an immigrant visa number became available.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201153\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h). Defendants aver that Plaintiff's immigration age is approximately 22 and a half years old because Application-2 - which Defendants insist is \"the applicable petition\" under the CSPA - was pending for nearly a week when a visa number became available to Plaintiff's mother in September 2012 - when Plaintiff was already twenty-two and a half years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   It is true that a visa number became available to Plaintiff's mother in September 2012. It is also true, however, that a visa number became available to Plaintiff's mother on July 1, 2007, the initial moment where Plaintiff sought to acquire lawful permanent resident status. Defendants even concede this fact. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' R. 56.1 Stmt, \u00b6 5(a) (admitting that immigrant visa became available to \"the vast majority of employment-based immigrants and their qualifying dependents,\n   <em>\n    which included Plaintiff\n   </em>\n   [,]\" on July 1, 2007) (emphasis added).) Thus, applying the CSPA in a straightforward fashion, and, even accepting Defendants' argument that Application-2 is \"the applicable petition,\" Plaintiff is a child for immigration purposes because she is aged seventeen years, two months, and one day after taking her age on July 1, 2007 (17 years, two months, and five days), and reducing it by the number of days Application-2 was pending (four days).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In an effort to avoid this outcome (and ignore altogether the critical events of 2007), Defendants argue that an alien's age calculation under the CSPA does not begin until \"the applicable petition\" is filed. Defendants' logic is as follows: Plaintiff's eligibility to apply for lawful permanent resident status is derivative of her mother's, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201153\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). Since her mother did not achieve lawful permanent resident status until approval of the 2012 Connexxion's visa petition, Plaintiff cannot\n   derive her residency status from a period that predates that moment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   This argument is flawed in a number of respects. Most fundamentally, it finds no support in the statute. Section 1153(h) plainly and unambiguously describes the manner in which one's immigration age is to be calculated; if Congress had intended for that calculation to begin no earlier than the date of the filing of the petition through which the parent ultimately adjusts her status, then it would have drafted the CSPA with language to that effect. In the absence of such language, this Court is not permitted to add an absent phrase to change the meaning of the statute's words.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lamie v.
