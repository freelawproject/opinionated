Instead, the complaint recites in detail a single incident of alleged unconstitutional conduct occurring on November 30, 2011, on West 53rd Street in Manhattan, when the plaintiffs were detained and kept inside a \"pen\" set up for the press for approximately two hours.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.

To the contrary, it alleges that the defendants' conduct \"violated\" the NYPD's official policy of allowing attendees at demonstrations to \"leave and return.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 3 (quoting Stipulation of Settlement and Order,\n   <em>\n    Stauber v. City of New York\n   </em>\n   , 03 Civ. 9162, filed March 31, 2008 (Docket # 14) (Sweet, J.)

Reply at 2. But this statement sweeps far too broadly. While, in the typical case, a court does not examine whether pleadings are sufficient when considering a summary judgment motion because of the possibility that an amendment to the pleadings would cure any defect, the situation is completely different where, as here, neither the original complaint - which suffers from the same defects as the Amended Complaint - nor any other events during the course of discovery gave notice that the claim sought to be added was being made.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Other than pointing to the fact that their complaints stated that Kelly and Esposito were being sued in their \"official\" capacities, plaintiffs provide no argument that defendants were on notice that plaintiffs were making a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that \"[t]he issue before the Court is the sufficiency of the proof.\" Pl. Reply. at 2. In fact, that is not the issue. Rather, the issue is whether Judge Griesa's conclusion that plaintiffs had never \"pled\" the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim should be reconsidered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204257525\">\n    2016 WL 4257525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. Even if we look to the \"proof\" plaintiffs point to, it plainly failed to give notice to defendants that plaintiffs were pursuing a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim. Plaintiffs point to the deposition of an Inspector Hart, a non-party police official, who briefly testified that the NYPD's actions on the day of the incident were proper.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 6-7. But given that the Amended Complaint explicitly alleged that the police officers' actions that day \"violated\" a governing policy that would have allowed plaintiffs to leave the pen,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 3, Inspector Hart's testimony could not possibly have given defendants notice that plaintiffs sought to hold the City liable for instituting a policy that led to the alleged constitutional violations. Moreover, defendants have stated without contradiction that plaintiffs took no discovery addressing\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. at 5.
