S. 589, 665 (1945). The Decree was amended pursuant to a stipulation and joint motion of the parties in 1953. <em>Nebraska </em>v. <em>Wyoming, </em>345 U. S. 981. In 1986, the State of Nebraska filed suit against the State of Wyoming. In 1987, Wyoming filed counterclaims against Nebraska. This Court resolved certain issues on cross-motions for summary judgment in 1993. <em>Nebraska </em>v. <em>Wyoming, </em>507 U. S. 584. In 1995, this Court granted in part and denied in part Nebraska\u2019s motion to amend its petition, and granted in part and denied in part Wyoming\u2019s motion to amend its counterclaims and to file cross-claims against the United States. <em>Nebraska </em>v. <em>Wyoming, </em>515 U.

The parties have agreed upon this Court\u2019s entry of this Modified Decree to a dismissal with prejudice of all claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims for which leave to file was or could have been sought in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The parties to this cause having filed a Final Settlement Stipulation dated March 13, 2001, which includes the parties\u2019 agreement to create the North Platte Decree Committee to assist them in monitoring, administering, and implementing this Modified Decree, and a Joint Motion for Approval of Stipulation, Modification of Decree, and Dismissal with Prejudice, and the Court being fully advised:</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">IT IS ORDERED:</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">That the Final Settlement Stipulation dated March 13, 2001, is hereby approved and adopted;</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">That all claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims for which leave to file was or could have been sought in this case are hereby dismissed with prejudice; and</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">That the Decree of October 8, 1945, as amended on June 15,1953, is hereby modified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>I. The State of Colorado, its officers, attorneys, agents, and employees, be and they are hereby severally enjoined:</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">(a) From diverting or permitting the diversion of water from the North Platte River and its tributaries for the irrigation of more than a total of 145,000 acres of land in Jackson County, Colorado, during any one irrigation season;</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">(b) From storing or permitting the storage of more than a total amount of 17,000 acre-feet of water for irrigation purposes from the North Platte River and its tributaries in Jackson County, Colorado, between October 1 of any year and September 30 of the following year;</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">(c) From exporting out of the basin of the North Platte River and its tributaries in Jackson County, Colorado, to any other stream basin or basins more than 60,000 acre-feet of water in any period of ten consecutive years reckoned in continuing progressive series beginning with October 1, 1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">II. The State of Wyoming, its officers, attorneys, agents, and employees, be and they are hereby severally enjoined:</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">(a) From diverting or permitting the diversion of water for irrigation from the North Platte River and its tributaries, including water from hydrologically connected groundwater wells, upstream of Pathfinder Dam for the consumption in any period of ten consecutive years reckoned in continuing progressive series, of more than the largest amount of water consumed for irrigation from such sources in any ten consecutive year period between 1952 and 1999, inclusive. This injunction becomes effective the first full calendar year after the date of entry of this Modified Decree. The consumptive use of irrigation water in this area to be counted under this injunction shall include the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">(1) Water consumed for irrigation purposes on lands irrigated with surface water diversions of natural flow;</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">(2) Water consumed for irrigation purposes on lands irrigated with water stored pursuant to paragraph 11(e);</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>(3) Water consumed for irrigation purposes on lands irrigated by water from hydrologically connected groundwater wells;</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">(4) Water consumed for purposes other than irrigation under water rights transferred since October 8, 1945, from an irrigation use to another use;</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The largest amount of water consumed for irrigation from such sources in any ten consecutive year period between 1952 and 1999, inclusive, has been determined by the parties pursuant to a methodology and procedures approved and adopted in the Final Settlement Stipulation to be 1,280,000 acre-feet. For the purpose of determining compliance with this injunction, the amount of water consumed for irrigation from such sources shall be determined by the same methodology and procedures. After ten years of administration, accounting, and reporting under this injunction, the methodology and the ten consecutive year limit will be reviewed by the North Platte Decree Committee pursuant to procedures approved and adopted in the Final Settlement Stipulation to determine if there is a better methodology for calculating the largest amount of water consumed for irrigation in such ten consecutive year period and for determining compliance. In making such calculation, any acreage historically reported by the Wyoming State Engineer as irrigated by direct flow surface water or stored water or as transfers, between 1952 and 1999, inclusive, and used in the existing methodology, shall not be changed. In addition, the other acreage used in the existing methodology shall not be changed unless the North Platte Decree Committee agrees that such change results in a more accurate determination of acres actually irrigated between 1952 and 1999, inclusive. In any new methodology, to determine compliance with the consumptive use limit, the acreage above Pathfinder Dam, when combined with the acreage between Pathfinder Dam and Guernsey Reservoir, cannot exceed the 226,000 acreage limitation pursuant to paragraph 11(c). If Nebraska, Wyoming, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>United States agree on a new methodology and a new limit, they shall notify the Court and this paragraph will be modified accordingly. As provided in paragraph XIII, absent agreement on a new methodology and a new limit, Nebraska, Wyoming, or the United States may seek recourse to the Court to resolve these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">(b) From diverting or permitting the diversion of water for irrigation from the North Platte River and its tributaries, including water from hydrologically connected groundwater wells, between Pathfinder Dam and Guernsey Reservoir for the consumption in any period of ten consecutive years reckoned in continuing progressive series, exclusive of the Kendrick Project, of more than the largest amount of water consumed for irrigation from such sources in any ten consecutive year period between 1952 and 1999, inclusive. This injunction becomes effective the first full calendar year after the entry of this Modified Decree. The consumptive use of irrigation water in this area to be counted under this injunction shall include the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">(1) Water consumed for irrigation purposes on lands irrigated with surface water diversions of natural flow;</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">(2) Water consumed for irrigation purposes on lands irrigated with water stored in reservoirs that store water from the tributaries between Pathfinder Dam and Guernsey Reservoir;</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">(3) Water consumed for irrigation purposes on lands irrigated by water from hydrologically connected groundwater wells;</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">(4) Water consumed for purposes other than irrigation with water rights transferred since October 8,1945, from an irrigation use to another use;</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">The largest amount of water consumed for irrigation from such sources in any ten consecutive year period between 1952 and 1999, inclusive, has been determined by the parties pursuant to a methodology and procedures approved and adopted in the Final Settlement Stipulation to be 890,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>acre-feet. For the purpose of determining compliance with this injunction, the amount of water consumed for irrigation from such sources shall be determined by the same methodology and procedures. After ten years of administration, accounting, and reporting under this injunction, the methodology and the ten consecutiv\u00e9 year limit will be reviewed by the North Platte Decree Committee pursuant to procedures approved and adopted in the Final Settlement Stipulation to determine if there is a better methodology for calculating the largest amount of water consumed for irrigation in such ten consecutive year period and for determining compliance. In making such calculation, any acreage historically reported by the Wyoming State Engineer as irrigated by direct flow surface water or stored water or as transfers, between 1952 and 1999, inclusive, and used in the existing methodology, shall not be changed. In addition, the other acreage used in the existing methodology shall not be changed unless the North Platte Decree Committee agrees that such change results in a more accurate determination of acres actually irrigated between 1952 and 1999, inclusive. In any new methodology, to determine compliance with the consumptive use limit, the acreage above Pathfinder Dam, when combined with the acreage between Pathfinder Dam and Guernsey Reservoir, cannot exceed the 226,000 acreage limitation pursuant to paragraph 11(c). If Nebraska, Wyoming, and the United States agree on a new methodology and a new limit, they shall notify the Court and this paragraph will be modified accordingly. As provided in paragraph XIII, absent agreement on a new methodology and a new limit, Nebraska, Wyoming, or the United States may seek recourse to the'Court to resolve these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">(c) From diverting or permitting the diversion of water from the North Platte River and its tributaries, including water from hydrologically connected groundwater wells, upstream of Guernsey Reservoir for the intentional irrigation of more than a total of 226,000 acres of land in Wyoming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>during any one irrigation season, exclusive of the Kendrick Project. The acres in this area to be counted under this injunction shall include the following, provided that an intentionally irrigated acre that receives water from more than one source shall be counted only once:</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">(1) Acres irrigated by surface water diversions of natural flow;</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">(2) Acres irrigated by water stored pursuant to paragraph 11(e);</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">(3) Acres irrigated by water stored in reservoirs that store water from the tributaries between Pathfinder Dam and Guernsey Reservoir;</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">(4) Acres irrigated with water from hydrologically connected groundwater wells;</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">(5) The equivalent of the acres found by order of the Wyoming State Board of Control to have been historically irrigated and that formed the basis for the transfer of water rights where water rights on the North Platte River upstream of Guernsey Reservoir or the tributaries upstream of Pathfinder Dam are transferred after October 8, 1945, from an irrigation use to another use; provided, however, that the amount of acres counted for a given year may be reduced proportionately to the extent that the actual diversion and use of water under the transferred water right during that year are less than the total diversion and use allowed by the order approving such transfer;</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">(6) The equivalent of the acres found by order of the Wyoming State Board of Control to have been historically irrigated and that formed the basis for the transfer of water rights where water rights on the tributaries entering the North Platte River between Pathfinder Dam and Guernsey Reservoir are transferred after January 1,2001, from an irrigation use to another use; provided, however, that the amount of acres counted for a given year may be reduced proportionately to the extent that the actual diversion and use of water under the transferred water right during that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>year are less than the total diversion and use allowed by the order approving such transfer;</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Ten years after the entry of this Modified Decree, the provision that enjoins Wyoming from intentionally irrigating more than 226,000 acres upstream of Guernsey Reservoir will be replaced with two injunctions, one that limits the number of acres that can be irrigated above Pathfinder Dam and one that limits the number of acres that can be irrigated between Pathfinder Dam and Guernsey Reservoir. Wyoming has the discretion to designate the irrigated acreage limitation above Pathfinder Dam and the irrigated acreage limitation between Pathfinder Dam and Guernsey Reservoir, so long as the total irrigated acreage limitation does not exceed 226,000 acres. After Wyoming makes such designation, Nebraska, Wyoming, and the United States will so notify the Court and the Modified Decree will be modified accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">(d) From diverting or permitting the diversion of water from the Laramie River and its tributaries, including water from hydrologieally connected groundwater wells, downstream of the Wheatland Irrigation District\u2019s Tunnel No. 2, exclusive of the area within the Wheatland Irrigation District, for the intentional irrigation of more than a total of 39,000 acres of land in Wyoming during any one irrigation season. The acres in this area to be counted under this injunction shall include the following, provided that an intentionally irrigated acre that re( eives water from more than one source shall be counted onl <em>y </em>once:</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">(1) Acres irrigated by surfac 3 water diversions of natural flow;</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">(2) Acres irrigated by stored irrigation water released from a reservoir;</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">(3) Acres irrigated with wa ;er from hydrologieally connected groundwater wells;</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">(4) The equivalent of the acre s found by order of the Wyoming State Board of Control t &gt; have been historically irri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>gated and that formed the basis for the transfer of water rights where water rights are transferred after January 1, 2001, from an irrigation use that is subject to the limitations of this paragraph 11(d) to another use; provided, however, that the amount of acres counted for a given year may be reduced proportionately to the extent that the actual diversion and use of water under the transferred water right during that year are less than the total diversion and use allowed by the order approving such transfer;</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">(e) From storing or permitting the storage of more than a total amount of 18,000 acre-feet of water for irrigation purposes from the North Platte River and its tributaries above Pathfinder Reservoir between October 1 of any year and September 30 of the following year, exclusive of Seminoe Reservoir.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">III. The State of Wyoming, its officers, attorneys, agents, and employees, be and they are hereby severally enjoined from storing or permitting the storage of water in Pathfinder, Guernsey, Seminoe, Alcova, and Glendo Reservoirs and the Inland Lakes otherwise than in accordance with the relative storage rights, as among themselves, of such reservoirs, which are hereby defined and fixed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">First, Pathfinder Reservoir;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">Second, Inland Lakes with the same priority date as Pathfinder Reservoir;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-10\">Third, Guernsey Reservoir;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-11\">Fourth, Seminoe Reservoir;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-12\">Fifth, Alcova Reservoir; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-13\">Sixth, Glendo Reservoir;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-14\">Provided, however, that water accruing in priority to the storage right of a reservoir listed above, and water accruing to the Glendo Reservoir reregulating space pursuant to paragraph XVII(g), may be physically stored in, released from, or exchanged with another reservoir so long as the water is accounted in accordance with the foregoing rule of priority and only when such storage, release, or exchange <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>will not materially interfere with the administration of water for irrigation purposes according to the priority decreed for the French Canal and the State Line Canals. Further, in accordance with the opinion of this Court dated April 20, 1993 (507 U. S. 584),. the United States has the right to divert 46,000 acre-feet of water during the^nonirrigation season months of October, November, and'April for storage in the Inland Lakes. Historically, pursuant to annual agreements entered in the discretion of the parties, such diversions have occurred at a rate not exceeding 910 cubic feet per second from gains accruing to the river downstream of Alcova Reservoir. This right shall be administered in accordance with procedures to be reviewed and adopted annually by the North Platte Decree Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">IV. The State of Wyoming, its officers, attorneys, agents, and employees, be and they are hereby severally enjoined from storing-or permitting the storage of water in Pathfinder, Guernsey, Seminoe, Alcova, and Glendo Reservoirs, and from the diversion of natural flow water through the Casper Canal for the Kendrick Project between and including May 1 and September 30 of each year otherwise than in accordance with the rule of priority in relation to the appropriations of the Nebraska lands supplied by the French Canal and by the State Line Canals, which said Nebraska appropriations are hereby adjudged to be senior to said five reservoirs and said Casper Canal, and which said Nebraska appropriations are hereby identified and defined, and their diversion limitations in second feet and seasonal limitations in acre-feet fixed as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\n<em>Lands Canal Limitation in Sec.

The costs in the original cause were apportioned and paid pursuant to previous order of this Court. The costs in the present cause and the payment of the fees and expenses of the Special Master have been apportioned and paid according to previous orders of this Court with which the parties agree and the Court hereby confirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">XV. The clerk of this Court shall transmit to the Governors and Attorneys General of the States of Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska, the Solicitor General of the United States of America, and Basin Electric Power Cooperative, copies of this Modified Decree duly authenticated under the seal of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">XVI. Whatever claims or defenses the parties or any of them may have in respect to the application, interpretation, or construction of the Act of August 9, 1937 (50 Stat. 564, 595-596), shall be determined without prejudice to any party arising because of any development of the Kendrick Project occurring subsequent to October 1, 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">XVII. The following provisions are effective for the operation of Glendo Dam and Reservoir:</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">(a) The operation of the Glendo Project shall not impose any demand on areas at or above Seminoe Reservoir which will prejudice any rights that the States of Colorado or Wyoming might have to secure a modification of the Modified Decree permitting an expansion of water uses in the natural basin of the North Platte River in Colorado or above Seminoe Reservoir in Wyoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">(b) The operation of Glendo Reservoir shall not affect the regime of the natural flow of the North Platte River except that not more than 40,000 acre-feet of the natural flow of the North Platte River and its tributaries which cannot be stored in upstream reservoirs under the provisions of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Modified Decree may be stored in Glendo Reservoir during any water year for disposition by the United States under contracts, in addition to evaporation losses on such storage, and further, the amount of water that may be held in storage at any one time for disposition by the United States under contracts, including carryover storage, shall never exceed 100,000 acre-feet. Such storage water shall be disposed of in accordance with contracts executed or to be hereafter executed, in compliance with federal law, and may be used for any beneficial purpose in Nebraska within the Platte River basin to the extent of 25,000 acre-feet annually and for any beneficial purpose in Wyoming within the Platte River basin to the extent of 15,000 acre-feet annually. The above limitation on the amount of storage of natural flow does not apply: (1) to flood water which may be temporarily stored in any capacity allocated for flood control in Glendo Reservoir; (2) to water originally stored in Pathfinder Reservoir which may be temporarily re-stored in Glendo Reservoir after its release from Pathfinder and before its delivery pursuant to contract; (3) to Inland Lakes account water temporarily stored in accordance with this Court\u2019s Order of April 20, 1993; (4) to water which may be impounded behind Glendo Dam, as provided in the Bureau of Reclamation Definite Plan Report for the Glendo Unit, Wyoming, dated December 1952, as revised through December 1959 (Glendo Definite Plan Report) for the purpose of creating a head for the development of water power; or (5) to water in Glendo Reservoir used for the purposes described in paragraph XVII(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">(c) Each State may substitute or supplement quantities of storage water obtained under other contractual arrangements with Glendo Reservoir storage supplies. Subject to contractual arrangements with the United States Bureau of Reclamation, including any required compliance with the Endangered Species Act, 16 U. S. C. \u00a7 1531 <em>et seq., </em>and the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U. S. C. \u00a74321 <em>et seq., </em>each State shall also enjoy unrestricted use of its respective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>storage allocation in Glendo Reservoir, so long as the use is below Glendo Reservoir and within the Platte River basin.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">(d) Glendo Reservoir storage water may be consumptively used in Wyoming by exchange or other means, upstream of Glendo Reservoir under the terms of this paragraph. For every two acre-feet of Glendo storage water diverted upstream of Glendo Reservoir pursuant to such an exchange, all of which may be fully consumed, an additional acre-foot of Wyoming\u2019s Glendo storage allocation shall be contracted at the same time for storage and release from Glendo Reservoir and passed through Guernsey Reservoir to the North Platte River. Except as may be modified in accordance with paragraph XVII(e), or by agreement of the parties, such additional water shall be released from the reservoir at the same time and at a rate proportionate to the diversion of the water contracted for use upstream from Glendo Reservoir during the irrigation season. During the nonirrigation season, due to operational constraints of the outlets at Guernsey Reservoir, such additional water will be held in the Glendo account and released prior to the first of May as may be operationally practical. Except as provided in paragraph XVII(e), once released, such additional water shall be considered natural flow water for purposes of the 75/25 apportionment specified in paragraph V.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">(e) If the valid exercise or enforcement of federal law or authority requires Wyoming or a water user within Wyoming to cause the release of a portion of Wyoming\u2019s Glendo allocation for environmental purposes downstream of Glendo Reservoir, the additional water contracted and released under paragraph XVII(d) may be dedicated to and used for that purpose. Any water released pursuant to such requirement shall not be considered natural flow but shall be administered and protected as storage water in accordance with state law within both Wyoming and Nebraska until used for its intended purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>(f) Storage water in Glendo Reservoir from either State\u2019s allocation may be used for fish and wildlife purposes downstream of Glendo Reservoir under contractual arrangements with the United States Bureau of Reclamation, subject to approval of Wyoming for contracts for water from Wyoming\u2019s storage allocation and subject to approval of Nebraska for contracts for water from Nebraska\u2019s storage allocation. Any water released pursuant to such agreement shall not be considered natural flow but shall be administered and protected as storage water in accordance with state law within both Wyoming and Nebraska until used for its intended purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">(g) The United States Bureau of Reclamation has the discretion to hold water in Glendo Reservoir in excess of the limitations stated in paragraph XVII(b) in accordance with the operation of the reregulation space in Glendo Reservoir under Permit No. 5998 Res. and Certificate of Construction of Reservoir, as clarified by Order of the Wyoming State Board of Control dated November 29, 2000. Such water may be used, subject to federal law, for the following purposes:</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">(1) to replace water that passed the Wyoming-Nebraska state line in excess of the amount ordered by canals with storage contracts below the Wyoming-Nebraska state line as the unintended result of physical limitations on the ability to control water deliveries;</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">(2) to replace evaporation from the storage ownership accounts of Pathfinder Reservoir, Guernsey Reservoir, Sem-inoe Reservoir, Alcova Reservoir, and Glendo Reservoir; and</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">(3) to supplement the natural flow that is available for apportionment pursuant to paragraph V.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">XVIII. The creation of the North Platte Decree Committee is hereby approved and ratified. Procedures that have been approved and adopted in the Final Settlement Stipulation may be modified from time to time by the North <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Platte Decree Committee if the modifications are consistent with the Modified Decree. In the event of a conflict between any procedure, the Final Settlement Stipulation and the Modified Decree, the provisions of this Modified Decree shall control.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
