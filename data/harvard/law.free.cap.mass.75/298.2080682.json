From the evidence it does not appear that pay was made to the landlord, or that any sales were made with his knowledge or permission. That was a question of fact for the jury to decide; but it was to be decided under proper instructions as to the effect of a sale in his house, by his servants; and because no such instructions were given, our judgment must be <em>Exceptions sustained.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
