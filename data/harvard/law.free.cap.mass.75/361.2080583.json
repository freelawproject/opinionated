Wilbur <em>vs. </em>Samuel Taber.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b371-5\">Under Rev. Sts. c. 85, \u00a7\u00a7 11,12, an entry in a record of a justice of the peace that the \u201c defendant appears and pleads orally and says he is not guilty \u201d is a joinder of issue; and the defendant can give in evidence any matter admissible under any general or special plea in bar; and if the case is carried by appeal to the court of common pleas, and no further pleading is ordered, the same evidence is admissible there, as would have been in the court below.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-6\">Action of tort, commenced before a justice of the peace. The declaration alleged that \u201c the defendant by his cattle forcibly entered the plaintiff\u2019s close in Raynham,\u201d (described,) and \u201c by said cattle trod down and depastured the grass there standing and growing.\u201d The record of the justice,' after stating the cause of action and the defendant\u2019s appearance, proceeded as follows: \u201c And now the defendant comes and defends and pleads (orally) and says that he is not guilty. Issue being joined, after a full hearing, it appears to the said justice that the said defendant is guilty.\u201d The record then stated.a judgment for the. plaintiff, and an appeal to the court of common pleas, where the case was tried before Mellen, C. J., who allowed this bill of exceptions :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-7\">\u201c No answer was filed in the court of common pleas. The plaintiff did not request the court to order the defendant to file an answer, nor did the defendant ask leave to file one, but elected to go to trial upon the pleadings which appeared by the justice\u2019s record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-8\">\u201c On the reading of the writ, the plaintiff asked the court that the defendant might be called, because no answer had been filed. But the court overruled the motion, on the ground that it appeared that an issue had been joined before the justice of the peace.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-9\">\u201c During the trial, the defendant offered evidence tending to show that when the defendant\u2019s cattle went upon the plaintiff\u2019s land they did so on account of the plaintiff\u2019s negligence in maintaining his part of the division fence between the plaintiff and defendant, which the plaintiff was bound by prescription to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>maintain. To this evidence the plaintiff objected, on the ground that it was inadmissible under the pleadings in the case. The objection was overruled, and the evidence admitted. The verdict was for the defendant. To which rulings the plaintiff excepts.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b372-5\"><em>G. 1. Reed, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1c\">1. A joinder of issue by an oral plea before a justice of the peace can only be shown by his record \u201c that the defendant appears, and orally denies the plaintiff\u2019s right to maintain his action, and puts himself on trial; or words to that effect.\u201d Rev. Sts. c. 85, \u00a7\u00a7 11,12. The record does not show <em>\u201c </em>words to that effect,\u201d but the technical general issue in trespass, \u201c not guilty.\u201d It was not the plea permitted by the statute, and should not have been allowed by the justice, or treated as affording any obstacle to a default in the court of common pleas. Rule 19 of C. C. P. in 1855.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-6\">2. If this was a sufficient joinder of issue, the case should have been tried in that court- according to its own rules, and nothing should have been admitted in evidence which would not be admissible under the general issue. <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>1 Met. 309. The evidence offered was not admissible under the general issue. 2 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 625. 1 Chit. Pl. (6th Amer. ed.) 492, 493. <em>Knapp </em>v. <em>Salsbury, </em>2 Campb. 500. <em>Milman </em>v. <em>Dolwell, </em>2 Campb. '378.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b372-7\"><em>J. Brown, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b372-8\">Merrick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aub\">The exceptions of the plaintiff must be overruled. The entry upon the record of the magistrate that the <em>\u201c </em>defendant appears and pleads orally and says he is not guilty,\u201d is equivalent to a denial of the plaintiff\u2019s right to maintain his action, and is exactly to the same effect as if those words had been used. This, by express permission of the statute, is a joinder of the issue, upon which a trial may be had. The defendant was therefore entitled to proceed to trial; and, by a further provision of the statute, to give in evidence any mattei which would have been admissible if the defence had been made under any general or special plea in bar. Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>85, \u00a7\u00a7 11, 12. No new pleading was ordered, and therefore none was required in the common pleas, when this case was carried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>there by appeal. And the rights of the parties, in relation to the production of evidence upon the trial in that court, were the same as those to which they were entitled when they were before the magistrate to whom the writ was made returnable. Rule 19 of C. C. P. See also <em>St. </em>1836, <em>c. </em>273.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
