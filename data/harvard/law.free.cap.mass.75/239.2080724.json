Bryant one hundred and fifty dollars, seventy five dollars to be paid to her by my son Ebenezer Bryant when he arrives to the age of twenty two years, and seventy five dollars more at the decease of my said wife.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-11\">The defendant was named in the will as principal devisee and residuary legatee, subject to a life estate in the testator\u2019s widow, who died before this suit was brought. The plaintiff married <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>John Howard in 1808. The defendant arrived at the age of twenty two in 1809, and in 1813 conveyed all the estate so devised and bequeathed to him to John Howard, by quitclaim deed in the usual form, and containing, after the description of the premises, these words: \u201c And it is considered that the said John Howard is to pay all the legacies which I am bound to pay by my father\u2019s will.\u201d Howard died intestate in 1824, and the plaintiff was appointed administratrix of his estate, and demanded payment of the legacy before bringing this action.

It was a chose in action which survived to her on his death, unless he had reduced it to possession, or released it, or had made a valid assignment of it, or had, in some other way, legally barred her right to it. And any lawful exercise of an act of ownership, by a husband, over his wife\u2019s chose in action, by which he appropriates it to his sole use, is such a reduction of it to possession as bars her right of survivorship. In this case, the legal effect of the facts is, that the plaintiff\u2019s husband received the amount of her legacy, by applying it towards payment for the land which he purchased of her father\u2019s residuary devisee, and in which she became entitled to dower.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">\n<em>Plaintiff nonsuit</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
