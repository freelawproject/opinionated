The evidence offered was rejected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-6\">The defendants introduced and read to the jury a policy of insurance issued by the Hampden Stock and Mutual Fire. Insurance Company to the plaintiffs on the 17th of August 1854 on \u201c four chests of carpenter\u2019s tools in wood shop in West Cambridge,\u201d and \u201cpredicated upon an application or survey,\u201d which was made a part of the policy, and described the property insured as situated in \u201c Brattle Place,\u201d and had indorsed upon it the following: \u201c Remarks of Agent. Messrs. Clark &amp; Burr wished me to file an application to insure this property; they employ ten hands, four or five of which work in the immediate neighborhood, so that their chests remain in the shop; and Messrs. C. &amp; B. think that this insurance will render their hands contented and not so liable to change places.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-7\">\u201c Isaac H. Damon, Agent.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-8\">The plaintiffs contended that the tools insured by the Hampden Company were not the same insured by the defendants, but belonged to certain journeymen in the plaintiffs\u2019 employment, for whose benefit that insurance was obtained. It appeared that at the time of that insurance and of the fire there were in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>the shop two chests of tools belonging to the plaintiffs, and also two and perhaps three chests of tools belonging to workmen in their employment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-5\">Damon, and Clark, one of the plaintiffs, were called as wit nesses, and testified that Damon filled out that application, and forwarded it to the defendants at Springfield, after being re quested to obtain insurance for the plaintiffs on four chests of tools belonging to journeymen in their employment. On cross examination, Damon testified that he made no other com muni cation to the Hampden Company than the writing on the application, and that, so far as he knew, they had no knowledge that their policy was to be on the tools of journeymen employed by the plaintiffs; and Clark testified that when he signed that application he supposed it related to and corresponded with the tools of the journeymen. All this evidence was objected to by the defendants, but admitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-6\">The case was then reserved for the full court, the parties agreeing that if the facts concerning the attempts to set fire to the shop and the plaintiffs\u2019 omission to make them known to the defendants constituted no defence to the action, and if the evidence concerning the journeymen\u2019s tools and the application to the Hampden Company was competent, and, taken in connection with the two applications and policies, was sufficient to show that the two insurances were not upon the same tools, judgment should be rendered for the plaintiffs; otherwise, for the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b160-7\"><em>S.

Continued and persistent effort's by unknown incendiaries to burn the property were such material circumstances, as, if occurring before the insurance, should have been disclosed in the application, or, if arising after-wards, constituted a change of circumstances, within the meaning of the 14th by-law. <em>Bufe </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>6 Taunt. 338. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Manufacturers\u2019 Ins.

The defendants\u2019 policy attached to all the tools of the plaintiffs, in chests or otherwise, in the shop ; the policy of the Hampden Company applied to four chests of tools of the plaintiffs in the same .shop. That company never contemplated insuring any tools but the plaintiffs\u2019. The memorandum on the back of the application contains no statement that the tools of the journeymen are meant to be insured. There is no ambiguity, latent or patent, in either policy. The testimony of Damon and Clark to the conversation about the purpose of procuring that policy was incompetent. <em>Weston </em>v. <em>Emes, </em>1 Taunt. 115. <em>Kaines </em>v. <em>Knightly, </em>Skin. 54. <em>Leslie </em>v. <em>De La Torre, </em>cited 12 East, 583. <em>Work </em>v. <em>Merchants &amp; Farmers\u2019 Ins.

The defendants\u2019 policy is therefore void by the terms of the IStji by-law, whether the other policy is void or not.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b161-6\">Thomas, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Agg\">This is an action upon a policy of insurance. There were two grounds of defence. The first was a change in the circumstances of the insured property, materially increasing the risk, and not communicated to the defendants. This alleged change of circumstances consisted in attempts on three distinct occasions to set fire to the shop insured. The court rejected the evidence, with the idea probably that the object of the policy of insurance was protection against loss by fire \u2014 fires kindled by incendiaries included.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The second ground of defence was a subsequent insurance on the same property, without notice to the defendants. The question of fact which arose was, whether the property insured in the second policy was the same as that insured in the first. Upon this point the testimony of the agent of the second insurance company and of one of the plaintiffs was admitted of the declarations, made at the time of insurance, as to what prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>erty the plaintiffs desired to have their policy cover. We think the admission of this evidence was an error. The contract in writing could not be so controlled.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">But we think also that the burden of proof was upon the defendants to show that the property insured in the second policy was the property insured in the first policy ; that upon the evidence reported this burden was not discharged; and that, upon the competent evidence in the case, it does not appear that the property was the same. The result however is to send the case hack for a <em>New trial.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
