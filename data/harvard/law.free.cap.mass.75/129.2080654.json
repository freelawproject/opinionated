And on appeal from the judgment of an inferior court, the defendant has a right to have his trial confined to the same act for which he has been tried in that court. If a complainant, or a grand jury, has not in mind any particular transaction, the defendant may be arraigned for an offence with which he has not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>charged, and tried for an offence on which he has not been arraigned.

This complainant had been informed that the defendant had committed the offence charged, and he made oath to the complaint in due form. It was not necessary that at the time of making the complaint he should know the particulars of the transaction, or the name of the person to whom the sale was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">After the defendant had been tried and convicted before a justice on proof of a sale at a certain time and place, evidence of a sale at a different time and place would be inadmissible in the higher court. But if the offence was well charged and was proved as laid, the legal presumption is <em>prima facie </em>that it was the same offence. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
