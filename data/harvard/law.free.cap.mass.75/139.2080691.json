F. Butler, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0e\">The liquor in question was illegally sold for an illegal purpose; bought for an illegal purpose, to wit, to be sold in this state by the purchaser; it was criminal to own or keep it for such purpose; it was being illegally transported for that purpose at the time1 of the asportation; and all these intents and purposes were known to the various actors. <em>St. </em>1855, <em>c. 215, \u00a7\u00a7 </em>1, 3, 18, 19. It was a common nuisance. \u00a7 37. And the defendant\u2019s taking and concealment of it were an abatement of the nuisance, which was the only lawful act that could be done with it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-7\">How can a man steal a common nuisance ? Stolen property is required to be secured, and, upon conviction of the thief, restored to the owner, at the expense of the Commonwealth. Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>136, \u00a7\u00a7 25, 26. Will the law lend its aid to recover this article, and put it back into the power of the purchaser, to enable him to pursue, his unlawful purpose ? See <em>Spalding </em>v. <em>Preston, 21 </em>Verm. 9; <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>8 Car. &amp; P. 642.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-8\">This case is distinguished from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rourke, </em>10 Cush. 397, by the fact that this liquor had lost every attribute of property when it was first sold, and from that moment became only an instrument of crime.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b150-9\"><em>J.

The owner might forfeit and lose the property, if upon proper legal process it should appear that it was procured and held for an illegal purpose, but only upon such proof, and in the method the law points out. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rourke, </em>10 Cush 397. <em>Ewings </em>v. <em>Walker, ante, </em>95. \u2018 <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
