Richards, summoned as trustee, and Jesse F. Richards, claimant, from the judgment of the court of common pleas, charging the trustee. The papers on which the case was submitted to this court consisted only of the claim of Jesse F. Richards of all moneys in the hands of the trustee, as having been assigned to him by the defendant on the 19th of April 1856, which was before the date of this process; and of the trustee\u2019s answer under oath, stating that at the time of the service of this process upon him a certain sum was due from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>him to the defendant, for which he had since given his due bill to Jesse F. Richards, upon .the latter\u2019s presenting to him the following assignment: \u201c In consideration of a debt I owe Jesse F. Richards, be it known that I, William F. Smith, of Attleborough, do hereby transfer and set over to said Jesse F. Richards all demands that I hold against Henry M. Richards, or that the said Henry M. Richards now owes me to this date, and I do empower the said Jesse F. Richards to collect the same. Dated this nineteenth day of April, 1856. W. F.

And this record does not state facts enough to show either the claimant\u2019s right to the fund, or the trustee\u2019s right to be discharged. \u2022 We must presume that evidence was not given to the court of common pleas, which proved the validity of.the assignment to the claimant; or that other evidence was given, which showed that the assignment was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">In the case of <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>5 Gray, 50, note, the trustee\u2019s answer disclosed a valid assignment for good consideration ; the court of common .pleas defaulted the claimant, but discharged the trustee; the plaintiff, by his appeal, opened the whole case in this court; and this court necessarily discharged the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">\n<em>Trustee charged.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
