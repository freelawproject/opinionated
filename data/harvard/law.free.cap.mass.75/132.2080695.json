The provision of <em>St. </em>1855, <em>c. </em>215, \u00a7 17, that \u201c three several sales of spirituous or intoxicating liquors shall be sufficient evidence of a violation of this section,\u201d is beyond the constitutional power of the legislature. What shall be sufficient evidence is to be determined by the jury. If the legislature had enacted that three sales should make a party liable to the penalties of a common seller, they might have done what they intended.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b143-6\"><em>J.
