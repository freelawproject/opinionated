Woodward, Justice of the Peace.\u201d To prove the authority of the treasurer to execute this assignment, the plaintiffs relied upon the by-laws of the corporation, which provided that it should be managed by a board of trustees, who- should \u201c have control in all matters of the institution not specially provided for,\u201d and \u201c have power to elect a treasurer and such other officers as the interests of the institution might require ; \u201d and upon votes of the trustees and of the corporation, \u201c that the treasurer be authorized to sign all deeds and instruments for the legal conveyance of real estate, under the direction of the committee of investment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-9\">The treasurer testified that the committee of investment held meetings every Monday, but kept no records of their doings. He also testified, against the defendants\u2019 objection, that he was authorized by that committee to execute this assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-10\">Upon this evidence the defendants objected to the admission of the assignment of the mortgage,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-11\">\u201c1st. Because it did not appear that the treasurer had the requisite legal authority from the corporation to execute said assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-12\">\u201c 2d. Because said assignment was not so executed as to be the act and deed of the corporation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-13\">But the judge overruled the objections, and permitted the deed to be offered in evidence.

And the assignment was not executed in the corporate name, nor with the corporate seal. <em>Elwell </em>v. Shaw, 16 Mass. 42, and notes thereto in 1 Amer. Lead. Cas. (3d ed.) 575, &amp; cases there cited. <em>Brinley </em>v. <em>Mann, </em>2 Cush. 337.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b379-5\"><em>E. H.

The corporation are the grantors named therein ; they declare that they have set \u201c their corporate name and seal \u201d thereto; and it is acknowledged to be \u201c their free act and deed.\u201d As their corporate name is actually signed, the preceding words, \u201c Geo. B. Atwood, Tr.\u201d may be rejected as immaterial. See <em>Mill Dam Foundery </em>v. <em>Hovey, </em>21 Pick. 417.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-7\">Even if no name were attached, the corporate seal would be quite sufficient. 2 Bl. Com. 306. <em>Cromwell </em>v. <em>Grunsden, </em>2 Salk. 462. It is so held in England, even under the statute of frauds. <em>Cooch </em>v. Goodman, 2 Ad. &amp; El. N. R. 580. <em>Aveline </em>v. <em>Whisson, </em>4 Man. &amp; Gr. 801. <em>Cherry </em>v. Heming, 4 Exch. 631. Shep. Touchst. (Prest, ed.) 56, note. And in the Rev. Sts. c. 59, \u00a7 1, \u201c deed executed \u201d means as at common law. [Bigelow, J. Sections 16 &amp; 18, providing for \u201c proving the handwriting of the grantor and of any subscribing witnesses\u201d of unacknowledged deeds, imply that he must sign.] In those cases, perhaps. But they equally imply that there must be witnesses, which this court has decided to be unnecessary. <em>Dole </em>v. <em>Thurlow, </em>12 Met. 166. [Bigelow, J. By \u00a7 29, \u201c all estates or interests in lands, created or conveyed without any instrument in writing, signed by the grantor or his attorney, shall have the force and effect of estates at will only.\u201d] If an estate at will, it is sufficient for this case. And our statute is not more positive than the English. [Bigelow, J. <em>\u201c </em>And no estate or interest in lands shall be assigned, granted' or surrendered, unless by a writing <em>sign.ed </em>as aforesaid, or by operation of law.\u201d Rev. Sts. c. 59, \u00a7 29.]</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Metcalf, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0L\">The defendants\u2019 counsel contends that the direction of the committee of investment to the treasurer should have been in writing and by their recorded vote. But the committee kept no records, and were not bound to keep any; nor was it necessary that their direction should be in writing. Angel\u00ed &amp; Ames on Corp. \u00a7 291 <em>a.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The defendants\u2019 main reliance is on the objection that the assignment in question was not so executed by the treasurer as to be the act and deed of the corporation. But we are of opinion that this objection cannot be sustained. The assignment was made in the name, and as the act, of the corporation, according to the rule laid down in <em>Combes\u2019s case, </em>9 Co. 76 <em>b, </em>and always adhered to in England and in this commonwealth. In <em>Brinley </em>v. <em>Mann, </em>2 Cush. 337, and in <em>Elwell </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>16 Mass. 42, cited for the defendants, that rule had not been complied with. The distinction between this case and those is most manifest. Nor is there in the collection of decisions on this point, in 1 Amer. Lead. Cas. to which we were referred, a single case that renders the validity of this assignment doubtful.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\n<em>Conditional judgment to be entered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
