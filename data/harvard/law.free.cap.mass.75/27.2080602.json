There were no vaults of brick or stone, and the ashes were generally-deposited on the ground, at a distance from the building; but the boy employed by the school committee to take charge of the building, for two or three weeks before the fire, without orders, placed the ashes in a wooden barrel in a shed adjoining the school-house. <em>Held, </em>that the insurers were discharged.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-6\">Action of contract on a policy of insurance, dated February 10th 1855, upon a school-house against loss by fire, \u201c according to the true intent and meaning of\u201d the rules annexed to the policy, and the application for insurance, which was made part of the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-7\">By those rules \u201c policies shall become void and of no effect for any of the following causes or reasons, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-8\">\u201c If the application shall not contain a full, fair and substantially a true representation of all the facts and circumstances respecting the property, so far as they are within the knowledge of the assured, and material to the risk.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-9\">\u201c Or if the assured shall withhold or conceal any such material facts or circumstances within his knowledge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-10\">\u201c Or if the state of things in or about buildings insured be so altered or changed by the advice, consent or procurement of the assured, as to cause a material increase of the risk.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-11\">\u201c Or if a loss shall happen through the gross, wanton or wilful misconduct of the assured, or through his gross or culpable negligence, or by means of his intoxication.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-12\">The twelfth interrogatory in the application was this: \u201c Are your ashes taken up in metallic vessels which are not allowed to stand on wood with ashes in them ?

A boy was hired to make the fires and take charge of the school-house during the continuance of the school; but no directions were given him by any one as to the disposition of the ashes. For almost three weeks from the opening of the school he threw them into a pile on the ground a rod or more from the building: but two or three weeks before the burning of the building a legal voter of the district in which the schoolhouse was situated placed a wooden barrel in the wood-house which adjoined the school-house, and in which the wood for fuel was kept, and agreed with the boy to pay him a stipulated price if he would put the ashes, as they accumulated, in the barrel, which the boy from that time did, until the building was destroyed. There were no vaults of brick or stone or other incombustible material in or about the school-house, or provided elsewhere for the deposit of the ashes. The wood-house was a building of wood, and it was in \u00f1ames when the fire was first discovered, and before it had reached the school-house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-7\"><em>\u201c </em>The prudential committee of the district at the time of the destruction of the school-house, who had held the same office in the previous year, soon after the school for the winter of 1854-55 was opened directed the person who then made the fires to throw the ashes upon the ground on the spot before referred to, and his directions were complied with during that winter.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-8\"><em>C.

Co. </em>6 Cush. 440 The plaintiffs\u2019 designation of this spot for the purpose was mani festly known to the boy who afterwards had charge of the fires. His acts in delivering the ashes to a stranger by placing them in a receptacle provided by him, and the keeping of such receptacle in dangerous proximity to the building by such stranger, without right and in violation of the known rules of the plaintiffs, cannot constitute a defence. The warranty can be held to extend only to matters within the knowledge and control of the insured. This is. put beyond dispute by the note at the end of the application, which limits the exemption of the insurers from liability to the single contingency \u201cif ashes are allowed to remain in wood.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b39-5\"><em>C.

To the twelfth interrogatory, the plaintiffs by their answer had stated that \u201c their ashes were taken up in metallic vessels, which were not allowed to stand on wood with ashes in them; and that, if deposited in or near the building, they were deposited in vaults of brick or stone.\u201d Upon the face of the application, and above the signature of the defendants to the application, was the following, \u201c If ashes are allowed to remain in wood, the company will not assume the risk.\u201d This policy was therefore directly affected by the manner in which the plaintiffs used the insured property in reference to the stipulations above referred to. It is conceded that the plaintiffs had no vaults of brick or stone for the deposit of ashes. Had they had such, and had the usual course been to deposit their ashes therein, an unauthorized departure in one or two instances by their servant might not have affected the policy. But under the circumstances of the present case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>placing the ashes for a period of two or three weeks continuously, and up to the time of the loss by fire, in a wooden barre! in the wood-house, which adjoined the school-house, and in which the fuel for the school-house was kept, by the agent employed by the defendants to make the fires and take charge of the school-house, was in direct violation of the terms of the contract for insurance, and must preclude the plaintiffs from recovering for the loss which has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendants.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b39-7\"> Thomas, J. did not sit in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
