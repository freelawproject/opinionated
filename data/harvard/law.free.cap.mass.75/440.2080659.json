Fischer &amp; another <em>vs. </em>Aaron A. Morse &amp; another.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b450-5\">In replevin of goods, to which the defendant pleads title as assignee in insolvency of one now deceased, the plaintiff is not a competent witness, under <em>St. </em>1857, c. 305, to prove that the goods were fraudulently obtained from him by the deceased.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-8\">Replevin of goods. The answer denied the plaintiffs\u2019 property, and the unlawful taking or detaining; and set up title in the defendants as assignees in insolvency of Samuel Allen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-9\">At the trial in the court of common pleas, the plaintiffs contended, and offered to prove by the testimony of one of them, \u201c that the goods in question were the property of the plaintiffs, and were delivered by them to Allen before the date of the proceedings of insolvency, under a contract of sale made by them with him, which was procured by certain false and fraudulent representations made by Allen to the plaintiffs, touching his own solvency and pecuniary condition, which sale, they contended, was thereby rendered void or voidable, and that they, having the right so to do, replevied these goods from the assignees, for the purpose of rescinding the contract of sale so made with the insolvent.\u201d The defendants objected \u201c that the said plaintiff was incompetent to testify, on the ground of the decease of Allen.\u201d <em>Perkins, </em>J. so ruled, the jury returned a verdict for the defendants, and the plaintiffs alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b450-11\"><em>J. A. Andrew 8f W. Lovering, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ART\">The plaintiff was a competent witness under the <em>St. </em>of 1857, c. 305, \u00a7 1. The proviso excluding the adverse party, \u201cwhere one of the original parties to the contract or cause of action in issue and on trial is dead,\u201d does not apply to this case, in which the \u201c issue \u201d on trial was the tortious taking and detaining of the goods by the defendants, to which the deceased was no party. The \u201c contract or cause of action in issue \u201d is as if it had said \u201cthe contract or other matter sued upon.\u201d The object was to exclude only when a party to the record or to the contract declared on was dead. The contract made by the plaintiffs with Allen was a mere incident in the case, not the substance, or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>issue. If the defendants\u2019 construction prevails, any remote circumstance of the case, occurring between parties not on the record, may defeat the plaintiffs\u2019 claim.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b451-5\"><em>E. </em>Wilkinson, for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b451-6\">Thomas, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ank\">The real matter in issue and on trial was the validity of the sale from the plaintiffs to Allen, the insolvent. It was upon this matter, that one of the plaintiffs was offered as a witness. The other party to that contract of sale was dead. The taking that was on trial was the taking by Allen under the contract of sale. The witness was clearly within the reason and purpose of the limitation of the statute, if not within the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
