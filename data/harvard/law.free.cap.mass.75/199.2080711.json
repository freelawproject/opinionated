Lowell, June 2d 1856.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-10\">\u201c Four months after for value received I promise to pay E. W.

Darius Whithead.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-13\">At the trial in the court of common pleas, the plaintiff intro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>duced evidence of the genuineness of the signatures, and for the purpose of proving that Whithead was not an indorser, but an iriginal promisor, called Scott as a witness, who testified \u201c that ne wrote the note; that it was for a debt which Stoddard owed him; that he told Stoddard he would not take it unless he would get another name to be responsible to him on it; that after Stoddard signed said note, and before he delivered it to Scott, he took it to Whithead, and Whithead put his name on the back of it, writing over his name the words \u2018 waiving demand and notice; \u2019 that Stoddard afterwards delivered it in that condition to Scott, in payment of the debt which he owed him ; that Scott afterwards put his own name on the back of the note above Whithead\u2019s signature, writing above his own name \u2018 waiving demand and notice; \u2019 that he then negotiated the note for value to Pearson; Scott and Pearson (as Scott testified on cross-examination) having made a previous arrangement that if Scott would get such a note, Pearson would take it and let him have the money on it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-5\">The defendants objected to the introduction of this testimony to contradict or vary the terms of the note. But Mellen, C. J. admitted it for the purposes for which it was offered; and ruled that the testimony of Scott, if true, made Whithead an original promisor and not an indorser; and also ruled that the note was due and payable, by its terms, in the absence of any testimony on that point, at the time of. the instituting of the suit. Scott was defaulted. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b210-6\"><em>A. F.

It is objected that by the terms of the note the same was not due and payable at the time when the suit was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>instituted. This objection arises wholly from the use of the words \u201c four months after,\u201d and it is contended that this cannot be read <em>\u201c </em>four months after date,\u201d but is quite as properly read \u201c four months after sight,\u201d or \u201c four months after request,\u201d and so being uncertain, no legal liability exists to pay the note in four months after date. We think this objection cannot avail, and that the proper reading of the note is <em>\u201c </em>four months after date,\u201d the omission of the last word being properly supplied, and the most obvious and natural reading being in that form.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">2. The testimony of Scott was properly admitted to the extent of showing the time when the name of the defendant was written upon the note, and whether it was before or after it was indorsed by the payee. To this extent such evidence is competent, and is not in violation of the rule excluding oral evidence when offered to control a written contract. Under our numerous decisions, which are collected and stated in the case of <em>Union Bank of Weymouth &amp; Braintree </em>v. Willis, 8 Met. 504, as well as by various subsequent decisions, a signature on the back of a negotiable note by a third person in blank, before the same has been put in circulation, or delivered to the payee, and before any indorsement of the note by the payee, creates the relation and liability of a maker of the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The nature of the contract and the character of the liability of the defendant depended therefore upon the fact of the time when he placed his name upon the note; and this is to distinguish his liability, whether it be that of maker, guarantor or indorser. The additional facts stated by the witness, beyond that of the time of the signature, were immaterial, and, although not strictly admissible, furnish no ground for setting aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The words \u201c waiving demand and notice,\u201d written above the name of the defendant, although certainly more appropriate words to accompany an indorsement of a note by a regular indorser, yet do not change the relation of the defendant, or his liability to be charged as maker, if in fact, when he signed the note, the same had not been negotiated by the payee and in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>dorsed by him. The evidence shows that this was the fact, and of course controls any inference which might otherwise be drawn from the use of the words recited.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\n<em>jExceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
