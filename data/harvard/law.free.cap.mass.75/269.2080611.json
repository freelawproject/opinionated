The parties submitted to the judgment of the court this case:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-12\">In 1822 Josiah Scudder conveyed to the plaintiff a tract of land in Barnstable bounded \u201c westerly by Phinney\u2019s Mill Pond.\u201d This mill pond was about thirty rods long and from one to six rods wide, and, long before this conveyance, had been made by building a dam across a natural stream. It was sometimes called \u201c Phinney\u2019s Mill Pond,\u201d and sometimes \u201c Trout Brook,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>and through the middle of the pond the thread of the stream is and always has been apparent from the greater depth of water and the current.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-5\">The defendant, under license from an owner of the dam and the water privilege incident thereto, crossed the pond in a boat, and between the thread of the stream and the plaintiff\u2019s upland caught a pound of trout.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b280-6\"><em>J.

On this state of the facts, the court are of opinion that the western boundary of the plaintiff\u2019s land is the centre or thread of the stream ; as it unquestionably would have been, if the deed had bounded him on Trout Brook, the other name by which the water was known and called.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">Though we cannot see any reason why the plaintiff\u2019s grantor should wish to exclude from his grant the very narrow strip of land between the brook and the edge of the water overflowing its banks \u2014 which would be worthless to him, while overflowed \u2014 yet this cannot be allowed to influence our judgment. The deed must be construed by the legal rules which are applicable to its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">However the words <em>\u201c </em>bounded by a pond \u201d should be construed, when applied to a natural pond, whether in its original state or raised by artificial means, we are of opinion, with Chief Justice Weston, that when land is bounded \u201c upon an artificial pond created by expanding a stream by means of a dam, the riparian proprietor would go to the thread of the stream. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>is law,\u201d he says, \u201c well settled and understood.\u201d <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>13 Maine, 201. See also <em>Waterman </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>13 Pick. 265, where Chief Justice Shaw intimates the like opinion : also <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>16 Maine, 361. In the absence of any adjudication conclusively settling the precise case before us, we adopt these views and apply them.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
