At common law, she could not testify. Is she made competent by statute ? The provision in <em>St. </em>1852, <em>c. </em>312, \u00a7 60, abolishing the disqualification of witnesses on the ground of interest in a suit, does not change the rule of the common law as to the competency of a wife; because it expressly enacts, that neither a party to a suit, not by law competent, nor the husband or wife of such party, shall be thereby rendered competent. She is not made competent by <em>St. </em>1856, c. 188, by which parties are made competent witnesses; because that act in terms extends only to parties to actions and does not include the husband or wife of a party. The rule of exclusion at common law still re mained in force when this action was tiled, which was before the enactment of <em>St. </em>1857, c. 305. But this last statute does not change the rule except where \u201c the wife is a party or one of the parties to the action ; \u201d in such cases and in such only she and her husband are made <em>\u201c </em>competent witnesses for or against each other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The cases cited for the plaintiff are not applicable to the question raised here. They are cases where the wife has been a witness in collateral proceedings, or in suits between third persons, where the husband has been indirectly interested oi has testified as a witness; and are not cases where the husband was a party to the suit or the party in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
