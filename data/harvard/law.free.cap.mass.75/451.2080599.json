The natural drainage of a large part of the territory of said original town of Roxbury always has been, and now is, into said Back Bay, and through said channels thereof into Charles River; and these defendants now claim the same right and privilege of drainage, subject only to the lawful obstruction created by the erection of said milldam, which permanently cut off the natural ebb and flow of the tide from said lands, flats and channels of said bay in 1821, but left sluices for the discharge of said drainage, with the waters of Muddy River and Stony Brook, and other smaller streams, into said Charles River.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-11\">At February term 1857 this cause was, by rule of court, and with the concurrence of the commissioners on the Back Bay, acting under the authority of the resolve of 1852, c. 79, \u201c referred to the arbitration of Hon. Marcus Morton, of Taunton, Massa <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>chusetts, aforesaid; and the referee shall give reasonable notice to the parties of the time and place of hearing; and the hearing shall begin as soon after May 15th 1857 as conveniently may be, and the award shall be returned into court as soon thereafter as practicable ; and the pleadings.in the cause may be amended, if need be, so as to embrace all the conflicting claims, rights and interests of the parties, within the bounds described in the first resolve of chapter 79 of the resolves of 1852, concerning Boston Harbor and the Back Bay; and the referee may make all needful views of the premises and all reasonable orders for the proper hearing and determination of the cause; and the referee shall report all questions of law arising in the cause to the court for revision and final adjudication ; meaning hereby that the referee shall award and determine the whole cause, including the law and the facts, but subject to the review and final adjudication of all matters of law in the cause by the full court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-5\">At the hearing before the arbitrator, the Commonwealth moved to amend the information by inserting before the words <em>\u201c </em>owner in fee \u201d the words \u201c under and by virtue of the charter of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay and the charter of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, in New England, or one of them ; meaning to state more fully thereby the nature of the title of the Commonwealth ; \u201d by striking out everything relating to any claim of land or flats in the full basin ; and by amending the description of the other premises claimed. The arbitrator at this term made the following report:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-6\">\u201c The referee appointed by the annexed rule, having duly notified the-parties, met them in the State House, on the twenty-second day of June last, and from time to time between that day and the twentieth of October last; and having heard their several pleas, allegations, proofs and arguments, and having duly examined and considered the same, and having viewed the premises, doth now make the following award and report:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-7\">\u201c This is an information brought by the attorney general in behalf of the Commonwealth, under the statute of 1836, chapter 108, for the purpose of recovering certain lands and flats in the Back Bay, so called, alleged to be owned by the Commonwealth</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>\u201c The defendants\u2019 counsel objected to the sufficiency of the information under the statute, and contended that a prerogative title could not be given in evidence under it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-5\">\u201c The counsel for the Commonwealth offered several amendments, which were objected to by the defendants\u2019 counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-6\">61 But I overruled the objection, and held, that under the circumstances the amendments were admissible, and that under the information, as amended, it was competent for the Com monwealth to give any evidence of title which it might possess.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-7\">\u201c The counsel for the Commonwealth contended that the title to the demanded premises, on the first settlement of the country, was vested in the Colony, and thence, by the acts of the several governments, passed through the Province to the Commonwealth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-8\">\u201c This position I adopted, and held that the fee still remained in the Commonwealth, unless its government, or that of one of its predecessors, had aliened it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-9\">\u201c The defendants\u2019 counsel then introduced an act of the general court of the Colony of Massachusetts, passed May 25,1636, in these words : \u2018 Ordered, that all the rest of the ground lying betwixt Dorchester bounds and Boston bounds shall belong to the town of Rocksbury, easterly of Charles River, (except the propriety of the aforesaid town, which they have purchased of particular persons,) Rocksbury not to extend above eight miles in length from their meeting-house.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-10\">\u201c The defendants\u2019 counsel contended that this was a grant in fee of all <em>\u2018 </em>the ground \u2019 described in it, and that the demanded premises were included in the description.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-11\">\u201c I have examined the terms used in this order, considered the usual modes of erecting towns and making grants of land to them, the unsettled state of the country, and the consequent want of accurate knowledge of local objects ; and am of opinion that a very liberal rule of construction should be adopted in relation to the grants and other public acts of that day. I am therefore of opinion and decide, that this order was a grant in fee of all the land described in it; that the description covers all the land lying between Dorchester and Boston, as the limits of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>the two towns then existed, which had not before been granted to Roxbury ; that inasmuch as every part of the territory granted lay easterly of some parts of Charles River, and southerly of other parts of said river, I cannot believe that the introduction of the words 1 easterly of Charles River,\u2019 if they apply to the granted new territory rather than the whole town, was intended to divide it, and to grant one part and reserve the other part of the territory, which was included in the general description of the whole. I am therefore of opinion and do decide, that the act of 1636, in the liberal and proper construction of the language used, operated as a grant, and vested in the then town of Roxbury the fee of the demanded premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-5\">\u201c This view of the case seems to me decisive of its merits, and but for the terms of the rule and the agreement of the parties I should not deem it necessary or proper to proceed any further in my report. But these expressly require <em>1 </em>the referee to report all questions of law arising in the cause to the court for their revision and final adjudication.\u2019 But I am directed to award and determine the whole cause, including the law and the facts, subject to the review and final adjudication of all matters of law in the cause by the whole court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-6\">\u201c Gratefully relieved by this provision, I proceed to report all the points raised by'the counsel on either side, without giving an opinion upon their materiality or relevancy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-7\">\u201c It was contended by the defendants\u2019 counsel, that the exclusion of the tide water from the empty basin, by virtue of the act incorporating the Boston and Roxbury Mill Corporation, passed June 14th 1814, and the subsequent acts of legislation touching that subject, vested in the adjoining owners all the land thus made bare, or at any rate operated as a relinquishment of all the rights of the Commonwealth, and barred it from making any claim to the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-8\"><em>\u201c </em>But I was of opinion and held, that neither the act of 1814, and the proceeding under it, nor any other acts of the government, divested the Commonwealth of any right or title which it had or might have to the premises in litigation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-9\">\u201c The defendants\u2019 counsel contended that the demanded prem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>ises, being admitted by the allegations in the information to be within the bounds of Roxbury, were, by virtue of the original settlement of the town and the act of 1836, necessarily the property of the town.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-5\">\u201c But as the premises might be within the jurisdictional limits of the town, and not its property, I was of opinion and held, that the allegation was not proof of title in Roxbury, nor did it preclude or estop the Commonwealth from setting up and maintaining any title it might have to the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-6\">\u201c The defendants\u2019 counsel further contended that the bounds between the two cities, agreed upon by Boston and Roxbury, in 1823, and afterwards, viz., in 1836, established and confirmed by the legislature, and from the time of said agreement till the commencement of this suit acquiesced in and recognized by every body, must be presumed and held to be the bounds established by the colonial act of 1636.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-7\">\u201c On this point I had doubts. But inasmuch as this line was agreed upon by parties who had no power to bind the Commonwealth, or in any way to affect its title, and inasmuch as the act of the Commonwealth in confirming and establishing this line may be supposed to look rather to jurisdictional bounds than to the title of the lands, and inasmuch as this was a conventional line, though intended to be based on the original line of 1636, yet avowedly departed from it in many particulars, I was of opinion and held, that though these several circumstances furnished strong evidence that the premises were included within the grant of 1636, yet they do not furnish conclusive evidence that such was the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-8\">\u201c The defendants\u2019 counsel also contended that the act of 1836, \u25a0chapter 37, by its true construction, not only establishes the jurisdictional bounds between Boston and Roxbury, but establishes the title to the land in question in Roxbury, so far at least as to preclude and estop the Commonwealth from setting up a claim to the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-9\">\u201c But I was of opinion, though it was strong evidence of the construction of the grant of 1636, which I have adopted, yet it was not of itself to establish a title in Roxbury, if they had none <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>before. But I held, that that establishment of this line was a valid substitution of' the conventional line for the original line, eo that if Roxbury established her title under the act of 1636 she will hold and recover up to this straight line instead of the original crooked line.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-5\"><em>\u201c </em>Much evidence was introduced to show possession in Rox bury, and acquiescence in all others. All the evidence on this point is fully reported, and will be herewith presented to the court for their consideration. In my opinion it did not prove that continuous and exclusive possession of the whole premises which is necessary to establish a title by disseisin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-6\">\u201c The defendants, in their answer, set up a claim to a right of drainage in the natural channels running through the demanded premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-7\">\u201c But I was of opinion and held, that this question did not properly arise, and could not be tried in this suit. I was also of opinion, no evidence was offered which could sustain the claim, even if it came properly before this reference.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-8\">\u201c All the evidence offered on either side was admitted, subject to the opinion of the whole court on its admissibility and relevancy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-9\">\u201c Having duly considered the whole case, and all the several grounds taken and urged by the counsel on both sides, and given my opinion on the same as before stated, do now report and decide and award, that the defendants have established their title to the fee of the demanded premises as described in the attorney general\u2019s information, and therefore that the Commonwealth take nothing by its information aforesaid, and the costs be taxed according to law.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-10\">The arbitrator returned with his award a list of the charters, laws and records, principally relied on at the hearing, and a full report of the evidence introduced before him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-11\">The maps used at the hearing were the following: <em>\u201c </em>The South Part of New England as it is Planted this yeare 1634,\u201d in Wood\u2019s New England Prospect, London 1634, copied in Young\u2019s Mass.

The information, as amended, sufficiently sets forth \u201c the title and claim of the Commonwealth,\u201d as required by the Rev. Sts. c. 108, \u00a7 1. It would seem that the title of, the Commonwealth is a fee by record and grant under the Plymouth Company, and not <em>jure corones </em>by the feudal prerogative title, which ascribes to the king all domain not shown to have been granted; and if this is so, an allegation of title and claim by prerogative could not be sustained.

But if the title of the seashore and <em>fundus mans </em>to the extent of the marine league can only be by prerogative, then the information shows the demanded premises to fall within it, both by the description, and by the averment that the title is in the Commonwealth under the Colony and Province Charters.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-9\">2.

It is settled by the decisions in England and in this commonwealth that the shores of the sea and the ground and soil of the coast belonged by prerogative to the king, and vested in the government of the Colony, Province and Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>London, </em>8 Beav. 270; 1 H.

The arbitrator\u2019s construction of the order of the general court of the Colony in 1636 was erroneous. If the words \u201c easterly of Charles River \u201d are to be treated as a boundary on the lower part of that river, which was an arm of the sea, they would be limited by the principles of law, before the ordinance of 1647, to high water mark. And the other two abuttals, <em>\u201c </em>Boston bounds \u201d and \u201c Dorchester bounds,\u201d must be presumed, until the contrary is shown, to be limited by the shore.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b481-8\">But the words <em>\u201c </em>easterly of Charles River \u201d must be referred, not to the arm of the sea called the Back Bay, (from which the premises granted lay southerly, not easterly,) but to that line of Charles River, which then formed the whole westerly boundary of Roxbury; Brookline (then Boston) extending to that part of the river on one side and Dorchester on the other side. Orders of 1633-1640 in Mass. Col. Rec.; <em>ante, </em>461-464, note. [See plan, <em>ante, </em>459.] Besides ; the grant of 1636 is obviously of land extending into the interior, according to the usual mode of enlarging grants at that period. 1 Mass. Col. Rec. 166,168, 176 ; <em>ante, </em>461, 462, 463, note. The coast had been previously</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>granted to Roxbury, and the bounds there defined. 1 Mass. Col. Rec. 103, 159; <em>ante, </em>461, note.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-5\">If the grant was not limited by the shore, but extended over the bottom of the sea, it must extend as far seaward as its abuttals, Boston bounds and Dorchester bounds, of the extent of which the defendants produce no proof. But the Boston line is shown to have stopped originally with the shore by a long series of legislative acts granting liberties to Boston, and leave to littoral proprietors to extend wharves. If this grant was of the <em>fundus marts </em>in 1636, then the ordinance of 1647 had no application to the shore of Roxbury, and the rights of littoral proprietors under grants from that town may not have the common construction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-6\">6. The acts of the town of Roxbury, as shown by its records \u25a0and the perambulations of its officers, made many years after \u25a0the alleged grant, and the agreements between the town of Roxbury and individuals, are inadmissible to disprove the title of the \u2018Commonwealth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-7\">.7. The acts of the legislature, incorporating the Boston and .Roxbury Mill Corporation, and excluding the tide water from \u2022the empty basin, and inclosing it in the full basin, gave no title to Roxbury. And there is no principle upon which they \u25a0 can be deemed an abandonment of the title in the soil to the littoral proprietors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-8\">\u25a08. The agreement of 1823 between Boston and Roxbury, for .straightening their boundary line, upon its face had reference to municipal jurisdiction only, and depended on legislative sanction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-9\">9. So the petition to the legislature in 1836 relates only to \u25a0straightening the lines \u201cdividing the territory of said city from the territory of said town.\u201d The <em>St. </em>of 1836, <em>c. </em>37, passed upon this petition, copies from this agreement the word \u201c territory,\u201d and adds the word \u201cjurisdiction \u201d to make the meaning certain. <em>Ante, </em>468. The word \u201c territory,\u201d as used in establishing boundary lines between towns or counties, means jurisdiction, not title. Prov. St. 13 <em>G. </em>3, (1773,) Anc.

The acts relied on to prove disseisin were transitory and not in continuous years, and covered but a small part of the territory; and were inadmissible to prove a disseisin. <em>Slater </em>v. <em>Jepherson, </em>6 Cush. 129. This is a question of fact, and has been disposed of as such by the arbitrator. And before the Rev. Sts. c. 119, \u00a7 12, the Commonwealth could not be disseised, and twenty years had not elapsed since that before this information was filed. See also <em>St. </em>1852, <em>c. </em>253.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-5\">11. The defendants\u2019 specification of the right of drainage is a special disclaimer, and thus of itself a waiver of the general issue, and an admission of the plaintiff\u2019s title. Jackson on Real Actions, 100, 101. The <em>St. </em>of 1852, c. 312, does not affect the form of proceeding upon informations on the Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>108. Dwarris on Sts. (2d ed.) 523. Under any system of pleading, such easement, if it exists, is no defence to a recovery by the Commonwealth of both fee and possession, subject to it; but leaves the protection of such easement, if interfered with, to action on the case or bill in equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-6\">If this right ever existed, it was cut off by building the mill-dam, under statutes which provided an indemnity. <em>Boston &amp; Roxbury Mill Corporation </em>v.

The information does not set forth the title of the Commonwealth to the premises claimed as is required by the Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>108, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2. This defect is substantial, and is not cured by the pleadings. <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>London, </em>2 Macn. &amp; Gord. 247. The Commonwealth cannot under this information set up a prerogative title to the premises.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-9\">2. The premises claimed and described, being, as alleged in the information, within the bounds of Roxbury, were acquired in fee by the original town of Roxbury, by settlement in 1630, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>and subsequent grant of town bounds; it appearing that Roxbury has always owned, in its corporate capacity, all the lands within its bounds, not belonging to individuals.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-5\">3. The arbitrator having decided, as matter of law, (which was also expressly admitted by the counsel for the Commonwealth at the hearing before the arbitrator, and is therefore not subject to review,) that the act of 1636 was a grant in fee of all the land described in it; and the arbitrator having also found by the evidence and view, and decided, as matter of fact, that the demanded premises were embraced within the descriptive bounds of that grant; the award is decisive of the case, and conclusive upon the parties, under the submission. See submission and award, ante, 454, 455, 456.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-6\">4. By the common law of Massachusetts, the Commonwealth has jurisdiction and dominion of the seashore and the land where the tide ebbs and flows below one hundred rods from high water mark, for public uses only; but does not own and has no exclusive right to the soil as private property.

If the lands in question belonged to the government, the special grant of the Colony Government of 1636 was upon its face a grant of the soil. That grant, so far as it is ambiguous, is to be construed against the grantor, and conveyed to Roxbury the demanded premises in fee; and they have always since been claimed, held and occupied by the town or its grantees, claiming a title in fee to the same. <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>4 Mass. 144. <em>Saltonstall </em>v. <em>Long Wharf, </em>7 Cush. 195. <em>Lapish </em>v. <em>Bangor Bank, </em>8 Greenl. 85. <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>3 Sumner, 170. <em>Handly </em>v. <em>Anthony, </em>5 Wheat. 374. <em>McCullock </em>v. <em>Aten, </em>2 Ohio, 309 <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Forbes, 2 </em>Dev. 30. <em>Stinson </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>4 Blackf. 285 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number><em>Felder </em>v. <em>Bonnett, 2 </em>M\u2019Mullan, 44. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Janney, </em>8 W. &amp; S. 436. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garner, </em>3 Grat. 655.

The <em>St. </em>of 1814, <em>c. </em>39, incorporating the Boston and Rox bury Mill Corporation, authorizing the effectual exclusion of tide water from the empty basin and the actual exclusion thereof by the milldam for nearly forty years, now made perpetual by the agreements of the Commonwealth; and the subsequent acts of -the legislature relative to said corporation and the Boston Water Power Company and the lands in said basin; all recognizing private rights in said lands, but neither claiming nor reserving any public rights \u2014when construed by the uniform usage of the Commonwealth in granting wharf acts, must be held to have relinquished any public rights in the premises to the owners of the adjoining lands, so that the Commonwealth cannot now set up any title to the premises claimed in this information. <em>Bowman </em>v. <em>Wathen, 2 </em>McLean, 376.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-8\">8. The bounds of Boston and Roxbury, as run out and established by the agreement of 1823, as the bounds according to the grant of 1636, having been fairly run out as soon as practicable, after the tide was excluded from the empty basin, and been assented to by the legislature, and recognized, acquiesced in and acted on, from that time to the present, must now be taken as the true bounds of the grant of 1636. <em>Kellogg </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>7 Cush. 375. <em>M\u2019Nairy </em>v. <em>Hightour, 2 </em>Overton, 304. <em>Newsom </em>v. <em>Pryor, </em>7 Wheat. 7. <em>Lerned </em>v. <em>Morrill, 2 </em>N.

The <em>St. </em>of 1836, <em>c. </em>37, authoritatively established the line so run out as the line and boundary of the grant of 1636; so that Roxbury has a clear right, under this act of the legislature, to hold, as against the Commonwealth, the territory, as wefi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>as the jurisdiction, up to that line, as the true line and boundary of the grant of 1636. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gratiot, </em>14 Pet. 562.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-5\">10. The evidence of possession, on the part of Roxbury, shows a title to the premises in question by disseisin and possession ; or if not, it shows a title in Roxbury under the act of 1636, and according to the bounds run out in 1823 and confirmed in 1836, and also under the deed from Sears in 1832.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-6\">11. However the question of title to the soil in the premises may be decided, the defendants have the right of drainage through the natural channels thereof, as set forth and claimed in their answer.

By this term we understand, in its application to a case like the present, where the tide ebbs more than one hundred rods from the line of ordinary high water, that line over and along the flats, over which the tide ordinarily ebbs and flows, at a distance of one hundred rods or sixteen hundred and fifty feet from the adjoining upland. We understand therefore, that, whatever were the terms of the information before its amendments, as it now stands, the Commonwealth makes no claim to any land in the full basin, nor to any land in the empty basin, nearer to the original line of ordinary high water mark than one hundred rods, being the ordinary line of high water mark, before the exclusion of the tide water, in its natural ebb and flow.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Again ; in regard to the right of drainage, which the respondents have put forward prominently in their answer; unquestionably such owners of lands in Roxbury, whether the municipal corporation, or individual proprietors of such lands as have and enjoy a right of drainage into and through the natural watercourses emptying into these channels and through them into the sea, have a right to the continued use and enjoyment of such watercourses, whether the soil, upon and over which they pass, be owned by the Commonwealth or by municipal corporations or individuals; and no question respecting them arises in the present case, which raises the question of title only</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>And further, the learned arbitrator has stated in his report, that all evidence offered on either side, whether objected to or not, was admitted by him, subject to the opinion of the whole court in regard to its competency, under this reservation, that if any part of the evidence is found to be incompetent, all facts, which such evidence would conduce to prove, and which are not proved otherwise, must be laid out of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">I. We come now to the consideration of the questions raised upon the report of the arbitrator; and by far the most important is that first stated. It thus appears in the report:</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\u201c The counsel for the Commonwealth contended that the title to the demanded premises, on the first settlement of the country, was vested in the Colony, and thence by the acts of the several governments passed through the Province to the Commonwealth. This proposition I adopted, and held, that the fee still remained in the Commonwealth, unless its government, or that of one of its predecessors, had aliened it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">In this position we entirely concur; and before going further, it may be useful to add some authorities to corroborate it, and to suggest a qualification, proper to be considered, in its application to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">At the time of the settlement of Massachusetts and the other English colonies in America, the only source of title to the vacant and unsettled lands of this portion of the continent, claimed by the crown of England by right of discovery, was a grant from the king. It was not merely the only source of legal title to the soil, but the only source of authority for exercising limited powers of government, in and over the lands thus granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">The theory universally adopted, acted upon, and sanctioned by a long course of judicial decisions of the highest authority, was, that the Indians found upon this continent had no legal title to the soil, as that term was understood at the common law and among civilized nations, no fee in the land, but only a temporary right of occupancy, for which it was pertiaps equitable to make them some allowance. The fee was considered to be in the sovereign, by whose subjects it was dis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>covered, and in whose name it was taken possession of. Under this role, this part of North America was claimed and held by the king of England. This jurisdiction extended to all tide waters, included in said territory, in the same manner as in those held by the crown within the realm of England, subject to the public use, according to the rules of the common law. But as it was held that the king, by virtue of his prerogative, had authority to create and grant political powers, necessary to the government of these new countries, it was held, that, where charters were granted to organized bodies with power of governing the colonies to be settled, like that of Charles I. to the Governor and Company of Massachusetts, they conveyed the prerogative powers of the crown, and as such included the arms of the sea, and all tide waters, to be held, like those of the crown, in trust for the public. The grantees thereby became invested with the ordinary right of property in lands for cultivation and settlement, and the extraordinary right of government, subject only to their allegiance and subordination to the parent government, including herein a power over all sea shores and tide waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Instead of resorting anew to the original charters, we wiL state what this court held to be the result and legal effect of them, in a recent case which was much discussed, and was decided after much consideration. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Alger, 7 Cush. 65, 66. The court there say: \u201c The charter under which the Colony was formed and settled \u2014 first, that of James I. to the Plymouth Company, and subsequently that of Charles I. in 1628, reciting an assignment of part of the territory formerly granted to the Plymouth Company, by that company, being, all that part of said territory, [described,] which afterwards constituted the Colony of Massachusetts, to Sir Henry Roswell and his associates \u2014 did proceed to grant and confirm to Sir Henry Roswell and his associates all the said lands described, and every part and parcel thereof, and all the islands, rivers, ports, havens, waters, fishings, fishes, mines, minerals, jurisdictions, franchises, royalties, liberties, privileges, commodities and premises whatsoever, with the appurtenances. This charter was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>merely a grant of property within the realm of England, but it contained provisions for the establishment of a separate dependent government under the allegiance of the king ; and the government thereby constituted was invested with all the civil and political powers to enable it to establish and govern the Colony, and to make laws for that purpose, not repugnant to-the laws of England.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">We may add here, in explanation, that the Charter provided for the organization of the Company, by the appointment of a governor, deputy governor, and eighteen assistants, to be chosen by the freemen of the Company, after the first appointment made by the Charter itself. The governor, deputy governor, assistants and freemen, were authorized to admit freemen, to elect officers for the ordering of- their affairs, and to make laws and ordinances, for the good and welfare of said company, and for the government and ordering, disposition and management of the said lands and plantation, and the people inhabiting and to inhabit the same, as to them from time to time should be thought meet, not repugnant to the laws of England. Anc. Chart. 8, 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">It is probable, as it has been suggested, that the Charter was intended to create and establish a trading corporation, to meet and act in England, with large powers to manage a planting and trading colony. But there being no restriction upon their meeting and acting anywhere within the king\u2019s dominions; in about two years, the Company, by advice of counsel, determined to remove to Massachusetts ; and in 1630 the governor, deputy governor, and many of the assistants and freemen, came to Massachusetts, bringing the Charter with them. From that time all meetings were held in the Colony. For a few of the first years, and whilst the plantations and settlements were few, meetings were attended according to the Charter, by all such freemen as chose to attend; but, as early as 1634, it was provided that the freemen of each- plantation might choose two or three before every general court, who should have the full voices of all the freemen to act with the governor and assistants in making laws, granting lands, &amp;c., and other affairs, excepting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>elections. 1 Mass. Col. Rec. 118. Here, then, was the origin of a representative government, probably not contemplated by the Charter, but perhaps not wholly inconsistent with it, because, if all freemen had a right to act, those delegated, being freemen, had that right; if repugnant at all to the Charter, it was in excluding those not appointed delegates.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In 1644, ten years later, a still more decisive step was taken. It was probably found that the delegates quite outnumbered the governor and assistants, and would of course outvote them, acting in one body. Divers inconveniences having been found in this mode of proceeding, and accounting it wisdom to follow the laudable practice of other states, it was ordered that henceforth the two bodies shall sit and act apart, in separate bodies, each having the initiative in proposing laws and measures, and each having a negative on the other, so that no act could pass without the concurrence of both bodies. 2 Mass. Col. Rec. 58. In this we perceive the complete establishment of a representative government, with a distribution and balance of powers. Whether this was perfectly consistent with the Charter or not, it was acquiesced in, acted on, and afterwards confirmed by the Province Charter. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charlestown, </em>1 Pick. 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Most of the English colonies had a similar origin in the charter of the sovereign, which granted not only the title to the soil, but the powers of government, and, as incident thereto, the right of the sovereign over the sea shores, and those powers denominated <em>regalia. </em>The nature and extent of these grants, both of property and powers, have been held to be regulated by the common law of England, which the English emigrants claimed as their birthright, and brought with them. This introduced and established the common law of England, as regulating the relative rights of the government and people in this country to the sea and sea shores. The effect of this charter was, to grant to the Governor and Company, as a body, the <em>jura regalia </em>or prerogative rights of the crown, to be held for the Colony, as the crown held them for the realm of England; and also the ordinary right of property in the soil, to be held and granted on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>liberal tenure of free and common socage, as private rights in real estate are held at common law. <em>Martin </em>v. Waddell, 16 Pet. 367, The same rule, substantially, was established in all the colonial governments, the authorities for which, we think, are too numerous and uniform to require citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">There is another subject which we think it necessary to con sider, before proceeding to the next point in the report of th arbitrator. We had considered it settled beyond controversy that, by the common law of England, the right of soil, not only in the sea, the <em>fundus maris, </em>was in the king, but also in the sea shore, the land between high and low water mark; and that <em>prima facie </em>the land of all private proprietors, towards the sea shore, and upon bays, arms of the sea, creeks and coves, where the sea ebbs and flows, was bounded by high water mark; but it having been intimated at the argument that some new views had <em>recently </em>been advanced on this subject in England, we were led to look at the authorities cited. The law in this commonwealth seemed to be settled by the case already cited, of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Alger, 7 Cush. 65. There it is declared that by the common law of England, as it stood long before the settlement of this country, the title to flats was in the king, that it was so held by him in trust for public uses. This rule, apparently so well settled and established both in England and this country, seems to us not to have been shaken or doubted in any recent English case, though some bold speculations may have been advanced by ingenious counsel in argument, or by acute essay writers in the law periodicals.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">In the case alluded to of the <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>City of London, </em>reported in its several stages in various books, but finally decided by Lord Chancellor Cottenham in January 1850, this ground of the right of the <em>crown </em>seems to have been assumed on all sides, as the settled law of the land, and the matters of controversy turned on other points. It is so distinctly stated by Lord Langdale, Master of the Rolls, in 12 Beav. 26. See also <em>In re Hull &amp; Selby Railway, </em>5 M. &amp; W. 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">In the case of <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Chambers, </em>4 De Gex, Macn. &amp; Gord 206, decided by Lord Chancellor Cranworth, assisted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>by Baron Alderson and Mr. Justice Maul\u00e9, it was also assumed on all hands, that the limit of the proprietorship, in lands bordering on the sea shore, between the king on the sea side, and the private owner on the land side, was the line of high water mark; and the question elaborately discussed was, where precisely that line should be drawn. These distinguished judges, we believe for the first time, declared the rule of law, and defined that line to be, the medium line between the ordinary line of high water in ordinary spring tides at the full and change of the moon, and the ordinary line of high water at neap tides, at about midway in time between the full and change of the moon.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Without citing other authorities, we think these modern cases show that in whatever other respects the law may have been modified, the ancient rule, on the point stated, has not been changed, and therefore we assume the doctrine to be, as stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Alger, and confirmed by the cases there cited, that at the time of the granting of the colony charters herein before stated, the king held the sea shores as well as the land under the sea; that he held the same <em>publici juris </em>for the use and benefit of all the subjects, for all useful purposes, the principal of which were navigation and the fisheries.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Taking this proposition, in connection with the proposition already stated, that the king had full power, in these unsettled parts of bis dominion, out of the realm of England, to grant a title to the land for purposes of settlement, and such powers of government as might be necessary; and that a charter was granted, vesting the right of soil in the grantees, with very large powers of government, including all necessary to the control and management of all public interests, of navigation and fisheries, and of the sea shore and navigable waters; the effect of this charter was, to grant to the company both the <em>jus privatum </em>and the <em>jus publicum </em>of the crown; the <em>jus </em>privatum, or title to the land, to be held in fee, parcelled out to corporations and individuals, to be held in fee, subject to the rules of the common law, as private property; and the <em>jus </em>publicum, or all those rights of the crown in the sea, sea shore, bays and arms of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>sea, where the tide ebbs and flows, in trust for public use of all those who should become inhabitants of said territory and sub jects of said government.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">We proceed now to the next and most essential part of thi award. The referee having come to the conclusion that. th right of property in these flats is in the Commonwealth, urdes it or its predecessors have aliened it, proceeds to state the in traduction by the. defendant\u2019s counsel of an act of the genera court of the Colony of Massachusetts, passed May 25th 1636, their claim under it, and the referee\u2019s opinion thereon, closing thus: \u201c I am therefore of opinion and do decide, that the act of 1636, in the liberal and proper construction of the language used, operated as a grant, and vested in the then town of Eoxbury the fee of the demanded premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">In order rightly to weigh and estimate the legality of the conclusion, to which the arbitrator thus came, in putting a construction upon the ancient grant thus mentioned, several things must be taken into consideration, and in this connection dates are important; also what was the actual condition of the Colony at the time when the supposed grant to the town of Eoxbury was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">1. We are to inquire how grants of land were first made and set off to the parties interested, and how actual settlements were first made.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">At one of the earliest meetings after the Charter, held in London, before the Company had thought of removing, a question naturally arose, how the adventurers should be reimbursed for their costs and charges, and to this end it was debated how some good course might be settled for the division of the lands. In the spring of 1629 a plan was agreed upon, for distributing the lands in the proportion of two hundred acres for every fifty pounds subscribed, and so in proportion; and fifty acres for each servant sent over. A special government, subordinate to that of the governor and company, was appointed, to reside in Massachusetts, consisting of thirteen persons, to be called the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Governor and Council of London\u2019s Plantation in the Massachusetts Bay in New England; and this subordinate government, of whom Governor Endicott, then gone to New England, was to be the head, was authorized and required to make dividend of lands to those entitled, and if such allotments were not made within ten days after the settler\u2019s arrival, demand being duly made, the settler was allowed to take up his allotment upon any lands, not already appropriated. 1 Mass. Col. Rec. 42, 361-365. About the same time, for enlarging their pecuniary means, provision was made for creating a new stock, with a like right to an allotment of land. 1 Mass. Col. Rec. 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">In consequence of these arrangements, when Governor Winthrop and the body of assistants and freemen came over with the Charter in 1630, a considerable number of allotments and grants of land had been made by the local government, and several settlements or plantations had been then formed. The settlers, in selecting their allotments, would naturally take up the lands in considerable numbers near each other, for their better mutual security against the dreaded enemy, the Indians. The terms \u201cplantation,\u201d \u201ctown,\u201d and \u201ctownship\u201d seem to be used almost indiscriminately to indicate a cluster or body of persons inhabiting near each other; and when they became designated by a name, certain powers were conferred upon them by general orders and laws, such as to manage their own prudential concerns, to elect deputies and the like, which in effect made them municipal corporations ; and no formal acts of incorporation were granted till long afterwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">At the second meeting in the Colony, at Charlestown, on the 7th of September 1630, the following order was passed : <em>\u201c </em>It is ordered that. Trimountain shall be called Boston; Mattapan, Dorchester; and the town upon Charles River, Watertown.\u201d 1 Mass. Col. Rec. 75. We doubt whether these places bad any formal act of incorporation during the existence of the Colony, or any other recognition by the government of a corporate existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">At the last meeting of the governor and assistants at Charles-town, before removing to Boston, on the 28th of Sept\u00e9mber <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>1630, an order passed indicating the several plantations townships then existing, and their relative importance, by rate assessed on them as follows, to raise \u00bf650:</p>\n<p id=\"A1m\">Charlestown . .\u00bf6 7</p>\n<p id=\"AJC-\">Boston .... 11</p>\n<p id=\"ABLM\">Dorchester . 7</p>\n<p id=\"AAU\">Roxbury .... ... 5</p>\n<p id=\"AnE\">Watertown . 11</p>\n<p id=\"Ahy\">Medford .... 3</p>\n<p id=\"AWo\">Salem .... . 3</p>\n<p id=\"Ay9D\">Wessaguscus [Weymouth] . . . <em>2</em></p>\n<p id=\"AGT\">Nantasket . 1</p>\n<p id=\"A9xv\">\u00bf650</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">We think no essential change in this respect took place till long after 1636, the date of the grant to Roxbury. Lands were allotted and assigned to settlers in severalty, and settlements Were formed without any previous survey of the territory; and towns, as settlements, were taxed, and vested by general acts with powers, which in effect made them corporations, but without bounds or limits. And the ancient records are full of orders, providing for the establishing of bounds between one town and another.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\"><em>2. </em>Another important consideration in putting a construction upon this grant is, that it was, in time, several years before the act usually known as the colony ordinance of 1641, though probably passed in 1647, by which \u201cit is declared, that in all creeks, coves and other places about and upon salt water where the sea ebbs and flows, the proprietor or the land adjoining shall have propriety to the low water mark, where the sea doth not ebb above one hundred rods, and not more wheresoever it ebbs further.\u201d Anc. Chart. 148. For a full statement of the character and effect of this act, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alger, </em>7 Cush. 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Under these views we come to consider the grant by the Colony in 1636, and ascertain its effect and operation. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>form of this act is as follows : \u201c Ordered, that all the rest of the ground lyeing betwixt Dorchester bounds, and Boston bounds, shall belonge to the towne of Rocksbury, easterly of Charles Ryver (except the propriety of the aforesaid town which they purchased of particular persons) Rocksbury not t\u00f3 extend above eight myles in length from their meeting howse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Supposing this to be a grant of property in land, by the Company, represented by the colonial government, then meeting and acting within the Colony of Massachusetts Bay, and having superseded the subordinate and temporary government of which Governor Endicott was the head, which had previously been authorized to appropriate and grant lands, the question is, what was the subject matter, what estate passed by this grant. When the boundaries, monuments and local objects, constituting the descriptive part of a grant, be it deed or record, are fixed by the evidence as matters of fact, the construction of such deed, its effect and operation, is a question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">These boundaries, abuttals and monuments \u00e1re fully set forth, in the report, by reference to the acts and records, many of which are specified and enumerated in the report and others are generally referred to. The first named is \u201c Dorchester bounds,\u201d that is, the bounds between Dorchester and the plantation or settlement called Roxbury, which the language of the order implies had been previously settled. Committees had been appointed, and surveys directed for that purpose ; it might be, and no doubt was, corrected afterwards. But it was assumed to be settled, and sufficiently accurate to stand as a boundary. It appears by the description and plans, that it was a line, extending up from Boston Harbor, between Boston proper and Dorchester Point, now South Boston, through what is now called the South Bay, and then run in a line designated, in a westerly direction, to the bounds of Dedham at Charles River.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The boundary expressed on the other side, being the northerly or northwesterly side, is \u201c Boston bounds.\u201d By this term, it is manifest, was intended the line of a tract of land at Muddy River, now Brookline, which was assigned to the inhabitants of Boston as an enlargement of their limited territory. Its well</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>established bounds, northerly and westerly, were Cambridge (now Brighton) and Newton. This settlement at Muddy River, at the time of the grant in question, was regarded and designated as part of Boston, and so remained half a century after-wards. In 1686, by an order of the president and council, the chartered government being then superseded, the inhabitants of Muddy River, then called a hamlet of Boston, were exempted from town rates to the town of Boston; they maintaining theii own highways, poor and other public charges, arising amongst themselves, and annually meeting and choosing three men to manage their affairs<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In 1705, after the establishment of the provincial government, they were granted the powers and privileges of a township, to be called Brooklyn, provided that all common lands belonging to Boston'should still remain to the proprietors of said lands. <em>[Ante, </em>465, note.] At the time of this grant, therefore, \u201c Boston Bounds,\u201d expressed in it, was the dividing line between Roxbury and the settlement at Muddy River, and nearly coincided with the present dividing line between Roxbury and Brookline, a line that formerly extended to Charles River, which was the easterly line of Dedham. It appears then by referring to the boundaries of the adjoining towns, and to the surveys and plans, that a part of Charles River, forming the easterly line of Dedham, is so situated that a line protracted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>a westerly or southwesterly direction would strike it, and that the bounds of Dorchester, on the southerly side, did strike it.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Here are then two side lines, as well defined as the nature of surveying at that time admitted, and both in fact extending - from the seaboard to the interior, towards Charles River. We are then to look\"for the residue of the description, \u201c all the rest of the ground lying betwixt Dorchester bounds and Boston bounds, easterly of Charles River, Roxbury not to extend above eight miles in length from their meeting-house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">At that period, it was a common practice, in establi ihing the bounds of the front range of towns on the seaboard, to extend them eight miles into the interior. In 1*635-6 it was ordered that Charlestown bounds shall run eight miles into the country, from their meeting-house, if no other bounds intercept. 1 Mass. Col. Rec. 168. So Watertown is to run till it be eight miles from their meeting-house. 1 Mass. Col. Rec. 257. Other instances might be named.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">When, having fixed side lines, which if protracted would extend to Charles River, the grant says \u201c all the rest of the ground, lying betwixte \u201d those two lines, <em>\u201c </em>easterly of Charles River; \u201d if unlimited, it would obviously make that part of Charles River the westerly boundary. But the grant was not unlimited ; it was qualified by the limitation, that it should not extend above eight miles from the meeting-house. The distance was probably unknown, it might be six or seven, or perhaps nine or ten miles. A specific limit was therefore inserted in terms. The word \u201c rest \u201d. or residue <em>\u201c </em>of the ground,\u201d &amp;c., implies that part of the land, then known as the town or plantation of Roxbury, perhaps a large part, had been previously taken up by settlers entitled, oi granted out by the provisional government under Endicott. The lands thus granted and settled would naturally be those near the seaboard, and the village be formed so that the lands in the interior would be those remaining longest ungranted and unsettled. Indeed there was an order of the government, previous to this grant, that no dwelling-house should be built above half a mile from the meeting-house in any new plantation, without leave from the court. 1 Mass. Col. Rec. 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>It appears to us therefore, that this last clause describes, in an alternative form, the westerly line of the intended grant, and that it embraced all the remaining interest of the government in the ungranted and unsettled lands, in remoter parts of the plantation lying between the two fixed lines described, and extending westwardly to Charles River, if it should be found not to exceed eight miles from the meeting-house, and, if it should exceed eight miles, then by a straight line drawn across from one of those to the other at the distance of eight miles.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">This construction gives effect to all the words of the grant; but upon any other view, if the term \u201c Charles River \u201d as used in the grant, does not mean that part of Charles River lying next to Dedham, and used in the alternative as one of the bounds of the grant, then the grant has no westerly bound whatever. A circumstance which confirms this construction is this: It was testified on the trial that from the meeting-house, which, it is agreed, stood where the present meeting-house now stands, the distance was between seven and eight miles, that is, less than eight miles. And by a subsequent colonial order, in 1638, it was directed \u201c that the town of Roxbury shall have four thousand acres of land, where it may be laid out without prejudice to any plantation or former grants, because Dedham doth shorten them,\u201d 1 Mass. Col. Rec. 220. This indicates that Roxbury did not get its full eight miles, and therefore Charles River, being the line of Dedham, did in fact constitute the westerly boundary of this grant, by that branch of the alternative which makes Charles River, if within eight miles, the boundary.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Suppose this colonial act then to be a grant, with well defined boundaries on three sides, but no expressed boundary on a fourth side; a deed is not to be held void for uncertainty because the boundaries are not fully expressed, when by reasonable intendment it can be ascertained what was considered and understood by both parties to be embraced, and intended to be embraced in the description. The obvious and legal course, we think, is to lay down a plan on the land, according to ascertained boundaries, abuttals and monuments, on these three sides, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>and thus see where the fourth would come; if it terminate on the sea or salt water, on a highway or public common, or on a well established line of private property, such deficient line will be supplied by necessary intendment, and the instrument be read as if it were so expressed. This rule is essential, and has been constantly adopted in the legal construction of the brief and inartificial grants, deeds and other forms of conveyance, in use at the early period when this colonial grant was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">But the result, it appears to us, would not have been different, if we are mistaken in supposing that by the name \u201c Charles River,\u201d as expressed in the ordinance, was intended that part of Charles River at the interior and most remote part of the granted territory; and that by the term \u201c Charles River \u201d was intended what is now known as the Back Bay, being a widening or enlargement of Charles River, and intended to be the eastern or northeastern boundary of the grant. This bay was then, still is in part, though affected by the Milldam, an arm of the sea, in which- the tide ebbs and flows; and the law, as it then stood, earned the public right in the sea and sea shores to the ordinary high water line of the flow of the tide ; and as, in the case supposed, the river was the boundary of the grant, and high water mark the limit of private ownership, the flats in question could not be included in or pass by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">But even if the colonial act in question had been passed after the ordinance of 1641, extending a qualified right of the soil of riparian owners, to the extent of an hundred rods, and the grant had been bounded, in express terms, or by necessary intendment, on the sea, it would have carried the right of the grantee to one hundred rods only below the ordinary high water line, and would not have included the flats in question, which are beyond one hundred rods.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">We lay no great stress on the use of the word \u201c ground \u201d instead of land; though by the term \u201c rest of the ground,\u201d where lands had been granted for cultivation and settlement, it could be hardly contended that land flowed by tide water was intended, without some context or qualifying word of description indicating such an intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>3. But it is argued and insisted in behalf of the defendants, that as the colonial government was at the time of the grant vested with the right of ownership in the soil, and also, as an incident thereto, with the right of government, with a prerogative right and interest in the soil of the sea, sea shores and arms of the sea, the government of the Colony had power to grant an interest in flats, as well as in upland; and the bounds of this grant being indefinite towards the tide water in the Back Bay or Charles River, the deed is to be taken most strongly against the grantors, and it must be presumed that they intended, when not limited in terms, to convey all which they had the power to convey.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">But, we think the argument does not apply. In the first place, the ordinary technical rule of presumption, that words are to be taken most strongly against the grantor, has no application. The colonial government stood in two relations to its subjects : first, as owners of the land, to be granted to settlers and purchasers, to be held in severalty in fee; and secondly, as incident to the powers of government, they held a prerogative right to the sea and sea shores, in a fiduciary relation, for the public use. As a general rule, in all grants from the government to the subject, the terms of the grant are to be taken most strongly against the grantee, and in favor of the grantor \u2014 reversing the common rule as between individuals \u2014 on the ground that the grant is supposed to be made at the solicitation of the grantee, and the form and terms of the particular instrument of grant prepared by him, and submitted to the government for its allowance. But this rule applies <em>a fortiori </em>to a case where such grant by a government to individual proprietors is claimed to be not merely a conveyance of title to land, but also of a portion of that public domain, which the government held in a fiduciary relation, for general and public use. This rule, with its necessary qualifications, is well stated in the opinion of Mr. Chief Justice Taney in <em>Martin </em>v. Waddell, 16 Pet. 411. That case is of the highest authority and directly in point as to the application of the legal maxim.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">But secondly, where a body like the colonial government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>holds two distinct powers, one for granting and distributing lands to parties entitled, for settlement in perpetuity, and of which power it is in the habitual and constant exercise, as one of the ordinary and prominent purposes of its establishment and at the same time has a fiduciary interest and authority over the public domain; the grant, whilst it conveys the land embraced in it, will not be held to include any portion of such public right, unless it is included in its terms, by express words or necessary implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">In the construction of a grant, the court will take into consideration the circumstances attending the transaction, the situation of the parties, the state of the country, and of the thing granted, at the time, in order to ascertain the intent of the parties. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Frothingham, </em>3 Mass. 352. In that case, a grant from the town of Newbury to Noyes in 1680, on an arm of the sea, indefinite in its direction towards the channel, was held to intend a conveyance to low water mark, being within one hundred rods, because the ordinance of 1641 bad then so extended the right of the town to the upland owners, as to make the flats to that extent their private property.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">So in other states, where the same rule of the common law existed, it was held that by the king\u2019s charter the' right of property vested in the colony, and as superadded thereto, the right of government, and, as incident to this, the <em>jus publicum </em>over sea shores and tide waters; but where no such law as the Colony ordinance of Massachusetts of 1641 was ever adopted, it has been decided that a grant of lands lying on the sea shore or an arm of the sea will not convey land beyond high water mark. As where the government of Connecticut in 1685 confirmed to proprietors, who had purchased of the Indians, lands including an arm of the sea, and with all ports, rivers, &amp;c., it was held not to be a grant of the soil between high and low water mark. <em>East Haven </em>v. <em>Hemingway, </em>7 Conn. 186. <em>Middletown </em>v. <em>Sage, </em>8 Conn. 221. In New York it has been decided, that no exclusive right, adverse to that of the sovereign and public right, in the soil of the shore below high water mark, can be acquired by a town, by the operation of an act of the legislature, extend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>ing the limits of such town over such waters. Such act may give jurisdiction, but no right of property in the soil. <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>6 Johns. 133. Similar decisions are to be found in some of the other maritime states.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The distinction, above alluded to, between the right of prop erty and the right of jurisdiction, in the towns in this common wealth, is of great importance. Counties are composed of towns. And for many purposes, the body of the county extends not only over the shores of the sea, but to some distance below the ebb of the tide, for many purposes of civil and criminal proceedings, and for certain purposes of jurisdiction ; and, for the like purposes, towns may be considered as having a coextensive jurisdiction; but this has no bearing upon the question of property. An act of incorporation therefore, without- words of grant of the soil, would vest no part of the property of the government in such town. Nor was the purpose of the organization of such a nature, as would require of the government any portion of the public right vested in them for public use and benefit, therefore no portion of the <em>jus publicum </em>will be presumed to have been granted, without express words. On the contrary, it was held in an early case in Massachusetts, that towns, in virtue of their authority to lay out town ways, cannot exercise that jurisdiction over lands between high water and low water mark, although plainly within their territorial limits and jurisdiction, and that a town had no authority by its surveyors to enter on flats to abate a nuisance. <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>1 Mass. 231. Courts of sessions and county commissioners, under a general authority to lay out highways, cannot lay them over tide waters, without special authority from the legislature. This, we think, is founded on, and affirms the principle, that an authority granted by the government to take land for highways, general in its terms, will not be construed to authorize like powers to be exercised over flats formed by navigable waters, unless such power appear by express words or necessary implication. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coombs, </em>2 Mass. 489. <em>Arundel </em>v. <em>McCulloch, </em>10 Mass. 70. The legislature alone have that power. <em>Charlestown </em>v. <em>County Commissioners, </em>3 Met. 202. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number><em>Kean </em>v. Stetson, 5 Pick. 492. <em>Marblehead </em>v. <em>County Commissioners, </em>5 Gray, 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">But it appears, that as early as the grant in question, and before the ordinance of 1641, declaring the right of all persons bordering upon tide water, to have a qualified and limited right of flats, the Colony government, when they intended to grant a right of flats, did it in express terms. By an order passed in March 1636, Noddle\u2019s Island was granted to Boston, in. the briefest possible terms, without limit or qualification. 1 Mass. Col. Rec. 189. At a meeting of the governor, assistants and a large number of deputies, in May 1640, this order was passed: \u201c It is declared that the flats round about Noddle\u2019s Island do belong' to Noddle\u2019s Island, to the ordinary low water mark.\u201d 1 Mass. Col. Rec. 291. By the grant of the island, without qualification, the whole island passed. Under the ordinary maxim that words are to be construed most strongly against the grantor, and the presumption that all passed which the grantor could convey, the flats would have passed by the first act. But the second order shows, that it was not so understood by the parties ; and in order to give title to the flats, the second grant was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">4. Again; the inquiry strongly impresses itself on our minds, if the grant to Roxbury, regarded either as a grant to a corporation, or to the proprietors as tenants in common by an aggregate name, carries with it a title to all the grounds over which the tide flowed; why would not the same be true in regard to every other maritime town in the Colony ? They all derived their titles from the government. Either grants were made in severalty to a considerable number of settlers, who were afterwards recognized as a plantation, settlement or town by a proper name, vested by general laws with certain powers, and after wards bad their bounds declared; or, at a much later period, grants were made to a company of individuals named, of a tract of land, with the view to constituting a town afterwards. In either case, their rights and powers, both of soil and jurisdiction, would seem to be the same with those of Roxbury; and yet we know of no instance of any claim made by any municipal cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>poration or proprietary to flats below high water mark, before the Colony-ordinance of 1641, or beyond the line of riparian proprietorship, since the passage of that ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Again; if the argument be sound, that because the government had power to alienate the public domain, it must be presumed that they intended so to convey it, unless expressly limited, why should the grant be limited to the channel or line of low water ? for the right of the public and the power of the government .to control and appropriate the same beyond low water, was the same. In its application to the grant in question, this construction would extend the grant of soil to the town of Roxbury, not only to the channel of Charles River, but to the bed of the channel and the flats beyond, quite to the shores of Charlestown and part of Boston, which cannot plausibly be pretended.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">In this view of the rules of the common law, here adopted from the earliest settlement, of the state of the country, of the date of the grant, of its obvious intent, we come to the construction of this grant. Roxbury was not a corporation in the sense in which we now understand the nature of a corporation, but was a plantation or settlement of proprietors, who had received grants of land, living near each other, which settlement had acquired a name; the grant was made to those settlers, for the enlargement of their estates; but, like other grants to proprietors as- an aggregate body, but not strictly a corporation, it must be held to communicate some limited corporate powers sufficient to enable them, as a proprietary, to manage, divide and alienate its property amongst themselves, or grant them to new comers. It was in these words :</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\"><em>\u201c </em>Ordered, That the rest of the ground lying betwixt Boston bounds and Dorchester bounds shall belong to the town of Roxbury easterly of Charles River, (except the propriety of the aforesaid town, which they have purchased of particular persons,) Roxbury not to extend above eight miles in length from their meeting-house.\u201d ,,</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">In putting a legal construction upon this grant, we are unable to concur in the conclusion to which the arbitrator came. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>are of opinion that it did not pass to the grantees any right, title or interest in the soil of the flats of Charles River or the Back Bay, below the line of ordinary high water mark; and of course they could acquire no title to flats lying more than one hundred rods seaward below such high water line.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">If there is no intelligible description of limits in this grant, it must be held void for uncertainty, and convey nothing, which would be subversive of the title of the defendants, who claim under it. We should hesitate long before putting this construction on a grant made at so early a period and under such circumstances, and would adopt it only as a last resort, when all other means had failed, which, for reasons already given, we think is not necessary. There is no local or descriptive term in the grant, which has the appearance of being a. northeasterly boundary, except Charles River, which we have supposed was not used for that purpose. The actual boundary, on that side, was in part only on Charles River and the Back Bay. The grant was of all the ground between Dorchester bounds and Boston bounds; and therefore land bordering on the South Bay, between Dorchester and Boston proper, as well as that on the west- side, between Boston proper and the old Boston bounds at Muddy River, constituted the actual northeastern side of this grant on tide water. The name \u201c Charles River \u201d would be wholly inapplicable to that line. But if we could go so far as to presume a mistake of the terms of the description, and instead of \u201c easterly of Charles River,\u201d it had been \u201c easterly on Charles River,\u201d and even added, \u201c and the South Bay; \u201d if the terms \u201c Charles River or Back Bay,\u201d and \u201c South Bay,\u201d as they are now understood, had been used, both being then as now ,arms of the sea, the grant could not by law extend beyond the ordinary high water line. If we supply the deficient description, by substituting these words as being, by a reasonable intendment, what the parties understood \u2014 and something must be supplied to give effect to the grant \u2014 the result must be the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">If indeed the same grant, in the same terms, had been made after the Colon) ordinance of 1641 or 1647, it would have car<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>ried the flats to the extent of one hundred rods, not because the description would have been more comprehensive, but because, when by reasonable intendment the deficient description is supplied by limiting it to the sea, or sea shore, then the law annexing a qualified right of flats to the upland propriety thus granted, the flats would have passed as an appendance. But this would have carried the right one hundred .rods only, and would not have included those flats beyond one hundred rods. It may be added in this connection, that if this grant preceded the colony ordinance, when that ordinance did pass, it annexed the flats to the upland; if the town were then owners of any portion of the shore, it would have enured to their benefit; if it was held by private proprietors, either derivatively from the town, or by original direct grants from the colonial government, it would have enured to their benefit respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In any possible view in which we can place this act of the colonial legislature, we are of opinion that it did not convey to the town of Roxbury the premises now in controversy ; but the tide remained, as it was before, in the Colony.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">That the construction of statutes, wills, deeds and other instruments of conveyance, when the facts of locality and description are ascertained, is a matter of law, is a position well established. We w\u00fcl cite one case only, but one of high authority, which marks the distinction with great precision and clearness.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">' In <em>Macbeath </em>v. <em>Haldimand, </em>1 T. R. 172, it was contended that the effect and meaning of certain letters, respecting a contract for public supplies, was matter of law. All the judges expressed an opinion, that being written instruments, the construction was matter of law for the court. But Mr. Justice Buffer stated the general rule and its limitations with great accuracy, thus: \u201c If letters be written in so dubious a manner, as to be capable of different constructions, and can be explained by other transactions, the whole must be left to the jury; for they are to judge of the truth or falsehood of such collateral facts, which may vary the sense of the letters themselves ; but if they be not explained by any other circumstances, then like deeds or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>written agreements, the construction of them is a mere matter of law.\u201d The facts in that case were altogether different, and it is cited only as a clear and authoritative statement of the settled rule of law, that the construction of all written documents, when the facts are proved, on which their meaning depends, is a question of law for the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">II. The next question mentioned in the report is thus stated : \u201c It was contended by the defendants\u2019 counsel, that the exclusion of the tide water from the empty basin, by authority of the act of June 14th 1814 and subsequent acts of legislation, vested in the adjoining owners all the land thus made bare, or at any rate operated as an extinguishment of all rights of the Commonwealth. But \u00cd was of opinion that neither the act of 1814 and proceedings under it, nor any other acts of the government, divested the Commonwealth of any right or title which it had in the premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">We fully concur with the referee in this opinion. But as the question has again been raised and argued before us, it seems proper to state some of the reasons on which our opinion is founded, especially as no reasons are given in the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The act of 1814 simply confers on the corporation thereby created an authority, a privilege or franchise, to exclude the tide waters from the empty basin, and to use it as a receiving basin, for the purpose of mill power. There are no words of grant of soil, nor anything which implies it. The most which it can be construed to confer on the corporation is an easement, a franchise, an incorporeal hereditament, leaving the title unaffected. The view taken of it by the court, in the case of <em>Boston &amp; Roxbury Mill Corporation </em>v. Newman, <em>12 </em>Pick. 476, was, that before this act passed \u201c the owners of the upland owned the flats to the extent of one hundred rods. The Commonwealth had the title to the flats beyond. So far as it regarded the right of the public, the corporation acquired it by the act of the legislature. But the flats between the upland and those belonging to the Commonwealth must be subjected to the control of the corporation, or they could not cony their undertaking into effect.\u201d The \u201c right \u201d of the public; what was the right ? The subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>clause, we think, explains it; it was subjected, like that of other owners, to the control of the corporation. It was a perpetual right to use it, for flowage only, and not for building. It is an easement, not a title. But secondly, if it made any grant, it was to the corporation and not to riparian proprietors, or any other party. No other party can set it up to defeat or extinguish the right of the Commonwealth. Thirdly, no reservation or exception of the right of the Commonwealth to the soil was necessary, because the soil was not granted, but remained as if no such grant had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">It is true that, after this act, the Commonwealth could make no beneficial use of the title in fee, for building or the like; but the corporation could make no other use of their easement, or right of flowage, without the consent of the government; but the government and the corporation, by reuniting the fee of the soil and all easements and franchises over it, have power to give a good title for all purposes, and this can in no respect enlarge or diminish the rights of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">III. The next question suggested in the award embraces the matter contained in the four next paragraphs of the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">The defendants\u2019 counsel contended that because the flats in question were described to be within the limits of Roxbury, they were, \u201c by virtue of the original settlement of the town and the act of 1636, necessarily the property of the town.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">We do not know precisely what is intended here, by \u201cthe original settlement; \u201d if any act of the government is intended, we know of none. It is believed that no formal act of incorporation of any town was passed during the existence of the Colonial government'. Roxbury was recognized as a settlement, and, as we have seen, assessed as such in 1630, and so remained to the time of the grant in question. But even an act of incorporation, without an express grant of the lands within it, would not, in our judgment, effect a transfer of the public lands. Such an act, with limited bounds, would pass municipal jurisdiction, but not soil. There was a practice, we believe, at a much later time, after the establishment of the provincial government by the Charter of 1692, to grant a tract of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>.and or township of land to a body of individuals named, constituting them proprietors and tenants in common, with a view to their incorporation afterwards as a town. But then they took the fee in the land, by force of the first grant, and not by force of the act of incorporation, when one passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">It is further contended, in two or three different forms, that the agreement of Boston and Roxbury in 1823, and the statute of 1836 affirming it, were evidence bearing upon the question of property. But we fully concur with the referee in his conclusion, that these acts can have no such effect; and for the unanswerable reason assigned by him, that Roxbury and Boston could by no acts of theirs, however formal, impair or affect the rights of the Commonwealth; and the <em>St. </em>of 1836, <em>c. </em>37, does nothing more than establish the lines as they have been mutually agreed on, as the boundary lines between said city and town.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The only plausible argument drawn from this statute is upon the use of the word \u201c territory,\u201d in the last clause, which is as follows: \u201c And the territory and jurisdiction on either side of the said lines as hereby established are accordingly confirmed to the said city and said town respectively.\u201d In our judgment, this clause affects jurisdiction only. It creates no new title; it confers no new rights; it gives the authoritative effect of law to a line before uncertain. The term \u201c territory \u201d was properly used ; it fixes the civil and political rights of all those who may build\" houses and become inhabitants on the one or the other side of this line. It has no bearing upon the question of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">We would add here, in general terms, in regard to a great mass of evidence made part of the case, that all the early acts fixing boundaries between towns, all the perambulations of lines made by selectmen and recorded in town books, have no tendency to prove or disprove title; they affect the question of jurisdiction only, and for the purpose of the present inquiry may be laid out of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">It may be added, as to the earlier acts of the Colony, fixing boundaries, they merely affect the rights of the respective towns, unless there be some records of grant by the government, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>and as to all these perambulations, that they are to ascertain \u25a0 and mark boundaries, and not to alter or vary them ; and as to the Commonwealth they are <em>res inter alios </em>and cannot affect its rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">IV. The only other question is that of disseisin, all the evi dence respecting which is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">We are entirely satisfied that the defendants acquired no titi by disseisin, and on this point fully concur with the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">V. In considering what is the proper judgment to be rendered in this case, we are necessarily referred to the submission, which is rather peculiar, and the award made under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">It seems to have been the desire and purpose of the parties to make the award conclusive, and by the combined action of the arbitrator, and of this court, to effect a speedy decision of all questions of law and fact, on which their contested rights depended, and to render the judgment upon them final. The case was referred to a learned and eminent jurist of much judicial experience, under an agreement that the pleadings might be so amended, if need be, as to embrace all the conflicting claims, rights and interests of the parties, embraced in a resolve specified, and with a provision that the referee should report all questions of law arising in the cause to the court, for review and final adjudication \u2014 meaning, that the referee should award and determine the whole cause, including the law and the facts, but subject to the review and final adjudication of all matters of law in the cause by the full court. The referee has made his award accordingly, admitting all the evidence offered on both sides, whether objected to or not, subject to the opinion of the whole court as to its competency and relevancy. The evidence upon the main question is mostly documentary, with reference to fixed localities. All the evidence in regard to possession is reported. He also reports, that in his opinion the title to the flats in question is in the Commonwealth, unless it has been alienated by the government or by one of its predecessors. No such act of alienation or grant is relied on or given in evidence to effect such alienation, except the Colony ordinance of 1636. The referee was of opinion that this act did operate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>as such alienation in favor of the defendants. But we are of opinion, that upon the facts shown and referred to in the report, the construction of this ordinance was a question of law, and upon that question this court is of opinion that that act did not effect such alienation, and therefore that the title still remains in the Commonwealth, concurring in all other respects with the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The judgment, we think, may be something in the following form: Report of the referee read and accepted, subject to the -opinion of the whole court in matters of law; the court are of opinion in point of law, that the grant from the colonial government to the town of Roxbury, in 1636, did not include any land bordering on the sea or tide waters, below ordinary high water mark, and therefore that judgment for the title and possession of the demanded premises be entered for the Commonwealth. <em>Judgment for the Commonwealth.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Note. By \u201c the Great Patent of New England,\u201d as it is generally called, James I. on the 3d of November 1620 granted to \u201cthe council established at Plymouth in the county of Devon, for the planting, ruling, ordering and governing of New England in America,\u201d and to their successors and assigns forever, \u201c all that circuit, continent, precincts and limitts in America, lying and being in breadth from fourty degrees of northerly latitude from the equinoctiall line, to fourty eight degrees of the said northerly latitude, and in length by all the breadth aforesaid throughout the moine land from sea to sea, with all the seas, rivers, islands, ereekes, inletts, ports and havens,\u201d and \u201c together also with the firme lands, soyles, grounds, havens, ports, rivers, waters, fishings, mines, and mineralls, as well royall mines of gold and silver, as other mines and mineralls, precious stones, quarries, and all and singular other commodities, jurisdictions, royalties, priveliges, franchises, and preheminences, both within the same tract of land upon the moine, as also within the said islands and seas adjoining; \u201d \u201c not actually possessed or inhabited by any other Christian prince or estate,\u201d nor within the limits of the Southern Colony, previously granted. 1 Hazard\u2019s Hist.

One was, want of sufficient experience of the nature and disposition of the people, considered with the condition of the country and other circumstances, which made them conceive that such laws would be fittest for us, which should arise <em>pro re nota </em>upon occasions, etc., and so the laws of England and other states grew, and therefore the fundamental laws of England are called customs, <em>consuetudines. </em>2.

But the validity of the judgment against the charter in 1684 (founded on charges of having illegally levied taxes and duties, coined money, and imposed an oath of fidelity) was denied by the house of commons, and \u201c questioned by very great authority in England,\u201d and was never admitted here. 32 Mass.

Knapp\u2019s Biog. Sketches, 43. Judge Trowbridge, as appears by his own manuscripts, (which have passed from his nephew, Chief Justice Dana, into the possession of the latter\u2019s grandson, Mr. Edmund Trow bridge Dana,) gave an opinion that rape was not entitled to the benefit of clergy by the laws of the Province, because the Prov. St. of 9 W. 3 did not make it a new felony, but only reaffirmed the law as it stood before, by the colony laws of 1649 and 1669, or the English Sts. of 13 &amp; 25 Edw. 3 and 18 Eliz.; and added, \u201cThe old charter was vacated in 1686, and thereupon the laws of England revived here. If rape under the old charter should not be thought felony, not being absolutely punishable with death, yet as there was eleven years between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>the old charter and the making this act, must not the laws of England in that time revive, so as that rape within that time must be felony without clergy.\u201d See also Quincy, 53, note; 2 Hutchinson\u2019s Hist. Mass. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The contrary opinion cannot be maintained, as Chief Justice Shaw was wont to do, by reference to the provincial statutes of May and November 1692 (4 W. &amp; M.), continuing in force the colonial laws.

In 1683 the following question was presented (by whom does not appear) to the general court: \u201c In regard the law entituled Libertys common doth give to all that border upon highwater mark the flats lying before their land downe to low water mark. Hence Query. When severall proprietors have land bordering upon a cove which is more than a semicircle. Q. Whether a line from the circumference to the center of the semicircle ought not be the bounds to each mans propriety, and not low water mark.\u201d By a plan annexed the question would appear to have arisen in Brain-tree. The magistrates thereupon on the 17th of May 1683 passed the following act, which however was not consented to by the deputies: \u201c For further explanation of the law granting to all proprietors of lands butting upon the salt water interest in the flatts to low water mark. Resolved upon the question, That where lands are so circumstanced as that to continue their bounds on strait lines to the lower water mark would unavoidably interfere one with another, the flats adjacent to low water mark shall be divided in proportion to each proprietors breadth upon high water mark: Provided alwayes this act of the court shall not be construed to disturb any orderly settlement formerly made.\u201d 47 Mass.

In a shallow cove, in which there is no channel, a base line may be run across the mouth of the cove, and parallel lines drawn, at right angles with the base line, from the ends of the division lines of the upland to low water mark. <em>Gray v.

A deep cove, out of which the tide entirely ebbs at low water, is to be divided by drawing a line across its mouth, giving to each proprietor a width upon the base line proportional to the width of his shore line, and then drawing straight converging lines from the divisions at the shore to the corresponding points on the base line. This rule (which is substantially that suggested by the magistrates in 1683, <em>ante, </em>521,) was first revived by <em>Wilde, </em>J., in the hypothetical case of a cove the circumference of which was twice its diameter, or deeper than a semicircle. <em>Rust v.

Col. Ree. 326. The rights acquired under such grants were expressly reserved in the sixteenth article of the Body of Liberties, <em>ante, </em>465 note. In Massachusetts, rivers are deemed navigable so far as the tide ebbs and flows; and above that point the right of fishing is in the riparian proprietor, subject however, like such rights acquired under legislative grant, and all other rights of fishing, either in the sea or in rivers, to regulation by the legislature, so as to prevent the obstruction of the passage of fish, in all cases where previous statutes do not amount to a contract with parti is obstructing the river.

It is true that the special verdict in that case found that the premises had been \u201c possessed and improved \u201d by the plaintiffs for more than twenty years. But the only acts of possession or improvement shown by the evidence, or indeed of which the premises, while uninclosed, were capable, was making annual leases thereof. Mr. Dane says, \u201cBy our law, fisheries, taking oysters, digging clams in flats-grounds, &amp;c. are incorporeal hereditaments, that may be appurtenant to lands and territories.\u201d \u201c Many parts of our flats-ground, and the rights of sea manure, &amp;c. on them, belong to proprietors in common and undivided.\u201d 2 Dane Ab. 690, 697. But he does not seem to have been very clear in his views about taking shellfish, sometimes classing it with \u201c digging sand and sea manure,\u201d sometimes with \u201c fishing and fowling,\u201d and sometimes with both. 2 Dane Ab. 694, 699, 700, 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Long since the Revolution, taking clams on the sea shore was recognized as the subject of a several fishery. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Lakeman, </em>15 Pick. 151. <em>Lakeman </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>17 Pick. 436. The first adjudication to the contrary in this commonwealth was in 1849. <em>Weston </em>v. <em>Sampson, </em>8 Cush. 351. That case arose in the county of Plymouth, to which the Massachusetts colony ordinances <em>proprin vigore </em>did not extend, and where fishing and fowling had been declared to be free from the earliest times. Ordinances 1627-1685, 11 Plym. Col. Rec. 5, 16, 114, 198 ; Plym. Col. Laws, (ed. 1685) 37; (ed. 1836) 30, 34, 282, 324. Yet the decision was not based upon that distinction, but upon the ground that the public right of fishing, reserved by the colony ordinances, extended to shellfish as well as to swimming fish.</p>\n<p id=\"AMU7\">The same doctrine, upon similar grounds, has been repeatedly declared in Maine. But it seems never to have been necessary to a decision there; for one case was simply of a corporation, building a dam on its own land by authority of the legislature, and held not liable for injuries thereby occasioned to clams on the flats below; a second was of an owner of flats, held liable for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>taking oysters thereon out of season without license: and a third concerned a shad fishery in a river, above tide water. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Cutler Milldam, </em>20 Maine, 358. <em>Moulton </em>v. <em>Libbey, </em>37 Maine, 472. <em>Preble </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>47 Maine, 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">In 1856 this doctrine was applied within the limits of the Massachusetts Colony to the same beach which was in dispute in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Lakeman </em>and <em>Lakeman </em>v. Butler, <em>ubi supra, </em>very near the flats trespassed upon in <em>Ipswich Proprietors </em>v. <em>Herrick, post, </em>529, and notwithstanding evidence of a claim of exclusive right, constantly asserted by sales of licenses and otherwise, running back almost to the time of that decision. <em>Lakeman </em>v. <em>Burnham, </em>7 Gray, 437.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Notwithstanding the words of the ordinance of 1641, the public right of fishing is not confined to the inhabitants of the town. <em>Lakeman </em>v. <em>Burnham, </em>7 Gray, 437. <em>2 </em>Dane Ab. 694, 699. The common right of fishery does not authorize the public to fix stakes on flats belonging to the owner of the upland, for the purpose of setting a seine. <em>Locke </em>v. <em>Motley, 2 </em>Gray, 267. <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Sylvester, </em>24 Maine, 486. But below low water mark any one may use a seine. 2 Dane Ab. 692, 693. The right of taking shellfish does not include any right* to take the soil, or dead shellfish imbedded therein, for manure. <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Shehan, </em>7 Gray, 435. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>22 Maine, 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">Timber cast upon the beach by the sea, and not claimed by any previous owner, belongs to the owner of the beach. <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Bates, </em>13 Pick. 255. So does seaweed, thrown upon the shore within the limits of the ordinance of 1647. <em>Cohasset Proprietors </em>v. <em>Tower, </em>(1821) 24 Law Reporter, 733. <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>7 Met. 323. The right to such seaweed depends upon the present extent of the beach, and not upon its condition when the owner acquired his title. <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>7 Met. 325. And it cannot be granted away by the legislature. <em>Cohasset Proprietors v. Tower, </em>24 Law Reporter, 734.
