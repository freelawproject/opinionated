Foster, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ao\">1. The essence of the crime charged consists in keeping intoxicating liquors with the intent to sell them in an illegal manner. But this complaint does not show that the defendant did not design to sell in some legal way, or after having obtained authority. Its only allegations are that the defendant kept; that he intended to sell; that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>was not authorized to sell. The very statute which creates thi offence and enacts the penalty uses the expression \u201c with inten to sell contrary to the provisions of this act.\u201d <em>St. </em>1855 <em>c. </em>215, \u00a7 34.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-5\">The fact that the complaint is in the form prescribed by <em>Si </em>1855, <em>c. </em>397, does not make it sufficient, if it has not the certainty required at common law. Declaration of Rights, art. 13 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>11 Pick. 433. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>16 Pick. 311.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-6\">3. By the statute creating the police court of Milford, the duties of clerk are expressly imposed upon the justice. <em>Sts. </em>185.4, c. 60, \u00a7 7 ; 1857, c. 364. The <em>St. </em>of 1838, c. 147, \u00a7 3, authorizing \u201cthe justice of any police court,\u201d except in. Boston, to appoint a clerk, does not apply to police courts since created. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>7 Gray, 330. In order to sustain this complaint, the court must not only hold that the justice could appoint a clerk', but must take notice that he had exercised that power, and had appointed Daggett.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b14-7\"><em>T.

This complaint is in the form prescribed by <em>St. </em>1855, <em>c. </em>397, and sufficiently avers that the defendant kept the liquors with intent to sell them contrary to law, by alleging that the defendant was not authorized to sell them in this commonwealth for any purpose whatever under the statute of 1855, <em>c. </em>315. This excludes any possible legal authority in the defendant to sell liquors in this commonwealth, inasmuch as any authority to sell liquors could be derived only from that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-9\">3. The second section of <em>St. </em>1838, <em>c. </em>147, authorizing the justice of \u201c any police court,\u201d except in Boston, to appoint a clerk, is a general provision, intended to enable the justices of such courts, then or thereafter to be established, to appoint a clerk whenever the amount of their business should require it</p>\n<p id=\"b14-10\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
