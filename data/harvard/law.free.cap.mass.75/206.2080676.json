At the trial in the court of common pleas, the plaintiff, as part of his testimony to prove the true boundary line of the close, called a witness, whom Sanger, J., against the defendant\u2019s objection, permitted to testify that Samuel Perry, now deceased, who had previously occupied, but never owned, the land adjoining the plaintiff\u2019s close on the line in question for about twenty five years, went with the witness, many years after he had ceased to occupy it, to the disputed line, and pointed out a ditch and certain heaps of stones as the true boundary of the plaintiff\u2019s close. The verdict was for the plaintiff, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b216-7\"><em>J.

To render it competent in cases of boundary, it must fall within the exception to the rule laid down in <em>Daggett </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>5 Met. 228. <em>Flagg </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>8 Gray, 557, &amp; cases cited. In the present case, the person, whose declarations concerning the boundary of the close in question were admitted, was not in possession of the land when he made the statements which were offered in evidence. They do not therefore come within the exception, and were erroneously admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
