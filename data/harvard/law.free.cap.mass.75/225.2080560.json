At the trial in the court of common pleas it appeared that this property was attached on a writ in favor of Bishop against the plaintiff\u2019s son, together with property of the latter, and was claimed by the plaintiff of the attaching officer; that the plaintiff as surety and his son as principal gave bond to dissolve that attachment, and that after such dissolution the property was again attached and sold on another writ in favor of Bishop, which was the tort now sued for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-7\">The defendants contended that the plaintiff by the execution of that bond had estopped himself to deny that the property now claimed by him was his son\u2019s, or to set up a title in himself.
