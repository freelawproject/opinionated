The errors assigned were, \u201c that both the defendants in said suit were out of the Commonwealth at the time of the service of the sum, manses in said suit; that both said defendants were, at the said time, and have hitherto been, resident without the said commonwealth ; that no notice, sufficient in law, of the commencement or pendency of said suit was given to the defendants, or either of them, before the rendition of judgment therein ; that judgment in said suit was rendered upon the default of said defendants at the term of court to which the writ in said suit was returnable, and without appearance by the defendants, or in their behalf.\u201d Plea, <em>in nullo est </em>erratum, upon which issue was joined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-8\">The service made in the original action, as shown by the officer\u2019s return, was by a general attachment of all the defendant\u2019s real estate in Dukes County, and leaving a summons for each of them <em>\u201c </em>at their last and usual place of abode, they being out of the Commonwealth at that time.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-9\">Trial before <em>Thomas, </em>J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, which after reciting the pleadings, and the officer\u2019s return in the original action, concluded thus: \u201c The parties went to the jury upon the issue presented by the assignment of errors, plea and joinder, the presiding judge interposing no objection. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs in error. No other service was made before default and judgment than that indicated in the officer\u2019s return. The presiding judge thereupon ordered that</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>the judgment be reversed, and that such entry be made on the docket. The defendant in error, feeling himself aggrieved by such decision and order, excepts thereto.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b322-5\"><em>J. C. </em>Stone, for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ac6\">The finding of the jury, that the plaintiffs in error were in fact resident out of the Commonwealth at the time of the service of the original writ, is not conclusive of their right to have the judgment. Even if the plaintiffs were at the time of the service of the original writ actually resident in another state, the service was sufficient upon which to found a judgment: because the attachment gave the court jurisdiction. Rev. Sts. c. 90, \u00a7 44. <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Un</em>derwood, 5 Cush. 52. The words \u201c out of the State \u201d in \u00a7\u00a7 41\u201418 must be interpreted to mean \u201cresident out of the Commonwealth ; \u201d and these sections must be construed in connection with \u00a7 3 of c. 92, to which they in terms-refer, and the various clauses of which cannot be taken disjunctively, but \u201c or \u201d must be taken to mean \u201c and \u201d in order to harmonize the provisions of the various sections.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-6\">The service required by the Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>90, \u00a7 45, at the defendant\u2019s last and usual place of abode, if he is out of the State, is not for the purpose of giving the court jurisdiction ; for the attachment gave that. See <em>Tilden </em>v. Johnson, 6 Cush. 354. The return of the officer does not show that the plaintiffs in error were in point of fact resident out of the Commonwealth ; and therefore no further notice was required under this section.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-7\">But if such notice was required, this court may now order it, under their power to render such judgment as the court of common pleas should have rendered. Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>82, \u00a7 20.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b322-8\"><em>T. M. Stetson, </em>for the plaintiffs in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AK87\">cited Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>90, \u00a7 48; <em>c. </em>92, \u00a7 3 ; <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Boston, 2 </em>Gray, 490 ; <em>Bodurtha </em>v. <em>Goodrich, </em>3 Gray, 508; <em>Downs </em>v. <em>Fuller, 2 </em>Met. 135; <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>11 Met. 370, and 2 Cush. 35.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b322-9\">Dewey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5TZ\">The facts stated in the assignment of errors having been found by the jury, the entry of a reversal of the judgment in favor of the defendant in error was correct. The cases of <em>Downs </em>v. <em>Fuller, 2 </em>Met. 135, and <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>11 Met, 370, and 2 Cush. 35, seem to have settled the construction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Rev. Sts. cc. 90 and 92, as to the service of writs, so far at least, that where the defendant is out of the Commonwealth at the time of the service, and not an inhabitant or resident thereof, and the only service made is by attaching real estate, and leaving a summons at the defendant\u2019s last and usual place of abode, the defendant is, in addition to such service, entitled to such further notice, and continuance of the action, as is provided in c. 92, \u00a7 3. -</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The reversal in a case like the present must be general, as this court cannot now make such order as the court of common pleas ought to have done. Had it been a judgment for a greater sum than it ought to have been, or error of that kind, the court might now render such judgment as the court of common pleas should have rendered. Rev. Sts. c. 82, \u00a7 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\n<em>Judgment of reversal affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
