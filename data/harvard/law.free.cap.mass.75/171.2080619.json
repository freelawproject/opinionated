There are no words in this will, enlarging the estate devised into a fee. The word \u201c estate \u201d is, by its reference, restricted to the antecedent words of devise. It is a word of reference, and means no more than the words to which it refers. <em>Doe </em>v. Clayton, 8 East, 144.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-5\">The use of apt and technical words to pass a fee, where such was the purpose, in other parts of the will, makes it clear that the testator understood the force of words of limitation; and requires the court to give effect to their omission. <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>2 Wils. 80. <em>Cook </em>v.

From the use of the word \u201c estate,\u201d which \u201c shall carry a fee, where the testator has a fee, unless the intention is broken in upon by other expressions in the will, clearly shewing that it is intended to give it a more limited construction.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Lawton, </em>4 Bing.

Sts. <em>c. </em>62, \u00a7 4, which have reversed the rule of construction in force when this will was made and proved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-7\">The rule, as stated in <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Tuchin, </em>6 Taunt. 416, is that \u201c the word estate \u201d must be \u201c used in the operative part of the devise; not introduced incidentally after the devising part is perfected, but introduced in the devise itself.\u201d And in all the cases cited by the tenant the word estate is not a word of reference, but is the word of devise; and the cases go upon that distinction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-8\">The word relied upon in the present case occurs in an independent and separate sentence, stating an immaterial circumstance in' the history of the farm, and expressing the testator\u2019s respect for the devisee, and acknowledgment of the devisee\u2019s services in directing the education of his grandsons. It is a word used in the statement of a former ownership, and not of the ownership or title which is the subject of this devise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-9\">If the devise in question was of a life estate, then the remainder was an estate \u201c not otherwise herein absolutely and specifically devised.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b184-10\">Metcalf, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayn\">The will of Mr. Boylston, having been made in the year 1826, before a new rule for the construction of devises of land was prescribed by the Rev. Sts. c. 62, \u00a7 4, must be construed by the rules of law which were in force when it was made. And we are all of opinion that by that will, so construed, Mr. Adams took a fee in the premises demanded in this writ. As we view the devise to him, its meaning and effect are the same as they would have been if the words of it had been arranged thus: \u201c I give and devise all my lands and tene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>ments in Weston, in the county of Middlesex, Massachusetts, with the privileges and appurtenances to the same belonging, containing four hundred acres, be the same more or less, which were formerly the estate of Lt. Gov. Gill, and which estate I now devise in token of respect for the devisee.\u201d We view the second sentence in this devise, as it stands in the will, not as introduced incidentally after the devising part was perfected, (as in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>White, 1 </em>Exch. 535,) but as an operative part of the devise. In that sentence, the devisor expressly repeats the devise of the \u201c estate \u201d which, in the first sentence, he devised by the words \u201c lands and tenements.\u201d Both must be taken together.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The word \u201c estate,\u201d in a devise, has repeatedly been held sufficient to give a fee, if the devisor had a fee, although the word is accompanied by words of locality, (as in this case,) or other expressions exclusively referable to the <em>corpus </em>of the property. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Lawton, </em>6 Scott, 318, and 4 Bing. N. C. 461. In <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Tuchin, 2 </em>Marsh. 117, Chief Justice Gibbs thus states the law on this subject: \u201c It is admitted very properly, that the word <em>1 </em>estate \u2019 or \u2018 estates \u2019 will carry a fee, unless the other parts of the will restrain the effects of it. Formerly, a narrower construction prevailed, and it was held that if the word \u2018 estate \u2019 were attended by words designating the thing devised, or its situation, it was to be considered not as descriptive of the interest intended to be passed, but only of the lands themselves which were the subject of the devise. Latterly, however, a more liberal construction has been adopted; and the word \u2018 estate,\u2019 though it be followed by words which point at the situation, or at the particular house or land, has been held to convey a fee simple. It may be restrained; it may be shown by other parts of the will, that the testator has used the word 6 estate,\u2019 as descriptive only of the thing devised, and not of the interest meant to be conveyed; but then it lies on the party who contends for this narrow construction, to show that there are such words of restraint in the will.\u201d In this case of <em>Randall </em>v, <em>Tuchin, </em>which is reported also in 6 Taunt. 410, C., after devising several dwelling-houses to T., (particularly describing them,) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>added these words: \u201c All which estates, being copyhold of the manor of Kennington, I devise to T. for life, and, after his decease, to his son M.\u201d It was decided that M. took an estate in fee in the copyhold. So in <em>Roe </em>v. Bacon, 4 M. &amp; S. 366, B. devised to his wife thus : \u201c All and singular my freehold lands, messuages and tenements at T. &amp; H., or elsewhere, together with all my household goods, cattle,\u201d &amp;c. \u201c for her natural life, and after her decease, then all the said estates, goods,\u201d &amp;c. \u201c to be divided among my sons, T., J., H. and P., and my son-in-law C., share and share alike.\u201d Lord Ellenborough and his associates decided that the sons took a fee, after the death of the wife. In <em>Uthwatt </em>v. Bryant, 6 Taunt. 317, and <em>2 </em>Marsh. 30, A. devised all his freehold lands, tenements, hereditaments and premises in the parish of B. to certain persons for life, with remainders over, and on the happening of a certain event, devised his said freehold estate in the parish of B. to his daughters, as tenants in common, and if they should die in the lifetime of his wife, then he devised all his said freehold estate in the parish of B. to his wife and her heirs forever. Chief Justice Gibbs and his associates certified their opinion to the Vice Chancellor, that the daughters took a fee. These cases are decisive that the word \u201c estate,\u201d even when used in a will as a word of reference, will carry a fee, unless other parts of the will show that such was not the testator\u2019s intention. In the present case, the whole will clearly tends to show that Mr. Boylston intended to give the Weston lands to Mr. Adams in fee. But we place our decision on the grounds and authorities above mentioned, without seek ing other reasons in confirmation of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\n<em>Judgment for the tenant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
