Had the words \u201c at said Hopkinton \u201d been omitted, the indictment might possibly have been held good.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b142-5\"><em>J. JEt.

And this form of charge has been decided to be sufficient and proper. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pray, </em>13 Pick. 359. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>4 Gray, 11. In the second of these cases, the indictment was precisely like that in the present case; that is, the place where the offence was committed was inserted twice; once when alleging a day certain, and again when alleging divers subsequent days. This repetition was doubtless unnecessary, but it was not improper, and there is no ground for the objection that two offences are thereby alleged in the indictment. We express no opinion whether duplicity, when found in an indictment, is cause for arresting judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
