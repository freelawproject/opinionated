Defendant in error originally brought an action in replevin against plaintiff in error before a justice of the peace and obtained judgment from which an appeal was prosecuted to the County Clerk. In that court the case was placed on the short cause calendar pursuant to the provisions of .the statute (E. S. chap. 110, Practice Act). It was not reached for trial on that calendar and about a month after it had been placed thereon it was, on motion of the plaintiff in the suit, stricken off the short cause calendar \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d This order was entered without notice to the defendant or his attorney, neither of whom was present or represented in court. A week later the cause appeared on the trial call of \u201cthe regular trial calendar,\u201d in the order in which it would have stood if it had never been placed on the short cause calendar. Thereupon the defendant\u2019s attorney appeared and moved to strike the cause from the regular trial call on the ground that having been placed on the \u201cshort cause calendar\u201d and thereby stricken off \u201cthe regular trial calendar\u201d as the statute provides, and not having been thereafter restored thereto in the manner required by statute, the case was not properly on that regular calendar for trial.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-4\" pgmap=\"273\">The provision of the statute (Section 5 of the Short Cause Calendar Act) is as follows: \u201cIf a suit which is upon the regular trial calendar shall be placed upon the \u2018short, cause calendar,\u2019 it shall be stricken off the regular trial calendar, and shall not again be placed thereon, except upon notice to the defendant, his agent or attorney.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-5\" pgmap=\"273(118) 274(81)\">The court took the motion to strike the case from the trial call under advisement after hearing the defendant\u2019s objections. At the afternoon session of court the plaintiff\u2019s attorney was allowed over defendant\u2019s objection to file affidavits in opposition to defendant\u2019s motion. These affidavits have no special relevance to the question now presented. The court after hearing overruled the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the cause from the trial call, and it was afterwards called, for trial in its order when reached upon \u201cthe regular trial calendar.\u201d Defendant\u2019s attorney then objected to the trial of the case on the same ground, viz., that it was still on the \u201cshort cause calendar.\u201d The objection was overruled and defendant\u2019s attorney preserved his exception. He thereupon declined to participate in the trial on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction to try the case at that time. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney called his witnesses and the trial proceeded to verdict. It appears that the defendant was present with his attorney during the trial, and after return of the verdict entered orally a motion for a new trial, and subsequently filed points in writing in support of said motion.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b274-5\" pgmap=\"274\">Robert E.

S. chap. 110, sec. 95-99)., it becomes the duty of the clerk to strike-it off the \u201cregular trial calendar.\u201d Brady v. Washington Ins. Co., 82 Ill. App. 380-382. In contemplation of law the case is no longer on the regular trial calendar, and must be treated accordingly. There is thereafter no way to get it back upon that calendar if it be not passed or continued, \u201cexcept upon notice to the defendant, his agent or attorney.\u201d The case at bar was improperly stricken off the short cause calendar without such notice and in violation of the statute. In contemplation of law it still remained on said short cause calendar notwithstanding the order striking it off. The attorney for the plaintiff in the trial court suggests that the record does not show the case ever to have been upon the short cause calendar. It does, however, show a notice to place it on that calendar and an order striking it off. When, therefore, the cause appeared on the trial call of the regular trial calendar it was improperly there. The defendant\u2019s attorney appeared and moved to strike it off. Both parties were then present in court, with full notice, and upon hearing and consideration, the court refused to strike the cause off the regular trial calendar. This was equivalent to restoring it to that calendar with notice to the defendant. Before that time the cause had been on that calendar by default of the clerk. Brady v. Washington Ins. Co., supra, p. 383. Thereafter it was there by act of the court. The statute does not provide for any special method of giving notice, nor does it fix any time. The court had power to place the cause again on the regular trial calendar or docket, both parties having notice and being present. Section 16 of the Practice Act provides that all causes shall be tried or otherwise disposed of in the order they are placed upon the docket. Having been replaced on the regular trial calendar or docket, the cause was subject to trial when reached in its order, and it was so tried over the objection of the defendant. The objection, however, was that the case was still on the short cause calendar. In this defendant\u2019s attorney was mistaken. It had been restored to the regular calendar- by the court\u2019s previous action. Doubtless had there been a motion for continuance based'on proper affidavits in compliance with the requirements of the Practice Act in that respect, the court would have granted the application. It appears that the defendant and his attorney were present during the trial, and refused to participate therein. This was the defendant\u2019s right, but in the absence of any showing or application for a continuance, no reason appears why the trial should not have proceeded as it did.</p> <p id=\"b275-4\" pgmap=\"275\">Binding no material error, therefore, the judgment of the County Court must be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b275-5\" pgmap=\"275\">Affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b275-6\" pgmap=\"275\">Mr. Presiding Justice Baker, dissenting.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
