Lord, executors of the will of Robert Waterston, against the Home for Aged Colored Women, the Association for the Relief of Aged, Indigent Females, the American Bible Society, the Massachusetts Bible Society, the Massachusetts Radical Peace Society and the American Peace Society, praying for instructions as to the disposal of certain legacies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-8\">The bill alleged that the testator left a will, the material clauses of which were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-9\">\u201c Thirteenth, to the following societies, to wit, the Benevolent Fraternity of Churches in Boston, the Home for Aged Women, the Freedmen\u2019s Aid Society, the Home for Aged Men, the Howard Benevolent Society,\" the Boston Provident Association, the Children\u2019s Mission, the Fatherless and Widows\u2019 Society, the So<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>ciety for the Prevention of Pauperism, the Children\u2019s Aid Society, the Society for the Relief of Aged and Destitute Clergymen, I give and bequeath to each the sum of two thousand dollars. To the Needlewoman\u2019s Friend Society, the Bible Society, the Washingtonian Home for the Fallen, and the Society for Promoting Peace on Earth and Good Will toward Men, I give and bequeath to each one thousand dollars. And it is my intention that the above societies shall receive the above sums, whether I have in all cases described them by their legal names or not, giving my executors full authority to pay out said sums to the trustees or proper officers of said societies, whether the same are corporate bodies or voluntary associations, and directing them to pay such sums to such societies, associations and institutions as are usually and commonly known by the names above described; the above legacies to be paid free of government tax.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-5\">\u201c Fourteenth.

The Massachusetts Radical Society afterwards withdrew its answer, and the legacy given to the Society for Promoting Peace on Earth and Good Will toward Men, was determined to belong to the American. Peace Society. <em>Colt, </em>J., found \u201c that in each of these cases it was a matter of doubt to which of the several sets of societies made defendants each legacy should be paid, and that the matter was a proper subject for judicial inquiry; \u201d and, at the request of the plaintiffs, reserved for the determination of the full court the question of costs and from what fund they should be paid.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b150-9\"><em>JR.

That the costs as between counsel and client are to be taken out of the legacy in dispute, has been authoritatively determined by this court in a case which cannot be distinguished from this. <em>Bliss </em>v. <em>American Bible Society, </em>2 Allen, 334.

Whenever such necessity arises, the whole costs are a charge upon the general estate. <em>Bagshaw </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>9 Mod. 283. <em>Jolliffe </em>v. <em>East, </em>3 Bro.

In <em>Bliss </em>v. <em>American Tract Society, 2 </em>Allen, 334, the question of costs does not appear to have been raised, but the direction to pay them out of the particular fund, may rest on the exceptions mentioned in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Squire, Attorney General </em>v. <em>Lawes, </em>and <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>Morong, ubi supra.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b151-6\">Chapman, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AoB\">We must regard it as a general rule established by the authorities cited by the defendants\u2019 counsel that whenever a testator has expressed himself so ambiguously as to make it necessary for his executors to come to this court, the costs should be paid out of the general assets. This case comes within the general rule. <em>Decree accordingly.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
