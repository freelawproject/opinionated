W.

And we are all of opinion that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The word \u201cbenevolent,\u201d of itself, without anything in the context to qualify or restrict its ordinary meaning, clearly includes not only purposes which are deemed charitable by a court of equity; but also any acts dictated by kindness, good \"will or a disposition to do good, the objects of which have no relation to the promotion of education, learning or religion, the relief of the needy, the sick or the afflicted, the support of public works or the relief of public burdens, and cannot be deemed charitable in the technical and legal sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The only difference of opinion in the adjudged cases on this subject has been upon the question how far the word \u201c benevolent,\u201d when used to describe the purposes of a trust, could be deemed to be limited in its meaning by being associated with other words more clearly pointing to a strictly charitable disposition of the fund. In one case in the English chancery, and another in New Jersey, it has been held that even a bequest to trustees to be applied in their discretion for \u201c benevolent, charitable and religious purposes,\u201d was too uncertain to be supported. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Kershaw, </em>5 Law J. (N. S.) Ch. 84; <em>S. C. </em>5 Cl. &amp; F. 111. <em>Norris </em>v. <em>Thomson, </em>4 C. E. Green, 307, and 5 C. E. Green, 489. On the other hand, it.has been held by this court, and by the House of Lords, that \u201cbenevolent,\u201d when coupled with \u201c charitable \u201d or any equivalent word, or used in such connection, or applied to such public institutions or corporations, as to manifest an intent to make it synonymous with \u201c charitable,\u201d might have effect according to that intent. <em>Saltonstall </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>11 Allen, 446. <em>Rotch </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>105 Mass. 431, 434. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>2 Wils. &amp; Shaw, 80. <em>Crichton </em>v. <em>Grierson. 3 </em>Bligh N.

C. </em>2 Shaw &amp; Mac. 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>In the case before us, the devise contains no qualifying or explanatory words, and falls precisely within the case of <em>James </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>3 Meriv. 17, and the reasons there given. A bequest to executors, \u201c in trust to be by them applied and disposed of for and to such benevolent purposes as they in their integrity and discretion may unanimously agree on,\u201d was there held to be void for uncertainty, and distributable among the next of kin; and Sir William Grant said: \u201c Although many charitable institutions are very properly called \u2018 benevolent,\u2019 it is impossible to say that every object of a man\u2019s benevolence is also an object of his charity.\u201d \u201c What authority would this court have to say that the property must not be applied to purposes however so benevolent, unless they also come within the technical denomination of charitable purposes ? If it might, consistently with the will, be applied to other than strictly charitable purposes, the trust is too indefinite for the court to execute.\u201d That decision has never been doubted, and is strongly supported by the arguments of Sir Samuel Romilly and the judgments of Sir William Grant and Lord Eldon in <em>Morice </em>v. <em>Bishop of Durham, </em>9 Ves. 399, and 10 Ves. 521, and by the opinions of Lord Brougham in <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Haberdashers\u2019 Co. </em>1 Myl. <em>&amp; </em>K. 420, 428, and Lord Langdale in <em>Nash </em>v. <em>Morley, </em>5 Beav. 177, 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">As the duration of the trust now in question is unlimited, and the trust property might, in full accordance with the terms of the devise, be wholly applied by the trustees in their discretion to uses and purposes which are not regarded by the law as charitable, the trust is wholly void, and the property must go to the heir at law and residuary devisee. <em>Decree </em>accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
