There was also evidence tending to show certain circumstances which occurred during the detention of the plaintiff on the boat, and which, he contended,, were circumstances of aggravation, which the jury were authorized and it was their duty to consider in estimating the damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-5\">\u201c The defendants offered evidence tending to show that their rules and practice at the time in question, and for many years before, required each passenger to deliver up his boat ticket on leaving the boat, on her arrival, (but there was no other evidence that these rules and practices were made known to the plaintiff;) that the regular fare from Fall River to New York, by the boat, was four dollars; that the clerk, in putting the number of the berth on the ticket, did so by writing it with a lead pencil; that it was impracticable to collect tickets at any other time than upon arrival; that frequently at Fall River passengers came on board accompanied by relatives or friends, who would select state rooms for them; that it. was impracticable to require all persons to purchase tickets before coming on board, or to collect tickets during the passage, as it was a night passage, and an unreasonable annoyance to passengers to enter their state rooms to collect tick\u00e9ts, and examine how many persons were in each state room; that it was a common occurrence on the boats of the defendants, for people to claim that they had lost their tickets; that such a ticket as the plaintiff claimed to have had, was good to any other person presenting it for a passage at any time, and was received as good by the defendants; that, when such tickets were presented to the defendants, at their offices, four dollars were paid to the holder, if he desired it, and the defendants were satisfied he was such without fraud; and that the defendants committed no assault on the plaintiff, except to put out the hand and tell him he could not pass till he showed his ticket, or paid his fare.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-6\">\u201c The plaintiff requested the judge to rule that the defendants had no right to detain him on board of the boat against his will, or prevent his leaving it after having once purchased and paid for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>his ticket if he had lost it, and so could not give it up, nor for the reason that he did not produce evidence satisfactory to the defendants\u2019 agents that such were the facts, nor even if he was fraudulently trying to get his passage without a ticket, and without paying the fare ; and that the fact of the defendants\u2019 agents detaining the plaintiff and taking the fare from him was conclusive evidence that the defendants detained him for the purpose of compelling him to pay the fare.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-5\"><em>\u201c </em>The judge declined so to rule, and ruled, among other things not excepted to, that the defendants\u2019 contract with passengers was not only to carry them, but for good treatment to them; that if the plaintiff did buy tickets at the station of the Old Colony <em>&amp; </em>Newport Railway in Boston for a passage from Boston to Philadelphia, among which was a ticket for a passage from Fall River to New York, it was his duty, if he knew that he was to give up the boat ticket before leaving the boat, to deliver it to the proper officer of the boat, upon proper demand made upon him therefor by the proper officer, or to pay the fare ; that if the plaintiff had lost his ticket, it would be his own loss, and not one which the defendants were to bear; that the law gave the defendants a lien on the baggage of the plaintiff, but not on his person; that they had no right to detain him till he did pay his fare or give up a ticket, or to compel him to pay his fare or give up a ticket; but that if he knew that he was to give up his ticket before leaving the boat, the defendants had a right, if he did not give it up or pay his fare, to detain him for a reasonable time to investigate on the spot the circumstances of his case, and, if the jury found that the defendants detained him for the purpose of compelling him to pay his fare or to give up his ticket, or detained him for the purpose of investigating his case for an unreasonable time, or in an unreasonable way, he was entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-6\">\u201c The judge also ruled that the detaining the plaintiff and taking the four dollars from him was evidence, but not conclusive evidence, that he was detained for the purpose of compelling the payment, and gave other rulings applicable to the case not excepted to, except as herein stated. The jury returned a verdict \u2666or the plaintiff for $50.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>\u201c To the rulings given, and the refusals to rule as requested, the plaintiff alleged exceptions.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b532-5\"><em>J.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Azo\">The jury having found a verdict for the plaintiff for $50, he excepts to all the rulings of the judge who tried the cause, and to his refusals to rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>1. He contends that it should not have been left to the jury to find whether the plaintiff knew he was to give up the boat ticket before leaving the boat, because there was no evidence whatever tending to prove such knowledge. But from the manner in which passengers purchase tickets, and the use necessary to be made of them, any person of ordinary intelligence would infer that they are to be given up on the boat to some officer, and as they had not been called for earlier, he would naturally suppose that they would be called for at the time of leaving the boat. Whether the plaintiff knew it was a question for the jury, under the circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">2. He contends that the defendants had no right forcibly to detain the plaintiff at all for the purpose of investigating on the spot the circumstances of the case. As passenger carriers the defendants had a right to make reasonable rules and regulations. It would be obviously reasonable to require passengers to purchase tickets at the office before the boat started, instead of taking money on board, and to give up these tickets at the end of the voyage while passengers were leaving the boat. If a passenger should attempt to leave without producing a ticket, and should allege that he had lost it, they would need to investigate the matter, and to ascertain the reason of his conduct, and to make reasonable provision for their own security. The ruling requested that they had no right to detain him, even if he was fraudulently trying to get his passage without a ticket and- without paying the fare, was properly refused. The ruling was proper that if the plaintiff lost his ticket it would be his own loss, and not one which the defendants were to <em>bear; </em>and it was sufficiently favorable to the plaintiff to rule \u201c that they had no right to detain him till he did pay his fare or give up a ticket, or to compel him to pay his fare or give up a ticket; but that if he knew that he was to give up his ticket before leaving the boat, the defendants had a right, if he did not give it up or pay his fare, to detain him for a reasonable time to investigate on the spot the circumstances of his case; and if the jury found that the defendants detained him for the purpose of compelling him to pay his fare or to give up his ticket, or detained him for the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>pose of investigating his case for an unreasonable time, or in an unreasonable way, he was entitled to recover.\u201d Under this ruling the jury found for the plaintiff. As he had sufficient money to pay his fare, as it was his duty to do, he himself was the unnecessary cause of his own detention for two hours, and the damages found by the jury seem to be ample. Upon the ruling and verdict, the other points insisted upon in the plaintiff\u2019s brief become immaterial. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
