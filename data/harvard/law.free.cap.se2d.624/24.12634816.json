Harris appeals from the judgment of the Circuit Court of the City of Newport News which granted the demurrer of the defendant, Jeffrey S. Kreutzer, Ph.D., and dismissed her motion for judgment with prejudice. For the reasons set forth below, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court dismissing Count III of the motion for judgment alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress, but will reverse that portion of the judgment which dismissed Count I alleging medical malpractice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. BACKGROUND AND MATERIAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Harris alleged she sustained a traumatic brain injury as the result of an automobile accident in 1991. She brought a personal injury action in 1992 seeking damages resulting from that accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court in that case granted the defendant's request and ordered Harris to undergo a medical examination pursuant to Rule 4:10 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to determine the nature and extent of her claimed brain injury. The defendant in the automobile accident case retained Dr. Kreutzer, a licensed clinical psychologist with a subspecialty in neuropsychology, to conduct the examination. The case at bar concerns Harris' claims against Dr. Kreutzer for his conduct of the court-ordered examination on January 19, 1996 (\"the Rule 4:10 examination\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 7, 2003, Harris filed the present motion for judgment against Dr. Kreutzer, alleging separate counts of medical malpractice, defamation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and intentional infliction of emotional distress arising out of the Rule 4:10 examination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Harris contends that Dr. Kreutzer, in undertaking the Rule 4:10 examination, owed a duty to her to exercise reasonable and ordinary care and to avoid causing her harm in the conduct of the examination. She further contends that Dr. Kreutzer knew of her pre-existing mental and emotional conditions\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and knew that she would be susceptible to further harm if treated in an abusive manner during the examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Regarding the medical malpractice claim (\"Count I\"), the motion for judgment specifically alleges that Dr. Kreutzer \"verbally abused [Harris], raised his voice to her, caused her to break down into tears in his office, stated she was `putting on a show,' and accused her of being a faker and malingerer.\" Harris contends that despite his knowledge of her condition, Dr. Kreutzer \"intentionally aggravated her pre-existing condition and her post-traumatic stress disorder and her brain injury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Further, Harris also contends Dr. Kreutzer breached his duty to her in the conduct of the Rule 4:10 examination because he \"failed to comply with the applicable standard of care within his profession in that he: a. failed to appropriately examine and evaluate the mental status of the plaintiff ... and d. was deliberately abusive to plaintiff with disregard for the consequences of his conduct.\" As a result, Harris claims her mental and physical health \"drastically deteriorate[d].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Harris averred in Count III of the motion for judgment that Dr. Kreutzer's conduct during the Rule 4:10 examination was \"intentionally designed to inflict emotional distress upon [her] or was done with reckless disregard for the consequences when he knew or should have known that emotional distress would result.\" (\"Count III\"). Furthermore, Harris contended Dr. Kreutzer's conduct was outrageous and the resulting emotional distress she suffered was severe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Dr. Kreutzer filed a demurrer to the motion for judgment specifically arguing that a Rule 4:10 examination did not create a physician-patient relationship, so he owed no legally cognizable duty to Harris. Thus, Dr. Kreutzer contended Count I stated no claim for medical malpractice as a matter of law. In the alternative, Dr. Kreutzer averred that if, arguendo, a claim for medical malpractice could exist in a Rule 4:10 context, Harris nevertheless \"fails to allege any facts which constitute a breach of the standard of care required of a reasonably prudent clinical psychologist.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As to Count III, Dr. Kreutzer argued that Harris failed to allege facts which would support a claim for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress. Specifically, Dr. Kreutzer contended that the motion for judgment did not show his conduct was outrageous or that Harris' injuries were severe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After a hearing, the trial court granted Dr. Kreutzer's demurrer as to all counts and dismissed Harris' motion for judgment with prejudice by an Order entered January 7, 2005, which incorporated its bench ruling. The trial court did not specifically find, in the bench ruling or in the order, that a cause of action for medical malpractice was cognizable for conduct during a Rule 4:10 examination. The trial court opined, however, that \"I understand that there can be situations in which a cause of action is stated even with an IME. The Court is of the opinion that this is not such an example.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court then stated, \"I don't see the proper factual allegations to support ... either count one or count three.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We awarded Harris this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.

ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal, Harris assigns error to the trial court's grant of the demurrer to Counts I and III. She avers that the trial court erred as to Count I because Dr. Kreutzer \"owed a duty to Harris to conduct the examination in a manner not to cause [her] harm.\" In addition, Harris asserts her motion for judgment alleged sufficient facts to show Dr. Kreutzer \"had breached that duty, that he breached the standard of care, and that Harris suffered damage as a result.\" Harris also contends the trial court erred in granting the demurrer as to Count III because her motion for judgment did state \"a cause of action for\n   intentional infliction of emotional distress under Virginia law.\" We address each assignment of error in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A. Medical Malpractice-Count I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The initial issue raised by the assignment of error as to Count I is a matter of first impression in Virginia: Is there a cognizable cause of action sounding in medical malpractice for the conduct of a Rule 4:10 examination? In resolving this question, we find guidance in our existing malpractice jurisprudence, the language of the medical malpractice statutes, Code \u00a7 8.01-581.1, et seq., and decisions from other states which have addressed this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Harris acknowledges that \"medical malpractice cases arise out of consensual physician-patient relationships\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that a Rule 4:10 examination does not involve a \"traditional physician/patient relationship.\" Nonetheless, Harris argues that \"[t]he limited relationship between the examiner and the plaintiff encompasses a duty by the examiner to exercise care consistent with his professional training and expertise so as not to cause physical harm by negligently conducting the examination.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Harris cites to other jurisdictions which unanimously hold that \"a physician owes a duty of care to a nonpatient examinee to `conduct [a court-ordered] examination in a manner not to cause harm to the person being examined.'\" Harris posits as a \"reasonable rule\" in Virginia \"that physicians conduct their Rule 4:10 examinations in a manner not to cause harm to the people being examined.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Harris argues that a cause of action for medical malpractice is properly pled if it is alleged that the defendant physician breached the duty to cause no harm in the conduct of the examination by violating the applicable standard of care. As in any other medical malpractice action, the plaintiff has the burden to show the standard of care and that the physician's alleged violation of the standard of care in conducting the examination proximately caused the alleged injury.\n   <em>\n    See Bryan v. Burt,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"99551\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/254/28/#p34\">\n    254 Va. 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 34,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=486%20S.E.2d%20536\">\n    486 S.E.2d 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 539-40 (1997). Assuming she has properly pled a cause of action for malpractice, Harris maintains her motion for judgment stated facts sufficient to survive a demurrer to Count I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Dr. Kreutzer responds that Harris' claim under Count I must fail as a matter of law because a cause of action for malpractice requires a consensual physician/patient relationship. He notes that Harris alleged no consensual relationship. Indeed, Dr. Kreutzer contends that no consensual physician/patient relationship can exist in a Rule 4:10 examination because it is by its very nature adversarial. In the absence of such a relationship, Dr. Kreutzer posits that he owed no duty to Harris in the conduct of the Rule 4:10 examination, and therefore no claim for malpractice can lie as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Next, Dr. Kreutzer argues that even if one assumes, arguendo, that a cause of action for malpractice may arise for the conduct of a Rule 4:10 examination, the trial court correctly held that the motion for judgment failed to state facts which would support a claim that he deviated from the applicable standard of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A number of states have addressed the issue whether a physician owes a duty to the person examined in a court-ordered medical examination, which if breached, establishes a cause of action for malpractice. While all the courts addressing this issue have found a cause of action to exist, the denomination of the basis of that cause of action has not been\n   uniform.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the Supreme Court of Colorado noted in\n   <em>\n    Greenberg v. Perkins,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10355661\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/845/530/#p535\">\n    845 P.2d 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 535 (Colo.1993), \"[t]he cases that consider the duty of care issue in circumstances where a physician conducts a medical examination of a person at the request of an employer, insurer, or other third person are remarkable for the diversity of their analyses.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In the case at bar, the trial court made no explicit ruling that a cause of action sounding in malpractice exists in a Rule 4:10 setting. However, the trial court implied that a cause of action does exist by its statement that Harris' motion for judgment failed to survive the demurrer because insufficient facts were pled to support it. Therefore, we begin our analysis with an inquiry as to whether a cause of action for medical malpractice may be recognized in a Rule 4:10 context in Virginia. We conclude that such a cause of action can lie under the appropriate facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Dr. Kreutzer is correct that our prior cases have noted that a physician's liability for malpractice is predicated upon an initial finding that a consensual agreement exists between physician and patient, establishing a relationship from which flows the physician's duty of care. \"A physician's duty arises only upon the creation of a physician-patient relationship; that relationship springs from a consensual transaction, a contract, express or implied, general or special ....\"\n   <em>\n    Lyons v. Grether,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2130627\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/218/630/#p633\">\n    218 Va. 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 633,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=239%20S.E.2d%20103\">\n    239 S.E.2d 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 105 (1977);\n   <em>\n    accord Didato v. Strehler,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4204427\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/262/617/#p626\">\n    262 Va. 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 626,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=554%20S.E.2d%2042\">\n    554 S.E.2d 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 47 (2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   While a physician/patient relationship between Dr. Kreutzer and Harris did not exist in the traditional sense, that factor is not dispositive in a Rule 4:10 examination setting. Although a Rule 4:10 examination will rarely involve an express consensual contract between the physician and the examinee, the consensual nature of the physician/patient relationship may be \"express or implied.\" Under the facts of this case, Harris' consent was implied, and Dr. Kreutzer's consent was express so as to establish a limited physician/patient relationship for the Rule 4:10 examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   By filing her motion for judgment in the automobile accident case, Harris consented to the requirements of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia for the prosecution of her suit. See Rule 3:1. When a plaintiff places her \"mental or physical condition ... in controversy\" by filing suit, she expresses an implied consent to a medical examination under Rule 4:10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the Rules, a plaintiff must, under proper circumstances, submit to an examination or her action may be dismissed. Rule 4:12(b)(2). By bringing her personal injury action, Harris gave her implied consent to the Rule 4:10 examination and formed a limited relationship with Dr. Kreutzer for purposes of the examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   A physician or health care provider, such as Dr. Kreutzer, who performs a Rule 4:10 examination, expressly consents to a relationship with the examinee when he agrees to conduct the examination. Therefore, we conclude there is a consensual relationship between the physician and the examinee as patient for the performance of the Rule 4:10 examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We next determine, in the context of the Rule 4:10 examination relationship, whether the physician has a duty cognizable under the malpractice statutes, Code \u00a7 8.01-581.1,\n   et seq., the breach of which establishes a cause of action for malpractice for the conduct of the examination. We look to the statutorily defined terms establishing an act of malpractice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Code \u00a7 8.01-581.1 defines malpractice as \"any ... action for personal injuries ... based on health care or professional services rendered ... by a health care provider, to a patient.\" We conclude that conduction of the Rule 4:10 examination is \"health care\" rendered by a \"health care provider,\" in the person of Dr. Kreutzer, to a \"patient,\" Harris.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The statute defines \"Health care\" as \"any act ... performed... by any health care provider for [or] to ... a patient during the patient's medical diagnosis.\" The Rule 4:10 examination is an \"act\" by Dr. Kreutzer for a medical diagnosis of Harris because her \"mental or physical condition ... is in controversy.\" While a court orders the medical diagnosis for its own benefit and the benefit of the other parties to the litigation, neither Rule 4:10 nor Code \u00a7 8.01-581.1 limits the acts constituting \"health care\" to medical diagnoses undertaken only for the patient's benefit. Thus, we find a Rule 4:10 examination is \"health care\" within the meaning of Code \u00a7 8.01-581.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As \"a person ... licensed by this Commonwealth to provide health care ... as a ... clinical psychologist,\" Dr. Kreutzer is a \"health care provider\" under Code \u00a7 8.01-581.1. Harris is a \"patient\" because she is a \"natural person who receives or should have received health care [(the Rule 4:10 examination)] from a licensed health care provider.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=554%20S.E.2d%2042\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, under the plain language of the malpractice statute, Code \u00a7 8.01-581.1, a cause of action for malpractice may lie in the context of a Rule 4:10 examination because \"health care\" is provided by a \"health care provider\" to a \"patient\" which allegedly resulted in personal injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Although a malpractice cause of action may lie for the conduct of a Rule 4:10 examination, the scope of such a cause of action is very limited. This is true, in part, because the nature of the physician/patient relationship in a Rule 4:10 examination is strictly circumscribed. As the Supreme Court of Michigan noted in its consideration of this issue, the physician/patient relationship relative to a court-ordered examination\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   does not involve the full panoply of the physician's typical responsibilities to diagnose and treat the examinee for medical conditions. The IME physician, acting at the behest of a third party, is not liable to the examinee for damages resulting from the conclusions the physician reaches or reports....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The patient is not in a traditional professional relationship with the physician. Nonetheless, he places his physical person in the hands of another who holds that position solely because of his training and experience. The recognition of a limited relationship preserves the principle that the IME physician has undertaken limited duties but that he has done so in a situation where he is \"expected to exercise reasonable care commensurate with his experience and training.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Dyer v. Trachtman,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1414147\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/470/45/\">\n    470 Mich. 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=679%20N.W.2d%20311\">\n    679 N.W.2d 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 314-15, 316 (2004) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The physician's professional duty in the conduct of a Rule 4:10 examination relates solely to the actual performance of the examination. Unlike a physician in a traditional physician/patient relationship, a Rule 4:10 examiner has no duty to diagnose or treat the patient, and no liability may arise from his report or testimony regarding the examination. Because the Rule 4:10 examination functions only to ascertain information relative to the underlying litigation, the physician's duty in a Rule 4:10 setting is solely to examine the patient without harming her in the conduct of the examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Cases from other jurisdictions are clear that an examining physician's only duty is to do no harm in the conduct of the examination, and any malpractice liability is restricted to a breach of that duty only. For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Dyer,\n   </em>\n   the physician conducting the court-ordered examination allegedly knew the examinee had significant restricted movement\n   in his arm and shoulder.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=679%20N.W.2d%20311\">\n    679 N.W.2d at 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We conclude Harris' factual allegations were sufficient to survive the demurrer, and the trial court erred in ruling otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Harris alleged that Dr. Kreutzer \"failed to comply with the applicable standard of care within his profession in that he failed to appropriately examine and evaluate the mental status of the plaintiff\" and \"fail[ed] to provide appropriate psychological care in performing his examination and evaluation.\" Specifically, Harris averred Dr. Kreutzer \"verbally abused [her], raised his voice to her, caused her to break down in tears in his office, stated she was `putting on a show', and accused her of being a faker and malingerer\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   during the Rule 4:10 examination, despite his alleged prior knowledge of her fragile mental and emotional state. If such conduct was proven at trial, and appropriate expert testimony showed such conduct breached the applicable standard of care for a reasonably prudent clinical psychologist in Virginia, then a trier of fact could conclude that malpractice occurred within the limited scope of a Rule 4:10 examination as described above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In short, Harris' motion for judgment alleged that Dr. Kreutzer breached the applicable standard of care by his specific acts during the Rule 4:10 examination. Harris averred that as a \"direct and proximate result\" of that breach, she \"sustained severe psychological trauma and mental anguish affecting her mental and physical well-being.\" Specifically, she suffered \"nightmares, difficulty sleeping and extreme loss of self-esteem and depression, requiring additional psychological treatment and counseling\" as a \"direct result\" of Dr. Kreutzer's conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Therefore, we conclude that Harris pled sufficient facts to sustain a cause of action for malpractice in the conduct of a Rule 4:10 examination. She pled that the defendant breached the applicable standard of care \"within his profession\" by stating specific acts of conduct which were the alleged proximate cause of her claimed injuries. Accordingly, her motion for judgment was sufficient to withstand a demurrer, and the trial court erred in granting the demurrer and dismissing Count I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   B.

A \"physician\" is included within the more comprehensive term \"health care provider\" which also includes a licensed clinical psychologist such as Dr. Kreutzer. We use the term \"physician\" in this opinion to include Dr. Kreutzer and other health care providers, who are not \"physicians,\" to maintain continuity with the language of the parties and that of the cases which address the issue of malpractice in the context of a Rule 4:10 examination.
