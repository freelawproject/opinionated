Defendant cannot, as he attempts in this appeal, challenge the witness' reliability by attempting to introduce on appeal scientific literature that was not first presented to the trial court. Since we find defendant's other arguments also to be unpersuasive, we conclude that defendant received a trial free of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The State's evidence tended to show the following. Prior to the fall of 2001, defendant and Teresa Adams had been dating in an on-again, off-again relationship. In the fall of 2001, both defendant and Adams were living in Durham, but Adams had started dating Matthew Jacobie, defendant's next door neighbor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On a Sunday afternoon that fall, defendant came to Jacobie's house looking for Adams. Jacobie's roommate, Stacy Wong, told Adams that defendant was outside, and Adams went with defendant into his house. Subsequently, Adams told Wong and Jacobie that defendant had said that somebody was going to get hurt if she kept visiting Jacobie's house and that defendant had tried to choke her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following Tuesday, 2 October 2001, Adams told her roommate, Patricia Andrus, that she was going out for a few hours and if she was not back by midnight, to go ahead and put the alarm on. Andrus stayed awake until about 1:00 a.m., but Adams had not yet returned home. By lunchtime the next day, Andrus still had not seen Adams, and there was no indication that Adams had slept in her room. Three days later, on 5 October 2001, Andrus filed a missing persons report with the Durham Police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ramal Lowery, a friend of defendant's, testified that defendant called him several times on the night of 2 October and in the early morning hours of 3 October. During the last call, defendant asked Lowery to come to his house so that they could talk about something important. When Lowery arrived, defendant told him that he had killed Adams. Because Lowery did not believe him, defendant had Lowery drive the two of them to an area off Hillandale Road in Durham. Defendant told Lowery to park in a wooded area beyond a parking lot, and Lowery could see a body laying on the ground when he got out of his car. As Lowery drove back to defendant's home, defendant kept saying, \"I'm a piece of shit, I shouldn't have done it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant also told Lowery that he needed to get rid of the gun used to kill Adams. Once they reached defendant's house, defendant went inside and came out with a duffle bag. They drove down Highway 751 to a bridge. Defendant took a brown paper bag out of the duffle bag and threw it over the bridge. Defendant told Lowery that a gun was inside the bag.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On 5 October 2001, the police received a call that there was a body on the side of the road near the intersection of Hillandale Road and Horton Road. Officers found Adams' body, which was already decomposing, in a ditch about five to 10 feet off the road. Adams had suffered two gunshot wounds, one to the right side of the back of the head and the other to her neck. The medical examiner estimated that the time of death was approximately two to three days before the body was discovered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Durham police subsequently found a gun near a creek that ran underneath Highway 751 in Chatham County. Teresa Powell, an agent with the State Bureau of Investigation, conducted tests on the gun found near the creek and the bullets removed from Adams' body. In Powell's opinion, the bullets were fired from the gun recovered near the creek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant was indicted for the first degree murder of Teresa Adams. At trial, defendant did not present any evidence. The jury found defendant guilty of first degree murder, and defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant contends that the trial court erred under Rule 702 of the Rules of Evidence by admitting Powell's ballistics testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant argues that Agent Powell did not comply with \"normally accepted scientific methodology\" and that \"Ms. Powell's results should not have been accepted under\n   <em>\n    Daubert.\n   </em>\n   \" Defendant further objects that \"[f]or scientific evidence to be admissible, the expert must point to external sources that validate the methodology,\" citing\n   <em>\n    Daubert v.

On appeal, however, defendant relies upon a series of journal articles that he contends establish that Agent Powell improperly failed to use photographs to document her work and that her methodology failed to comply with accepted scientific methods. Those articles were not, however, presented to the trial judge. A defendant cannot establish an abuse of discretion by the trial judge based on scientific literature never provided to that judge.

Subsequently, the State made the second argument challenged by defendant as not supported by the evidence:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   [Prosecutor]: What do you think Mr. Anderson was doing? He didn't just bring his keys and his cell phone, did he? What did he bring? A loaded .357. What kind of love is that? In his mind it was until death do us part. See, if he couldn't have her, nobody would. And he drove her out right down the street from her house. You all saw that blood on the side of the road over here.\n   <em>\n    Shot her there and drug her in the woods.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   [Defense counsel]: There's no evidence of that either, Your Honor. Objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   THE COURT: She may argue any inference from the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   (Emphasis added.) We believe that the State's suggestion that Adams met defendant to settle matters with him and that defendant shot Adams on the side of the road before dragging her into the woods are inferences that reasonably can be drawn from the evidence presented. Even if that were not the case, in light of the evidence, any error from the statements was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendant also points to the prosecutor's expression of opinion on defendant's possible theory of the case:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Now, I'm going to sit down and let you all listen to [the defense attorney]. And he'll bring up a lot of things that Ramal said that were different, not a hundred percent like he likes them. He may even try to throw out there maybe Ramal killed him.\n   <em>\n    I mean that is just crazy.\n   </em>\n   He might do that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Defendant argues this is an impermissible expression of the prosecutor's personal beliefs. We agree that this remark was improper under N.C.
