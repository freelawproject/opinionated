Defendant was found guilty of first-degree murder both on the basis of malice, premeditation and deliberation and on the basis of felony murder. Following a capital sentencing proceeding, the jury found that the mitigating circumstances were insufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstances and recommended a sentence of death. The trial court entered judgment on 17 March 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On 9 June 2002, Daniel Branch told his wife Barbara that he and defendant were going to travel to Asheboro. According to Barbara, defendant was an acquaintance who was supposed to help Branch sell some firearms. After loading several long guns into his 1977 blue Thunderbird, Branch left home around 11:00 or 11:30 that morning. She never saw him alive again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The next day, Barbara filed a missing persons report and Detective Kevin Ray of the High Point Police Department began an investigation. On 11 June 2002, while pursuing a lead that defendant had been seen in West Virginia driving a Thunderbird matching the description of Branch's vehicle, Detective Ray discovered that defendant had been romantically involved with Kim Persinger in West Virginia and that she was pregnant with his child. Kim's brother indicated to Detective Ray that Branch had been killed in North Carolina and that his body was in a field near the Montgomery and Randolph County line.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Detective Ray and High Point Police Detective Lieutenant Dick Shuping searched a large, cleared tract of land at the described location and found the body of Daniel Branch. The victim was lying on his back and one of his pockets had been pulled out. The investigators observed that he appeared to have suffered gunshot wounds to the torso and head. Two expended shotgun shell casings were found near his body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   That same day, state police and sheriffs in West Virginia began searching for defendant and the victim's blue Thunderbird. Acting on a tip, investigators located both at a convenience store near Rock Creek, where defendant was taken into custody without incident. During the arrest, defendant stated that \"he was just glad that it was over\" and that \"he had killed a guy in North Carolina.\" Even though he was given his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, defendant continued to talk, repeating that he had killed a man in North Carolina with a shotgun and brought his car to West Virginia. Shortly thereafter, the\n   arresting officers allowed defendant to visit the Persinger residence, where he spoke briefly with Kim and other members of her family. Defendant was then transported to the state police detachment in Beckley, where he again was advised of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. After waiving those rights, defendant confessed to the murder of Daniel Branch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In his confession, defendant said that he knew Branch from having traded guns with him in the past. Defendant claimed that the victim called him the day before the murder and asked him to meet to trade some guns. Defendant said that \"[he] knew [he] was going to kill [Branch]\" as soon as their telephone conversation ended and \"began to plan.\" The next day, defendant met Branch at the field where the killing occurred to purchase a twelve-gauge Mossberg pump shotgun. When defendant asked Branch if he could test-fire the weapon, the victim agreed. At defendant's urging, Branch walked into the field to set up some cans and bottles. As he did, defendant opened fire, shooting the victim three times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the first shot, which defendant indicated struck Branch in the ribs or stomach, the victim yelled \"no, no, don't shoot,\" and turned to run. Defendant shot Branch again, hitting him in the side and causing him to fall. Defendant then walked toward the victim and shot him in the head. After the final shot, defendant reached into the victim's pocket, took his keys, and left the scene in Branch's car. An autopsy confirmed that Branch had suffered shotgun wounds in his lower left chest and abdominal area, in his right side, and in his right jaw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant told the officers that the Mossberg shotgun was at the house of a relative, Leon Burgess, where he had traded it for a .410 gauge shotgun. Burgess later confirmed the trade and gave the murder weapon to the investigators. A .410 gauge shotgun was recovered from the victim's Thunderbird that defendant had been driving when arrested. Defendant also stated that he had sold Branch's .22 caliber rifle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   During the interview, defendant said that the victim had not provoked or threatened him and declined to give a reason for the shooting. He said he did not know the victim that well, but that he was \"an okay guy.\" Defendant stated that he was not sorry for killing Branch but that he felt sorry for the victim's family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant did not testify at trial. During the guilt phase of the trial, he presented instead James H. Hilkey, Ph.D., an expert forensic psychologist, who testified that defendant suffered from borderline personality disorder, traits of antisocial personality disorder, and depression. Dr. Hilkey stated that, in his opinion, defendant's psychological disorders \"affected his ability to weigh and consider the consequences of his actions and to form specific intent to kill.\" Dr. Hilkey was also of the opinion that at the time of the shooting, defendant \"was under the influence of a mental or emotional disturbance and his capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was impaired.\" However, Dr. Hilkey also testified that defendant's \"clearly average\" I.Q. was 104 and that he knew killing the victim was wrong. Dr. Hilkey found no signs that defendant suffered from neurological damage or distortions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Additional facts will be set forth as necessary for the discussion of specific issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    JURY SELECTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant contends he is entitled to a new trial because the trial court failed to take appropriate action when it learned that a prospective alternate juror brought a newspaper article dealing with the trial into the jury room during jury selection. The record indicates that jury selection commenced on Tuesday, 2 March 2004, and by mid-morning Friday, 5 March 2004, twelve jurors had been seated. After consulting with counsel for the State and for defendant, the trial court elected to select three alternate jurors. Selection of the alternates began after the morning recess that same Friday and continued into the afternoon. After one alternate was chosen, prospective alternate juror Paul Biedrzycki was called. During\n   <em>\n    voir dire,\n   </em>\n   Biedrzycki stated that he had read a newspaper article concerning the case in the jury room \"about half an hour ago.\" Biedrzycki\n   was excused for cause, then questioned in greater detail as to the newspaper in the jury room. He explained that someone in the jury room had been reading a local newspaper article about the trial and he had asked if he could read it. The headline of the article was to the effect that defendant admitted guilt. Biedrzycki added that the newspaper had not been present in the room on either of the preceding days but was there when he returned to the jury room that afternoon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defense counsel moved for a mistrial based on the article's contents and the jury's disobedience of the trial court's prior instructions not to read any extraneous material. After hearing arguments from defendant and the State, the trial court observed that the twelve jurors already chosen had left the courthouse by the time the article appeared in the jury room, and denied the motion. Shortly thereafter, the trial court brought the remaining prospective alternate jurors into the courtroom, explicitly instructed them not to read any press accounts about the case nor bring any newspapers to court, then excused them for the weekend recess. The court also made arrangements to ensure that the prospective alternates who were scheduled to arrive the following Monday would not mix with the jurors who had already been chosen. The bailiff then retrieved the newspaper from the jury room and the court admitted into evidence as a pretrial exhibit the 5 March 2004 Randolph County edition of the\n   <em>\n    News &amp; Record\n   </em>\n   that contained an article headlined \"High Point man admits to killing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The following Monday, sixteen prospective alternate jurors were individually questioned. Several reported that they had seen or read the article or heard it discussed in the jury room on the preceding Friday. One of the twelve admitted bringing newspapers into the jury room every day but added that the Friday paper was the only one that any other juror had borrowed and read. Of the two alternate jurors that were selected from this pool of twelve, one had read the Friday article but had heard no discussion about it and said he could disregard what he had read. The other said that he had seen but not read the newspaper and had not observed anyone else reading it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We first address defendant's argument that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial. Upon motion by a defendant, \"[t]he judge must declare a mistrial . . . if there occurs during the trial an error or legal defect in the proceedings, or conduct inside or outside the courtroom, resulting in substantial and irreparable prejudice to the defendant's case.\" N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-1061 (2005). \"The decision to grant or deny a mistrial rests within the sound discretion of the trial court\" and will be reversed on appeal only upon \"a clear showing that the trial court abused its discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Bonney,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2556466\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/329/61/#p73\">\n    329 N.C. 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 73,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=405%20S.E.2d%20145\">\n    405 S.E.2d 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 152 (1991). Thus, a mistrial should not be allowed unless \"`there are improprieties in the trial so serious that they substantially and irreparably prejudice the defendant's case and make it impossible for the defendant to receive a fair and impartial verdict.'\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=405%20S.E.2d%20145\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   When the trial court initially denied defendant's motion for a mistrial on Friday, 5 March 2004, it stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Well, I'm going to note that by the time according to this juror, by the time the newspaper appeared in the jury pool room there were none of the twelve jurors present, they had all been sent home. So at least as to the twelve jurors it does not taint them. We will probably have to ask the remaining ones about the newspaper, and I am going to instruct them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   . . . Because we only have seated one alternate, the others were not present at the time this alleged newspaper got loose in the jury room. I do not believe at this point that the defense has shown substantial and irreparable harm under the statute, and so in my discretion I am denying the motion for a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The following Monday, defendant twice renewed his mistrial motion during the examination of prospective alternate jurors. The trial court again denied it on similar grounds:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The motion, in my discretion, is denied on the same grounds as I stated on Friday. We have twelve jurors that were seated who were not present in the jury room at\n   the time these discussions took place, so they have presumably not been tainted. We have one alternate seated that was not tainted. And I'm going to continue to go through these alternate jurors, and I will allow you to ask questions, but at this point, while there certainly appears to have been some potential juror misconduct, it has not affected the twelve jurors that were seated to be the actual tryers [sic] of the facts in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The court then completed selection of alternate jurors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Although defendant argues that insufficient evidence existed to support the trial court's findings, our review of the record reveals no abuse of discretion. At the close of court on Thursday, 4 March 2004, ten jurors had been selected. The final two jurors were seated the morning of Friday, 5 March 2004, then excused until the following Monday. The court reconvened on the afternoon of that same Friday to select three alternate jurors. After alternate juror Anna Frye was chosen, prospective alternate juror Biedrzycki mentioned the newspaper in the jury room, advising the trial court that \"[i]t was only there . . . the last half hour or hour\" and that \"[t]here was nothing in there yesterday or the day before.\" This testimony provided initial support for the trial court's finding that none of the twelve jurors selected for the sitting panel were in the jury room by the time the article appeared there and that defendant had not shown the substantial and irreparable harm required by N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-1061 for declaration of a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As to the prospective alternates who were examined on Monday, 8 March 2004, defendant focuses on the testimony of Donald Reese, who eventually was excused for cause unrelated to the newspaper. On\n   <em>\n    voir dire,\n   </em>\n   Reese stated that he had read the article in the Friday newspaper and that he was responsible for the newspaper's appearance in the jury room. He also reported that he had brought a newspaper to court every day during jury selection and had overheard conversations about the case. However, Reese added that, except for the first day of jury selection when one juror borrowed the first page but then was \"called in [the courtroom] right away,\" no one asked to borrow his newspaper until Friday, the day he heard the jurors' discussions. In addition, while other prospective alternate jurors questioned on Monday expressed some knowledge of the article or had overheard discussions in the jury room from the preceding Friday, none stated definitively that the newspaper was present in the room before Friday afternoon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   This evidence is consistent with the voir dire testimony of James Phillips and Sheila Thompson, the final two regular jurors selected on Friday morning. Both were asked whether they had read, heard, or watched any news reports or heard discussions about the case. Phillips answered the question in the negative and made no mention of the article. Thompson similarly made no comment about any newspaper article in the jury room, stating that her only familiarity with the case came through overhearing general discussions \"long ago\" when the crime actually happened. Thus, our review of the record demonstrates that the trial court's findings that the original jury was not tainted and its subsequent denial of defendant's motion for mistrial was not \"'\"so arbitrary that it could not have been the result of a reasoned decision.\"'\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Diehl,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"135564\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/353/433/#p437\">\n    353 N.C. 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 437,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=545%20S.E.2d%20185\">\n    545 S.E.2d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 188 (2001) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendant next argues that the trial court's inquiry concerning the newspaper article was inadequate and that as a result the court had insufficient information from which to determine whether defendant had been prejudiced. This Court has held that \"`[w]hen there is a substantial reason to fear that the jury has become aware of improper and prejudicial matters, the trial court must question the jury as to whether such exposure has occurred and, if so, whether the exposure was prejudicial.'\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

After concluding that only prospective alternate jurors\n   might have been affected, the court and counsel questioned each subsequent prospective alternate juror individually about exposure and possible prejudice. Defendant points out that even if the article had been in the jury room only on Friday, the last two panelists seated as regular jurors that day were not asked specifically if they had seen the article. However, as detailed above, the court made findings at the outset of its inquiry that none of the regular jurors had seen the article. The record fully supports this finding. In addition, both of these jurors were asked on\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   if they had seen or read any news reports about the case, and both answered in the negative. This questioning was sufficient to support the trial court's findings that the regular jury was not exposed to the article and was fully adequate under our law.\n   <em>\n    See Bonney,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2556466\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/329/61/#p73\">\n    329 N.C. at 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=405%20S.E.2d%20145\">\n    405 S.E.2d at 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Moreover, none of the alternate jurors participated in the deliberations at defendant's trial. Thus, even if alternate jurors were exposed to the article, any resulting taint was immaterial and caused defendant no prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See State v. Blakeney,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"684937\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/352/287/#p301\">\n    352 N.C. 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 301-02,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=531%20S.E.2d%20799\">\n    531 S.E.2d 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 811 (2000) (noting that when an alternate juror, who admitted to having read a newspaper article about the case, did not participate in deliberations, and when no participating juror was exposed to the article, the defendant failed to demonstrate prejudice from the trial court's denial of his motion for a continuance or that the trial court abused its discretion),\n   <em>\n    cert. denied,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9715558,9715496,9715306,9715436,9715372,9716078,9716238,9716015,9715729,9715667,9715607,9715867,9715932,9716157,9715807\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/1117/\">\n    531 U.S. 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=121%20S.%20Ct.%20868\">\n    121 S.Ct. 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=148%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20780\">\n    148 L.Ed.2d 780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). Accordingly, defendant's argument that he suffered \"substantial and irreparable prejudice\" fails. This assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendant next makes the related argument that the trial court's admonition to the prospective jurors on the second panel brought before the court was incomplete and misleading and allowed them to view the allegedly prejudicial newspaper article about the trial. On Wednesday morning, 3 March 2004, the second panel of prospective jurors was brought into the courtroom. The trial court considered requests for deferrals, administered the oath, and instructed the panel. Before excusing this panel for lunch, the trial court stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   I will instruct you during the jury selection process in this case that if you are selected to serve as a juror, throughout the trial you should not read, watch, or listen to any news media reports about this case. You should not discuss this case with anyone else, including other jurors, your spouses, family members, or friends, or have any contact with the lawyers, the parties, or the witnesses in this matter, and that includes me as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendant maintains that this admonition, which was the only one this panel received as prospective jurors, did not meet the requirements of N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-1236(a). That statute sets out the admonitions that a trial court must give jurors at appropriate times. We will assume without deciding that these admonitions apply as well to prospective jurors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v. Thibodeaux,\n   </em>\n   we observed that a defendant claiming error in the trial court's admonitions pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-1236(a) \"must object . . . in order to preserve [the] issue for appeal.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"793201\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/341/53/#p62\">\n    341 N.C. 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 62,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=459%20S.E.2d%20501\">\n    459 S.E.2d 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 507 (1995). Defendant acknowledges that no such objection was raised. In addition, the defendant also \"must establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of any failure of the trial court to admonish the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=459%20S.E.2d%20501\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As detailed above, we are satisfied from our review of the record that the trial court conducted an adequate inquiry and correctly concluded that none of the seated jurors who participated in deliberations were present in the jury room when the newspaper article was read and discussed by the prospective alternate jurors. The admonition quoted above specifically advised the prospective jurors that, if they were selected for the jury, they were not to read media reports about the case. The record indicates that none of the deliberating jurors saw or read the article. Therefore, defendant has failed to demonstrate prejudice. This assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    SENTENCING ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendant raises several issues relating to sentencing. Defendant assigns error to the\n   trial court's decision not to submit the statutory mitigating circumstance that \"[t]he defendant has no significant history of prior criminal activity.\" N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-2000(f)(1) (2005). Defendant contends that by submitting a similar nonstatutory mitigating circumstance, the trial court violated his federal and state constitutional rights and that he is entitled to a new sentencing hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   At the sentencing proceeding charge conference, defendant's counsel presented to the trial court a list of requested mitigating circumstances, including instructions on the N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-2000(f)(2) (\"[t]he capital felony was committed while the defendant was under the influence of mental or emotional disturbance\") and (f)(6) (\"[t]he capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was impaired\") statutory mitigating circumstances. Defendant also asked the trial court not to instruct on the (f)(1) statutory mitigating circumstance. Instead, defendant requested that the court instruct on a proposed nonstatutory mitigating circumstance, that \"[p]rior to this offense, the defendant had no significant history of violent criminal activity.\" In addition, defendant requested that the trial court instruct as to fifteen other nonstatutory mitigating circumstances. The trial court agreed not to give the (f)(1) instruction and further agreed to instruct peremptorily as to all of defendant's proposed statutory and nonstatutory mitigating circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Although the court verbally instructed the jury that it could consider whether \"[p]rior to this offense, the defendant had no significant history of violent criminal activity,\" the circumstance was printed in the verdict sheet as \"[p]rior to this offense, did the defendant have a significant history of violent criminal activity?\" Defendant argues that the discrepancy between these formulations of the mitigating circumstance makes ambiguous the answer \"No\" that the jury wrote on the verdict sheet. However, in light of the court's correct oral articulation of the mitigating circumstance, its provision to the jury of written copies of the instructions, its general instruction to answer \"No\" if the jury did not find the circumstance, and the additional specific wording in the verdict form that none of the jurors found this particular mitigating circumstance to exist, we are satisfied that no juror found this nonstatutory mitigating circumstance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Defendant now argues that the trial court erred when it acceded to his request not to submit the (f)(1) statutory mitigating circumstance to the jury. Defendant contends that the trial court's failure to provide this instruction was prejudicial error that entitles him to a new sentencing proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Before we address defendant's contention, we believe it appropriate to reexamine how our jurisprudence has developed around the (f)(1) mitigating circumstance. North Carolina's capital punishment statute provides that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In all cases in which the death penalty may be authorized, the judge\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   include in his instructions to the jury that it\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   consider any aggravating circumstance or circumstances or mitigating circumstance or circumstances from the lists provided in subsections (e) and (f) which may be supported by the evidence, and shall furnish to the jury a written list of issues relating to such aggravating or mitigating circumstance or circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-2000(b) (2005) (emphases added). By \"unequivocally set[ting] forth the legislature's intent that in every case the jury be allowed to consider all statutory aggravating or mitigating circumstances which the jury might reasonably find supported by the evidence,\" this section ensures that jury consideration in capital cases is properly guided.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although other evidence suggested that defendant may have been involved in additional illegal activity, the information described above sufficiently supports the trial court's threshold determination that no rational jury could find that defendant's criminal activity was insignificant.

Defendant's family history also indicated that his relationship with his parents was \"extremely chaotic,\" that defendant's father physically abused and assaulted him and his mother, that defendant's parents suffered from mental health problems, and that defendant's father introduced defendant to alcohol and illegal drugs at an early age.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Dr. Hilkey testified that defendant's upbringing manifested itself as BPD when he grew older. Dr. Hilkey stated,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   that defendant felt responsible for his parents' fighting; that defendant's family history was being replicated in his relationships; and that defendant felt unsure and unstable when not in a relationship, demonstrated reckless behavior and substance abuse, exhibited a \"flat affect\" or lack of emotional response to important events such as his role in the instant offense, and responded to events leading up to the murder by exhibiting a \"transient depersonalization.\" Dr Hilkey added that defendant still hoped against all logic that his trial might bring his family together. According to Dr. Hilkey, defendant's slaying of Daniel Branch had no purpose other than allowing defendant to take the victim's car so he could travel to West Virginia to reunite with Kim. In addition, defendant points to previous failed relationships with women that resulted in severe depression, instances of job truancy, and irresponsible substance abuse as evidence of emotional immaturity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In determining whether the (f)(7) circumstance should have been submitted, \"[w]e have recognized that chronological age is not the determinative factor.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

When defendant was seventeen years old, he went to live with his cousin Teresa Gillespie so he could be closer to his job.

Defendant contends that the argument improperly encouraged the jurors to recommend death on the basis of evidence introduced in the guilt phase of the trial to support the elements of premeditation and deliberation. Defendant claims that by arguing this evidence during the sentencing proceeding, the State was encouraging the jurors to act on the basis of an aggravating circumstance that is not set out in N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-2000(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   At the close of the guilt phase of the trial, the State argued that defendant had premeditated and deliberated before killing the victim. In support of this theory, one prosecutor, noting that defendant had lured the \"totally innocent victim\" to the death scene, emphasized that defendant had decided \"to kill twenty-four hours earlier\" and then \"carried out his plan.\" Another prosecutor argued in the guilt phase \"that there was no provocation by Daniel Branch\" and that defendant acted according to \"plan\" by \"tak[ing] a man to a place that is secluded where there's no other witnesses.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Later, at the sentencing proceeding, the trial judge agreed to submit the N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-2000(e)(9) aggravating circumstance, that \"[t]he capital felony was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel.\" A portion of the State's closing argument at the sentencing proceeding as to this circumstance pointed out that \"Daniel Branch was an innocent man. And the murder of an innocent man . . . fits all of [the] definitions\" of heinous, atrocious, or cruel. The State went on to argue that \"the plan, the luring of Daniel Branch to a secluded location\" was an \"evil element\" of the crime. The State added:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   And let me just point out that the entire time that they're driving out to that field in extreme southern Randolph County, and the entire time that he's loading that shotgun, and the entire time that he's walking out he's watching Daniel Branch walk out into this field, the entire time the motive in his mind is to kill and to murder and to take the life of Daniel Branch. How do we know that? Because from his own mouth he said that I knew I was going to do it the day before. But if he knew he was going to do it the day before, if he knows with every passing moment that he's in the car with Daniel Branch he knows that he's one minute closer to taking the life of this innocent man. He knows that every time he shoves a twelve-gauge shell into the gun, one, two, three, he is one step closer to killing Daniel Branch. Is that extremely wicked or shockingly evil? Is it outrageously wicked and vile?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The jury found this circumstance to exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Defendant concedes that he did not object to the argument at issue.

Because we see that [he] ejected the second round far away from the first.

Daniel Branch is on his back. He has two shotgun blasts pumped into his body, and he's on his back. . . . Daniel Branch is on his back and his arms are in the surrender position. . . . And the testimony is that he's saying don't shoot me anymore. And he's shot. He's in the most defenseless position that a man can be in. And his arms are up because he's saying I surrender, I don't have a gun, I'm no longer any threat to you, don't shoot me anymore. . . . The evidence is that he [then] pulled the keys out of [the victim's] pocket after smelling the blood that he's spilled. . . . Is that extremely wicked, shockingly evil, outrageously wicked and vile?
