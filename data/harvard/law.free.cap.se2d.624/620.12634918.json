We hold the claim accrues whenever alienation is complete, regardless of the date of separation, and that the determination of when alienation occurs is generally a question of fact for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff and Byron McCutchen (\"Byron\") married on 1 June 1968 and had three children between 1969 and 1980. The couple separated on 9 September 1998 and divorced on 30 May 2002. Before the couple's separation, Byron met defendant, now his wife, and began a sexual relationship with her. Defendant admits she had actual knowledge of Byron's marriage when she entered the relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On 25 April 2003, plaintiff filed suit against defendant asserting causes of action for alienation of affections and criminal conversation. In her complaint, plaintiff alleged defendant engaged in an adulterous relationship with Byron before the couple's divorce. Plaintiff further alleged defendant wrongfully and maliciously destroyed her marriage to Byron. She claimed defendant continued her relationship with Byron despite knowing that Byron and plaintiff were engaged in counseling and reconciliation efforts. Plaintiff asserted she and Byron purchased a car titled in both of their names in May 1999 using funds from a joint account and continued managing their finances together until October 2001. In addition, plaintiff maintained that on at least three occasions following the date of separation Byron expressed his desire to return to the marriage and asked plaintiff to refrain from taking legal action while they were attempting to reconcile. Plaintiff contended Byron told her at their last joint counseling session in February 2001 that \"he was not heading toward divorce,\" but approximately two weeks later informed her the marriage was over.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant responded, asserting the statute of limitations as a bar to plaintiff's alienation claim, and filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment for plaintiff on her criminal conversation claim, reserving damages for a jury determination, but granted summary judgment for defendant on plaintiff's alienation claim after concluding it was barred by the statute of limitations. A divided panel of the Court of Appeals determined plaintiff's interlocutory appeal was proper and affirmed summary judgment in favor of defendant, holding plaintiff's cause of action for alienation accrued by the date of separation and was thus barred by the statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    McCutchen v.

Interlocutory orders are appealable before entry of a final judgment if (1) the trial court certifies there is \"no just reason to delay the appeal of a final judgment as to fewer than all of the claims or parties in an action\" or (2) the order \"`affects some substantial right claimed by the appellant and will work an injury to him if not corrected before an appeal from the final judgment.'\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 175,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=521%20S.E.2d%20707\">\n    521 S.E.2d at 709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   N.C.G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1-277; 1A-1, Rule 54(b); 7A-27 (2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the present case, the issue of damages for plaintiff's criminal conversation claim remained unresolved when the trial court granted summary judgment for defendant on the alienation of affections claim. Plaintiff's appeal is therefore interlocutory. Since the trial court did not certify its decision, we must decide whether plaintiff has a substantial right that would be lost absent immediate review. Both plaintiff and defendant agree this case involves a substantial right warranting immediate review; however, acquiescence of the parties does not confer subject matter jurisdiction on a court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The parties assert the substantial right at stake is the right to have the same jury hear plaintiff's claims for alienation of affections and criminal conversation. \"[B]ecause the two causes of action and the elements of damages here are so connected and intertwined, only one issue of . . . damages should [be] submitted to the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Sebastian v.

In light of this legal interdependence, the same jury should determine damages for both claims. This right will be lost if plaintiff must wait to appeal summary judgment on her alienation claim until the issue of damages for criminal conversation is resolved. Accordingly, the interlocutory order granting summary judgment on plaintiff's alienation claim is subject to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II. ACCRUAL OF ALIENATION OF AFFECTIONS CLAIM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We next turn to the issue of when a cause of action for alienation of affections accrues. To establish a common law claim for alienation, a plaintiff must prove \"'(1) [t]hat [she and her husband] were happily married, and that a genuine love and affection existed between them; (2) that the love and affection so existing was alienated and destroyed; [and] (3) that the wrongful and malicious acts of the defendant[] produced and brought about the loss and alienation of such love and affection.'\"\n   <em>\n    Litchfield v.

They were \"happily married with genuine love and affection\" before the \"interference of the [d]efendant.\" Although the couple separated on 9 September 1998, Byron expressed his desire to return to the marriage multiple times between October 1999 and September 2000 and asked plaintiff not to take legal action during that time. The couple purchased a car together in May 1999, following Byron's indication that he had broken off his relationship with defendant. Plaintiff and Byron also maintained joint finances after their separation. Additionally, they participated in marriage counseling from July 1998 to February 2001. During their last counseling session, Byron told plaintiff \"he was not heading toward divorce.\" In fact, Byron did not file for divorce until more than a year after the date he was legally permitted to do so under state law. Plaintiff apparently had reason to believe the couple would reconcile until Byron made a final decision in February 2001 to end their marriage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff's allegations in her sworn affidavit and verified complaint present a genuine issue of material fact as to whether there was love and affection following her separation from Byron. Because a jury could determine alienation did not occur until as late as February 2001, when Byron made the final decision to end the marriage, and plaintiff filed her complaint within three years of his decision, plaintiff's claim for alienation of affections is not facially barred by the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We affirm that part of the decision of the Court of Appeals holding plaintiff was entitled to an immediate appeal. We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals upholding summary judgment in favor of the defendant. The case is remanded to that court for further remand to the Wake County Superior Court for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1.\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Nor does the Restatement (Second) of Torts adopt this position. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 683 cmt. f (1977) (\"The fact that the spouses were living apart at the time of the acts complained of . . . does not bar recovery. . . .\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
