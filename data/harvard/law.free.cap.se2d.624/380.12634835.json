Marshall, M.D. and McArthur Newell, M.D., alleging negligence in connection with Aeron's delivery. Plaintiffs appeal from a grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants. While we hold that summary judgment was proper as to Dr. Marshall because plaintiffs failed to establish that their sole standard of care expert was qualified to testify under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 90-20.12 (2003), we must reverse as to defendant Newell. Although Dr. Newell had died during the pendency of the lawsuit, the trial court did not rule on plaintiffs' motion to substitute the executrix for the estate as a party defendant. Without the substitution of the executrix, there was no party to seek summary judgment, and there was no party on whose behalf the court could enter judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Keisha Purvis became pregnant in 1998. She experienced an uneventful pregnancy under the care of her regular obstetrician/gynecologist, Dr. Marshall. On Saturday, 13 February 1999, Ms. Purvis began experiencing contractions and sought care at The Women's Hospital of Greensboro (\"Women's Hospital\"). She was first seen by Dr. Charles Harper, who sent her home with instructions to see Dr. Marshall on Monday.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ms. Purvis returned to Women's Hospital two hours later, in the early morning hours of 14 February 1999, because her water had broken. She was admitted and placed on an electronic fetal monitor. At that time, Dr. Newell was the supervising physician on call. Ms. Purvis remained at Women's Hospital under Dr. Newell's care through 14 February and overnight into 15 February.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ms. Purvis came under the care of Dr. Marshall at approximately 4:30 a.m. on 15 February. Dr. Marshall monitored her progress through the morning of 15 February until Aeron was delivered in the early afternoon. When Aeron was delivered, his umbilical cord was wrapped around his neck. He appeared blue or gray in color and was \"depressed\" or oxygen-deprived. Aeron was ventilated and received medication, measures that revived him after about two minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   For the first few hours of Aeron's life, he appeared to be a normal infant. In the sixth hour, he had a seizure while he was with his mother, followed by a second one when he was in the nursery. Aeron was transferred to the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit\n   \"for further evaluation and management.\" He was eventually diagnosed with \"neurologic problems, including spastic cerebral palsy, mental retardation, seizure disorder, cortical visual impairment, and microcephaly,\" resulting from \"a hypoxic ischemic injury leading to an encephalopathy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On 9 January 2002, plaintiffs filed a medical malpractice action against four defendants: (1) The Moses H. Cone Memorial Health Service Corporation, d/b/a The Moses Cone Health System, d/b/a The Women's Hospital of Greensboro; (2) Dr. Harper; (3) Dr. Marshall; and (4) Dr. Newell. Plaintiffs alleged generally that defendants were negligent in failing to detect Aeron's fetal distress such that delivery could be initiated in a timely manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Dr. Newell passed away on 9 July 2002. On 13 January 2004, plaintiff filed a motion to substitute \"Dottie Jean Ambrose Newell, Executrix of the Estate of McArthur Newell, deceased.\" The trial court never ruled on this motion. Nevertheless, counsel for Dr. Newell filed a motion for summary judgment on 4 February 2004, an amended motion on 16 March 2004, and a second amended motion on 28 April 2004. Dr. Marshall filed a motion for summary judgment on 14 April 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On 10 May 2004, the superior court entered an order granting summary judgment to Dr. Marshall. Likewise, on 17 May 2004, the court entered summary judgment \"in favor of defendant McArthur Newell, M.D. (and his estate).\" On 3 June 2004, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims against Women's Hospital without prejudice. They had previously, on 21 October 2003, voluntarily dismissed their claims against Dr. Harper without prejudice. Plaintiffs timely appealed from the two summary judgment orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A motion for summary judgment may be granted \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" N.C.R.

Dr. Overstreet has, therefore, failed to meet the requirement of contemporaneousness set forth in the plain language of the statute.\n   <em>\n    See Cox,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8956570\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/161/237/\">\n    161 N.C.App. at 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=587%20S.E.2d%20908\">\n    587 S.E.2d at 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Dr. Donnelly specifically testified that he was familiar with the standard of care for board-certified physicians such as Dr. Steffes practicing in Fayetteville or a similar community\n   <em>\n    in 1994\n   </em>\n   with respect to post-operative care after a Nissen fundoplication procedure.\" (emphasis added)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Although summary judgment is a drastic remedy,\n   <em>\n    Capital Outdoor, Inc. v.

Dr.\n   Overstreet was plaintiffs' sole standard of care expert. As he was not competent to testify regarding the standard of care under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 90-20.12 as it existed in 1998, the trial court correctly concluded that plaintiffs had failed to forecast sufficient evidence to meet one of the essential elements of their claim and that summary judgment should be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Newell Summary Judgment Order\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We cannot, however, reach the merits with respect to the order granting summary judgment as to Dr. Newell. We are confronted with a record in which Dr. Newell passed away in 2002, but the executrix for his estate has not yet been substituted as a party. Under North Carolina law, there is currently no party in favor of whom summary judgment could be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   According to the record, it appears that on 19 February 2003, plaintiffs proposed to defendants that Dr. Newell's estate be substituted for Dr. Newell. Counsel for Dr. Newell refused to agree to the substitution unless plaintiffs agreed to limit any recovery to Dr. Newell's insurance coverage, a stipulation to which plaintiffs would not consent. Instead, plaintiffs filed a motion on 28 April 2004, requesting that the trial court substitute the executrix for Dr. Newell's estate as a party defendant without any limitations on the source of recovery. The trial court, however, never ruled on plaintiffs' motion for substitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As this Court explained with respect to a lawsuit mistakenly brought against a deceased person named John Daniel Johnson rather than against his estate:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   John Daniel Johnson, a legal entity, is transformed, after death, into the estate of John Daniel Johnson, a legal entity. . . . [T]he life and estate of John Daniel Johnson are inextricably dependent: Death of the person is a point at which a legal transformation to an estate can occur. Once death occurs, the legal entity known as the life of John Daniel Johnson can never again have legal standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    Pierce v.

In recognition of this principle, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 28A-18-1(a) (2003) provides that upon the death of any person, all right to defend any action existing against the deceased \"shall survive . . . against the personal representative or collector of his estate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   As a result, when Dr. Newell died, this action did not abate, but it could not be continued against Dr. Newell or his estate generally. The action survived only against the personal representative or collector of Dr. Newell's estate.\n   <em>\n    Shaw v.

Although the parties urge the Court to address the merits of plaintiffs' substitution motion on appeal, we cannot do so because the trial court entered no ruling on that motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Rule 10 of the North Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In order to preserve a question for appellate review, a party must have presented\n   to the trial court a timely request, objection or motion, stating the specific grounds for the ruling the party desired the court to make if the specific grounds were not apparent from the context.\n   <em>\n    It is also necessary for the complaining party to obtain a ruling upon the party's request, objection or motion.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   N.C.R.App. P. 10(b)(1) (emphasis added). Substitution in the event of death is not automatic and, accordingly, whether or not to allow substitution must be decided in the first instance by the trial court. We have no choice but to vacate the trial court's summary judgment order with respect to \"Dr. Newell (and his estate)\" and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Vacated and remanded in part, and affirmed in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Judges HUNTER and HUDSON concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
