HASSELL, SR.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The primary issue that we consider in this habeas corpus proceeding invoking this Court's original jurisdiction is whether petitioner, who was committed to an institution pursuant to Virginia's Sexually Violent Predators Act, is entitled to effective assistance of counsel during the appeal of the civil commitment judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Jim Murrow Jenkins, petitioner, was convicted in the Accomack County Circuit Court in 1994 of one count of forcible sodomy, two counts of aggravated sexual battery, and one count of carnal knowledge. He received a sentence of 10 years, and he was released on parole in October 1999.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Subsequently, Jenkins was convicted of a sexual offense in Maryland and his parole was revoked. He was returned to the custody of the Virginia Department of Corrections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 9, 2003, the Department of Corrections notified the Attorney General that Jenkins qualified for consideration under the Virginia Sexually Violent Predators Act. Petitioner, who was scheduled to be released from prison on October 31, 2003, had scored a four or five on the Rapid Risk Assessment for Sexual Offender Recidivism Test, and he had predicate convictions of one count of forcible sodomy and two counts of aggravated sexual battery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Attorney General filed a petition seeking commitment of Jenkins as a sexually violent predator. Pursuant to former Code \u00a7 37.1-70.7 that was in effect at the time of petitioner's incarceration, the circuit court was required to conduct a hearing to determine whether there was probable cause to continue to hold Jenkins in prison beyond his scheduled release date, pending the outcome of a trial under the Sexually Violent Predators Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   A probable cause hearing was scheduled for October 28, 2003. That morning, Jenkins obtained a shaving razor and mutilated himself by cutting his testicles and flushing them in the toilet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Attorney General requested that the circuit court detain Jenkins in prison until the date of the rescheduled probable cause hearing. Jenkins objected, and the court refused to do so. Jenkins was released from custody of the Department of Corrections on October 31, 2003. The circuit court scheduled a probable cause hearing for November 17, 2003, and ordered Jenkins to appear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Jenkins appeared at the probable cause hearing, and at the conclusion of the Attorney General's evidence, the circuit court ruled that probable cause existed to believe that Jenkins was a sexually violent predator. The circuit court entered an order that placed Jenkins in the custody of the Department of Corrections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the conclusion of a trial, the circuit court held that Jenkins was a sexually violent predator and that no lesser restrictive alternative to full commitment existed. Jenkins was placed in the custody of the Commissioner of the Department of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse Services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 12, 2005, Jenkins filed a notice of appeal from the circuit court's judgment. However, his trial counsel failed to file timely trial transcripts as required by Rule 5:11(a). Consequently, this Court dismissed Jenkins' appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Jenkins filed with the Clerk of this Court a petition for a writ of habeas corpus against the Director of the Virginia Center for Behavioral\n   Rehabilitation. We placed this proceeding on our privileged docket, and we requested that counsel address the question whether petitioner was denied effective assistance of counsel because trial counsel failed to perfect his appeal of the civil commitment order. Additionally, petitioner challenges whether the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction to commit him as a sexually violent predator because he was not incarcerated at the time of the probable cause hearing held pursuant to former Code \u00a7 37.1-70.7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Former Code \u00a7 37.1-103,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in effect when Jenkins filed his petition of habeas corpus, stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"Any person held in custody as mentally ill may by petition for a writ of habeas corpus have the question of the legality of his detention determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. Upon the petition, after notice to the authorities of the hospital or other institution in which such person is confined, the court shall in some courtroom of such county or city, or in some other convenient public place in such county or city determine whether such person is mentally ill and whether he should be detained.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Former Code \u00a7 37.1-104,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   in effect when Jenkins filed his petition for writ of habeas corpus, stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"If the person mentioned in \u00a7 37.1-103 is held in custody and actually confined in any hospital or other institution, he may file his petition in the circuit court of the county or the city in which such hospital or other institution is located or in the circuit court of the county or the city adjoining the county or city in which such hospital or other institution is located.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Former Code \u00a7 37.1-104.1,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   also in effect when Jenkins filed his petition for habeas corpus, stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"In all cases, other than those provided for in \u00a7 37.1-104, the person may file his petition in the circuit court of the county or the city in which he resides, or in which he was certified to be mentally ill, or in which an order was entered authorizing his retention for continued hospitalization, pursuant to Chapter 2, Art. 1 (\u00a7 37.1-63 et seq.) of this title.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Code \u00a7 8.01-654 states in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"A. 1.

As we have repeatedly stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"While in the construction of statutes the constant endeavor of the courts is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature, that intention must be gathered from the words used, unless a literal construction would involve a manifest absurdity.

There is simply no language in former Code \u00a7 37.1-104 that required Jenkins to file his petition for habeas corpus in the circuit court that adjudicated him as a sexually violent predator. Additionally, Code \u00a7 8.01-654, which the Director does not discuss in his brief, authorizes the petitioner to file his petition for writ of habeas corpus in this Court. Code \u00a7 8.01-654 also prescribes the statute of limitations and numerous requisites that a habeas corpus petitioner, including Jenkins, must satisfy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Former Code \u00a7 37.1-70.7,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   in effect during Jenkins' sexually violent predator proceedings, stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \"A. Upon the filing of a petition alleging that a person is a sexually violent predator, the circuit court shall schedule a hearing within thirty days to determine whether probable cause exists to believe that the person named in the petition is a sexually violent predator. A copy of the petition shall be personally served on the person named in the petition, his attorney, and his guardian or committee, if applicable. In addition, a written explanation of the sexually violent predator involuntary commitment process and the statutory protections associated with the process shall be given to the person at the time the petition is served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"B. Prior to any hearing under this section, the judge shall ascertain if the person whose commitment is sought is represented by counsel, and if he is not represented by counsel, the judge shall appoint an attorney-at-law to represent him.

In the case of a defendant, if the judge finds that there is not probable cause to believe the defendant is a sexually violent predator, the judge shall dismiss the petition and order that the defendant be released, committed pursuant to \u00a7 37.1-67.3, or certified pursuant to \u00a7 37.1-65.1.

He finished serving this sentence in January 1991, but he remained in prison as a result of convictions for other crimes that were not sexually violent offenses.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632454\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/609/1/\">\n    269 Va. at 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632454\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/609/1/\">\n    609 S.E.2d at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Townes was released from prison in April 2002 and granted parole. He violated parole, and he returned to prison that same month to complete his remaining sentence. In April 2003, the Director of the Virginia Department of Corrections notified the Commitment Review Committee that Townes, who was scheduled to be released from prison in August 2003, was subject to review for civil commitment because he had committed a sexually violent offense, and he had been identified through testing as likely to re-offend.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632454\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/609/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The circuit court conducted a probable cause hearing as required by former Code \u00a7 37.1-70.7 and concluded that there was probable cause to believe that Townes was a sexually violent predator.

The former Sexually Violent Predators Act conferred subject matter jurisdiction upon the circuit courts to adjudicate the class of cases involving the involuntary commitment of alleged sexually violent predators. Petitioner ignores the numerous statutory grants of authority that the former Act conferred upon the circuit courts. For example, the former Act required that the Attorney General file all petitions for involuntary commitments against alleged sexual predators in the circuit court where the prisoner was last convicted of a sexually violent offense or where the defendant was deemed unrestorably incompetent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   former Code \u00a7 37.1-70.6. Additionally, the former Act prescribed numerous procedures for involuntary commitment proceedings in the circuit courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Jenkins argues that pursuant to the due process clauses of the federal constitution and the Constitution of Virginia, he is entitled to counsel during the involuntary commitment process for sexually violent predators. Jenkins asserts that he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel because trial counsel failed to perfect an appeal from the order of involuntary commitment in the manner provided by law. Petitioner contends that he is entitled to a belated appeal of that order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Responding, the Director states that Jenkins does not have a constitutional right to an appeal and, hence, he has no right to counsel during the appellate phase of a civil case. The Director also contends that even if Jenkins has a right to effective assistance of counsel, he was not prejudiced because of trial counsel's failure to file an appeal in the manner prescribed by law.

One explanation previously articulated by this Court in the context of post-conviction habeas relief is equally valid in this proceeding. When ruling on a habeas petition asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to perfect an appeal, it is not an efficient use of judicial resources for this Court to examine the merits of a petitioner's grounds of appeal in order to determine whether the petitioner satisfied the prejudice prong of the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   test.
