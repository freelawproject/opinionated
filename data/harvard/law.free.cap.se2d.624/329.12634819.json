On 29 January 2001, a Scotland County grand jury indicted defendant for the murder of Shirley McNeill and for discharging a weapon into occupied property. Defendant was tried capitally before a jury at the 23 June 2003 Criminal Session of the Scotland County Superior Court. On 11 July 2003, the jury found defendant guilty of first-degree murder on the basis of malice, premeditation, and deliberation and additionally under the felony murder rule. The jury also found defendant\n   guilty of discharging a firearm into occupied property, a Class E felony. On 15 July 2003, following a capital sentencing proceeding, the jury returned a binding recommendation of death for the first-degree murder conviction, and the trial court entered judgment in accordance with that recommendation. Additionally, the trial court sentenced defendant, within the presumptive range, to a term of thirty-four to fifty months for discharging a firearm into occupied property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant appealed his convictions and sentence of death to this Court. After consideration of the assignments of error raised by defendant on appeal and a thorough review of the transcript, the record on appeal, the briefs, and oral arguments, we find no reversible error in defendant's convictions or sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant and Shirley McNeill were married in 1975, nearly twenty-five years before her murder. From the beginning, the marriage was a troubled one. By defendant's own admission, law enforcement officers were called to the marital home a number of times for domestic violence incidents prior to 10 April 2000. Defendant was convicted of assault on a female, an A1 misdemeanor, for an incident involving Shirley three years into their marriage. Defendant admitted to multiple incidents of uncharged domestic violence, one in which he poured food over his wife while she was asleep, and another incident in which he burned her clothes, \"[b]ecause she was dating a man, I think.\" Approximately twenty years after the couple's marriage, the relationship further declined as both defendant and Shirley suffered the deaths of close family members. During this stressful time defendant substantially increased his consumption of alcohol and began smoking crack cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In early 2000, Shirley left the marital home and began residing with her niece, Yolanda Gates. Shirley retained an attorney to draft a separation agreement, claiming a separation date of 31 January 2000. By defendant's own admission, Shirley's move from the marital home caused him to \"los[e] total control.\" This caused him to increase his consumption of alcohol and escalated his abuse of controlled substances. Additionally, he was plagued by sleep deprivation, loss of appetite, and a lethargic work ethic. Sometime in late February of 2000, Shirley began a romantic relationship with Vernon \"Bun\" McDougald, Shirley's supervisor and an early childhood acquaintance of defendant. When defendant learned of the adulterous relationship it completely \"devastated\" him. In his own words, \"It ate me up. Just totally ate me up every day, day in and day out. Night and day.\" Defendant's obsessive behavior towards Shirley reflected his loss of control. Defendant telephoned her incessantly and showed up at locations where he believed she would be. On many occasions, defendant followed her to and from work. Additionally, defendant discussed his marital problems with several of his friends and acquaintances. For instance, he told his longtime friend Danny Monroe if Shirley didn't come back, there's no telling what he might do. Further, Defendant told Shirley's first cousin, Jerome Swindell, \"if [defendant] couldn't have her, nobody else going to have her [sic].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During the days leading up to Shirley McNeill's murder, defendant's obsessive behavior intensified. At approximately 7:45 a.m. on Friday, 7 April 2000, defendant entered the parking lot at Burlington Industries Raeford Plant, where Shirley was employed. Glenn McCutcheon, a security guard at Burlington Industries, observed defendant looking in the windows of Shirley's vehicle and then entering the vehicle. As defendant left the parking lot, McCutcheon approached defendant and inquired if he needed help, to which defendant replied that he came to see his wife. Defendant then departed the premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On Saturday, 8 April 2000, two days before the murder, defendant went to Yolonda Gates's residence, where Shirley was living. His purported purpose was to visit with Shirley's grandson Tyler McRae. During the visit, defendant continually prodded Shirley to come home with him, but she refused. After defendant returned home, he attempted to telephone Shirley, but Gates answered the telephone call and lied at Shirley's direction, telling defendant Shirley was not at\n   the residence. Nevertheless, defendant continued to telephone throughout the night until Gates finally removed the phone from its cradle at 1:00 a.m., which prevented anyone from telephoning her. At Shirley's request, Gates relocated Shirley's car behind a neighbor's house so defendant could not observe it if he drove past. Approximately thirty to forty-five minutes later, defendant drove to Gates's residence, even driving into her yard and driveway. The next morning, as soon as Gates returned the phone to its cradle, defendant's telephoning resumed. Just like the night before, Gates continued to tell defendant Shirley was not there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On Sunday, 9 April 2000, the day before her murder, Shirley attended services at Nazareth Baptist Church and a church social afterwards. Jerome Swindell, Shirley's first cousin, testified he was in the church parking lot during the social when defendant drove into the parking lot in the company of Johnny \"Jail\" Morrison. Swindell invited them to join the festivities, but defendant declined. Swindell later advised Shirley defendant had been there. Shirley subsequently asked Ronnie Livingston, her brother-in-law, to take Tyler to his father's residence in Fayetteville, and Livingston did so, using Shirley's car for the trip. Livingston and Tyler, accompanied by Carlton Gates, Shirley's brother, arrived at Tyler's father's residence in Fayetteville to find defendant sitting in his pickup truck, backed up near a fence at the property. When Livingston escorted Tyler into the residence, defendant departed the area. Livingston then returned the vehicle to Shirley, advising her defendant had been waiting at Tyler's father's residence. When Shirley returned to Gates's residence, she parked her car behind a neighbor's house so defendant would not know she was there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DAY OF THE HOMICIDE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On the morning of Monday, 10 April 2000, the day of her murder, Shirley McNeill drove to the residence of Carolyn McLeod, her best friend for over forty years. Both McLeod and Shirley were employed by Burlington Industries Raeford Plant for over twenty-six years and they often carpooled to work. Shirley arrived at McLeod's residence at about 7:20 a.m. As McLeod walked out to Shirley's vehicle, defendant drove up next to Shirley. Defendant told Shirley he was going to kill her that afternoon. Shirley and McLeod then drove to Burlington Industries. On the way, McLeod recommended Shirley take defendant's threat seriously and suggested she not drive McLeod home that afternoon alone. Shirley indicated she did not take defendant's threat seriously. Vernon \"Bun\" McDougald, Shirley's paramour and supervisor, testified Shirley told him about defendant's threat while she was at work that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   While Shirley and McLeod were at Burlington Industries, defendant spent the morning consuming alcohol and napping. According to defendant's testimony, he awoke around noon and went to an acquaintance's residence to try to obtain some crack cocaine. Because his acquaintance did not have any crack cocaine, defendant traveled to another friend's house and consumed more alcohol. Later, defendant went to Massey's Grocery and purchased a pint of Lightning Creek wine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Danny Monroe, a friend of defendant's for fifteen to twenty years, testified he went to defendant's house at approximately 4:00 p.m. to ask if he could either rent or purchase a lawnmower trailer defendant owned. Defendant \"kind of smiled, and he told [Monroe] that if he do [sic] what he's thinking about doing that [Monroe] could have it.\" Defendant then left his residence and drove towards Massey's Grocery. By his own admission, defendant parked his truck under the tree at Massey's Grocery knowing Shirley would pass by when she took McLeod home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Shirley and McLeod left Burlington Industries at approximately 4:00 p.m., returning to McLeod's residence. While en route, they observed defendant's truck parked at Massey's, and Shirley stopped her vehicle next to where defendant was standing. Defendant walked up to the driver's side of Shirley's car and asked, \"Are you going to do what I told you to do?\" Shirley asked, \"What's that?\" Defendant responded, \"Are you going to come back home?\" Shirley said, \"No,\" and defendant said, \"Well, that's all I wanted to\n   know.\" Shirley replied, \"Well, you said you were going to kill me this afternoon anyway.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Shirley continued traveling to McLeod's residence and parked her vehicle in the driveway. Almost immediately, defendant arrived and parked his truck behind Shirley's vehicle. Approximately six or seven neighborhood children were playing in the area as these events unfolded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   While McLeod exited the vehicle, defendant walked toward the driver's side of Shirley's vehicle with a rifle in his hand. He told McLeod to go in the house and he \"wouldn't bother [her].\" Without warning, Defendant shot Shirley in the chest through the driver's side window. Shirley pleaded with him not to shoot her again. McLeod testified she heard five or six more shots as she ran behind a nearby shed. All of the eyewitnesses observed defendant pursuing Shirley around the yard, shooting her multiple times. McLeod testified Shirley was begging, \"Please, Jimmy, don't kill me. Please don't kill me.\" Defendant continued firing his rifle and began calling Shirley, her mother, and her sister vulgar names.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At some point, Shirley collapsed face down on the ground near the driver's side of her car. Defendant shot her approximately eight more times, still calling her and her family expletives. Veronica Blue, Shirley's cousin and one of McLeod's neighbors, observed Shirley attempting to escape by crawling on her arms even as defendant continued shooting her in the back. Both McLeod and Blue shouted at defendant to stop shooting, but defendant continued to fire until expending all sixteen of the cartridges his rifle held. As a final insult, defendant kicked Shirley and left her to die. Before the arrival of first responders to the scene, Shirley's wounds rendered her unconscious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   While witnesses sought help for Shirley, defendant left the scene in his pickup truck. Defendant drove his truck to the home of Eula Mae Rogers, the mother of defendant's friend, Will Rogers. Defendant asked to use the telephone, but apparently was not able to complete the call. When Eula Mae inquired as to whom he was trying to call, defendant responded, \"I was trying to call the police. I just shot Shirley.\" Eula Mae noted there was no emotion in Defendant's voice as he relayed this information. Defendant then told her he was going to return a lawnmower part which belonged to Will and which he had borrowed earlier. Eula Mae testified she saw him leave toward Will's house, but because Will was not home defendant departed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Law enforcement personnel responded to the crime scene, and immediately enlisted other officers to aid in searching for and apprehending defendant. Soon thereafter, Officer Corey Jones of the Wagram Police Department and Detective Randy Jacobs of the Scotland County Sheriff's Department stopped defendant's vehicle near the police station in downtown Wagram. The officers ordered defendant out of his vehicle at gunpoint and handcuffed him. Law Enforcement Officers recovered the murder weapon in defendant's truck incident to his arrest. At one point during defendant's transport, Deputy Eric Pate smelled alcohol, and he asked defendant how much he had drunk, to which defendant responded, \"I think it's best I keep my mouth shut.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At approximately 6:30 p.m., Agent Janie Pinkston of the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) interviewed defendant at the Scotland County Sheriff's Department. She solicited defendant's consent to search his pickup truck, which he declined. Therefore, Agent Pinkston applied for a search warrant for the vehicle, which was granted by the magistrate. Defendant made no statements to Agent Pinkston or any other law enforcement official about the circumstances of his wife's shooting. At approximately 8:45 p.m., Agent Pinkston informed defendant his wife had died. Agent Pinkston testified defendant \"did not react. What I noted was no change in his physical appearance, and no change in his demeanor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   North Carolina Chief Medical Examiner John D. Butts, M.D. testified concerning the autopsy performed on Shirley's body by Michael Ross, M.D., which Dr. Butts supervised. The autopsy revealed sixteen gunshot wounds, including wounds to Shirley's shoulder, chest, back, hip, buttocks, thigh, foot, and forearm. Additionally, the autopsy report\n   showed defendant shot Shirley's ring finger of her left hand at the very spot where her wedding ring would have been had she been wearing it at the time of her murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As to the cause of death, Dr. Butts testified that Shirley died as a result of multiple gunshot wounds. Her lungs, heart, liver, spleen, and both kidneys were damaged. Several of the gunshot wounds would have been irreversibly fatal, even if medical personnel had been at the scene when the shooting began. Due to the nature of Shirley's injuries, Dr. Butts was unable to determine the sequence of the gunshot wounds, but he did indicate the location and trajectory of the wounds comported with the eyewitness testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Through microscopic examination, an S.B.I. expert conclusively matched fifteen of the sixteen spent shell casings found at the crime scene to defendant's Marlin Model 60 .22 caliber semiautomatic rifle. Of the eleven projectile fragments recovered from Shirley's body during the autopsy, one fragment was also conclusively matched to defendant's firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Based upon the above evidence, the jury convicted defendant of first-degree murder under both the felony murder rule and a theory of malice, premeditation, and deliberation, as well as a separate offense of discharging a firearm into occupied property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CAPITAL SENTENCING PROCEEDINGS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At the capital sentencing proceeding, the State presented victim impact evidence from Shirley's sister, Maizie Quick, and her mother, Esther McLeod. Defendant presented evidence from Jeffrey McKee, Ph.D., a forensic psychologist, that defendant was under the influence of emotional disturbance at the time of the murder, specifically due to alcohol and cocaine dependence. Dr. McKee's opinion was, at the time defendant murdered his wife, his capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was impaired. Defendant's aunts, Mary McNeill, Thelma Williams, and Janice Patricia Waddell, and his uncle by marriage, Artie Bethea, testified as character witnesses for defendant. They all testified to defendant's close relationship with his extended family. His aunts testified the deaths of defendant's close family members within such a short period of time affected him deeply. His uncle testified defendant's military service during Operation Desert Storm in the Middle East affected defendant negatively as well. Additionally, four stipulations were read to the jury concerning defendant's military service, high school graduation, and his public service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The jury unanimously found beyond a reasonable doubt as an aggravating circumstance that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel. One or more of the jurors found nine mitigating circumstances. The jury unanimously found beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigating circumstances were insufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstance. The jury also found unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt the aggravating circumstance was sufficiently substantial to call for the imposition of the death penalty when considered with the mitigating circumstances. The jury thereby returned a binding recommendation of a sentence of death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     JURY SELECTION, MOTIONS, AND GUILT-INNOCENCE ISSUES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendant assigns multiple instances of error in the jury selection and guilt-innocence proceeding, including his conviction of discharging a firearm into occupied property, but defendant has not presented any argument or cited any authority in support of these assignments. \"Assignments of error not set out in the appellant's brief, or in support of which no reason or argument is stated or authority cited, will be taken as abandoned.\" N.C.

While it is true each of these factors have been held insufficient to submit the HAC circumstance to the jury, these factors were taken in isolation and occurred in cases in which little other evidence to support submission of HAC was present. However, when all the evidence is considered in this case, the circumstance was properly submitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendant first points out a multiplicity of gunshots inflicted by the perpetrator in rapid succession is insufficient by itself to prove HAC. Additionally, defendant points out that a defendant's disregard of a victim's plea for life, a victim's realization she is about to be killed, a victim's awareness of impending death, and a defendant's calmness and lack of regret are each, taken alone, insufficient to allow the trial court to submit the HAC circumstance to the jury for consideration. Defendant's statements of the law are, at least, partially correct.\n   <em>\n    See State v. Lloyd,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"138508\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/354/76/#p124\">\n    354 N.C. 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 124-26,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=552%20S.E.2d%20596\">\n    552 S.E.2d 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 629-30 (2001);\n   <em>\n    State v.

Even so, defendant's argument is without merit for the simple reason none of the events stated here occurred in isolation. Instead, the record reflects each and every one of these events occurred in the course of this murder. We reject defendant's argument that the sum of zeros equals zero because such a proposition distorts our precedent on the sufficiency of the evidence of the HAC aggravating circumstance.

Defendant's actions, taken as a whole, demonstrate\n   a murder which a jury could find to be especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In this case, the victim pleaded for her life while defendant continued shooting her, showing no mercy as she was prone on the ground. The murder was dehumanizing, because defendant unloaded the capacity of his gun, inflicting multiple gunshots upon his victim. In this process, defendant scarred for life the witnesses to the murder, including the many children present during this tragedy. His victim was unable to retreat or flee, as he began shooting her while she was confined to the passenger compartment of her vehicle. When she finally exited the vehicle, he continued to pursue her, shooting all along the way. As defendant shot Shirley, she knew she was going to die, but there was absolutely nothing she could do to prevent her impending death. Finally, defendant's kicking of his victim, in addition to shooting her on the very spot where her wedding ring would have been, adds to the especially cruel nature of this murder. All of this evidence, taken as a whole, was sufficient to submit the HAC aggravating circumstance to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Therefore, we hold that submission of the N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-2000(e)(9) especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance to the jury was proper. This assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Prosecutor's Closing Argument\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Defendant next argues the trial court erred by overruling defendant's timely objection during the prosecution's closing argument, thereby allowing the prosecutor to read a statement of the law that was incorrect, incomplete, inapplicable, misleading, and prejudicial to defendant. Specifically, the prosecutor made two statements to which defendant now assigns error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In attempting to explain HAC, the prosecutor stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Judge Thompson, I believe, is going to instruct you as follows. The following is the aggravating circumstance which might be applicable to this case. Was this murder especially heinous, atrocious or cruel? In this context, \"heinous\" means extremely wicked, or shockingly evil. \"Atrocious\" means outrageous [sic] wicked and vile. And \"cruel\" means designed to inflict a high degree of pain with utter indifference to or even enjoyment of the suffering of others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendant contends since the prosecutor used the language of the first two paragraphs of the relevant pattern jury instruction but not the latter two paragraphs, this portion of the closing argument is incomplete and misleading. First, we note defense counsel did not object to this language as incomplete or misleading during the closing argument itself. \"The standard of review for assessing alleged improper closing arguments that fail to provoke timely objection from opposing counsel is whether the remarks were so grossly improper that the trial court committed reversible error by failing to intervene\n   <em>\n    ex mero motu.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The prosecution's use of the word \"defined,\" while not particularly accurate, was not misleading. After setting out these types of murders, the prosecutor continued by showing how this murder fit within the parameters defined by the law. Inasmuch as we find the prosecutor's statement was not improper, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling defendant's objection. We therefore overrule defendant's assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Defendant's Closing Argument\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Defendant argues the trial court erred by sustaining prosecution objections during defendant's closing arguments in the penalty proceeding, thereby preventing defendant from fully explaining to the jury the decision it was to make concerning HAC. Defense counsel's argument on HAC was as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Now let's consider the aggravating circumstance tendered by the State in this particular case, which is that this murder was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   One of the things that the Judge's instruction will tell you - first degree murder is heinous, atrocious and usually cruel. I mean, first degree murder is that. That is what we're dealing with with first degree murder. So when the District Attorney talked to you about, you know, things that would be consistent with heinousness and with atrocity and with cruelty, that is always present when you have a first degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Judge will instruct you what the statute says and what you must determine. And this, members of the jury - this is a value judgment that you make based upon the facts that you determine to exist beyond a reasonable doubt. And you must have this value judgment beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In other words, you must eliminate any possibility that this murder was - Yes, heinous, atrocious and cruel in the ordinary sense of first degree murder. Which all have. But that this was not the exceptional, the uniquely heinous, atrocious and cruel first degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Now let's think about the word \"especially.\" What does it mean as we all use it now?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \"The choir at church sang beautifully, but Jane's voice was especially beautiful.\" Now that is the way \"especially\" is used here, except that it's used not for \"especially beautiful\", but for \"especially, uniquely ugly.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   And I will concede to you - I will concede to you that this murder, as it was committed, was heinous, atrocious and cruel. But I would contend to you that the State has not established beyond a reasonable doubt that this murder was especially, uniquely heinous, atrocious or cruel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Members of the jury, let us, as we go through the mitigating circumstances, please understand, and please understand clearly, that the totality of Jimmy McNeill's life prior to April 10th of 2000 - the good things that he did are something that you must consider in determining whether this murder was the worst of the worst, and whether this defendant was the worst of the worst.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Now let's consider - I mean, what would be some examples of murders that would be worse?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   [Prosecuting Attorney]: Objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   THE COURT: I'll sustain that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   [Defense Counsel]: The question is whether this murder, in the universe of murders, is the worst. And whether this defendant, in the universe of defendants convicted of first degree murder, is the worst.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   I contend to you, clearly, there are worse murders than this. And I contend to you, absolutely, there are a whole lot worse defendants guilty of first degree murder than this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   It was a tragic - it was a tragic killing. But it was a tragic killing by an individual who, if you look at it honestly, you could not understand why he did it. This is no excuse for it. But you can see, okay, this person - what he did is not the worst first degree murder. And it has not been committed by the worst defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   [Prosecuting Attorney]: Objection. Your Honor, it's not a comparison between cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   THE COURT: Sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Defendant contends his trial counsel was merely comparing his case to other cases in the same way the prosecutor did in her closing argument. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Defendant claims, in essence, \"what's good for the goose is good for the gander\" and he should have been allowed to make comparisons of his case to previous cases in which HAC was not found, or found and reversed upon appeal, because the prosecution was able to make such a comparison. This assertion mischaracterizes the prosecution's argument. In this case, the prosecution merely set out the law and applied the facts of the present case to the law. For the reasons set out above, this argument is proper. However, defendant began to make comparisons between cases and the facts of each case, something this Court has not allowed.\n   <em>\n    See State v.

Specifically, defendant requested the trial court to instruct the jury that it must recommend a sentence of life imprisonment unless it found the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating circumstances. The trial court denied this request. Utilizing the established pattern jury instruction, the trial court instructed the jury:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Issue 3 is, \"Do you unanimously find beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigating circumstance or circumstances found is or are insufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstances found by you?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   If you find from the evidence one or more mitigating circumstances, you must weigh the aggravating circumstance against the mitigating circumstances. When deciding this issue, each juror may consider any mitigating circumstance or circumstances that he or she deemed to exist by a preponderance of the evidence in [I]ssue 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In so doing, you are the sole judge of the weight to be given to any individual circumstance which you find, whether aggravating or mitigating. You should not merely add up the number of aggravating circumstances and mitigating circumstances. Rather, you must decide from all the evidence what value to give to each circumstance, and then weigh the aggravating circumstance, so valued, against the mitigating circumstances, so valued, and finally determine whether the mitigating circumstance[s] are insufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   If you unanimously find beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigating circumstances found are insufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstance found, you would answer [I]ssue 3 \"yes\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   If you unanimously fail to so find, you would answer [I]ssue 3 \"no\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Defendant argues this instruction violated his constitutional rights because it impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to defendant on this issue by requiring the jury to determine whether the mitigating circumstances found are insufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstance found, creating a presumption the answer should be \"yes.\" We find defendant's arguments to lack merit and therefore overrule this assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Initially, we note it was proper for the trial court to deny defendant's request to change the language in the jury instructions and the Issues and Recommendation as to Punishment form regarding Issue Three. \"[R]equested instructions need only be given in substance if correct in law and supported by the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In the instant case, defendant was convicted of first-degree murder. His conviction was based upon the felony murder rule and upon a theory of malice, premeditation, and deliberation. Following defendant's capital sentencing proceeding, the prosecution submitted only the (e)(9) aggravating circumstance for the jury's consideration: \"Was this murder especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel?\" The jury found that aggravating circumstance to exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The jury also found three enumerated statutory mitigating circumstances: The defendant has no significant history of prior criminal activity ((f)(1)); the murder was committed while the defendant was under the influence of mental or emotional disturbance ((f)(2)); and the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was impaired ((f)(6)). Additionally, the jury found the (f)(9) mitigating circumstance: \"[A]ny other circumstance or circumstances arising from evidence which the jury deems to have mitigating value.\" N.C.G.S. 15A-2000(f)(9) (2005). Of the ten non-statutory mitigating\n   circumstances submitted, one or more jurors found by a preponderance of the evidence that five existed and had mitigating value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   After thoroughly reviewing the record, transcripts, and briefs in this case, we conclude the evidence fully supports the aggravating circumstance found by the jury. Further, we conclude nothing in the record suggests defendant's death sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. Accordingly, we will not disturb the jury's balancing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Turning now to our final statutory duty, we recognize that proportionality review is designed to \"eliminate the possibility that a person will be sentenced to die by the action of an aberrant jury.\" In conducting the proportionality review, we must determine whether \"the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\" N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-2000(d)(2).
