S. </em>309, \u00a7 37.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b665-8\">The suit was commenced in the common pleas of Herkimer county, where the plaintiff had twice recovered verdicts and entered judgments, and upon each occasion the defendant had obtained a new trial under the statute. He then removed the cause here by <em>certiorari, </em>where the plaintiff obtained a third verdict, and entered judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b665-9\"><em>E.

I think the power is exhausted, and that the fact that the new trials already had were granted by the common pleas while the cause was pending there, does not create a distinction favorable to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
