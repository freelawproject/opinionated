A bond was executed, in compliance with the conditions of the lease, with the defendant as surety, conditioned that R. should pay the rent reserved during the continuance of the lease.

The suggestion of the writ was, that in October term, 1842, the'plaintiffs, as executors of Mason, recovered a judgment in the superior court against <em>Redmond and Clark </em>for $3300 of debt, besides costs. The judgment was recovered on the bond of the defendants, Redmond and Clark, to Mason, dated 25th January, 1833, in the sum of $3300, with a recital that Mason had made a lease of certain premises to Redmond for the term of ten years from the first day \u00f3f May then next, at the yearly rent of $3300, payable quarterly, on condition of the punctual payment of the rent to be secured by the bond of Redmond, in the sum of $3300, with a competent person as security; and it was by the lease covenanted and agreed that in case the rent due on any quarter day should remain unpaid for the space of thirty days, <em>\u201c </em>that then and in that case the said lease should <em>cease and </em>determine, and the said bond for $3300 should be forfeited, and the amount of the said bond should be forthwith paid to the said John Mason, and should be considered as <em>liquidated damages </em>for the nonperformance of the said lease;\u201d and it was understood and agreed by the parties to the bond that the same was given in compliance with the conditions of the lease. After this recital, the condition of the bond was, that Redmond should pay the rent reserved during the continuance of the lease. The writ of <em>scire facias </em>further suggested, that the action in which the judgment was recovered was commenced June 23, 1842, and that the action was brought for breaches occurring prior to that day. The plaintiffs then assigned breaches for the non-payment of two quarters\u2019 rent, falling due subsequent to the commencement of the original action, to wit, on the first day of August, and the first day of November, 1842. Redmond suffered judgment on the <em>scire facias </em>to pass by default. Clark demurred, and the court below gave judgment for the plaintiffs. A writ of inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>of damages on the breaches newly assigned was issued and executed ; and judgment was rendered that the plaintiffs have execution of the damages assessed, with costs.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aeb\">Where there is a condition in a lease that upon the neglect of the tenant to pay rent, or for some other default or improper conduct on his part, the lease shall <em>cease and, determine, </em>or shall become <em>null and void, </em>the neglect to pay rent, or the like, does not render the lease absolutely void. It is void as to the estate and interest of the lessee, who has done the wrong. But as to the lessor, the lease is voidable only. He may dispense with the forfeiture, and affirm the continuance of the lease. A distinction in relation to the effect of the forfeiture was formerly taken between leases for lives, and those for terms of years. In the latter case it was said, that on breach of the condition the lease absolutely determined, and could not be again set up by the acceptance of rent, or any other act on the part of the lessor. <em>(Pennant's case, </em>3 <em>Co. </em>64; 1 <em>Saund. </em>287, <em>b. c. note </em>16; <em>and see Browning </em>v. Beston, <em>Plowd. </em>131; <em>Chalker </em>v. <em>Chalker, </em>1 <em>Conn. R. </em>79; <em>Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number><em>Litt. 215, </em>a.; <em>Adams on Eject. </em>196-7, <em>ed. of </em>\u201940.) But this doctrine no longer prevails. It is now held in relation to leases for years, as well as those for life, that the happening of the cause of forfeiture only renders the lease void as to the lessee. It may be affirmed by the lessor; and then the rights and obligations of both parties will continue without regard to the forfeiture. <em>(Rede </em>v. <em>Farr, </em>6 <em>Maule &amp; Selw. </em>121; <em>Arnsby </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>6 <em>Barn. &amp; Cress. </em>519; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Bancks, </em>4 <em>Barn. &amp; Ald. 401; Reid </em>v. <em>Parsons, 2 Chit. R. </em>247 <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark>.) It is a far reaching principle of the common law, that a.party shall not be allowed to take advantage of his own wrong; and courts will not so construe the contract as to enable the lessee to put an end to it at pleasure, .by his own improper conduct. And it makes no difference that the defendant here is the surety of the lessee. <em>(Reid </em>v. <em>Parsons, 2 Chit. R. </em>247.) A surety, like a principal debtor, must answer according to the legal interpretation of his contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">On the first default for thirty days in paying rent, the lessor might have elected to consider the lease atan end, and have brought ejectment to recover possession. And in that case he would probably have been entitled to the'whole sum of $3300, mentioned in the bond as \u201c liquidated damages.\u201d Had he made such election, and then sued for a less sum than he was entitled to recover on the bond, the judgment would have been a bar to any further remedy. He could not split up one entire demand, and maintain a second suit, or suggestion, for a portion of it. <em>(Bendernagle </em>v. <em>Cocks, </em>19 <em>Wend. </em>207.) But the lessor elected to waive the forfeiture, and affirmed the continuance of the lease. He sued for nothing more than the rent in arrear; and the lessee continued to enjoy the property. As the lease has never <em>ceased </em>or <em>determined, </em>the title to \u201c liquidated damages\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>has never arisen, and nothing was. lost by omitting to claim them in the original action.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">As the lease was not terminated by the first default, the right to recover the subsequently accruing rent cannot be questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b519-7\"> The same principle has been repeatedly applied between vendor and vendee in construing articles for the sale of land. See <em>Canfield </em>v. <em>Westcott, </em>(5 <em>Cowen, </em>270,) <em>and note </em>(a) <em>to that case.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
