The plaintiff was one of his children and heirs, and he was also the grantee of two other of his heirs, and he claimed to recover an undivided interest in the premises upon the assumption that the deceased died intestate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-13\">The defendant is the widow of Richard Rutherford, and . claimed to be entitled to the possession of the premises as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>devisee under his will. She produced a paper purporting to he the last will and testament of Richard Rutherford, which appeared to be subscribed by. him. There was no formal attestation clause, but it was subscribed after the words <em>\u201c </em>witnessed by,\u201d at the foot of the will, by Peter Henry and John H. Rutherford, as witnesses. She gave in evidence an exemplification of the record of the proof taken before the surrogate of St. Lawrence county, upon which he had admitted the will to probate, which was to the following effect. Peter Henry, one of the witnesses, swore that the testator, in his last illness, and two days before his death, requested the witness to draw his will; upon which he drew the paper propounded, according to instructions given him by the testator, that the. testator read it over, and the witness also read it aloud to him, and he pronounced it right, and signed it in the presence of the witness, and requested the witness to sign it, which he accordingly did in the form above stated, and the testator then requested that John H. Rutherford (the other witness) who, <em>though not </em>present, was supposed to be in the house, should be sent for, and desired his wife to go and call him; that he (J. H. Rutherford) came in shortly after, and the witness told him\" that the -paper was Richard Rutherford\u2019s \u201c will or agreementthat the testator spoke and requested him to sign it; which he did.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-5\">John H. Rutherford testified that he was at testator\u2019s barn, when he was informed by one Gideon Rutherford that he was . wanted in the house, upon which he went into the room where the testator was lying, when witness\u2019 mother, who was in attendance, told him they were making a will and wanted him to sign it as a witness; that the witness inquired of Mr. Henry what it was they wanted him to sign, who replied that it was \u201c the will or agreement\u201d of Richard Rutherford, and that he (R. Rutherford) wished him to sign it, and he did so. That the testator said nothing to the witness and the witness made no remark to him. He said he did not hear the paper read, and did not see the testator sign his name, and had not seen him before on that day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected to the reading of the will in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>evidence, insisting that it was not proved to have been duly executed, but that on the contrary it appeared that the requirements of the statute had not been complied with, and particularly that it was not subscribed by the testator in the presence of the two witnesses, nor acknowledged by him in their presence to have been so subscribed, and that he had not declared it to be his will in the presence of the attesting witnesses. The circuit judge overruled the objections. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel then offered to prove by another witness that the testator did not speak at all while the witness J. H. Rutherford was in the room, but the circuit judge rejected the evidence. The testimony being closed the circuit judge, on the motion of the defendant\u2019s counsel, nonsuited the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-5\">The plaintiff, upon exceptions taken to the several decisions of the circuit judge, now moved to set aside the nonsuit and for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b35-6\"><em>James </em>Edwards, for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9X\">relied upon the same-grounds taken at the circuit.

Reynolds, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4\">argued that the declarations of the witness Henry to Rutherford, the other witness, at the testator\u2019s bed side, and in his presence and hearing, were under the circumstances to be taken as though made by the testator himself; and that Henry having sworn affirmatively that the testator requested the other attesting witness to sign, the fact was to be so taken although that witness did-not so understand it, or did not recollect it, and that these facts showed a substantial compliance with the statute.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b35-8\">Pee. Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Ak\">The question as to the execution of this will depends upon the validity of the attestation of one of the witnesses. The statute requires that both should subscribe the will at the request of the testator. Henry swears that the testator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>personally requested J. H. Rutherford to sign the will, but the latter declares that the testator said nothing whatever to him. The plaintiff offered to show by another person that when the will was attested the testator was silent. Perhaps the jury might have found, had there been no difficulty respecting the other requisites to the due execution of the will, that the sending for J. H. Rutherford to be a witness, by the testator, and the request made by Henry in the testator\u2019s presence was in effect a request by the testator, but the plaintiff had a right to establish the fact that there was no personal request made by the testator after J. H. Rutherford came into the room, so that it should depend wholly upon the constructive request, and then to have had the question submitted to the jury. For this cause alone the nonsuit must be set aside. But there are other difficulties in the case. The testator is required to declare in the presence of the attesting witnesses that the instrument is his last will and testament. If it should be conceded that such a declaration would be sufficient if made by another person in the testator\u2019s presence and hearing, the information should be distinct and unequivocal. Here both the witnesses testify that the words were that the paper was the testator\u2019s \u201cwill or agreement.\u201d This is too indefinite. Again, the testator must sign in the presence of both of the witnesses, or must acknowledge his signature in their presence. In this case, as to the witness Rutherford, he did neither, and this seems to be a fatal defect in the execution of the paper.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Nonsuit set aside, and new trial granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b36-6\"><em> </em>In <em>Chaffee </em>v. <em>The Baptist Missionary Convention, </em>10 <em>Paige's R. </em>85, where the testatrix\u2019s name, in the hand-writing of another person, had been subscribed to the will before the attesting witnesses were called ip, but she distinctly declared to them both, that the paper was her last will and testament, it was notwithstanding held by the chancellor not to have been legally executed, for the want of its being signed by the testatrix, or having the testatrix\u2019s signature acknowledged by her <em>in their presence.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
