The action is in assumpsit, and Alanson Allen, who resides in the state of Vermont, claims to be the owner of the demand to recover which the suit is brought and is the party in interest therein, and the suit is prosecuted by him for his own benefit. The plaintiffs on the record reside in this state, but are insolvent.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b659-9\">J <em>Newland, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoH\">insisted that upon the equity of the statute, (2 <em>R. S. </em>619, \u00a7 44,) the party beneficially interested, when a non-resident, should be required to find security for costs. \u2022 Such parties are liable to pay costs, and should be compelled to give security in the same cases in which it would be required of plaintiffs prosecuting in their own names.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b659-10\"><em>S. Stevens, </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AC_\">argued that the statute authorizing security-to be required of non-resident plaintiffs did not embrace this case. Where plaintiffs were named in that statute, those who are such on the record are intended.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b659-11\"><em>By the Court, </em>Beardsley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ArS\">It is not necessary to inquire whether this case is within the words of the statute, (2 <em>R. S. </em>619, <em>tit. </em>2, \u00a7 1,) for the power to require security for costs is inherent in the court. <em>(The People </em>v. <em>Oneida C. P., </em>18 <em>Wend. </em>652.)</p>\n<p id=\"b659-12\">The real plaintiff in this case is beyond the jurisdiction of the court, and the nominal plaintiffs are insolvent. He should not he allowed to sue in their names, for his own benefit, without \u25a0giving adequate security to pay costs if the defendants succeed in their defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-13\">Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
