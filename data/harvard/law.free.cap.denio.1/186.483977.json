Higbe sued Leonard before a justice of the peace in assumpsit, and the defendant pleaded non-assumpsit. After a trial before the justice, he rendered a judgment for the plaintiff for $18 damages, and costs. Leonard brought a <em>certiorari </em>to the common pleas, and assigned for error in fact, that a brother of the justice had intermarried with a sister of the plaintiff, and that another brother of the justice had intermarried with another sister of the plaintiff, it being alleged' that such marriages had taken place before the commencement of the suit before the justice, and that the persons so connected were still living. The plaintiff put in a joinder, <em>in millo est erratum. </em>The common pleas reversed the justice\u2019s judgment for such alleged error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number><em>N.

S. </em>275, \u00a7 2.) It has been held by this court that the statute extends to a justice of the peace sitting on the trial of a civil cause. <em>(Edwards </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>21 <em>Wend. </em>63; <em>Foot </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>1 <em>Hill, </em>654.) Consanguinity is not pretended' between the justice and either of the parties, but it is insisted that there is an <em>affinity </em>by marriage between the plaintiff and the justice, which disqualified him, and such as would have excluded him from being a juror between the parties to this suit. The record shows, that two brothers of the justice intermarried with two sisters of the plaintiff, and that all were living. \u201c\u2022 <em>Affinity,\u201d </em>according to <em>Gibs. Cod. </em>412, (1 <em>Bl. Comm. </em>435, <em>note </em>(9) <em>by </em>Christian,) \u201c always arisesby the marriage of one of the parties so related. A husband is related by affinity to all the <em>consanguinei </em>of his wife, and <em>vice versa, </em>the wife to the husband\u2019s <em>consanguinei ; </em>for the husband and wife being considered one flesh, those who are related to the one by <em>blood, </em>are related to the other by <em>affinity.\u201d \u201c </em>But the <em>consanguinei </em>of the husband are not at all related to the <em>consanguinei </em>of the wife.\u201d If this rule be correct, and I think it is, although the justice was related by affinity to \u00bfhe two sisters of Higbe the plaintiff, there was no such relation between him and Higbe. The judgment of the common pleas must be reversed, and that of the justice affirmed.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ASu\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b187-8\"> See <em>Carman </em>v. <em>Newell, (ante, </em>25.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
