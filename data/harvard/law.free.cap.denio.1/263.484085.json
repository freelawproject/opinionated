S.p. </em>57, \u00a7 13.) He also produced a bond of the defendants with two sureties, conditioned that th\u00e9y would enter at such circuit court, on the first day of its \"session, copies of the process against them, and appear therein by entering special bail. He moved for an order that the security he accepted, and that this court would proceed no further in the cause, &amp;c.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>D. Greig, </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8j\">read an affidavit sworn to by one of them, stating that the plaintiffs\u2019 demand exceeds the sum of $20,000, that the plaintiffs have eleven witnesses residing in the city of New-Yorlc, and none in the northern district, and that the'cause of action arose in this state, in the city of New-Yorlc. It appeared by the statements in the affidavit, that the transaction out of which the action arose took place in Ohio. He insisted, first, that the defendants should be required to put in special bail in this court before the cause could be removed. The act of congress (\u00a7 12) declares that the petition shall be filed \u201c at the time of entering\u201d the defendant\u2019s 11 appearance in the state court.\u201d <em>Appearing, </em>in bailable actions, means putting in and perfecting special bail. Such a step is essential .to protect the rights of the plaintiffs, for the suit may be dismissed in the circuit court, and then it will be necessary to_ continue it here. He contended, secondly, that the cause should be removed to the circuit court for the southern district of New-York. The act of congress provides that it shall be removed \u201cinto the next circuit court to be held in the district where the suit is pending.\u201d There being two judicial districts in this state, it is necessary to inquire in. which of them this suit is pending. If the plaintiffs had declared, the suit would be pending in the district where the venue was laid, but as no declaration, is yet filed, it should be considered to be pending in the district where the venue can rightfully be laid, and the affidavit, he said, showed that it ought to be laid in the city and county of New-York, and therefore the removal ought to be' to the southern district. He cited <em>Redmond </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>(12 <em>John. </em>153.) He also objected that.there was no evidence of the genuineness of the bond produced or of .the sufficiency of -the \u25a0 sureties, who were said to reside at Buffalo, some four hundred miles from this city, and that the plaintiffs had no opportunity of enquiring as to their responsibility.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b264-5\"><em>Stevens, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ArD\">The reference in the act of congress to the <em>appearance </em>in the state court, was simply to fix the time in respect to the progress of the cause in the state court, when the petition should be presented, and it would be incon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>gruous to require special bail in a court from which the cause was about to be removed. The court has power to direct the removal to which circuit it pleases, but it ought to go to the northern district. The cause of action arose in Ohio, the <em>capias </em>is returned and filed in the clerk\u2019s office in that district, and the defendant was arrested there, and, jn the absence of other circumstances, these ought to fix the locality. But we insist that the defendants have a right to elect to which circuit they will go. They are the moving parties, \u00e1nd as the removal to either circuit would be legal and regular, the party moving is entitled to choose the forum.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b265-5\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AYP\">The suit is against three defendants, all of whom join in the petition, and although the <em>capias </em>was served but upon one, an appearance .must be entered for all. We are of opinion that special bail need not be put in in this court, although it is a bailable action. The terms <em>\u201c </em>entering an appearance,\u201d used in the act of congress, are not appropriate words to indicate the putting in of bail. They simply mean that the defendant shall, by entering his appearance, <em>concede </em>that the state court has full jurisdiction over him. Besides, the section provides that the defendant, in order to effect a removal, shall offer good and sufficient surety for his \u201c appearing <em>and </em>entering special bail in the cause,\u201d in the circuit court, if special bail was originally requisite therein. The provision recognizes <em>\u201c </em>appearing\u201d and \u201c entering special bail,\u201d as separate acts. The section further provides, that when a proper bond has-been given for entering bail in the federal court, \u201c any bail that may have been originally taken shall be discharged.\u201d It would be idle to exact special bail here, when such bail would be immediately discharged upon perfecting the removal. The bond offered is in due form, and the only question is as to the sufficiency of the sureties. To ascertain this there must be a reference to the clerk. \u2022 ' \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">By the act of congress the cause is to be removed to the circuit court to be held in the district \u2022\u201c where the suit is pending.\u201d The suit is in this court, which has jurisdiction throughout the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>state, and within the same limits there are two circuit courts of the United States. . We might legally send the cause to either circuit, but it may, without any great inconvenience, go to that of the northern district, as desired by the petitioner. The defendant was arrested there, and it is less remote, than the other district from the state of Ohio, where the cause of action arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Ordered accordingly.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b266-6\"> If there be two defendants in the state court, the cause cannot be removed into the circuit court of the U. S. upon the petition of one of them. <em>(Beardsley </em>v. <em>Torrey, </em>4 <em>Wash. C. C. R. </em>286.) So if there be two defendants, and only one of them is a citizen of another state, the cause cannot be removed. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In such cases the circuit court will remand the cause to the slate court. <em>(Ibid.) </em>If a cause is regularly removed from a state court, the plaintiff cannot-oust the circuit court of jurisdiction by releasing a part of his debt so as to bring it below $500. <em>(Wright </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>1 <em>Pet. </em>220.) .Where the time has gone by within which a petition to remove a cause from a state court can legally be filed, an agreement to consider it filed as of a preceding term, when it would be in time, does not confer jurisdiction on the circuit court. <em>(Gibson </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>1 <em>Pet. C. C. R. </em>44.) Where special bail is put in in a state court, the defendant cannot, <em>at a subsequent time, </em>present his petition to remove the cause to a circuit court of the U. S. <em>(Redmond </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>12 <em>John. </em>153.) But if the petition is filed at the time of putting in special bail, it will be in proper time, though the bail be excepted to. <em>(Arjo </em>v. <em>Monteiro, </em>1 <em>C. R. </em>248.) If the landlord of a tenant in ejectment be an alien, and petition to remove the cause at the time he is let in to defend, he is in season. <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Stiles, </em>4 <em>John. </em>493.) Where the cause of removal is that the defendant is a citizen of another state, that fact must be sworn to positively, and it is not enough to state that he is a resident of such other state. <em>(Corp </em>v. <em>Vermilye, </em>3 <em>John. </em>145.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
