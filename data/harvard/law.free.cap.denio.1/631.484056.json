The defendant not being prepared to make payment as required by the order, his attorney stipulated that they should be paid when taxed. The referee had a right to require payment or such a stipulation. <em>(Butler </em>v. <em>Bates, </em>5 <em>Hill, </em>375.) The defendant having refused to pay after taxation and a demand, the motion should be granted with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
