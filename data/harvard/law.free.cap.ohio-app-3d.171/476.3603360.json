Complainant alleged that she had been sexually harassed by appellant\u2019s executive director, Dale Butler, and terminated in retaliation for complaining about the harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">{\u00b6 3} The commission notified appellant of the charge in a letter, dated August 18, 2005. Appellant responded by filing a position statement with the commission on September 19, 2005, alleging that it had terminated complainant shortly after learning she had been previously convicted of a felony and that complainant had filed the discrimination charges as her own act of retaliation for being terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">{\u00b6 4} On September 19 and 23, 2005, appellant sent letters to the commission, requesting that it issue a subpoena in its name to Adult Parole Authority Officer David Porter. Appellant requested that Officer Porter provide it with all documents pertaining to complainant\u2019s sentence in Arizona, the transfer of her case to Ohio, and all documents pertaining to her parole or probation, including those related to any restrictions placed on her during her parole or probation and the dates and length of her supervision. Appellant also requested a subpoena requiring Officer Porter to meet with it to discuss his conversations with Dale Butler.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">{\u00b6 5} The commission denied appellant\u2019s request to issue a subpoena to Officer Porter, advising appellant that the commission would not issue a subpoena on behalf of a party during the \u201cinvestigative phase\u201d of a discrimination charge, but only during the \u201chearing process.\u201d Thereafter, the commission did issue a subpoena to Officer Porter, but only as part of its investigation of complainant\u2019s charges \u2014 not on appellant\u2019s behalf. In response, Officer Porter provided the commission with information and statements that factored into the agency\u2019s decision-making process. When appellant learned of the existence of this information, appellant sought to obtain it from the commission, but the commission refused to share the information with appellant, relying on certain provisions in R.C. 4112.05(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">{\u00b6 6} On October 27, 2005, the commission issued a decision, finding that it was \u201cprobable\u201d that appellant had engaged in an unlawful discriminatory practice under R.C. 4112.02 when it terminated complainant\u2019s employment. The commission scheduled the matter for conciliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">{\u00b6 7} On December 15, 2005, the commission issued a complaint and notice of hearing to appellant, after failing to resolve the matter through the informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion. The complaint stated that \u201cthe Commission determined at its meeting on October 27, 2005, that it is probable that unlawful discriminatory practices have been or are being perpetrated by [appellant] in violation of [R.C.] 4112.02(A) and (I).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>{\u00b6 8} While these administrative proceedings were pending, appellant, on October 26, 2005, filed a complaint in the Fayette County Court of Common Pleas, seeking a peremptory writ of mandamus compelling the commission and Ohio Attorney General Jim Petro to prepare and issue a subpoena to Officer Porter as requested in the letters appellant sent to the commission on September 19 and 23, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">{\u00b6 9} On November 23, 2005, the commission moved to dismiss appellant\u2019s complaint pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6), arguing that appellant had no clear legal right to have the commission issue the requested subpoena, the commission had no clear legal duty to issue the subpoena, and appellant had an adequate remedy at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">{\u00b6 10} On January 4, 2006, the trial court held a phone conference, permitting the parties to make any additional arguments they had regarding the case. Later that day, the trial court issued an entry ordering that appellant\u2019s complaint for a writ of mandamus be dismissed on the grounds that appellant had no clear legal right to the issuance of a subpoena during the commission\u2019s \u201cinvestigatory phase,\u201d the commission had no clear legal duty to issue the subpoena, and appellant\u2019s \u201cclear remedy lies in the ongoing administrative process, including full discovery rights in the current \u2018formal complaint\u2019 stage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">{\u00b6 11} Appellant now appeals the trial court\u2019s order dismissing its complaint for a writ of mandamus, raising the following assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of appellant as a matter of law when it failed to issue a preemptory [sic] writ of mandamus to the Ohio Civil Rights Commission when the appellant alleged that it had no adequate remedy at law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">{\u00b6 13} Before addressing the issues raised in appellant\u2019s assignment of error, we need to discuss briefly the nature of the two proceedings involved in this case: (1) a discrimination claim brought pursuant to R.C. Chapter 4112 and (2) an application for a writ of mandamus brought pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2731.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">{\u00b6 14} R.C. 4112.05(B)(1) provides that \u201c[a]ny person may file a charge with the commission alleging that another person has engaged or is engaging in an unlawful discriminatory practice,\u201d including sexual harassment, see R.C. 4112.02(A), or retaliation for complaining about an unlawful discriminatory practice, see R.C. 4112.02(1). The person who files the charge is known as \u201cthe complainant,\u201d and the party against whom the charge is filed is known as \u201cthe respondent.\u201d See, generally, R.C. 4112.05(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">{\u00b6 15} R.C. 2731.01 states that \u201c[m]andamus is a writ, issued in the name of the state to an inferior tribunal, a corporation, board, or person, commanding the performance of an act which the law specially enjoins as a duty resulting from an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>office, trust, or station.\u201d R.C. 2731.04 allows a person to petition for an application for the writ of mandamus \u201cin the name of the state on the relation of the person applying.\u201d The party that applies for a writ of mandamus is known as \u201cthe relator,\u201d while the party against whom the writ is sought is known as \u201cthe respondent.\u201d See, generally, <em>State ex rel. Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers v. Sheward </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 451, 715 N.E.2d 1062.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">{\u00b6 16} We are concerned that the use of the term \u201crespondent\u201d may cause confusion in this case since appellant is \u201cthe respondent\u201d for purposes of the discrimination claim, while the commission is \u201cthe respondent\u201d for purposes of the mandamus action. Therefore, when we use the term \u201crespondent,\u201d we will be careful to specify which party to whom we are referring. When we use the term \u201crespondent\u201d without specifically referring to either party, we will be using it simply as the term is used in R.C. Chapter 4112 or Ohio Adm.Code Chapters 4112-1 and 4112-3 or as the term is used in mandamus actions brought pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2731. With that said, we now turn to the merits of appellant\u2019s assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">{\u00b6 17} Appellant argues that the trial court erred in failing to issue a peremptory writ of mandamus to the commission, compelling it to issue the requested subpoena. Appellant\u2019s assignment of error and the commission\u2019s response to it raise a number of issues that we shall address in an order that facilitates our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">{\u00b6 18} The first issue we must decide is whether the issues raised in this appeal are moot. The commission argues that appellant\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus is now moot because appellant has been entitled to have the commission issue a subpoena on appellant\u2019s behalf since December 15, 2005, which was the day the commission issued a complaint against appellant. Consequently, the commission argues that this matter was moot even before the trial court dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint. We disagree with this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cIn a mandamus action, a \"writ will be denied when a question presented by the relator becomes moot.\u201d <em>State ex rel. The Plain Dealer v. Ohio Dept. of Ins. </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 513, 518, 687 N.E.2d 661. A question becomes moot \u201c[w]here, prior to the rendition of a final decision, an event occurs, without the fault of either party, which renders it impossible for the court to grant effectual relief in a case.\u201d <em>Ohio Civ. Serv. Emp. Assn., AFSCME, Local 11, AFL-CIO, v. Ohio Dept. of Transp. </em>(1995), 104 Ohio App.3d 340, 343, 662 N.E.2d 44. When the issues in a case become moot, the case should be dismissed. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">{\u00b6 20} There is, however, a recognized exception to the mootness doctrine for cases that present issues that are capable of repetition but will continually evade review. Id., citing <em>James A. Keller, Inc. v. Flaherty </em>(1991), 74 Ohio App.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>788, 791, 600 N.E.2d 736. This case falls within that exception to the mootness doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">{\u00b6 21} The commission asserts that it has no obligation under R.C. 4112.04(B)(3)(b) to issue a subpoena on respondent\u2019s behalf until the commission issues a complaint against a respondent, even though that section does not expressly impose such a limitation. Therefore, this issue is clearly \u201ccapable of repetition.\u201d <em>Flaherty, </em>74 Ohio App.3d at 791, 600 N.E.2d 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">{\u00b6 22} Furthermore, this case itself demonstrates that the issue \u201cwill continually evade review,\u201d id., if we accept the commission\u2019s argument that the matter has been rendered moot by its issuance of a complaint. By the time a hearing is held in the trial court on an R.C. Chapter 4112 respondent\u2019s application for a writ of mandamus, made pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2731, or by the time the respondent appeals a trial court\u2019s denial of such a writ, the commission will usually have decided whether to bring a complaint against the R.C. Chapter 4112 respondent. If the commission chooses <em>not </em>to bring a complaint against the respondent, the respondent will have no reason to challenge the commission\u2019s position on the issue, and there will be no opportunity for either a trial court or court of appeals to consider whether the commission has a right to deny a respondent\u2019s request for a subpoena until the commission issues a complaint against the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">{\u00b6 23} However, if the commission <em>does </em>choose to bring a complaint against a respondent, as it has against appellant in this case, the commission will then be able to argue, as it has in this case, that the issue has been rendered moot since the respondent will then have full discovery rights, including the right to issue subpoenas, pursuant to Ohio Adm.Code 4112-3-12(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Once again, there will be no opportunity for either a trial court or court of appeals to consider whether the commission has a right to deny a respondent\u2019s request for a subpoena until the commission issues a complaint against the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">{\u00b6 24} The potential unfairness of this situation stems from the fact that the commission is insisting that it has the right to issue subpoenas in furtherance of its preliminary investigation of a complainant\u2019s charge of discrimination, but is denying that same right to a respondent who has a charge brought against it, at least until the commission decides to bring a complaint against the respondent. However, this position appears to run counter to the plain language in R.C. 4112.04(B)(3)(b), which states that a respondent has the right, upon written application, to have the commission issue a subpoena in its name \u201cto the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>extent and subject to the same limitations as subpoenas issued by the commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">{\u00b6 25} By not allowing a respondent to request that the commission issue a subpoena on the respondent\u2019s behalf until the commission brings a complaint against the respondent, the commission is placing respondents such as appellant at a distinct disadvantage, particularly during the conference, conciliation, and persuasion phase of the proceedings. As appellant noted in its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c[The commission] and Appellant repeatedly communicated about reaching a conciliation};] however, Appellant\u2019s counsel informed [the commission] of the unethical nature of advising his client to settle when [the commission] had the upper hand because of its knowledge of the contents of [Officer] Porter\u2019s file. Appellant informed [the commission] that conciliation was meaningless because of the unequal playing field. [The commission] replied by continuing to run the statutory period of conciliation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">{\u00b6 27} After concluding that the informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion were fruitless, the commission, on December 15, 2005, filed a complaint against appellant pursuant to R.C. 4112.05(B)(5). Having done so, the commission claims that the issue of whether the commission can deny a respondent\u2019s request for a subpoena, made pursuant to R.C. 4112.04(B)(3)(b), is now moot. However, for the aforementioned reasons, we conclude that this issue is not moot because it is capable of repetition but will continually evade review. See <em>Flaherty, </em>74 Ohio App.3d at 791, 600 N.E.2d 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">(\u00b6 28} In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the issue of whether the commission is entitled to deny a respondent\u2019s written application for a subpoena, pursuant to R.C. 4112.04(B)(3)(b), until it brings a complaint against the respondent, pursuant to R.C. 4112.05(B)(5), did not become moot after the commission filed a complaint against appellant in the administrative proceedings involving the discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">{\u00b6 29} The second issue that we must address concerns appellant\u2019s argument that the trial court was required, pursuant to R.C. 2731.10, to issue a writ of mandamus when the commission failed to file an answer to its complaint seeking a writ of mandamus. We disagree with this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">{\u00b6 30} When relief is applied for by a writ of mandamus petition, a trial court may respond in three ways: (1) allow the writ without notice, (2) grant an order requiring that the respondent either perform the requested act or show cause why the act should not be performed, or (3) require that notice of the petition be given to the respondent and schedule a hearing on the matter. <em>State ex rel. Mansfield v. Lowrey </em>(C.P.1964), 3 Ohio Misc. 174, 177-178, 32 0.0.2d 481, 210 N.E.2d 751, citing R.C. 2731.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>{\u00b6 31} \u201cWhen the right to require the performance of an act is clear and it is apparent that no valid excuse can be given for not doing it, [the court should] allow a peremptory [writ of] mandamus. In all other cases, an alternative writ must first be issued on the allowance of the court, or a judge thereof.\u201d R.C. 2731.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">{\u00b6 32} A peremptory writ orders the respondent to do the act required, while the alternative writ requires the respondent to do the act required or to show cause why the act is not, or should not, be performed. See <em>Werden v. Milford </em>(C.P.1998), 91 Ohio Misc.2d 215, 218, 698 N.E.2d 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">{\u00b6 33} R.C. 2731.10, which is relied upon by appellant, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cIf no answer is made to an alternative writ of mandamus, a peremptory mandamus must be allowed against the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cR.C. 2731.10 establishes that the failure to answer an <em>alternative unit </em>is grounds for the court to issue the requested writ of mandamus.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State ex rel. Papp v. Norton </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 162, 610 N.E.2d 979.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">{\u00b6 36} In this case, the trial court did not issue either a peremptory writ of mandamus or an alternative writ of mandamus. Instead, the trial court followed the third option listed in R.C. 2731.04 and <em>Lowrey, </em>and required that notice of appellant\u2019s application for the writ of mandamus be given to the respondent in the action, who, in this instance, was the commission, and then scheduled the matter for hearing. See <em>Lowrey, </em>3 Ohio Misc. at 177-178, 32 0.0.2d 481, 210 N.E.2d 751, citing R.C. 2731.04. Therefore, contrary to what appellant says, R.C. 2731.10 has no application to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">{\u00b6 37} The next issue we must address is whether the trial court was correct in dismissing appellant\u2019s mandamus action after finding that appellant failed to establish each of the elements necessary to prevail in its mandamus action.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">{\u00b6 38} In order for a writ of mandamus to issue, the relator must demonstrate that (1) he has a clear legal right to the relief prayed for, (2) the respondent has a clear legal duty to perform the acts, and (3) the relator has no plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. <em>State ex rel. Westbrook v. Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 215, 17 OBR 449, 478 N.E.2d 799. \u201cThe burden of proving these elements is on the relator.\u201d Id. Furthermore, all three of these elements must be met in order for the relator to prevail in the mandamus action. <em>State ex rel. McGrath v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 82287, 2003-Ohio-1969, 2003 WL 1901344, \u00b6 5.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>{\u00b6 39} In support of its argument that it has a clear legal right to have the commission issue the subpoena it requested and that the commission has a clear legal duty to issue it, appellant relies on R.C. 4112.04(B)(3)(b), which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cUpon written application by a respondent, the commission shall issue subpoenas in its name to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as subpoenas issued by the commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">{\u00b6 41} R.C. Chapter 4112 does not provide a formal definition of the term \u201crespondent.\u201d However, R.C. 4112.04(A)(4) provides that \u201c[t]he commission shall * * * [a]dopt, promulgate, amend, and rescind rules to effectuate the provisions of this chapter and the policies and practice of the commission in connection with this chapter.\u201d The Ohio Administrative Code defines the term \u201crespondent,\u201d when used in R.C. Chapter 4112 and Ohio Adm.Code Chapters 4112-1 to 4112-3, as \u201ca person against whom a charge has been filed, or with respect to whom an investigation has been initiated by the commission without a charge, or against whom a complaint has been issued.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 4112-1-01(N).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">{\u00b6 42} The definition of \u201crespondent\u201d in Ohio Adm.Code 4112-1-01(N) comports with the usage of that term in R.C. Chapter 4112. See, e.g., R.C. 4112.05(B)(5) (\u201cIf the commission fails to effect the elimination of an unlawful discriminatory practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion * * * the commission shall issue [a complaint] and cause [it] to be served upon any person, including <em>the respondent against whom a complainant has filed a charge\u201d) </em>(Emphasis added.) Thus, appellant became a respondent for purposes of R.C. 4112.04(B)(3)(b) when complainant filed a charge of discrimination against it on August 18, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">{\u00b6 43} Appellant asserts that the commission was obligated under R.C. 4112.04(B)(3)(b) to issue a subpoena in its name to Officer Porter when appellant filed a written application for one on September 19 and 23, 2005, even though the commission had not yet issued a complaint against appellant. We agree with this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">{\u00b6 44} R.C. 4112.04(B)(3)(b) provides that \u201c[u]pon written application by a respondent, the commission shall issue subpoenas in its name <em>to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as subpoenas issued by the commission.\u201d </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>(Emphasis added.) R.C. 4112.04(B)(3)(a) provides that \u201c[t]he commission * * * may issue subpoenas to compel access to or the production of premises, records, documents, and other evidence or possible sources of evidence or the appearance of individuals * * * to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as would apply if the subpoenas * * * were issued or served in aid of a civil action in a court of common pleas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">{\u00b6 45} In this ease, the commission issued a subpoena to Officer Porter for purposes of its preliminary investigation of complainant\u2019s charge, shortly after it had rejected appellant\u2019s request, pursuant to R.C. 4112.04(B)(3)(b), to have the commission issue a subpoena to Officer Porter on appellant\u2019s behalf. The commission was within in its rights to issue a subpoena to Officer Porter for purposes of its preliminary investigation of complainant\u2019s charge. See R.C. 4112.04(B)(3)(a). However, appellant was within its rights to ask the commission to issue a subpoena to Officer Porter on appellant\u2019s behalf, and the commission was obligated to issue that subpoena upon appellant\u2019s written application. See R.C. 4112.04(B)(3)(b). Consequently, we conclude that appellant had a clear legal right to have the commission issue a subpoena in its name to Officer Porter upon appellant\u2019s written application, and the commission had a clear legal duty to issue the subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">{\u00b6 46} The commission argues that R.C. 4112.04(B)(3)(b) cannot be construed to provide parties like appellant with \u201ca blank check entitling it to a subpoena at any time during the administrative process and conferring a duty upon the commission to issue a subpoena anytime one is requested.\u201d The commission asserts that parties such as appellant are entitled to have the commission issue a subpoena in its name <em>only after </em>it has issued a complaint against the party, pursuant to R.C. 4112.05(B)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">{\u00b6 47} In support of this assertion, the commission relies primarily on Ohio Adm.Code 4112-3-13(B), which, the commission asserts, was promulgated pursuant to the language in R.C. 4112.04(B)(3) authorizing the commission to \u201cmake rules as to the issuance of subpoenas by individual commissioners.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 4112-3-13(B) states that \u201c[s]ubpoenas shall be issued upon receipt of a written request from a respondent * * * which identifies the case caption and complaint number.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">{\u00b6 48} The commission points out that at the time appellant requested a subpoena for Officer Porter, there was no complaint number in the case, since it had not yet filed a complaint against appellant. Consequently, the commission argues that a party such as appellant cannot seek a subpoena through Ohio Adm.Code 4112-3-13(B) \u201cunless and until an administrative complaint is issued,\u201d and, therefore, that \u201ca party is not entitled to a subpoena and the commission has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>no duty to issue a subpoena until after a complaint has been issued.\u201d We disagree with this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">(\u00b6 49} Initially, it appears that the commission promulgated Ohio Adm. Code 4112-3-13(B) pursuant to the authority granted to it by R.C. 4112.04(A)(4), rather than by the aforementioned language in R.C. 4112.04(B)(3).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nevertheless, an administrative rule issued pursuant to statutory authority \u201chas the force of law\u201d <em>only if </em>it is not unreasonable and does not conflict with a statute covering the same subject matter. <em>State ex rel. Celebrezze v. Natl. Lime &amp; Stone Co. </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 377, 382, 627 N.E.2d 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">{\u00b6 50} In this case, Ohio Adm.Code 4112-3-13(B), which requires that a respondent\u2019s written request for a subpoena identify the case caption and complaint number, conflicts with R.C. 4112.04(B)(3)(b), which grants respondents, such as appellant, the right to have the commission issue subpoenas, upon written application, \u201cto the same extent and subject to the same limitations as subpoenas issued by the commission.\u201d Since the commission is entitled to issue subpoenas prior to filing a complaint against a respondent, see R.C.4112.04(B)(3)(a), then respondents are entitled to have the commission issue such subpoenas on their behalf. See R.C. 4112.04(B)(3)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">{\u00b6 51} As a result, Ohio Adm.Code 4112-3-13(B), at least in the context of this case, does not have the \u201cforce of law,\u201d <em>Natl. Lime &amp; Stone Co., </em>68 Ohio St.3d at 382, 627 N.E.2d 538, and that provision of the Ohio Administrative Code cannot be used as a justification for ignoring appellant\u2019s rights under R.C. 4112.04(B)(3)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">{\u00b6 52} This same analysis applies to Ohio Adm.Code 4112-3-12(A), which provides that \u201c[a]fter issuance of a complaint and receipt of the commission\u2019s file by the commission\u2019s attorney, the commission and respondent shall both enjoy the same rights of discovery as are provided for in division (B)(3) of section 4112.04 of the Revised Code, and in rules 26 through 37, \u2018Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure.\u2019 \u201d This provision of the Administrative Code \u201chas the force of law\u201d <em>only if </em>it is not unreasonable and does not conflict with a statute covering the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>same subject matter. <em>Natl. Lime &amp; Stone Co., </em>68 Ohio St.3d at 382, 627 N.E.2d 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">{\u00b6 53} In this case, Ohio Adm.Code 4112-3-12(A) conflicts with R.C. 4112.04(B)(3)(b) since the latter provision grants respondents the right, upon written application, to have the commission issue subpoenas on the respondents\u2019 behalf, \u201cto the same extent and subject to the same limitations as subpoenas issued by the commission,\u201d whereas Ohio Adm.Code 4112-3-12(A) indicates that respondents like appellant will not \u201cenjoy the same rights of discovery as are provided\u201d in R.C. 4112.04(B)(3), and in Civ.R. 26 through 37, until <em>after </em>a complaint is issued and the commission\u2019s attorney receives the commission\u2019s file. Because these limitations are not contained in R.C. 4112.04(B)(3)(b), Ohio Adm. Code 4112-3-12(A), at least in the context of this case, does not have the force of law, see <em>Natl. Lime &amp; Stone Co., </em>68 Ohio St.3d at 382, 627 N.E.2d 538, and that provision of the Administrative Code cannot be used as a justification for ignoring appellant\u2019s rights under R.C. 4112.04(B)(3)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">{\u00b6 54} The commission argues that appellant is still not entitled to a writ of mandamus because appellant has or had several adequate remedies at law that it has chosen not to pursue. We disagree with this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cMandamus will not issue if there is a plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.\u201d <em>State ex rel. United Auto., Aerospace &amp; Agricultural Implement Workers of Am. v. Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp., </em>108 Ohio St.3d 432, 2006-Ohio-1327, 844 N.E.2d 335, \u00b6 54, citing <em>State ex rel. Ross v. State, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 73, 2004-Ohio-1827, 806 N.E.2d 553, \u00b6 5, and R.C. 2731.05. \u201c \u2018The alternative must be complete, beneficial, and speedy in order to constitute an adequate remedy at law.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. United Auto., </em>at \u00b6 54, quoting <em>State ex rel. Ullmann v. Hayes, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 405, 2004-Ohio-5469, 816 N.E.2d 245, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">{\u00b6 56} The commission argues that \u201c[t]he most obvious and complete remedy is [a]ppellant\u2019s current entitlement to a subpoena after the Commission issued its [complaint on December 15, 2005],\u201d adding that \u201c[a]ppellant can [now] avail itself of all the tools of discovery pursuant to [Ohio Adm.Code] 4112-3-12.\u201d The commission also argues that appellant could have requested the commission to reconsider its probable-cause determination in the case and that appellant \u201cstill has the opportunity to resolve the underlying claim through conciliation or settlement and will continue to have this opportunity until the administrative hearing commences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">{\u00b6 57} However, none of the alternative remedies proposed by the commission provide appellant with a complete or adequate remedy. As we have stated, when complainant filed a discrimination charge against appellant, appellant became a \u201crespondent\u201d for purposes of R.C. 4112.04(B)(3)(b), and thus became entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>have the commission issue a subpoena on appellant\u2019s behalf to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as subpoenas issued by the commission. The purpose behind R.C. 4112.04(B)(3)(b) is to place respondents on an equal footing with the commission once a charge of discrimination has been filed against the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">{\u00b6 58} All of the alternative remedies proposed by the commission fail to place appellant on an equal footing with it, as required by R.C. 4112.04(B)(3)(b). Instead, those proposed remedies merely ratify the commission\u2019s position that respondents such as appellant are not entitled to have the commission issue a subpoena on the respondent\u2019s behalf until the commission chooses to file a complaint against the respondent. However, that position is contrary to the plain language in R.C. 4112.04(B)(3)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">{\u00b6 59} By giving respondents the right to have the commission issue subpoenas on their behalf to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as subpoenas issued by the commission, R.C. 4112.04(B)(3)(b) allows a respondent to request a subpoena before a complaint has been brought against it. Additionally, it allows respondents to have the commission issue subpoenas on their behalf before the conciliation phase of the proceedings begins, thereby placing them on an equal footing with the commission during that phase of the proceedings. The commission\u2019s proposed alternative remedies do not offer respondents the same advantage, but, instead, force them to accept the commission\u2019s unwillingness to comply with its duties under R.C. 4112.04(B)(3)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">{\u00b6 60} Under these circumstances, we conclude that appellant does not have an adequate remedy at law. Because (1) appellant had a clear legal right to have the commission issue a subpoena on appellant\u2019s behalf, (2) the commission had a clear legal duty to issue the subpoena, and (3) appellant does not have an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law, we conclude that the trial court erred in dismissing appellant\u2019s mandamus action pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">{\u00b6 61} We also conclude that by refusing to issue the subpoena requested by appellant, the commission failed to engage in a \u201ccompleted attempt\u201d to eliminate unlawful discriminatory practices by conference, conciliation or persuasion before issuing a complaint against appellant, thereby divesting itself of jurisdiction to issue such a complaint against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">{\u00b6 62} \u201cPursuant to R.C. 4112.05(B), a completed and unsuccessful attempt by the Ohio Civil Rights Commission to eliminate unlawful discriminatory practices by conference, conciliation or persuasion is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the issuance of a complaint by the commission.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Republic Steel Corp. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number><em>Ohio Civ.

See R.C. 4112.04(B)(3)(a). By having the commission issue a subpoena to Officer Porter, appellant may have learned information that could have proven useful to appellant during the conciliation phase of these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">{\u00b6 64} However, by refusing to issue the requested subpoena, the commission and appellant were not placed on an equal footing for purposes of the conciliation phase of the proceedings. Because the commission was able to subpoena Officer Porter, but appellant was not, the commission had an unfair advantage against appellant, contrary to R.C. 4112.04(B)(3)(b)\u2019s explicit mandate requiring the commission, \u201cupon written application by a respondent, * * * [to] issue subpoenas in its name to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as subpoenas issued by the commission.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">{\u00b6 65} Under these circumstances, we conclude that the commission failed to engage in \u201ca completed * * * attempt * * * to eliminate unlawful discriminatory practices by conference, conciliation or persuasion,\u201d and, therefore, the commission lacked jurisdiction to issue a complaint against appellant. <em>Republic Steel Corp., </em>44 Ohio St.2d 178, 73 O.O.2d 478, 339 N.E.2d 658, at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">{\u00b6 66} The final issue we must address concerns the commission\u2019s request in its reply to appellant\u2019s brief that we dismiss Ohio Attorney General Jim Petro as a party to this action on the grounds that R.C. 4112.10 requires the attorney general of this state to act as counsel for the Ohio Civil Rights Commission, and that appellant, without citing any authority in support, \u201cis essentially suing an attorney for an alleged violation by the client.\u201d While we are not unsympathetic to this argument, we conclude that it is not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">{\u00b6 67} App.R. 3(C)(1) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-9\">{\u00b6 68} \u201cA person who intends to defend a judgment or order against an appeal taken by an appellant and <em>who also seeks to change the judgment or order </em>* * * shall file a notice of cross appeal within the time allowed by App.R. 4.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">{\u00b6 69} In its January 4, 2006 order dismissing appellant\u2019s mandamus action, the trial court expressly dismissed appellant\u2019s action against the commission, but failed to expressly dismiss appellant\u2019s action against the attorney general. While that may have been what the trial court intended, that is not what the trial court did. By requesting that this court dismiss the attorney general as a party to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>appellant\u2019s mandamus action, the commission is tacitly acknowledging that the trial court failed to dismiss the attorney general as a party to appellant\u2019s mandamus action.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">{\u00b6 70} Furthermore, by requesting that this court dismiss the attorney general as a party to appellant\u2019s mandamus action, the commission is essentially seeking \u201cto change the * * * order\u201d from which the appeal has been taken. App.R. 3(C)(1). Consequently, the commission needed to file a cross appeal in order to accomplish that objective. Id. Nevertheless, after this case is remanded, the commission and the attorney general will, again, be able to request that the attorney general be dismissed as a party to this action on the grounds set forth in their appellate brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">{\u00b6 71} In light of the foregoing, appellant\u2019s assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">{\u00b6 72} The trial court\u2019s judgment is reversed, and this cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b530-9\">Walsh and Young, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-14\">.
