We find merit in one of her assignments of error, and we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">{\u00b6 2} The parties had substantial assets. The primary asset was a business, which was actually an amalgamation of four companies. The primary company was Sure-Wood Forest Products, Inc. For simplicity, we refer to Sure-Wood when discussing the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">{\u00b6 3} Robin had purchased the business during the marriage. Through her substantial efforts, it had become a multi-million-dollar enterprise. The trial court accepted the valuation made by Robin\u2019s expert and found that Sure-Wood was worth $9 million, instead of $13 million, as Andy\u2019s expert had testified. As part of the property division, the court awarded Andy $4.5 million, half of Sure-Wood\u2019s value.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-14\">{\u00b6 4} In this appeal, Robin presents two assignments of error. In her first assignment of error, she contends that the trial court erred in failing to consider the tax consequences associated with the property award. She argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>property division effectively forces her to dispose of assets to meet her obligations, causing her to incur tax consequences, and that those consequences rendered the property division inequitable. This assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\"> {\u00b6 5} R.C. 3105.171(C)(1) provides that the court should divide marital property equally unless an equal division would be inequitable. R.C. 3105.171(F) sets forth the factors the court must consider in making its decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court has broad discretion in fashioning an equitable division of property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An appellate court will not reverse the trial court\u2019s decision absent an abuse of that discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, an appellate court should not review discrete aspects of the property division out of the context of the entire award.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">{\u00b6 6} R.C. 3105.171(F)(6) requires the trial court to consider the tax consequences when dividing and awarding marital property, as long as they are not speculative.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If an award of property, in effect, forces a party to dispose of an asset to meet an obligation the court has imposed, the court must consider the tax consequences.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">{\u00b6 7} First, we note that in analyzing the issue, the magistrate\u2019s report incorrectly stated that \u201cOhio law * * * does not allow for the deduction of tax consequences on property that is not actually being sold.\u201d But it went on to accurately summarize the law. The court did not, as Robin contends, fail to consider the tax consequences. Instead, it correctly concluded that the tax consequences were speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">{\u00b6 8} The trial court ordered Robin to pay $4.5 million to Andy, his share of the value of the business. Robin contends that it essentially ordered a sale of one-half of the business and that such a sale would involve substantial tax consequences. She presented expert testimony about those consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>{\u00b6 9} The flaw in this argument is that nothing in the trial court\u2019s order actually required her to sell half the business. As the court pointed out, she may never sell the business, and \u201cshe will never experience any tax consequences while continuing to enjoy the extensive benefits of owning the companies, including their large income flow and expected annual growth of 10% \u2014 20% per year.\u201d Under the circumstances, we cannot hold that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that the tax consequences were speculative.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">{\u00b6 10} Robin also presented evidence that paying Andy $4.5 million would require her to generate income of over $5 million. To pay Robin that amount of income, the business would have to generate additional profits of over $9 million on gross sales of over $38 million, which would have substantial tax consequences. Again, the court\u2019s order does not require her to pay the money out of dividend income. Thus, the consequences were speculative; many ways may exist to structure the payment to minimize tax consequences. Further, we find it somewhat disingenuous to argue that she has to pay taxes on the income used to generate dividends to pay Andy\u2019s share. She would have to pay taxes on the income in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">{\u00b6 11} Under the circumstances, we cannot hold that the trial court\u2019s finding that any tax consequences were speculative was so arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable as to connote an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Further, this determination did not render the overall property division inequitable. We overrule Robin\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">{\u00b6 12} In her second assignment of error, Robin contends that the trial court erred in ordering her to pay Andy \u201cinterest on his portion of the property division.\u201d She argues that any increase in value that occurs to property after the de facto termination of the marriage due to one party\u2019s efforts belongs solely to that party. She also argues that the trial court\u2019s use of a ten percent interest rate was not supported by the evidence. We find some merit in this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">{\u00b6 13} The trial court found that the de facto termination of the marriage occurred in February 2002. The court journalized the magistrate\u2019s report on December 6, 2005, and the divorce decree on April 27, 2006. In her report, the magistrate stated that \u201c[s]ince the parties have separated, Wife has had sole use of the millions of dollars in income to fund growth for the company. Husband is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>entitled to share in the growth that was made possible by the use of his half of the companies and their income. The most appropriate way to determine the growth that Husband is entitled to is to look at the growth of the company. [Robin\u2019s expert] used a 10% compounded growth rate for the future of the company indefinitely into the future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">{\u00b6 14} The magistrate went on to set out a \u201crecapitulation of marital property division,\u201d which listed each piece of property both Andy and Robin were to receive in the property division and its value in separate columns. She then stated that \u201cRobin shall pay to Andy the net difference between their two columns as listed in the above recapitulation, within six months of the journalization of this decision, plus 10% simple interest, per year, effective Feb. 14, 2002.\u201d Paying the ten percent on the difference between the amounts of property the court awarded the parties did not follow, since the idea was to compensate Andy for the use of his money.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">{\u00b6 15} But even though the trial court overruled Robin\u2019s objections and adopted the magistrate\u2019s report, the decree contained different language. It stated that \u201c[p]laintiff shall pay defendant 10% simple interest effective February 14, 2002 until payment on * * * $4,500,000 as half of the marital interest in the companies. This amount is $1,800,000 as of February 13, 2006 and $37,500 per month thereafter until the $4,500,000 is paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">{\u00b6 16} Robin is correct in this case when she contends that Andy was not entitled to share in the growth of the company after the de facto termination of the marriage in February 2002 because the court used that date to value the business. The court\u2019s decision to set that date as the de facto termination of the marriage was within its discretion and was supported by the evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While it had discretion to use a different valuation date for any of the parties\u2019 assets as long as it adequately explained its reasons for doing so, it used the same valuation date for all the assets.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Consequently, any growth in the company that occurred after the de facto termination date was not marital property.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">{\u00b6 17} Andy contends that the interest payment was not due to the increased value of the property. He argues that it was a \u201cusage charge\u201d for Robin having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>the use of his share of the business for the four years the divorce was pending. We agree. After all, the very definition of interest is a fee or charge for the use of money.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">{\u00b6 18} Andy also contends that a charge for the use of the money that he could not use was equitable. Again, we agree. Such an award of interest was within the trial court\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But we take issue with how the court characterized the interest and how it determined the interest rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">{\u00b6 19} If the interest was not due to the increased value of the business, then the interest rate should not have been tied to the company\u2019s growth rate, particularly since Andy was not entitled to share in the growth of the company after the date the court valued the business, in this case the de-facto-termination date of the marriage. Therefore, the court erred in setting the interest rate at ten percent based on Robin\u2019s expert\u2019s testimony about the company\u2019s growth.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">{\u00b6 20} We note that R.C. 1343.03, which sets forth the statutory interest rate, does not technically apply in the case although the court could appropriately use it as a guideline.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The statutory rate was ten percent at one time.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> But the legislature has amended the statutes and tied the statutory interest rate to the federal short-term rate.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">{\u00b6 21} Under the circumstances, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in determining the interest rate. We sustain Robin\u2019s second assignment of error in part, reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment in part, and remand the cause to the trial court to determine the appropriate rate of interest by hearing evidence on what a reasonable return on investment would have been for the four years in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b315-10\">Cunningham, P.J., and Winkler, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Ralph Winkler, J., retired, of the First District Court of Appeals, sitting by-assignment.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-9\">. <em>Zerbe </em>v. <em>Zerbe, </em>1st Dist Nos.
