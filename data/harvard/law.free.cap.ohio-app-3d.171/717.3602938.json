Rath, and ordered a new trial. For the reasons that follow, we hereby reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-12\">{\u00b6 2} The relevant, undisputed facts are as follows. In August 2002, appellee, Robin L. Redlin,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Rath were involved in an automobile accident on Secor Road in Toledo, Ohio. On January 29, 2004, Redlin filed the complaint herein against Rath, seeking damages for injuries she allegedly incurred as a result of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-13\">{\u00b6 3} The matter was tried to a jury on December 5, 6, and 7, 2005, after which a verdict was returned in favor of Rath. On March 27, 2006, the trial court entered judgment in Rath\u2019s favor. However, on April 10, 2006, the trial court, acting on its own initiative, filed a decision and journal entry, in which it vacated the March 27 judgment entry and ordered a new trial. Rath filed a notice of appeal from that judgment on April 25, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-14\">{\u00b6 4} On appeal, Rath sets forth the following as his sole assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-15\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe trial court erred in sua sponte vacating the unanimous jury verdict and final judgment entry, and ordering a new trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>{\u00b6 6} In his appellate brief, Rath sets forth several arguments in support of his assignment of error. Because it presents a threshold issue, we will first address Rath\u2019s assertion that the trial court abused its discretion, and thereby denied him due process, by sua sponte ordering a new trial without first giving the parties notice and an opportunity to be heard as required in the second paragraph of Civ.R. 59(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">{\u00b6 7} Civ.R. 59(D) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-6\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cNot later than fourteen days after entry of judgment the court of its own initiative may order a new trial for any reason for which it might have granted a new trial on motion of a party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-7\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe court may also grant a motion for a new trial, timely served by a party, for a reason not stated in the party\u2019s motion. In such case the court shall give the parties notice and an opportunity to be heard on the matter. The court shall specify the grounds for new trial in the order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">{\u00b6 10} In support of his argument, appellant cites <em>Musca v. Chagrin Falls </em>(1981), 3 Ohio App.3d 192, 3 OBR 219, 444 N.E.2d 475. The dispute in <em>Musca </em>centered around liability for an unpaid water bill in the amount of $11,594.93. Initially, Musca, a local business owner, requested an injunction prohibiting Chagrin Falls\u2019s city water department from obtaining a lien on her business and adding the unpaid balance to her tax bill. After holding a hearing, the trial court enjoined the city water department\u2019s efforts to collect the water bill. However, 13 days later, the trial court sua sponte vacated its judgment entry and denied Musca\u2019s request for injunctive relief without notice or a hearing. Musca filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">{\u00b6 11} On appeal, the Eighth District Court of Appeals analyzed the language of Civ.R. 59(D) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-10\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cEach paragraph in (D) provides a trial judge sua sponte authority to grant a new trial but it is not clear that the procedures for notice and hearing and the specification of grounds provided in the second paragraph also apply to the first. However, there appears to be no reason why the draftsmen should intend a procedural difference when sua sponte authority is exercised under the first rather than the second provision. On the other hand there are obvious reasons for intending notice and hearing for both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe ambiguity is resolved if Civ.R. 59(D) is read as though the last two sentences of the second paragraph were part of a third paragraph providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>{\u00b6 14} \u201c \u2018In such case[s]<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark> the court shall give the parties notice and an opportunity to be heard on the matter. The court shall specify the grounds for [the] new trial.\u2019 \u201d (Footnote sic.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">{\u00b6 15} Generally, in deciding whether the language employed in a statute, or, in this case, a Civil Rule, is ambiguous, a court is required \u201c \u2018to objectively and thoroughly examine the writing to attempt to ascertain its meaning. * * * Only when a definitive meaning proves elusive should rules for construing ambiguous language be employed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Meadounvood Manor, Inc. v. Ohio Dept. of Health, </em>12th Dist. No. 2006-08-010, 2007-Ohio-2067, 2007 WL 1248183, \u00b6 19, quoting <em>State v. Porterfield, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 5, 2005-Ohio-3095, 829 N.E.2d 690, \u00b6 11. In so doing, courts must keep in mind that \u201c[susceptibility] to more than one interpretation does not necessarily render a provision ambiguous.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">{\u00b6 16} After thoroughly reviewing the language employed in Civ.R. 59(D) we find that although the rule is susceptible to more than one interpretation, it is not ambiguous on its face. To the contrary, it is quite possible to conclude that the requirement for notice and a hearing is imposed only in cases where the trial court grants a timely motion for a new trial on grounds other than those raised in a motion for a new trial. This interpretation is reasonable, particularly since the first paragraph of Civ.R. 59(D) imposes a relatively short 14-day limitation on the trial court\u2019s authority to sua sponte order a new trial. Accordingly, we disagree with the Eighth District Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that notice and a hearing are required when the trial court sua sponte orders a new trial, and we refuse to impose such a requirement in this case. Rath\u2019s argument that notice and a hearing are required is, therefore, without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">{\u00b6 17} Having resolved the threshold issue of due process, we now turn to Rath\u2019s assertion that the trial court erred by ordering a new trial based on defense counsel\u2019s alleged misconduct. In support, Rath argues that his defense counsel\u2019s conduct \u201cwas neither inflammatory, prejudicial, nor in any way had a negative impact on the jury\u201d; and neither the trial court nor plaintiffs counsel objected to defense counsel\u2019s actions at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">{\u00b6 18} We note initially that a reviewing court may reverse a trial court\u2019s order for a new trial only if in ordering the new trial, the trial court had abused its discretion. <em>Antal v. Olde Worlds Prods. </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St.3d 144, 145, 9 OBR 392, 459 N.E.2d 223. An abuse of discretion connotes more than a mere error of law or judgment; it requires a finding that the trial court\u2019s decision was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. This \u201chigh abuse-of-discretion standard\u201d is necessary because the trial court\u2019s ruling may require an evaluation of factors that are not readily apparent upon review of the trial court\u2019s record. <em>McLeod v. Mt. Sinai Med. Ctr., </em>166 Ohio App.3d 647, 2006-Ohio-2206, 852 N.E.2d 1235, \u00b6 27, citing <em>Schlundt v. Wank </em>(Apr. 17, 1997), Cuyahoga App. No. 70978, 1997 WL 186830. Nevertheless, \u201cso long as the verdict is supported by substantial, competent, credible evidence, the jury verdict is presumed to be correct and the trial court must refrain from granting a new trial.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">{\u00b6 19} As set forth above, pursuant to Civ.R. 59(D), the trial court may sua sponte order a new trial \u201cfor any reason for which it might have granted a new trial on motion of a party.\u201d Civ.R. 59(A) provides the following relevant bases upon which a party may seek a new trial:</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(1) Irregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury, magistrate, or prevailing party, or any order of the court or magistrate, or abuse of discretion, by which an aggrieved party was prevented from having a fair trial;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-7\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(2) Misconduct of the jury or prevailing party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-8\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-9\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(6) The judgment is not sustained by the weight of the evidence; * * *;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-10\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(7) The judgment is contrary to law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-11\">{\u00b625}\u201c* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-12\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cIn addition to the above grounds, a new trial may also be granted in the sound discretion of the court for good cause shown.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-13\">{\u00b6 27} In its judgment entry, the trial court found, after reviewing \u201cnotes of the trial, the file, the pleadings and the closing argument of Defense Counsel,\u201d that defense counsel\u2019s conduct was \u201cinflammatory, prejudicial, and had a substantial negative impact on the jury\u2019s decision.\u201d The trial court concluded that the jury\u2019s verdict was \u201ccontrary to law.\u201d In support of its conclusion, the trial court cited the following specific instances of defense counsel\u2019s alleged misconduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-14\">{\u00b628} \u201cDuring Jury examination Defense Counsel informed the potential members that neither he nor Plaintiffs counsel wanted an unbiased panel. This in effect called Plaintiffs Counsel\u2019s remarks into question since he [plaintiffs counsel] had repeatedly asked the potential jurors if they could treat both sides fairly. Furthermore, it informed the jury [that defense counsel] was not interested in a fair and impartial adjudication. This is unacceptable to the Court and perhaps unethical.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-15\">{\u00b629} \u201cDefense Counsel often inserted prejudicial remarks during the trial. On one occasion during the trial Defense Counsel blurted out, essentially testify<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>ing, that \u2018he was glad to finally see the pictures\u2019 offered by the Plaintiff. He either had the pictures or could have had them in discovery. This \u2018testimony\u2019 and others like it was designed to prejudice the jury against the Plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-5\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cMost egregious of all was counsel\u2019s closing argument. Prior to the commencement of the trial Defense counsel moved to exclude the police report concerning the automobile accident which was the basis for the Plaintiffs case. That motion was granted, yet in closing argument [defense counsel] stated that the Plaintiff should have called the police officers who made the report as witnesses during the trial. The inference being that the Plaintiffs\u2019 [sic] were trying to hide something from the jury. * * * [Defense counsel] further inferred in his argument, without any basis in evidence, that the Court, counsel for the plaintiff and the system were prejudiced against him and his client. Finally, his uses of inflammatory remarks like \u2018money grab\u2019 are so offensive as to shock the conscious and should not be condoned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">{\u00b6 31} As to counsel\u2019s comments during voir dire, a review of the trial transcript shows that the trial court stated: \u201cWhat we\u2019re looking for is we want to get a jury that\u2019s just like the one you\u2019d like to have if you had a case. People that are fair and impartial * * Thereafter, plaintiffs counsel stated: \u201c[Defense counsel] and myself [want] a jury that we both feel can be fair to the plaintiff and can be fair to the defense.\u201d Defense counsel later told the jury that \u201cwe all want fair jurors and we all want you to independently consider the evidence, but there\u2019s two sides here, and they\u2019re trying to pull you your way or our way or his way.\u201d No objection was made by either side as to these comments, and the court made no attempt to correct either party after these remarks were made to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">{\u00b6 32} As to defense counsel\u2019s comments regarding pictures of the parties\u2019 respective vehicles, the trial transcript shows that Redlin referred to photographs of her vehicle during her direct testimony; however, her attorney did not enter the photographs into evidence at that time. On cross-examination, defense counsel showed Redlin photographs of the damage to Rath\u2019s vehicle, which were entered into evidence. Later, on direct examination, plaintiffs counsel showed Redlin\u2019s son, Matthew, and her husband, Greg, pictures of the damage to Redlin\u2019s vehicle. Later, on cross-examination of Greg Redlin, defense counsel commented: \u201c[We] finally got some photographs from you folks.\u201d No objection was made to defense counsel\u2019s comments, and the trial court made no independent attempt to intervene during Greg Redlin\u2019s cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">{\u00b6 33} At the close of all the evidence, the trial court conferred with counsel for both parties outside the hearing of the jury, during which plaintiffs counsel made a motion for a directed verdict. Before denying the motion the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>{\u00b6 34} \u201cWould I find liability if called upon, I think I probably would in this case, I think I probably would, but you know what, the point is not what I would do, the point is could reasonable minds come to a different conclusion and I think they could.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">{\u00b6 35} Thereafter, a discussion regarding the admission of evidence took place, during which the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-6\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cThe Court: You know it\u2019s going to be an interesting case. You\u2019re a good man, [Defense counsel].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-7\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cDefense counsel: I\u2019m glad that one\u2019s on the record. [Plaintiffs counsel is] a good man too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-8\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cThe Court: It\u2019s your job, why would I get \u2014 You can\u2019t take this personally, it\u2019s your job to do these things. * * * I mean that\u2019s what you do, I\u2019m not going to get personally involved in that. That\u2019s your job. I don\u2019t have any problem with it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">{\u00b6 39} After the above exchange, closing remarks were made to the jury. The trial transcript shows that during closing, plaintiffs counsel asked the jury to return a verdict of $50,000 for Robin Redlin and $10,000 for her husband, Greg Redlin. Defense counsel told the jury during closing that the case was a \u201cmoney grabber,\u201d and further stated that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel was \u201cshooting high hoping you\u2019re going to land high.\u201d Defense counsel also asked: \u201cWhere are the police officers? I don\u2019t recall them testifying * * * We didn\u2019t hear from the police officers. This gentleman [Greg Redlin is] a police officer. We didn\u2019t * * * hear any body man come in here and talk about what was repaired on the car.\u201d He then referred to Redlin\u2019s photographic exhibits by saying: \u201cI about jumped out of my seat yesterday when they finally stood up and gave you their photographs, maybe you\u2019ll remember, funny how they didn\u2019t want to talk about their photographs until they absolutely had to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">{\u00b6 40} In addition, defense counsel stated: \u201cI told you when we started, [plaintiffs] counsel stood here in jury selection and said he wanted a fair and impartial jury. I told you that\u2019s baloney, he wants things [sic] that see things his way, I want a jury that sees things our way. I\u2019d like you to have sympathy, I\u2019d like you to have heart. He\u2019s a nice man. They have been playing the sympathy card since we started. But you know what the judge is going to tell us and tell you? \u2014 No sympathy. You use logic.\u201d Defense counsel also stated: \u201cMoney grab, folks, excessive care and treatment, unnecessary care and treatment * * *. [Plaintiffs counsel] stood here and told you he wanted you to be fair. Guess what? We\u2019re hoping that you\u2019re fair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">{\u00b6 41} No objections were made to defense counsel\u2019s closing remarks, either by the trial court or plaintiffs counsel. In rebuttal, plaintiffs counsel asked the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>to not allow defense counsel to \u201cmuddy the water.\u201d He then agreed with defense counsel that \u201c[I]t\u2019s about money, it is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">{\u00b6 42} In addition to the above, the trial transcript contains the testimony of Redlin, who stated that at the time of the accident, she was employed cleaning houses. Redlin further stated that immediately following the accident, she was able to drive her vehicle to work, where she cleaned a private residence that day, as scheduled. As to the extent of her injuries, Redlin testified that several days after the accident, she developed pain in her body and suffered depression and blinding headaches, and she was admitted to the hospital for several days. After her release from the hospital, Redlin sought treatment from several doctors and a chiropractor, who were able to relieve her symptoms. The jury also heard testimony from Redlin\u2019s treating physician, who stated that she had pain as a result of the accident. In addition, Redlin\u2019s husband, Greg, and her son, Matthew, testified that Redlin suffered from headaches and depression following the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">{\u00b6 43} The transcript also contains Rath\u2019s testimony, in which he stated that Redlin was in no apparent pain immediately after the accident and that neither party\u2019s vehicle sustained major damage. In addition, the jury heard the video deposition <em>of </em>Rath\u2019s medical expert who testified that although Redlin may have suffered from headaches as a result of the accident, the treatment she received in 2003 and 2004 was not for a medical condition related to the accident. As set forth above, the jury also heard evidence as to the monetary value of Redlin\u2019s medical treatment, pain and suffering, as well as the value of the loss of consortium suffered by her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">{\u00b6 44} It is well-settled that the law does not prohibit trial counsel from zealously representing a client. <em>McLeod v.

Upon consideration thereof, we find that defense counsel\u2019s comments, while decidedly zealous, were not so \u201coutrageous\u201d or \u201cheinous\u201d as to improperly prejudice or inflame the jury.
