Because the entry from which Fuller appeals is not a final, appealable order, we dismiss his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">{\u00b6 2} On April 23, 2004, Fuller was convicted upon his plea of guilty to aggravated trafficking in drugs. On May 25, he filed a pro se notice of appeal. The state moved to dismiss the appeal, not on the ground that it was untimely, but on the ground that it had been taken from \u201can agreed sentence.\u201d On July 2, 2004, we granted the motion to dismiss without elaboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">{\u00b6 3} On January 24, 2006, we reopened Fuller\u2019s appeal upon our determination that he had been denied the effective assistance of counsel on appeal, because his retained trial counsel had not, as Fuller had requested, filed a notice of appeal, and because the trial court had not, despite Fuller\u2019s submission of an affidavit of indigency, appointed appellate counsel. The transcript of the proceedings at trial was filed in the appeal on March 10, 2006.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On April 18, 2006, Fuller filed his postconviction petition. The common pleas court denied the petition for lack of jurisdiction. Fuller now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">I. The Common Pleas Court Had Jurisdiction to Entertain Fuller\u2019s Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">{\u00b6 4} In his first assignment of error, Fuller contends that the common pleas court erred in declining to entertain his petition. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">{\u00b6 5} R.C. 2953.21 et seq., governing postconviction proceedings, permit a collateral challenge to a judgment of conviction by one \u201cwho claims that there was such a denial or infringement of [his] rights [in the proceedings resulting in his conviction] as to render [his conviction] void or voidable under the Ohio Constitution or the Constitution of the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> R.C. 2953.21(A)(2) provides that a postconviction petition \u201cshall be filed no later than one hundred eighty days after the date on which the trial transcript is filed in the court of appeals in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>direct appeal of the judgment of conviction,\u201d and that \u201c[i]f no appeal is taken * * *, the petition shall be filed no later than one hundred eighty days after the expiration of the time for filing the appeal.\u201d R.C. 2953.23 closely circumscribes the common pleas court\u2019s jurisdiction to entertain a tardy postconviction petition: The petitioner must show that he was unavoidably prevented from discovering the facts upon which his petition depends, or he must show that his claim is predicated upon a new or retrospectively applicable federal or state right recognized by the United States Supreme Court since the expiration of the prescribed time; and he must show \u201cby clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error at trial, no reasonable factfinder would have found [him] guilty.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, a common pleas court has jurisdiction to entertain a postconviction petition only if the petitioner meets either the time strictures of R.C. 2953.21 or the jurisdictional requirements of R.C. 2953.23.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">{\u00b6 6} Fuller filed his postconviction petition 39 days after the transcript of the proceedings had been filed in his reopened appeal. The statute affords a postconviction petitioner 180 days \u201cafter the date on which the trial transcript is filed in the court of appeals in the direct appeal of the judgment of conviction.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But the state argues that the statute did not afford Fuller 180 days from the date the transcript was filed in his reopened appeal, because a reopened appeal is not a \u201cdirect appeal.\u201d To hold otherwise, the state insists, would be to \u201cextend[ ] indefinitely\u201d the time for filing a postconviction petition and thus to \u201cfrustrate\u201d the General Assembly\u2019s purpose in enacting the statute\u2019s time limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">{\u00b6 7} In 1998, the Tenth Appellate District in <em>State v. Price </em>followed this line of reasoning to hold that the common pleas court had properly declined to entertain a postconviction petition filed within 180 days of the filing of the trial transcript in an appeal by leave of court, or \u201cdelayed appeal,\u201d under App.R. 5(A).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court in <em>Price </em>noted that the General Assembly had amended the postconviction statutes in 1995 to add the R.C. 2953.21(A)(1) time limits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court then interpreted the statute by applying the statutory presumptions that the legislature had intended by that amendment that the entire statute be effective and that the result be just and reasonable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court noted that App.R. 5(A) places no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>time limit on a motion for a delayed appeal. Thus, the court reasoned, an interpretation of the statute that permitted a postconviction petition to be filed \u25a0within 180 days of the filing of the transcript in a delayed appeal would nullify the legislature\u2019s \u201cobvious\u201d intent to place time limits on such actions and would unreasonably afford \u201ca defendant who had neglected to file a direct appeal, and subsequently brought a delayed appeal\u201d more time than that afforded \u201ca defendant who had timely prosecuted his direct appeal.\u201d Accordingly, the court concluded that the time for filing Price\u2019s petition had \u201cexpired one hundred eighty days after the time [had expired] for filing his <em>direct appeal as of right </em>* * * pursuant to App.R. 4(A).\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">{\u00b6 8} In 2000, the Tenth Appellate District in <em>State v. Bird </em>expanded upon the reasoning of its unpublished decision in <em>Price </em>to arrive at the same conclusion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court deemed the statute\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cdirect appeal\u201d ambiguous and thus subject to interpretation \u201cbased upon the legislative intent\u201d of the amendment, as determined in <em>Price, </em>to place time limits on postconviction actions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, the court in <em>Bird </em>made manifest what it had in <em>Pnce </em>implied: that for purposes of the postconviction statutes, the phrase \u201cdirect appeal\u201d means only an appeal as of right filed under App.R. 4; it does not encompass an appeal by leave of court under App.R. 5(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">{\u00b6 9} The Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Appellate Districts have followed <em>Price </em>to hold that the phrase \u201cdirect appeal,\u201d as used in the postconviction statutes, does not include a delayed appeal under App.R. 5(A).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And the Fifth Appellate District, in its 2000 decision in <em>State v. Godfrey, </em>embraced the rationale of <em>Price </em>to hold that \u201cdirect appeal\u201d does not include an appeal reopened under App.R. 26(B).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">{\u00b6 10} The <em>Godfrey </em>court based its holding upon its assertion that \u201c[a] \u2018direct appeal\u2019 is referred to as an \u2018appeal as of right\u2019 under App.R. 3\u201d and upon \u201cthe procedural differences that exist between a \u2018direct appeal\u2019 or \u2018appeal as of right\u2019 and a \u2018reopened appeal\u2019 \u201d The court acknowledged that App.R. 26(B), unlike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>App.R. 5(A), limits the time within which an application to reopen an appeal maybe filed. But the court asserted that because App.R. 26(B) permits an appeal to be reopened out of time upon a showing of good cause for the filing delay, \u201ctheoretically, there is no time limitation with a reopened appeal.\u201d The court further asserted that to read the statute to permit a postconviction petition to be filed within 180 days of the filing of the transcript in a reopened appeal would effectively permit the filing of two petitions: one within 180 days of the filing of the transcript in the \u201cdirect appeal\u201d and a second within 180 days of the filing of the transcript in the reopened appeal. Thus, the court concluded, \u201cit is not the filing of the transcript that triggers the [180-]day rule in R.C. 2953.21(A)(2), but rather the filing of a direct appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">{\u00b6 11} We are not bound by the decisions in <em>Price </em>and its progeny. Nor does the force of the courts\u2019 logic in those cases compel us to the same conclusion. To the contrary, our analysis leads us to conclude that the phrase \u201cdirect appeal\u201d as used in R.C. 2953.21 encompasses an appeal as of right under App.R. 4, an appeal by leave of court under App.R. 5(A), and an appeal reopened under App.R. 26(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">{\u00b6 12} R.C. 2953.21(A)(2) provides that if a <em>\u201cdirect appeal of the judgment of conviction </em>\u201d is taken, the time for filing a postconviction petition begins to run on \u201cthe date on which the trial transcript is filed in * * * the direct appeal\u201d; \u201cif no [direct] appeal is taken,\u201d the time for filing a posteonviction petition begins to run upon \u201cthe expiration of the time for filing the [direct] appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The <em>Price </em>court deemed R.C. 2953.21(A)(2) ambiguous, interpreted the statute to advance the statute\u2019s \u201cobvious\u201d legislative intent, and concluded that a \u201cdirect appeal\u201d is synonymous with an \u201cappeal as of right.\u201d The <em>Godfrey </em>court proceeded upon the assertion that \u201c[a] \u2018direct appeal\u2019 is referred to as an \u2018appeal as of right\u2019 under App.R. 3.\u201d And it based its holding on \u201cthe procedural differences that exist between a \u2018direct appeal\u2019 or \u2018appeal as of right\u2019 and a \u2018reopened appeal.\u2019 \u201d Thus, the decisions in <em>Price </em>and its progeny turned upon a definition of the phrase \u201cdirect appeal\u201d that includes an App.R. 4 \u201cappeal as of right,\u201d but excludes an App.R. 5(A) delayed appeal and an App.R. 26(B) reopened appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">1. The Appellate Rules</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">{\u00b6 13} A close reading of the appellate rules does not support the distinctions drawn by the courts in <em>Price </em>and its progeny between an appeal by right and a delayed or reopened appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>a</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">{\u00b6 14} App.R. 3 governs how an \u201cappeal as of right\u201d is taken. App.R. 4 prescribes the time for taking an \u201cappeal as of right.\u201d App.R. 5(A) governs an \u201cappeal by leave of court,\u201d or \u201cdelayed appeal,\u201d granted after that time has expired. And App.R. 26(B) permits the \u201creopening of [an] appeal from [a] judgment of conviction and sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">{\u00b6 15} But the procedural differences between an appeal by right under App.R. 3 and 4 and an App.R. 26(B) reopened appeal are not as significant as the court in <em>Godfrey </em>would have them. App.R. 3 and 4 differ from App.R. 26 in that they provide different means for initiating intermediate appellate review of a judgment of conviction. But after an appeal is reopened, an indigent appellant is entitled to appointed counsel, and the appeal \u201cproceed[s] as on an initial appeal in accordance with [the appellate] rules except that the court may limit its review to those assignments of error and arguments not previously considered.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">b</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">{\u00b6 16} The <em>Godfrey </em>court\u2019s assertion that \u201c[a] \u2018direct appeal\u2019 is referred to as an \u2018appeal as of right\u2019 under App.R. 3\u201d is also mistaken. The phrase \u201cdirect appeal\u201d appears nowhere in the text of App.R. 3. Nor does it appear in the text of App.R. 4, 5, or 26. And the appellate rules and staff notes that contain the phrase do not use it in a way that supports the definition of the phrase upon which the decisions in <em>Price </em>and its progeny turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">{\u00b6 17} The phrase \u201cdirect appeal\u201d appears in the staff note to the 1994 amendment to App.R. 5(A). The amendment deleted a requirement that a motion for a delayed appeal demonstrate a probability that the alleged errors occurred. The rule\u2019s drafters noted that the \u201c[d]enial of leave to file a delayed appeal for failure to demonstrate the probability of error usually [led] to subsequent litigation of the issue by direct appeals to the Ohio and United States Supreme Courts, petitions to vacate sentence under R.C. 2953.21 et seq., and appeals thereon, and/or federal habeas corpus petitions and appeals.\u201d The drafters eliminated the probability-of-error requirement \u201cprimarily]\u201d to promote \u201cjudicial economy,\u201d because \u201c[r]eview of the merits by the courts of appeals upon the <em>initial direct (albeit delayed) appeal </em>would thus avoid the presentation of the probability of error issue to as many as nine subsequent tribunals.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">{\u00b6 18} The phrase also appears in the text of and the staff note to App.R. 6. The rule provides the procedure when a common pleas court in reviewing a postconviction petition and an appellate court in a \u201cdirect appeal\u201d \u201care exercising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>[the] concurrent jurisdiction [established by the 1995 amendment of R.C. 2953.21] to review a judgment of conviction.\u201d The staff note to the rule\u2019s 1997 amendment states that the rule\u2019s express purpose is to facilitate the \u201c[o]rderly exercise\u201d of the \u201cconcurrent jurisdiction\u201d and to coordinate \u201cappellate review in the direct appeal and appellate review of the post-conviction ruling * * * to preserve efficient use of judicial resources.\u201d Thus, the phrase \u201cdirect appeal\u201d is used in App.R. 6 to distinguish a direct challenge to a conviction from a collateral challenge to a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">2. R.C. 2953.21 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">{\u00b6 19} We do not find, as the courts in <em>Price </em>and its progeny have found, that the postconviction statutes are ambiguous and thus in need of interpretation. R.C. 2953.21(A)(2) plainly affords a petitioner who has taken a direct appeal from his judgment of conviction 180 days from the filing of the trial transcript in his direct appeal and affords a petitioner who has taken no direct appeal from his judgment of conviction 180 days from the expiration of the time for filing his direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">{\u00b6 20} The statutes do not define the phrase \u201cdirect appeal of the judgment of conviction.\u201d But neither do they expressly apply only to App.R. 4 appeals of right or expressly exclude from their operation App.R. 5(A) delayed appeals or App.R. 26(B) reopened appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">{\u00b6 21} Under the Ohio Rules of Appellate Procedure, an appellant may, by means of an appeal by right, a delayed appeal, or a reopened appeal, bring before an intermediate appellate court a direct, as opposed to a collateral, challenge to his judgment of conviction. Thus, the postconviction statutes, by their terms, plainly afford a postconviction petitioner who has timely filed an appeal by right, who has been granted a delayed appeal, or whose appeal has been reopened, 180 days from the date on which the trial transcript is filed in his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">3. Legislative Purpose</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">{\u00b6 22} Despite the plain language of the postconviction statutes, the courts in <em>Price, Bird, </em>and <em>Godfrey </em>constructed an ambiguity based upon R.C. 2953.21(A)(2)\u2019s \u201cobvious\u201d legislative purpose to place time limits on postconviction actions. Then, applying the statutory presumptions that the General Assembly had intended by the amendment that the entire statute be effective and that the result be just and reasonable,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the courts interpreted the phrase \u201cdirect appeal\u201d to mean an appeal by right, and not a delayed or reopened appeal. Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>interpretation of the phrase by employing the statutory presumptions leads us to a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">{\u00b6 23} As we have noted, the Ohio Rules of Appellate Procedure use the phrase \u201cdirect appeal\u201d to distinguish between the review conducted in an appeal taken directly from a judgment of conviction and the collateral review of a conviction conducted pursuant to R.C. 2953.21 et seq. The postconviction statutes afford relief from a judgment of conviction based upon constitutional error that is not manifested by the record in, and that thus could not have been raised in, a direct appeal.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The statutes provide \u201cthe exclusive remedy by which a person may bring a collateral challenge to the validity of a conviction or sentence in a criminal case.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> They permit a common pleas court to exercise jurisdiction over a postconviction petition concurrent with an appellate court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over a pending \u201cdirect appeal,\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and in furtherance of that jurisdiction, they tie the time for filing the postconviction petition to the filing of the transcript in the direct appeal. Accordingly, a postconviction proceeding may fairly be viewed as the exclusive complement to a direct appeal, permitting a collateral challenge to a judgment of conviction that proceeds contemporaneously with the direct appeal, but that, unlike the direct appeal, depends for its resolution upon matters outside the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">{\u00b6 24} The General Assembly enacted the postconviction statutes in 1965 with the purpose to substitute for habeas corpus proceedings \u201ca new procedure\u201d to make available \u201cthe best method of protecting constitutional rights of individuals and, at the same time, provid[e] a more orderly method of hearing such matters.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Until their amendment in 1995, the statutes permitted a petitioner to file a petition \u201cat any time\u201d after his conviction.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">{\u00b6 25} The General Assembly\u2019s apparent purpose in limiting the time for filing a postconviction petition was to put a stop to serial collateral attacks upon the judgment of conviction well after the direct-appeal process had been completed. But we will not read the time limitations imposed by the 1995 amendment to defeat the overarching purpose of the postconviction statutes: to provide one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>convicted of a criminal offense with the means to challenge his conviction with matters outside the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">{\u00b6 26} If, in enacting R.C. 2953.21(A)(2), the General Assembly\u2019s sole concern was, as the courts in <em>Price and its </em>progeny would have it, restricting the time within which a postconviction claim may be brought, the legislature could simply have fixed the entry of the judgment of conviction as the event triggering the 180 days. It did not. By instead setting as the triggering event the filing of the transcript \u201cin the direct appeal of the judgment of conviction,\u201d the legislature effectively acknowledged that the trial record plays as critical a role in preparing a postconviction petition as it does in prosecuting a direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">{\u00b6 27} The courts in <em>Price </em>and its progeny argue that a definition of the phrase \u201cdirect appeal\u201d that includes a delayed or reopened appeal would frustrate the General Assembly\u2019s purpose in amending the postconviction statutes because it would effectively allow an unlimited amount of time to file a postconviction petition. This argument overstates the case. The postconviction statutes themselves limit the time within which a postconviction petition may be filed. The length of the delay in seeking leave to appeal is a factor in a common pleas court\u2019s exercise of its discretion to grant a delayed appeal. And a court may grant an application to reopen an appeal, whether timely filed or late for good cause, only if the applicant demonstrates \u201ca \u2018genuine issue\u2019 as to whether he has a \u2018colorable claim\u2019 of ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">{\u00b6 28} The court in <em>Godfrey </em>asserted that allowing a postconviction petition to be filed within 180 days of the filing of the transcript in a reopened appeal would effectively permit the filing of two petitions: one within 180 days of the filing of the transcript in the \u201cdirect appeal\u201d and a second within 180 days of the filing of the transcript in the reopened appeal. But the doctrine of res judicata precludes a posteonviction petitioner from presenting in a subsequent petition matters that were determined or could fairly have been determined in an earlier postconviction petition or in the direct appeal.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">{\u00b6 29} The court in <em>Price </em>insisted that permitting a postconviction petition to be filed within 180 days of the filing of the transcript in a delayed appeal would reward \u201ca defendant who had neglected to file a direct appeal\u201d by affording him more time than that afforded \u201ca defendant who had timely prosecuted his direct appeal.\u201d But the court\u2019s statement mistakenly presumes negligence or calculation on the part of a defendant seeking a delayed appeal. Just as the postconvic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>tion statutes contemplate circumstances that excuse a delay in filing a postconviction petition,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the Ohio Rules of Appellate Procedure, by permitting a delayed appeal by leave of court and by permitting an appeal to be reopened, contemplate that circumstances beyond a criminal defendant\u2019s control might arise to impair his ability to exercise his right to appeal his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">{\u00b6 30} Fuller\u2019s case is illustrative. Fuller had effectively lost his right to directly challenge his conviction before this court, not because of a lack of diligence on his part, but because he had been denied his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel on appeal. As a further consequence, he did not have the benefit of the trial transcript to aid him in preparing a postconviction petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">{\u00b6 31} By interpreting the phrase \u201cdirect appeal\u201d as used in R.C. 2953.21 et seq. to encompass appeals reopened under App.R. 26(B), we accord the phrase a meaning consistent with its use in the appellate rules. By reading the postconviction statutes to permit a postconviction petitioner to file his petition within 180 days from the filing of the transcript in his reopened appeal, we advance the overarching legislative purpose of the postconviction statutes to provide a criminal defendant with the means to mount a challenge to a judgment of conviction based on matters outside the trial record. And in doing so, we do no violence to R.C. 2953.21(A)(2)\u2019s legislative purpose to place time limits on postconviction proceedings. We, therefore, hold that the common pleas court erred in declining to entertain Fuller\u2019s petition on the ground that it was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">II. The Court of Appeals Has No Jurisdiction to Entertain This Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">{\u00b6 32} When a common pleas court denies a postconviction petition that satisfies the time strictures of R.C. 2953.21 or the jurisdictional requirements of R.C. 2953.23, the court must make and file findings of fact and conclusions of law.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> An entry denying a postconviction petition that does not contain findings of fact and conclusions of law, and that does not otherwise apprise the petitioner of the basis for dismissal and permit meaningful appellate review, \u201cis incomplete and it thus does not commence the running of the time period for filing an appeal therefrom.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>{\u00b6 33} The entry denying Fuller\u2019s postconviction petition stated only that the court \u201c[had] no jurisdiction to entertain the petition as [Fuller had] failed to meet the conditions set forth in R.C. 2953.23(A) * * *.\u201d Thus, the court did not make findings of fact and conclusions of law or otherwise meaningfully apprise Fuller or this court of a basis for denying the petition. Therefore, the entry is not a final, appealable order.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">III. The Second Assignment of Error Is Moot</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">{\u00b6 34} Our disposition of his first assignment of error renders moot Fuller\u2019s contention in his second assignment of error that the common pleas court erred in \u201crul[ing] on\u201d the state\u2019s untimely memorandum in opposition to his postconviction petition. Accordingly, we do not reach the merits of that challenge. See App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">IV. We Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">{\u00b6 35} We therefore conclude that the common pleas court had jurisdiction to entertain Fuller\u2019s postconviction petition. But in the absence of findings of fact and conclusions of law, the judgment from which Fuller appeals is not a final, appealable order. Thus, we are without jurisdiction to review the court\u2019s disposition of the petition. Accordingly, we dismiss Fuller\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b309-10\">Sundermann, P.J., Hendon and Winkler, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b309-11\">Ralph Winkler, J., retired, of the First District Court of Appeals, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b300-12\">.
