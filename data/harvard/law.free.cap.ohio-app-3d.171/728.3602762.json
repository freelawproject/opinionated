Steve and Celeste Holder were married on July 25, 1997, and they were divorced on January 21, 2003. The parties have one daughter, Michelle, born April 6, 1998, and they entered into a shared-parenting plan upon their divorce. Conflict soon arose between the parties due to their different religions. Celeste joined the United Pentecostal Church in 2000, and Steve is Roman Catholic. Michelle was baptized in the Catholic Church while her parents were still married. Celeste\u2019s church has several lifestyle restrictions that affect Michelle. On September 3, 2004, Steve filed a motion for sole custody. On September 22, 2004, Celeste filed a motion for sole custody, and, in the alternative, asked that the court award shared parenting to the parties pursuant to her newly proposed shared-parenting plan. On October 15, 2004, Steve filed a reply to Celeste\u2019s proposed shared-parenting plan, arguing against its adoption. A hearing was held on the matter on August 23 and 30, 2005. On May 23, 2006, the magistrate issued a decision and permanent order, granting sole custody to Steve, overruling Celeste\u2019s motion for sole custody, and also overruling her motion to modify the shared-parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>{\u00b6 2} The magistrate noted that the parties\u2019 \u201cconflict stemming from their differing beliefs and values is having a very negative [e]ffect on Michelle. * * * Some examples of defendant\u2019s religious practices which have a direct effect on Michelle include: defendant\u2019s insistence that Michelle can only swim if she wears a dress and there are no boys in the water. Michelle cannot wear pants or shorts. Michelle can only wear dresses that are below the knees and cover three-quarters of her arms. The defendant does not believe females should cut their hair, wear make-up, jewelry or nail polish. The defendant will not allow Michelle to watch television. Defendant does not support or approve of Michelle participating in sports or dance. Michelle attends St. Charles Catholic School where she wears a uniform. According to the defendant, this uniform does not conform to her religion\u2019s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cThe defendant is rigid and uncompromising in her religious beliefs. She wants Michelle to adhere only to the defendant\u2019s religious doctrine. Defendant also stated that she will not sacrifice her religious convictions to appease the court or the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">{\u00b6 4} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe plaintiff believes that the defendant loves Michelle and that defendant and Michelle are bonded. Plaintiff does not believe, however, that the defendant is a good mother to Michelle, because defendant puts her religious needs ahead of the child\u2019s needs. * * * According to the plaintiff, Michelle is well adjusted for the most part and is doing well in school where she is socially accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cPlaintiff has taken Michelle to Dr. Tyrone Payne for counseling to assist Michelle in adjusting to the differences in her parents\u2019 households. Dr. Payne described Michelle as having a pretty good self-concept, but Michelle has expressed guilt and anxiety as well as fear. * * * It is Dr. Payne\u2019s belief that the cause of Michelle\u2019s anxiety and conflict is the child\u2019s knowledge of the differences in her parents\u2019 homes. Michelle is especially aware of what she cannot do in the defendant\u2019s home. Because of the conflict between the homes, Michelle sometimes feels she cannot tell the truth or she will lie by omission. Dr. Payne expressed concern over the fact that Michelle feels a lot of guilt and anxiety. He stated that it is especially bad for a child to feel such guilt and anxiety. When a child is older that child may become rebellious and angry. The anger will be focused on the parent she perceives as trying to stop her activities but will also spill over on the other parent. Michelle\u2019s anxiety has not eased since Dr. Payne first saw her in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>{\u00b6 8} \u201cIf the conflict continues, Dr. Payne recommends that Michelle adopt only one religion and attend only similar churches. It is his belief that one parent needs to be quiet about their religion and let the child practice just the one religious choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cDr. Phyllis Kuehnl-Walters was appointed by this court to conduct a psychological evaluation for purposes of making recommendations as to custody in this matter. Dr. Kuehnl-Walters recommended that the plaintiff-father be designated the sole custodian of Michelle with the defendant-mother being granted liberal parenting time. * * * According to the psychologist, in her professional opinion, the two conflicting faiths have fostered fear, deceitfulness, guilt and confusion for Michelle. She, therefore, recommended that Michelle not attend religious services with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cDr. Kuehnl-Walters was concerned that although Michelle is bonded to both parents, she is \u2018tormented\u2019 by keeping secrets on both sides. According to the psychologist, the child is too young to deal with this form of conflict. Michelle told Dr. Kuehnl-Walters that she fears that if she does the things permitted by the plaintiff-father, such as wearing jeans or playing sports, then she is going to go to Hell according to the defendant-mother\u2019s standards. In her deposition, Dr. Kuehnl-Walters stated that in 30 years she had never experienced a parent who was so rigidly willing to adhere to her church\u2019s principles, that she would be willing to sacrifice her own child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">{\u00b6 12} The magistrate determined that \u201cthe only practical way to reduce the conflict in this case is to choose a sole custodian for Michelle. In choosing a sole custodian, this magistrate must choose the parent who will provide for Michelle\u2019s best interests and has the ability to separate the child\u2019s needs from their own. The evidence presented, including Dr. Kuehnl-Walter\u2019s evaluation, shows that the defendant is unable to separate her own needs from those of Michelle\u2019s. Therefore, based on the evidence presented, including the psychological evaluation, the witnesses\u2019 demeanors and credibility, as well as the statutory and case law,\u201d the magistrate determined that Steve should have sole custody of Michelle. The trial court granted Celeste the court\u2019s standard order of parenting time, changing her midweek visitation from Wednesday to Tuesday and scheduling her alternating weekend time from noon on Saturday until 7:00 p.m. on Sunday. The magistrate ordered Celeste to \u201cprovide for transportation to take Michelle to any activities which occur during her parenting time unless she has made arrangements with the plaintiff otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">{\u00b6 13} On June 6, 2006, Steve filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. Steve argued that the trial court should \u201cadopt the Plaintiffs standard of living for the child as to eliminate the double standard of living she is currently dealing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>with as to cause no further anxiety or confusion.\u201d Steve also argued that \u201cthe court should rule that the child is not permitted to attend any church services or activities with Defendant.\u201d Finally, Steve argued that \u201cthe court should rule that Defendant must allow and provide transportation for the child to her school and extracurricular activities. If Defendant is unable or unwilling to provide such transportation then parenting time should be modified as to allow the child to participate in her activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">{\u00b6 14} On October 5, 2006, Steve filed supplemental objections, again asking the court to order \u201c1) that the minor child continues following the standard of living and religion of Plaintiff, who is her residential parent, 2) that Defendant be prohibited from taking the minor child to any church related or religious activities, and 3) the Defendant be ordered to take the minor child to all of her activities or make arrangements for her attend these activities or forfeit those time with the minor child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">{\u00b6 15} On November 3, 2006, the trial court issued a decision and judgment, finding that Steve\u2019s objections were not well taken. The trial court determined that the magistrate \u201cspecifically addressed the issue of defendant arranging transportation of Michelle to her activities.\u201d The court also determined that it \u201cwill not prohibit either party from having their child accompany them to religious services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">{\u00b6 16} Steve asserts two assignments of error. His first assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-8\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cThe court erred in not ordering appellee to refrain from taking the daughter to religious activities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">{\u00b6 18} While this appeal involves Celeste\u2019s visitation rights and not custody, our analysis begins with the child-custody statute, R.C. 3109.04(F), which provides that the best interests of the child must be determined after a consideration of all relevant factors, including \u201c(c) [t]he child\u2019s interaction and interrelationship with the child\u2019s parents, siblings, and any other person who may significantly affect the child\u2019s best interest; (d) [t]he child\u2019s adjustment to the child\u2019s home, school, and community; [and] (e) [t]he mental and physical health of all persons involved in the situation.\u201d Clearly, identical logic applies to any allocation of parental rights and responsibilities in terms of visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\"> {\u00b6 19} \u201c \u2018The discretion which a trial court enjoys in custody matters should be accorded the utmost respect, given the nature of the proceeding and the impact the court\u2019s determination will have on the lives of the parties concerned. The knowledge a trial court gains through observing the witnesses and the parties in a custody proceeding cannot be conveyed to a reviewing court by a printed record.\u2019 A reviewing court will not overturn a custody determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>tion unless the trial court has acted in a manner that is arbitrary, unreasonable, or capricious.\u201d <em>Haynes v. Haynes </em>(Nov. 13, 1998), Montgomery App. No. 16992, 1998 WL 865040, *2, quoting <em>Miller v. Miller, 37 </em>Ohio St.3d 71, 74, 523 N.E.2d 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">{\u00b6 20} Steve relies on <em>Pater v. Pater, </em>63 Ohio St.3d 393, 395, 588 N.E.2d 794, which held that \u201ca domestic relations court may consider the religious practices of the parents in order to protect the best interests of a child\u201d (citing <em>Birch v. Birch </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 85, 11 OBR 327, 463 N.E.2d 1254). \u201c[A] parent\u2019s actions are not insulated from the domestic relations court\u2019s inquiry just because they are based on religious beliefs, especially actions that will harm the child\u2019s mental or physical health.\u201d Id. at 399, 588 N.E.2d 794. In <em>Pater, </em>at issue was the effect that the religious practices of the mother, a Jehovah\u2019s Witness, would have on the child if the court granted custody to the mother instead of the father, a Roman Catholic. In reversing the award of custody to the father, the court determined that \u201ccustody may not be denied to a parent solely because she will not encourage her child to salute the flag, celebrate holidays, or participate in extracurricular activities,\u201d and the court also determined that the trial court\u2019s orders were improperly based on the mother\u2019s religious beliefs. Id. at 395-396, 588 N.E.2d 794. The court noted that \u201cparents have a fundamental right to educate their children, including the right to communicate their moral and religious values.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">{\u00b6 21} Celeste relies on <em>Davidovics v. Shore </em>(1999), 135 Ohio App.3d 374, 734 N.E.2d 395, which held that a modification to the parties\u2019 shared-parenting plan allowing the mother to choose a religious school outside the father\u2019s religious tradition was not an abuse of discretion. There was nothing in the record to indicate that the child\u2019s \u201cattending an Orthodox or conservative Jewish school would be against [the child\u2019s] best interests.\u201d It was significant to the court that since the child resided with his father, his attendance at the religious school ensured the child\u2019s exposure to <em>both </em>of his parents\u2019 religious practices on a daily basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">{\u00b6 22} Our review of the matter herein makes clear that the trial court correctly refused to prohibit Celeste from taking Michelle to her church\u2019s religious activities. Steve testified that Celeste and Michelle are bonded and that Michelle is well adjusted for the most part and doing well in school. Further, the magistrate determined, after an in camera interview with Michelle, that she \u201cis a charming intelligent, outgoing little girl who expressed love for both of her parents.\u201d That Michelle experiences ongoing conflict between the two households does not affect Michelle\u2019s general welfare to the extent that Celeste\u2019s fundamental right to communicate her religious convictions to Michelle should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>curtailed. <em>Pater, </em>68 Ohio St.3d 393, 588 N.E.2d 794. There being no abuse of discretion, Steve\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">{\u00b6 23} As mentioned above, custody is not the issue in this appeal, but we note that Celeste\u2019s unrelenting refusal to place Michelle\u2019s needs above her own religious convictions clearly justified the trial court\u2019s grant of sole custody of Michelle to Steve. See, e.g., <em>Birch, </em>11 Ohio St.3d 85, 11 OBR 327, 463 N.E.2d 1254 (in denying mother custody of her children, consideration of her religious practices, which included requiring her children to dress so that little of their bodies showed, even in the hottest days of summer and also required suffering and constant prayer to the Virgin Mary in order to be saved, did not violate mother\u2019s right to the free exercise of religion, because, \u201c[i]n recognition of society\u2019s legitimate interest in the welfare of its minor children, the law does not require that a child be actually harmed or that a parent\u2019s unsuitability to have custody of her children be disregarded because the parent claims that the bases of her unsuitability are religious practices\u201d). Id. at 87, 11 OBR 327, 463 N.E.2d 1254.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">{\u00b6 24} While Celeste has the right to have Michelle participate in any religious experience she finds appropriate, it is our expectation that she will not continue to foster conflict and to attack Steve\u2019s religious orientation by means of Michelle. Celeste\u2019s intolerance is \u201ca classic example of [a parent] using religion in all the wrong ways with [her child].\u201d <em>Reier v. Reier </em>(June 21, 1996), Darke App. No. 1372, 1996 WL 339943, *2.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">{\u00b6 25} Celeste\u2019s proposed shared-parenting plan contained the following language: \u201cNeither of the parents shall put any obstacle in the way of the maintenance of love and affection between the child and the other parent, nor shall either parent do anything to estrange the child from the other parent.\u201d It is our expectation that Celeste will accept that it is in Michelle\u2019s best interest that the religious values of both her parents be supported in a reciprocal atmosphere of respect. <em>Davidovics, </em>135 Ohio App.3d 374, 734 N.E.2d 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">{\u00b6 26} Steve\u2019s second assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-9\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cThe trial court erred in awarding visitation to the appellee during times in which she may take the child to religious activities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">{\u00b6 28} According to Steve, \u201cIn the totality of the circumstances, the court was unreasonable to assume that the mother would refrain from taking the child to religious activities if the child was in her custody on days that the mother herself would normally take part in religious activities.\u201d As indicated above, Celeste has a fundamental right to share her religion with Michelle, and the trial court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>not abuse its discretion in its award of visitation to Celeste. Steve\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b773-5\">Fain, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b773-6\">Walters, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b773-7\">Walters, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Axs\">concurring separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">{\u00b6 29} Based upon the record before us, I cannot conclude, as did the majority, that the trial court correctly refused to prohibit Celeste from taking Michelle to her church\u2019s religious activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">{\u00b6 30} I believe that the evidence is replete with uncontroverted indications that Celeste is unreasonably rigid and uncompromising in her religious beliefs, that she consistently places what she determines her religious obligations to be over the best interests of Michelle, that Michelle is \u201ctormented\u201d and suffers \u201cguilt, anxiety and fear,\u201d and that Michelle may suffer from long-term problems. All of this is solely because of Celeste\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">{\u00b6 31} Likewise, based upon the evidence before us that Celeste regards her religious experiences to be more important than her daughter\u2019s well-being and because she has expressed to the court that she will not modify them for the benefit of the child or to appease the court, I am not as convinced as the majority seems to be that Celeste will modify her behavior in order to reduce the conflict for Michelle. And, I would suggest that if she does not, then it might constitute an abuse of discretion for the trial court to refuse to limit Michelle\u2019s participation in Celeste\u2019s religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-11\">{\u00b6 32} While every parent has a fundamental right to share his or her religion with a minor child, that right cannot transcend the fundamental obligation that a parent has to not cause harm to the child. And, when the \u201csharing\u201d of a religion presently causes harm to the child, as both psychologists testified, then the court has the obligation to step in on the child\u2019s behalf and impose restrictions upon an offending parent. The trial court took a big step in that direction herein by awarding sole custody to Steve. If there is a next time, more drastic action may need to be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-12\">{\u00b6 33} However, an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d requires us to find that the trial court\u2019s result is so palpably and grossly violative of fact or logic that it evidences not the exercise of will but the perversity of will, not the exercise of judgment but the defiance of judgment, not the exercise of reason but instead passion or bias. <em>Nakoff v. Fairview Gen. Hosp. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 254, 256-257, 662 N.E.2d 1. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>For that reason, I am required to concur with the majority that the trial court\u2019s decision does not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b774-5\">Sumner E.
