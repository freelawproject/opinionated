For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">{\u00b6 2} The facts of this case are largely undisputed. Heartland is an Ohio banking corporation. National City is a national banking association with its principal place of business in Ohio. Hook &amp; Motter, Inc., d.b.a. Dublin Auto Sales (\u201cDublin Auto\u201d) was an automobile dealership that sold and leased automobiles to the general public. On or about November 29, 2000, Heartland entered an open-end-credit arrangement with Dublin Auto that was evidenced by a universal promissory note (\u201cthe note\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the note, Dublin Auto was able to borrow up to $300,000 from Heartland. In consideration for the open-end credit and to secure the note, Dublin Auto granted Heartland a security interest in all of Dublin Auto\u2019s inventory, including automobiles held by Dublin Auto for sale or lease. Heartland\u2019s security interest in the inventory of Dublin Auto was perfected by the filing of financing statements with the Ohio Secretary of State and the Franklin County Recorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">{\u00b6 3} On December 11, 2001, and pursuant to the arrangement between Heartland and Dublin Auto, Heartland advanced $9,000 to Dublin Auto for the purpose of enabling Dublin Auto to acquire a 1997 Ford F-150 (\u201cF-150\u201d). In view of the $9,000 advance, the certificate of title to the F-150 was physically delivered to Heartland. Heartland has maintained physical possession of the certificate of title since December 11, 2001. The certificate of title designated Dublin Auto as the owner of the motor vehicle. A notation was made on the certificate of title indicating that Heartland was the first lienholder on the motor vehicle. On March 12, 2002, Joe E. Murphy and Michael J. Murphy entered into an agreement with Dublin Auto to purchase the F-150 for a total price of $15,386.63. National City financed the Murphys\u2019 purchase of the F-150. Heartland did not receive any funds relating to that sale. On June 12, 2002, a certificate of title was issued designating \u201cMichael J. Murphey\u201d [sic] as the owner of the vehicle, Heartland as the previous owner, Heartland as the first lienholder, and National City as the second lienholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>{\u00b6 4} On February 28, 2002, and pursuant to the arrangement between Heartland and Dublin Auto, Heartland advanced $13,000 to Dublin Auto for the purpose of enabling Dublin Auto to acquire a 1999 Jeep Cherokee (\u201cJeep\u201d). In view of the $13,000 advance, the certificate of title to the Jeep was physically delivered to Heartland. Heartland has maintained physical possession of the certificate of title since February 28, 2002. That certificate of title designated Dublin Auto as the owner of the Jeep, with Heartland as the lienholder. On March 7, 2002, Michael E. Laxton entered into an agreement with Dublin Auto to purchase the Jeep for a total price of $14,045. National City financed Mr. Laxton\u2019s purchase of the Jeep. Heartland did not receive any funds relating to that sale. On June 26, 2002, a certificate of title was issued designating Michael E. Laxton as the owner of the Jeep, Heartland as the previous owner, and Heartland as the first lienholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">{\u00b6 5} On July 14, 2003, Heartland filed a declaratory-judgment action in the trial court naming National City, Mr. Laxton, and the Murphys as defendants and seeking a declaration that it is the first lienholder on the two motor vehicles at issue in this case. On September 25, 2003, National City filed its answer to Heartland\u2019s complaint, as well as a counterclaim against Heartland. National City\u2019s counterclaim alleged that Heartland interfered with its contract rights to collect loan payments from its borrowers in connection with the motor vehicles at issue and sought a declaration that the motor vehicles at issue are not subject to any lien asserted by Heartland. On October 15, 2003, National City filed a cross-claim against Joe E. Murphy.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">{\u00b6 6} On March 18, 2004, National City filed a motion for summary judgment as to the declaratory-judgment causes of action in Heartland\u2019s complaint and National City\u2019s counterclaim. On April 9, 2004, Heartland filed its motion for summary judgment as to the declaratory-judgment causes of action in Heartland\u2019s complaint and National City\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">{\u00b6 7} On July 15, 2004, the trial court denied the summary-judgment motions of Heartland and National City. The trial court denied the motions on the basis that neither party had briefed the issue, which, in the trial court\u2019s view, was central to the case: whether Heartland had any right to retain possession of the certificates of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">{\u00b6 8} The final pretrial conference was held on September 2, 2004, and the parties agreed to attempt to resolve the matter by means of supplemental motions for summary judgment. Accordingly, on September 20, 2004, both Heartland and National City filed supplemental motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">{\u00b6 9} On October 20, 2004, Heartland and National City filed a stipulation of dismissal as to National City\u2019s counterclaim against Heartland for tortious interference with contract rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>{\u00b6 10} On August 5, 2005, the trial court issued a decision finding that Heartland\u2019s security interest in the two motor vehicles at issue was terminated upon the sale of the vehicles, based on its application of R.C. 1309.320 and 4505.13(B) to the facts of this case. Accordingly, the trial court denied Heartland\u2019s supplemental motion for summary judgment and granted National City\u2019s supplemental motion for summary judgment. Finding no just reason for delay, the trial court entered judgment on January 4, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">{\u00b6 11} Plaintiff timely appeals and sets forth the following four assignments of error for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">Assignment of Error Number One</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">The trial court erred by rendering summary judgment in favor of defendantappellee National City Bank and against plaintiff-appellant Heartland Bank because there were no genuine issues of material fact and the evidence was of such a nature that reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion and that conclusion favored plaintiff-appellant Heartland Bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">Assignment of Error Number Two</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-9\">The trial court erred by holding that Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 1309.320 rather than Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 4505.04 controlled the disputes relating to the motor vehicles at issue in this action because the disputes among the plaintiff-appellant Heartland Bank, defendant-appellee National City Bank, and the purchasers involved competing interests in the motor vehicles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-10\">Assignment of Error Number Three</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-11\">The trial court erred by holding that Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 4505.13(b) mandated that plaintiff-appellant Heartland Bank\u2019s liens on the motor vehicles at issue were terminated upon the attempted sale of those motor vehicles by its owner because plaintiff-appellant Heartland Bank\u2019s liens were properly notated on the certificates of title for the motor vehicles and plaintiff-appellant Heartland Bank maintained physical possession of the certificates of title at all times after its liens were notated thereon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-12\">Assignment of Error Number Four</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-13\">The trial court erred by holding that plaintiff-appellant Heartland Bank was not entitled to payments on account of its liens on the motor vehicles at issue because plaintiff-appellant Heartland Bank\u2019s liens survived any attempted transfer of the motor vehicles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-14\">{\u00b6 12} For ease of analysis, we will address Heartland\u2019s first and second assignments of error together. In its first assignment of error, Heartland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>generally argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of National City because there were no genuine issues of material fact and the evidence was of such a nature that reasonable minds could only reach a conclusion in favor of Heartland. Heartland argues in its second assignment of error that the trial court erred in holding that R.C. 1309.320, rather than R.C. 4505.04, controlled the disputes relating to the motor vehicles at issue in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">(\u00b6 13} Appellate review of a trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment is de novo. <em>Mitnaul v. Fairmount Presbyterian Church, </em>149 Ohio App.3d 769, 2002-Ohio-5833, 778 N.E.2d 1093, at \u00b6 27. Summary judgment is proper when a movant for summary judgment demonstrates that (1) no genuine issue of material fact exists, (2) the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, that party being entitled to have the evidence most strongly construed in its favor. Civ.R. 56; <em>State ex rel. Grady v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 181, 183, 677 N.E.2d 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">{\u00b6 14} This case involves the interplay between Ohio\u2019s version of revised Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (\u201cUCC\u201d), which is codified at R.C. Chapter 1309, and Ohio\u2019s Certificate of Motor Vehicle Title Law (\u201cCertificate-of-Title Law\u201d), which is embodied in R.C. Chapter 4505. We begin our analysis of Heartland\u2019s first and second assignments of error by setting forth the key statutory provisions in those chapters of the Ohio Revised Code that are the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">{\u00b6 15} R.C. 1309.320(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">[A] buyer in the ordinary course of business * * * takes free of a security interest created by the buyer\u2019s seller even if the security interest is perfected and the buyer knows of its existence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">(\u00b6 16} R.C. 4505.04(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-10\">No person acquiring a motor vehicle from its owner, whether the owner is a * * * dealer * * *, shall acquire any right, title, claim, or interest in or to the motor vehicle until there is issued to the person a certificate of title to the motor vehicle * * * and no waiver or estoppel operates in favor of such person against a person having possession of the certif\u00edcate of title to * * * the motor vehicle, for a valuable consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">{\u00b6 17} R.C. 4505.13(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-12\">(1) Chapter 1309. and section 1701.66 of the Revised Code do not permit or require the deposit, filing, or other record of a security interest covering a motor vehicle, except as provided in division (A)(2) of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>(2) Chapter 1309. of the Revised Code applies to a security interest in a motor vehicle held as inventory for sale by a dealer. The security interest has priority over creditors of the dealer as provided in Chapter 1309. of the Revised Code without notation of the security interest on a certificate of title, without entry of a notation of the security interest into the automated title processing system if a physical certificate of title for the motor vehicle has not been issued, or without the retention of a manufacturer\u2019s or importer\u2019s certificate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">{\u00b6 18} Additionally, R.C. 4505.13(B) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">Subject to division (A) of this section, any security agreement covering a security interest in a motor vehicle, if a notation of the agreement has been made by a clerk of a court of common pleas on the face of the certificate of title or the clerk has entered a notation of the agreement into the automated title processing system and a physical certificate of title for the motor vehicle has not been issued, is valid as against the creditors of the debtor, whether armed with process or not, and against subsequent purchasers, secured parties, and other lienholders or claimants. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">{\u00b6 19} Heartland contends that the trial court erroneously permitted R.C. Chapter 1309 to usurp the Certificate-of-Title Law. Specifically, Heartland argues that the trial court erred in finding that R.C. 1309.320(A) was made applicable to this action by means of R.C. 4505.13(A)(2). According to Heartland, R.C. 4505.04(A), and not the provisions of R.C. Chapter 1309, controls in this case, and pursuant to R.C. 4505.04(A), its security interests remained protected because the certificates of title remained in its possession. Heartland also argues under its first and second assignments of error that pursuant to R.C. 4505.13(B) its security interests remained protected because they were notated on the certificates of title for the motor vehicles at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">{\u00b6 20} In support of its arguments, Heartland relies upon the Supreme Court of Ohio decision in <em>Saturn of Kings Automall, Inc. v. Mike Albert Leasing, Inc. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 513, 518, 751 N.E.2d 1019 <em>(\u201cSaturn of Kings </em>\u201d). <em>Saturn of Kings </em>required the Supreme Court to \u201cconsider the interplay between Ohio\u2019s adoption of Article 2 of the UCC, codified at R.C. Chapter 1302, and Ohio\u2019s Certificate of Motor Vehicle Title Law as embodied in R.C. Chapter 4505.\u201d Id. The \u201cprimary issue\u201d before the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>Saturn of Kings </em>was \u201cwhether a person may acquire legal ownership of a motor vehicle without transfer to that person of the vehicle\u2019s certificate of title.\u201d Id. at 515, 751 N.E.2d 1019.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">{\u00b6 21} In <em>Saturn of Kings, </em>Gallatin Auto Sales (\u201cGallatin\u201d) contracted with Saturn of Kings Automall, Inc. (\u201cSaturn\u201d) and Cronin Motor Company (\u201cCronin\u201d) for the purchase of motor vehicles from those two dealers. Saturn and Cronin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>allowed Gallatin to take physical possession of the vehicles before payment was tendered, and both retained possession of the certificates of titles for those vehicles. Gallatin sold three of those motor vehicles to Mike Albert Leasing, Inc. (\u201cAlbert Leasing\u201d), who paid Gallatin in full. However, Gallatin failed to remit payment to Saturn and Cronin. Saturn and Cronin sued Albert Leasing and Gallatin, seeking replevin and money damages. See id. at 513-514, 751 N.E.2d 1019.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">{\u00b6 22} In its analysis, the <em>Saturn of Kings </em>court cited language from earlier Ohio Supreme Court cases, namely <em>Hughes v. Al Green, Inc. </em>(1981), 65 Ohio St.2d 110, 19 O.O.3d 307, 418 N.E.2d 1355, and <em>Smith v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 150, 524 N.E.2d 507. Specifically, the court quoted the following statement in <em>Hughes:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">\u201cR.C. 4505.04 was intended to apply to litigation where the parties were rival claimants to title, <em>i.e., </em>ownership of the automobile; to contests between the alleged owner and lien claimants; to litigation between the owner holding the valid certificate of title and one holding a stolen, forged or otherwise invalidly issued certificate of title; and to similar situations. <em>Kelley Kar Co. v. Finkler </em>(1951), 155 Ohio St. 541 [44 O.O. 494, 99 N.E.2d 665]; 5 W. Reserve L.Rev. 403, 404 (1954).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-6\"><em>Hughes </em>at 115-116, 19 O.O.3d 307, 418 N.E.2d 1355, quoting <em>Grogan </em>Chrysler-<em>Plymouth, Inc. v. Gottfried </em>(1978), 59 Ohio App.2d 91, 94-95, 13 O.O.3d 154, 392 N. E.2d 1283. In addition, the <em>Saturn of Kings </em>court quoted the following language in <em>Smith:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">\u201cThe purpose of the Certificate of Title Act is to prevent the importation of stolen motor vehicles, to protect Ohio bona-fide purchasers against thieves and wrongdoers, and to create an instrument evidencing title to, and ownership of, motor vehicles.\u201d * * * [I]t is apparent that R.C. 4505.04 is irrelevant to all issues of ownership except those regarding the importation of vehicles, rights as between lienholders, rights of bona-fide purchasers, and instruments evidencing title and ownership.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-9\"><em>Smith, </em>37 Ohio St.3d at 152-153, 524 N.E.2d 507, quoting <em>Hughes </em>at 115, 19 O.O.3d 307, 418 N.E.2d 1355.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">{\u00b6 23} The <em>Saturn of Kings </em>court determined that the above-quoted language from <em>Hughes </em>and <em>Smith </em>resolved the dispute before it, i.e., a dispute between parties with competing claims of ownership and title to the motor vehicles at issue. See <em>Saturn of Kings, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 519, 751 N.E.2d 1019. Citing <em>Hughes, </em>the court determined that it had already \u201cclearly and unequivocally stated that R.C. 4505.04 was intended to apply to litigation where the parties were rival claimants to title, i.e., ownership of the automobile.\u201d Id. at 519, 751 N.E.2d 1019.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>{\u00b6 24} The <em>Saturn of Kings </em>court expressly held that \u201cin determining competing claims of ownership of a motor vehicle, R.C. 4505.04(A) controls over the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code\u201d and observed that Saturn and Cronin \u201cretained possession of the certificates of title to the motor vehicles at issue in this dispute.\u201d Id. at 520, 751 N.E.2d 1019. In consideration thereof, the <em>Saturn of Kings </em>court resolved:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-5\">Pursuant to R.C. 4505.04(A), title to and, thus, ownership of a motor vehicle in this context does not pass without issuance or delivery of the certificate of title. Because the certificates of title were never assigned and delivered to Gallatin, Gallatin was never the lawful owner of the vehicles and, therefore, could not lawfully pass title to appellee. [Saturn and Cronin], by retaining possession of the certificates of title, are the rightful owners of the motor vehicles and, as such, are entitled to the proceeds of sale placed in escrow.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">{\u00b6 25} In this appeal, Heartland also relies on <em>First Merit Bank v. Angelini, </em>159 Ohio App.3d 179, 2004-Ohio-6045, 823 N.E.2d 485, a decision from the Third District Court of Appeals. <em>Angelini </em>involved facts similar to those in the case at bar, and in that case, the Third District found <em>Saturn of Kings </em>and R.C. 4505.04(A) to be controlling. <em>Angelini </em>involved a 2000 Astro van and a 1997 Saturn automobile. Automobile dealer John Angelini sold the two vehicles from his dealership lot. Prior to the sales, Angelini had granted Galion Building &amp; Loan Bank (\u201cGalion\u201d) a security interest in both vehicles as a result of a consolidated loan. A notation of Gabon\u2019s security interest was made on the certificates of title for the vehicles. Buyers purchased the vehicles with the assistance of financing by Angelini through First Merit Bank (\u201cFirst Merit\u201d). Payment was made to Angelini for the vehicles, but Angelini did not forward payment to Galion. The buyers took possession of their vehicles on the day of the purchase. However, neither buyer received the certificate of title for his purchased vehicle, as Gabon retained physical possession of the certificates of title to the vehicles. See id. at \u00b6 2-4, 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">{\u00b6 26} First Merit filed a complaint against Angelini and Gabon, alleging that Angelini had committed fraud when Angelini accepted the funds from First Merit without paying off the vehicles\u2019 prior perfected lienholders. First Merit filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, seeking an order to extinguish Gabon\u2019s perfected security interests in the vehicles and to compel the transfer of the certificates of title. Following a hearing on the matter, the trial court found that Angehni was a dealer of motor vehicles, that the two vehicles were offered for sale as inventory, and that both buyers were buyers in the ordinary course of business. Finding R.C. 1309.320 applicable by means of R.C. 4505.13(A)(2), the trial court concluded that the purchasers were to take free of Gabon\u2019s security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>interests and that First Merit was entitled to relief. The trial court granted the motion for the injunction, ordered Gabon to release its security interests over the vehicles and to turn over the certificates of title. Gabon appealed from the judgment of the trial court. See <em>Angelini </em>at \u00b6 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">{\u00b6 27} <em>Angelini </em>reversed the judgment of the trial court. Citing <em>Saturn of Kings, </em>the <em>Angelini </em>court determined that \u201cR.C. 4505.04(A) controls over provisions of the UCC when determining competing claims of ownership in motor vehicles. Like the case sub judice, the <em>Saturn [of Kings </em>] case involved competing interest of ownership in motor vehicles where there had been no transfer of the certificate of title.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 11, citing <em>Saturn of Kings, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 513, 751 N.E.2d 1019. The <em>Angelini </em>court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">[AJpplying R.C. 4505.04(A) to the case at bar, we hold that Gabon\u2019s security interests in the vehicles clearly take priority over First Merit\u2019s claim. Under R.C. 4505.04(A), \u201c[n]o person acquiring a motor vehicle from its owner, whether the owner is a manufacturer, importer, dealer, or any other person, shall acquire any right, title, claim, or interest in or to the motor vehicle until there is issued to the person a certificate of title to the motor vehicle * * *.\u201d Here Gabon properly held and retained possession of the certificates of title to both vehicles at all times. \u201cPursuant to R.C. 4505.04(A), title to and, thus, ownership * * * does not pass without issuance or delivery of the certificate of title.\u201d <em>Saturn, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 520, 751 N.E.2d 1019. Here the certificates of title were never assigned or delivered to either Angelini or First Merit. Thus, under R.C. 4505.04(A) and <em>Saturn, </em>because the certificates of title were never assigned and delivered to Angelini, Angelini was never the lawful owner of the vehicles, and, therefore, could not lawfully pass title to First Merit. Id. Accordingly, by retaining possession of the certificates of title, Gabon\u2019s security interests in these vehicles remain superior. Id.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Id. at \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">{\u00b6 28} Additionally, the <em>Angelini </em>court addressed the issue of whether R.C. 4505.13(A)(2) allowed the UCC to \u201cusurp\u201d the Certificate-of-Title Law. Id. at \u00b6 21. The court recognized that R.C. 4505.13(A)(2) specifically refers to R.C. Chapter 1309 and that R.C. 4505.13(B) is subject to R.C. 4505.13(A); however, it found the \u201cspecific requirements in subsection (B) to be controlling.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 23. Applying its interpretation of R.C. 4505.13(B), the <em>Angelini </em>court found that Gabon\u2019s security interest was \u201cvalid as against * * * subsequent purchasers\u201d because notation of Gabon\u2019s security interest had been made on the face of both certificates of title. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">{\u00b6 29} In sum, the <em>Angelini </em>court found that pursuant to R.C. 4505.04(A), Gabon\u2019s security interests in the motor vehicles remained superior because Gabon retained possession of the certificates of title and that pursuant to R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>4505.13(B), Gabon\u2019s security interests remained protected because notations of the security interests had been made on the face of both certificates of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">{\u00b6 30} In urging that we follow the reasoning in <em>Angelini, </em>Heartland asserts that <em>Angelini </em>was not accepted for review by the Supreme Court of Ohio despite its opportunity to review the case. Heartland suggests that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision not to accept the case for review implies that it concurred with the resolution of the case. However, a decision by the Supreme Court of Ohio not to accept an appeal is not a determination on the merits of the case. See S.Ct.Prac.R. 111(6). (\u201cAfter the time for filing jurisdictional memoranda has passed, the Supreme Court will review the jurisdictional memoranda filed and determine whether to accept the appeal and decide the case on the merits.\u201d) Therefore, we draw no inference from the fact that the Supreme Court declined to accept an appeal in <em>Angelini.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">{\u00b6 31} Applying the same or similar reasoning as applied in <em>Angelini </em>Heartland argues that the reasoning of <em>Saturn of Kings </em>applies to the facts of this case because this case involves competing claims between an alleged owner of a motor vehicle and a lienholder. In that regard, Heartland contends that R.C. 4505.04(A) is controlling because the disputes among Heartland, National City, and the purchasers involve competing interests in the motor vehicles. Heartland further argues that based on R.C. 4505.04(A), as well as <em>Saturn of Kings </em>and <em>Angelini, </em>Dublin Auto \u201cdid not have the ability to lawfully transfer title to the Purchasers or National City free and clear <em>of </em>Heartland\u2019s liens.\u201d Heartland reasons as follows: \u201cAlthough Heartland subsequently caused certificates of title to the motor vehicles at issue to be issued to the Purchasers, Heartland\u2019s liens were not released or cancelled from the certificates. Thus, Heartland\u2019s liens survived the attempted transfer of the motor vehicles to the Purchasers and remain the first and best liens on the motor vehicles.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">{\u00b6 32} As to that argument, we find Heartland\u2019s reliance on <em>Saturn of Kings, </em>as well as <em>Angelini, </em>misplaced. In <em>Saturn of Kings, </em>the \u201cprimary issue\u201d was \u201cwhether a person may acquire legal ownership of a motor vehicle without transfer to that person of the vehicle\u2019s certificate of title.\u201d Id. at 515, 751 N.E.2d 1019. In resolving that dispute, the Supreme Court of Ohio analyzed the interplay between R.C. Chapters 1302 and 4505. The dispute in this case concerns whether Heartland\u2019s security interest in motor vehicles held as inventory for sale by a dealer was extinguished upon the sale of those motor vehicles, and it necessitates an analysis of the interplay between R.C. Chapters 1309 and 4505. In <em>Saturn of Kings, </em>the court did not analyze the interplay between R.C. Chapters 1309 and 4505. Moreover, contrary to Heartland\u2019s implicit assertion, <em>Saturn of Kings </em>did not hold that all disputes involving lienholders in a motor vehicle are controlled and resolved by R.C. 4505.04(A). In <em>Angelini </em>the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>determined that the dealer, Angelini, was never the lawful owner of the motor vehicles at issue in that case and therefore could not pass title. Here, the certificates of title designated Dublin Auto, then the retail purchasers, as the title owners of the motor vehicles at issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Furthermore, Heartland concedes that certificates of title to the pertinent motor vehicles were issued to the retail purchasers of those motor vehicles. Based on the foregoing, we conclude that neither <em>Saturn of Kings </em>nor the <em>Angelini </em>court\u2019s application of <em>Saturn of Kings </em>resolves the dispute in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">{\u00b6 33} Consistent with the <em>Angelini </em>court\u2019s analysis regarding the application of R.C. 4505.13(A)(2), Heartland asserts that although R.C. 4505.13(B) is subject to R.C. 4505.13(A)(2), \u201cthe specific requirements in [R.C.] 4505.13(B) are controlling.\u201d Heartland contends that although R.C. 4505.13(A)(2) states that R.C. Chapter 1309 applies to a motor vehicle held as inventory for sale by a dealer, \u201cit does not state that Chapter 1309 applies exclusively to such a motor vehicle.\u201d Thus, according to Heartland, R.C. Chapter 1309 does not apply when a lien is noted on the face of the certificate of title, because the \u201cmore specific language\u201d in R.C. 4505.13(B) controls over R.C. 4505.13(A)(2). Pursuant to Heartland\u2019s reasoning, R.C. Chapter 1309 generally applies to a security interest in a motor vehicle held as inventory for sale by a dealer, but if a notation of the security interest has been made on the certificate of title, then R.C. 4505.13(B) controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">{\u00b6 34} Additionally, Heartland argues that \u201c[t]he clear language of [R.C.] 4505.04(A) mandates an interpretation of [R.C.] 4505.13(B) that protects a security interest in a motor vehicle when the secured party maintains physical possession of the certificate of title.\u201d In support of that argument, Heartland emphasizes the following language in R.C. 4505.04(A): \u201c[N]o waiver or estoppel operates in favor of such person against a person having possession of the certificate of title to * * * the motor vehicle, for a valuable consideration.\u201d Thus, according to Heartland, its security interest remains protected under R.C. 4505.13(B) against subsequent purchasers because of the notation of the security interest on the face of the certificates of title and because of its possession of the certificates of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">{\u00b6 35} We disagree with Heartland\u2019s statutory analysis. R.C. 4505.13(A)(2) provides that R.C. Chapter 1309 (which includes R.C. 1309.320(A)) \u201capplies to a security interest in a motor vehicle held as inventory for sale by a dealer.\u201d Contrary to Heartland\u2019s argument, language in the first sentence of R.C. 4505.13(B) does not create an exception to that principle when a notation of a lien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>is made on the face of the certificate of title. Indeed, R.C. 4505.13(B) provides that \u201cany security agreement covering a security interest in a motor vehicle, if a notation of the agreement has been made * * * on the face of the certificate of title * * * is valid as against * * * subsequent purchasers, secured parties, and other lienholders or claimants.\u201d However, that provision is \u201c[sjubject to\u201d R.C. 4505.13(A)\u2019s specific designation of R.C. Chapter 1309 as applying to security interests in motor vehicles held as inventory for sale by a dealer. See R.C. 4505.13(B). Thus, as to the perfection and priority of security interests in motor vehicles held as inventory for sale by a dealer, R.C. Chapter 1309 controls. This finding is consistent with the cross-reference within R.C. Chapter 1309 citing R.C. Chapter 4505 as governing the perfection of security interests in motor vehicles that are not inventory held for sale by a dealer. See R.C. 1309.311. See, also, Comment 4 to UCC 9-311, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">Inventory Covered by Certificate of Title. Under [UCC 9 \u2014 311(d) ], perfection of a security interest in the inventory of a person in the business of selling goods of that kind is governed by the normal perfection rules, even if the inventory is subject to a certificate-of-title statute. Compliance with a certificate-of-title statute is both unnecessary and ineffective to perfect a security interest in inventory to which this subsection applies. Thus, a secured party who finances an automobile dealer that is in the business of selling and leasing its inventory of automobiles can perfect a security interest in all the automobiles by filing a financing statement but not by compliance with a certificate-of-title statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">{\u00b6 36} Therefore, R.C. Chapter 1309, and necessarily R.C. 1309.320(A), applies to Heartland\u2019s security interest in the motor vehicles at issue in this case because, according to Heartland, the vehicles were held as inventory for sale by a dealer. As outlined above, R.C. 1309.320(A) provides that a buyer in the ordinary course of business takes free of a security interest created by the buyer\u2019s seller, even if the security interest is perfected and the buyer knows of its existence. It is undisputed that both Laxton and the Murphys were buyers in the ordinary course of business under the Revised Code. Applying R.C. 1309.320(A) to these facts, Heartland\u2019s security interest as against Laxton and the Murphys in the motor vehicles at issue was extinguished upon the sale of those motor vehicles. Thus, we conclude that the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of National City. Accordingly, we overrule Heartland\u2019s first and second assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">{\u00b6 37} Heartland argues in its third assignment of error that the trial court erred in holding that R.C. 4505.13(B) mandated that Heartland\u2019s liens on the motor vehicles at issue were terminated upon the attempted sale <em>of </em>those motor vehicles. In addition to applying R.C. 1309.320(A) to the facts of this case, the trial court, citing the third sentence in R.C. 4505.13(B), determined that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>\u201csecurity interest Heartland held on the two vehicles cannot stay with the vehicles once purchased.\u201d That sentence provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">Exposure for sale of any motor vehicle by its owner, with the knowledge or with the knowledge and consent of the holder of any security interest, lien, mortgage, or encumbrance on it, does not render that security interest, lien, mortgage, or encumbrance ineffective as against the creditors of that owner, or against holders of subsequent security interests, liens, mortgages, or encumbrances upon that motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">In its analysis, the trial court noted that the omission of \u201cpurchaser\u201d from this provision, as one of the entities against whom the lien is effective, has been interpreted to mean that a lienholder\u2019s interest is ineffective against a purchaser. See <em>Natl. City Bank, Akron v. Jim Pritz Ford, Inc. </em>(Sept. 4, 1990), Tuscarawas App. No. 90AP020015, 1990 WL 139718. In this appeal, Heartland challenges that analysis. Nonetheless, as to Heartland\u2019s first and second assignments of error, we have detex-mined that pursuant to R.C. 1309.320(A), Heartland\u2019s security interest in the motor vehicles was extinguished upon their sale. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to analyze whether the additional provision cited by the trial court also operated to extinguish Heartland\u2019s security interest in the motor vehicles. Therefore, our disposition of Heartland\u2019s first and second assignments of error x-enders moot its third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">{\u00b6 38} In its fourth assignment of error, Heartland argues that the trial court erred in holding that it was not entitled to payments on account of its liens on the motor vehicles at issue, because, according to Heartland, its liens survived any transfer of the motor vehicles. Heartland argues that the motor vehicles at issue ax-e subject to its liens and it is entitled to payment in full in view of those liens, even though it concedes that it has no contractual relationship with any of the purchasers of the motor vehicles at issue. National City argues that if Heartland\u2019s security interest suxwived the sale, then Heax-tland\u2019s only remedy would be as to the motor vehicles. Additionally, National City maintains that Heartland\u2019s secux-ity intex-est was terminated and, thex-efore, it has no rights as against the motor vehicles or the purchasers\u2019 payments to National City. On the basis of our determination that Heartland\u2019s secux-ity interest in the motor vehicles at issue was extinguished upon the sale of the motor vehicles to the retail purchasers, we ovex-x'ule Heax-tland\u2019s fourth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">{\u00b6 39} For the foregoing reasons, Heartland\u2019s first, second, and fourth assignments of error are overruled, and its third assignment of error is moot. Accordingly, the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b182-10\">Sadler, P.J., and Bryant, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-8\">. Although the certificates of title, issued June 12, 2002, and June 26, 2002, designate Heartland as the previous owner, Heartland has not asserted that it was at any time the title owner of the motor vehicles at issue. Thus, the discrepancies can be explained only as clerical errors, and we find them to be of no consequence to the resolution of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
