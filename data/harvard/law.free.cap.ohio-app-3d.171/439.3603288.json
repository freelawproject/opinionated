Dargart, filed a complaint in the common pleas court asserting a claim against appellee, the Ohio Department of Transportation (\u201cODOT\u201d) under R.C. 4113.52, the Ohio Whistleblower Statute. Appellant alleged that he worked for ODOT for approximately 35 years and, as of the year 1999, was the Business and Human Resource Administrator at ODOT\u2019s Bowling Green office.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">{\u00b6 3} The following facts are taken from appellant\u2019s complaint. On June 15, 1999, appellant verbally advised ODOT\u2019s chief legal counsel, Lisa Conomy, of possibly illegal acts that had occurred in the workplace. In a later written report, he contended that Richard Martinko, appellant\u2019s supervisor and Acting Deputy Director, and a second county transportation administrator had submitted falsified time sheets charging \u201cstate time to personal campaign activities.\u201d Appellant also alleged that Martinko may have \u201cfalsified his payroll forms by recording hours in excess\u201d of eight hours per day and then working only partial days on Fridays. Appellant further maintained that Martinko forged his immediate supervisor\u2019s name to the payroll forms and that Martinko failed to sign the daily logs when he left the building. Conomy subsequently informed appellant that in her opinion, there \u201cwere no improprieties among the violations\u201d described by appellant in his report. On September 2, 1999, Martinko was appointed Deputy Director of ODOT, District 2, with direct supervisory authority over appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">{\u00b6 4} According to the complaint, Martinko and the Director of ODOT, Gordon Proctor, thereafter took numerous retaliatory actions against him, e.g., (1) appellant did not receive pay increases when other administrators in his district received them, (2) he was eventually ordered to move his office to a remote location in the ODOT building, (3) he was, de facto, demoted from the position that he held for nine years, (4) he was, unlike other workers in his classification, required to get approval for vacations, compensatory time, and personal leave, (5) a disciplinary action was brought against appellant for alleged sexual harassment, (6) despite the fact that his physician said that it was unnecessary, appellant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>involuntarily placed on an administrative leave for health reasons, and (7) he was constructively discharged on July 31, 2000, when he resigned under continued threats of retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">{\u00b6 5} On December 8, 2005, ODOT filed a motion to dismiss appellant\u2019s complaint pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(1), lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, and 12(B)(3), improper venue. ODOT contended this was, at the least,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the third time that appellant has brought a claim under R.C. 4113.52 and offered documents in support of this contention. These materials show that appellant first brought this action in the Court of Claims in March 2000. In November 2001, he voluntarily dismissed that action, without prejudice. Appellant later refiled his action in the Court of Claims, not only alleging violations of R.C. Chapter 4113, but also age and disability discrimination. On March 23, 2003, the district court judge issued an opinion in favor of appellant on the R.C. 4113.52 claim only. ODOT, however, then filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. After reviewing the applicable law, the judge agreed with ODOT, and by judgment entry dated August 1, 2005, vacated his prior decision, and dismissed appellant\u2019s R.C. 4113.52 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">{\u00b6 6} Based upon the procedural history of this cause, ODOT asserted that the common pleas court was without jurisdiction for three reasons.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Two of these reasons are the subject of this appeal. Citing the \u201ctwo dismissal rule\u201d found in Civ.R. 41(A)(1), ODOT argued that the court lacked jurisdiction because the saving statute, R.C. 2305.19, can be used only once to refile a cause of action. ODOT also maintained that the court was without jurisdiction because R.C. 5501.22 requires that all actions against ODOT be brought in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. Appellant filed a memorandum in opposition, and ODOT filed a reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">{\u00b6 7} On January 13, 2006, the trial court entered a judgment dismissing appellant\u2019s case. It found that July 31, 2000, the date on which, appellant claims, he was compelled to resign, was the last date that ODOT took any retaliatory action against appellant. The court then concluded that appellant timely filed his whistleblower action in the Court of Claims within the 180-day limitations period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>set forth in R.C. 4113.52(D). The judge further decided that after dismissing his claim without prejudice, appellant refiled his case in the Court of Claims within the one-year time limit set forth in the saving statute. The judge held, however, that when the Court of Claims dismissed appellant\u2019s case due to lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, the statute of limitations had expired, and appellant could not employ R.C. 2305.19 to file his ease in the court of common pleas. In addition, he determined that jurisdiction did not lie in his court because courts have interpreted R.C. 5501.22 \u201cto mean that the courts of Franklin County have exclusive subject matter jurisdiction to hear cases involving the director of transportation or the Department of Transportation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">{\u00b6 8} Appellant appeals this judgment and asks us to consider the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cIt was error to not find that the \u2018two dismissal rule\u2019 has been abrogated by a change to O.R.C. 2305.19.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cIt was error to fail to recognize that O.R.C. 4113.51 creates a distinctly different party-defendant from the Director of Transportation and affords venue outside of Franklin County for whistleblower claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">{\u00b6 11} In his first assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred in dismissing his whistleblower action because this court has not explicitly adopted the two-dismissal rule. He further asserts that the March 2, 2004 amendment of the saving statute, R.C. 2305.19, effectively eliminated the two-dismissal rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">{\u00b6 12} When ruling on a Civ.R. 12(B)(1) motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, trial courts must determine whether a claim raises any action cognizable in that court. See <em>State ex rel. Bush v. Spurlock </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 77, 80, 537 N.E.2d 641; <em>Roll v. Edwards, </em>156 Ohio App.3d 227, 2004-Ohio-767, 805 N.E.2d 162, \u00b6 15. Appellate courts review trial court judgments regarding motions to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction de novo. <em>Schetter v. Frogameni, </em>6th Dist. No. L-05-1366, 2006-Ohio-3065, 2006 WL 1667709, \u00b6 4, citing <em>Hull v. Columbia Gas of Ohio, </em>160 Ohio App.3d 695, 2005-Ohio-2089, 828 N.E.2d 677, \u00b6 11. In making a determination under Civ.R. 12(B)(1), neither the trial court nor this court is confined to a consideration of the allegations of the complaint, but may consider any material pertinent to that inquiry. <em>Southgate Dev. Corp. v. Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 211, 2 O.O.3d 393, 358 N.E.2d 526, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">{\u00b6 13} We note at the outset that the trial court did not utilize the so-called \u201ctwo dismissal rule\u201d or \u201cdouble dismissal rule\u201d in making its decision. The lower court\u2019s sole basis for finding that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction was the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>that appellant could not rely \u201con the savings statute to re-file his claim for a third time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">{\u00b6 14} The so-called \u201ctwo dismissal rule\u201d or \u201cdouble dismissal rule\u201d applies only when a plaintiff twice voluntarily dismisses an action without prejudice by filing a notice in the trial court at any time before trial. Civ.R. 41(A)(1); <em>Olynyk v. Andrish, </em>8th Dist. No. 86009, 2005-Ohio-6632, 2005 WL 3436343, \u00b6 12; <em>EMC Mtge. Corp. v. Jenkins, </em>164 Ohio App.3d 240, 2005-Ohio-5799, 841 N.E.2d 855, \u00b6 28; <em>Robinson v. Allstate Ins., </em>8th Dist. No. 84666, 2004-Ohio-7032, 2004 WL 2980489, \u00b6 29. Specifically, Civ.R. 41(A)(1) allows a plaintiff to voluntarily dismiss all of his or her claims against a defendant, without approval of the court or any adverse party, by filing a notice of dismissal prior to trial, unless the case involves a counterclaim that cannot be independently adjudicated. <em>Frysinger v. Leech </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 38, 42, 512 N.E.2d 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">{\u00b6 15} The first voluntary dismissal of a claim without prejudice places the parties in the position as if no suit had ever been filed. <em>Denham v. New Carlisle </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 594, 596, 716 N.E.2d 184. However, the second voluntary dismissal without prejudice is deemed a dismissal on the merits and, thus, is res judicata to the filing of the same cause of action for the third time. <em>Forshey v. Airborne Freight Corp. </em>(2001), 142 Ohio App.3d 404, 411-412, 755 N.E.2d 969; <em>Olynyk v. Andrish, </em>\u00b6 11. Because the dismissals must be voluntary dismissals made pursuant Civ.R. 41(A)(1), the two-dismissal rule does not apply where the second dismissal is made by court order. <em>EMC Mtge. Corp. v. Jenkins, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">{\u00b6 16} As applied to the case under consideration, the second dismissal of appellant\u2019s whistleblower action in the Court of Claims was premised upon that court\u2019s lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and was accomplished by means of an order of the court. Therefore, the two-dismissal rule does not pertain to this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">{\u00b6 17} On the controlling question, i.e., whether appellant could file his R.C. 4113.52 suit for a third time under the saving statute, we must, for the following reason, agree with the court below. R.C. 2305.19(A), as effective on March 2, 2004, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cIn any action that is commenced or attempted to be commenced, if in due time * * * the plaintiff fails otherwise than upon the merits, the plaintiff * * * may commence a new action within one year after the * * * failure otherwise upon the merits or within the period of the original applicable statute of limitations, whichever occurs later.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">{\u00b6 19} The former version of the statute differed from the current statute in that it began with the phrase \u201cIn <em>an </em>action\u201d and ended with \u201cthe time limited for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>the commencement of such action at the date of * * * failure [otherwise than upon the merits] has expired.\u201d Appellant contends that by using the word \u201cany,\u201d the General Assembly intended to abrogate the two-dismissal rule. As stated previously, we hold that the two-dismissal rule is not relevant to our disposition of this cause. The amendment of R.C. 2305.19 may, however, be material to the outcome of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">{\u00b6 20} The legislature enacted the March 2, 2004 amendment of R.C. 2305.19 for one purpose. The prior version of the statute was available only to plaintiffs whose statute of limitations had run. Therefore, the legislature believed that under the pre-amendment version the saving statute arguably treated \u201csimilarly situated plaintiffs\u201d differently. 4 Anderson, Ohio Civil Practice (2004) 148.13, citing Bill Analysis of Sub. H.B. 161, 125th General Assembly. This belief is predicated upon the fact that a plaintiff who filed a Civ.R. 41(A)(1) dismissal of a claim without prejudice would have one year to refile, while a plaintiff who dismissed a claim before the statute ran would possibly have only one or two days to refile. Id. We must next determine, in light of the legislature\u2019s intent, what, if any, effect the amendment has upon the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">{\u00b6 21} Prior to the amendment of R.C. 2305.19, the Ohio Supreme Court held that the saving statute may be used only once to refile a case. <em>Thomas v. Freeman </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 221, 227, 680 N.E.2d 997, citing <em>Hancock v. Kroger Co. </em>(1995), 103 Ohio App.3d 266, 659 N.E.2d 336. See, also, <em>Estate of Carlson v. Tippett </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 489, 491, 702 N.E.2d 143; <em>Harris v. O\u2019Brien, </em>8th Dist. Nos. 86218 and 86323, 2006-Ohio-109, 2006 WL 73452, \u00b6 15. The saving statute cannot be used to keep actions alive indefinitely. <em>Romine v. Ohio State Hwy. Patrol </em>(2000), 136 Ohio App.3d 650, 654, 737 N.E.2d 586. To allow a plaintiff to use R.C. 2305.19 more than once would \u201cfrustrate the purpose of the civil rules which are intended to prevent indefinite filings.\u201d <em>Hancock v. Kroger Co., </em>103 Ohio App.3d at 269, 659 N.E.2d 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">{\u00b6 22} Despite the broadening language in the amendment of R.C. 2305.19, we are of the opinion that the legislature did not intend to obviate the foregoing precept by allowing endless filings of the same case so long as the filings were within one year of a dismissal otherwise than upon the merits. The legislative history of the current version of R.C. 2305.19, as set forth infra, supports this opinion. The new version of the statute was enacted to prevent the disparate treatment of \u201csimilarly situated\u201d plaintiffs. Appellant\u2019s case cannot be likened to that of a plaintiff whose case was dismissed other than on the merits before the statute of limitations ran. We thus conclude that because appellant employed the saving statute once to refile his lawsuit in the Court of Claims, he cannot use the saving statute to bring the same cause of action a third time. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>{\u00b6 23} Our disposition of appellant\u2019s first assignment of error renders appellant\u2019s second assignment of error moot, and it shall not be considered by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">{\u00b6 24} On consideration whereof, this court finds that substantial justice was done the party complaining, and the judgment of the Wood County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed. Appellant is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24. Judgment for the clerk\u2019s expense incurred in preparation of the record, fees allowed by law, and the fee for filing the appeal is awarded to Wood County.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b484-6\">Pietrykowski and Parish, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-8\">. ODOT noted that appellant also filed the claim in the United States District Court, Northern Division, asserting federal constitutional violations under Section 1983, Title 42, U.S.Code in 2000, but subsequently dismissed this action without prejudice. Nevertheless there is no evidence in the record of this cause establishing that appellant ever filed such a suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b480-9\">. ODOT maintained that appellant's sole remedy was an appeal to the State Personnel Board of Review under R.C. 124.341(D). Appellant argued that depending upon the type of violation allegedly committed by the state agency or instrumentality, he was provided with alternate remedies under R.C. 4113.52 and 124.341. The trial court found in favor of appellant on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
