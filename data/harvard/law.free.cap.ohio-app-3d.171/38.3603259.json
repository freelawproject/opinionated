In October 2002, law-enforcement officers executed a warrant to search his medical offices in Springfield and seize any evidence relevant to prove that defendant had prescribed controlled substances illegally. The officers seized defendant\u2019s patient records and a loaded shotgun found under his desk.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-14\">{\u00b6 3} Defendant was subsequently charged by indictment with ten counts of trafficking in drugs, R.C. 2925.03(A), and ten counts of illegal processing of drug documents, R.C. 2925.23(A). The state\u2019s theory was that defendant illegally prescribed the drug OxyContin and similar controlled substances used to manage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>intractable pain to three patients on ten occasions because in doing so he failed to comply with specific diagnosis and treatment protocols required by law when those drugs are prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">{\u00b6 4} At trial, the state offered the testimony of the three patients involved in the charges and the testimony of three undercover police officers who had posed as patients and also been prescribed drugs by defendant. The state also offered in evidence defendant\u2019s medical records concerning his treatment of those and over 200 other patients. Expert witnesses testified that those records reflect that like failures in diagnosis and treatment occurred with respect to defendant\u2019s other patients. The records were admitted as \u201cother act\u201d evidence pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B). On that same basis, the state offered evidence of the shotgun that was seized from defendant\u2019s office, as well as evidence showing that he had experienced serious financial difficulties.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">{\u00b6 5} Defendant Nucklos testified that he believed he had complied with all requirements imposed by law for prescribing OxyContin. The only documentary evidence he introduced was a copy of the Hippocratic oath of physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">{\u00b6 6} The jury returned guilty verdicts on all ten counts of trafficking in drugs and all ten counts of illegal processing of drug documents. The trial court merged the illegal-processing-of-drug-document offenses into defendant\u2019s ten drug trafficking offenses pursuant to R.C. 2941.25 and convicted defendant of the ten trafficking offenses. The court sentenced defendant to serve a maximum available term of two years for each offense, to be served consecutively, for an aggregate term of 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">{\u00b6 7} Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal. He presents eight separate \u201carguments,\u201d which we shall treat as assignments of error for purposes of App.R. 16(A)(3). By leave of court, an amicus curiae brief was filed by the Ohio State Medical Association concerning an error in a jury charge that defendant has assigned. Because we find that the trial court erred in giving the challenged charge and in admitting certain \u201cother act\u201d evidence, we need address only the assignments pertaining to those errors, because our rulings on them render the remaining assignments moot.

In submitting a case to a jury, the court must \u201c \u2018separate and definitely state * * * the issues of fact made in the pleadings, accompanied by such instructions as to each issue as the nature of the case may require.\u2019 \u201d <em>Marshall v.

Chapter 3719 governs controlled substances. R.C. 3719.06(A)(1) authorizes licensed health professionals to prescribe controlled substances \u201cif acting in the course of professional practice, in accordance with the laws regulating the professional\u2019s practice, and in accordance with rules adopted by the state board of pharmacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">{\u00b6 17} R.C. Chapter 4731 governs licensed physicians. R.C. 4731.41 prohibits the practice of medicine \u201cwithout the appropriate certificate from the state medical board to engage in the practice.\u201d Pursuant to its licensing authority, the State Medical Board has promulgated Ohio Adm.Code 4731-21-02, et seq., governing a physician\u2019s utilization of any prescription drug for the treatment of intractable pain on a prolonged basis. The regulation contains extensive provisions governing a physician\u2019s initial diagnosis, a medical diagnosis, formulation of an individualized treatment plan, diagnosis of an intractable pain condition, referral of the patient to a specialist in the body part affected, the need to obtain records of the patient\u2019s prior treatment, maintaining records detailing those procedures, and similar requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-13\">{\u00b6 18} It is undisputed that defendant Nucklos acted as a licensed health professional for purposes of R.C. 3719.06(B)(1) when he committed the violations of R.C. 2925.03(A)(1) alleged and that the drugs he prescribed for the three patients concerned in the ten charges against him, as well as numerous other patients, are controlled substances for purposes of R.C. 2925.03(A)(1). Defendant argues that the trial court erred in its instruction to the jury regarding the burden of proof that R.C. 2925.03(B)(1) imposes, specifically, that the trial court erred when it instructed the jury that it was defendant\u2019s burden to prove that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>acted in accordance with the laws and regulations governing prescription of a controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">{\u00b6 19} Criminal liability requires proof that the accused engaged in a voluntary act or omission prohibited by law with the requisite degree of culpability for each element of the offense the law specifies. R.C. 2901.21(A). Further, R.C. 2901.05 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(A) Every person accused of an offense is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and the burden of proof for all elements of the offense is upon the prosecution. The burden of going forward with the evidence of an affirmative defense, and the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, for an affirmative defense, is upon the accused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(B) As part of its charge to the jury in a criminal case, the court shall read the definitions of \u2018reasonable doubt\u2019 and \u2018proof beyond a reasonable doubt,\u2019 contained in division (D) of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c(C) As used in this section, an \u2018affirmative defense\u2019 is either of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(1) A defense expressly designated as affirmative;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-10\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(2) A defense involving an excuse or justification peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused, on which he can fairly be required to adduce supporting evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">{\u00b6 25} In charging the jury with respect to the drug trafficking violations alleged, the court instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-12\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cThe defendant is charged in Count 1 with trafficking in OxyContin. Before you can find the defendant guilty of this offense, <em>you must find beyond a reasonable doubt </em>that on or about December 6, 2001, at Clark County, Ohio, he did knowingly sell or offer to sell the Schedule II controlled substance OxyContin to Darrin Briggs; and <em>his conduct ivas not in accordance ivith Chapters 3719, 4729, and 4731 of the Ohio Revised Code.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-13\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cA person acts \u2018knowingly\u2019 regardless of his purpose when he is aware that his conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when he is aware that such circumstances probably exist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-14\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c \u2018Sale\u2019 includes delivery, barter, exchange, transfer, or gift or offer thereof; and each such transaction made by any person, whether as principal, proprietor, agent, servant, or employee. The issuing of a prescription for controlled substances constitutes a sale of controlled substances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-15\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c \u2018Offer\u2019 means to present for acceptance or rejection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>{\u00b6 30} \u201cTypically a physician who prescribes a controlled substance is exempt from the provisions of law dealing with drug trafficking; however, a physician loses that exemption when his conduct is not in accordance with Chapters 3719, 4729 and 4731 of the Ohio Revised Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cIf you find that the defendant was not acting as a physician in the course of the bona fide treatment of a patient because he issued a prescription for some reason or reasons other than a legitimate medical purpose, you must find that his conduct was not in accordance with Chapters 3719, 4729, and 4731 of the Ohio Revised Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c \u2018Bona fide\u2019 means in, or with, good faith, honestly, openly, and sincerely, without deceit or fraud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">{\u00b6 33} <em>\u201cIf you find that the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt all of the essential elements of trafficicing in OxyContin, you will go on to determine whether the defendant has established by a preponderance of the evidence the affirmative defense that he was a physician acting in the course of the bona fide treatment of patients.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cOn the other hand, if you find that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt <em>any one of the essential elements of </em>trafficking in OxyContin, your verdict on that charge must be not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-9\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cCounts 2 through 10.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-10\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cAll of the instructions and definitions for Count 1, which are set forth above, apply to Counts 2 through 10 as well.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">(\u00b6 37} Defendant argues that the instruction the court gave was confusing and inconsistent and that it improperly transferred the burden of proof on the proposition in R.C. 2925.03(B)(1) to him. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-12\">{\u00b6 38} Because R.C. 2925.03(B)(1) is not expressly designated as an affirmative defense, an accused may be required to prove the particular facts and circumstances that R.C. 2925.03(B)(1) concerns, by a preponderance of the evidence, only if those matters \u201cinvolve[d] an excuse or justification peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused, on which he can fairly be required to adduce supporting evidence.\u201d R.C. 2901.05(C)(2). However, because the burden to prove all elements of the offense is on the prosecution, and never shifts, where a particular affirmative defense goes to or negates an element of the offense which the prosecution must prove in order to convict, the burden of its proof does not shift to the defendant because due process requires the state to prove every element of the crime charged, beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>In re Winship </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368; <em>Patterson v. New York </em>(1977), 432 U.S. 197, 97 S.Ct. 2319, 53 L.Ed.2d 281; <em>State v. Frost </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St.2d 121, 11 O.O.3d 294. 387 N.E.2d 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>{\u00b6 39} R.C. 2925.03(A)(1) prohibits knowingly selling or offering to sell a controlled substance, and issuing a prescription for a controlled substance is a form of \u201csale.\u201d However, the privilege conferred on licensed physicians by R.C. 3719.06(A)(1) to prescribe controlled substances exempts those licensees from criminal liability for conduct that would otherwise violate R.C. 2925.03(A)(1) when they prescribe a controlled substance, unless in prescribing the drug the physician fails to act in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. R.C. 2925.03(B)(1). Because proof of the failure is necessary to a finding of the physician\u2019s criminal liability in that circumstance, that failure is an element of the criminal conduct that R.C. 2925.03(A)(1) prohibits when the accused is a licensed physician and the conduct alleged to create criminal liability involves \u201csale\u201d of a controlled substance by writing a prescription for it. Being an element of the violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(1) alleged, proof that the defendant physician did not act in accordance with applicable laws remains the state\u2019s burden, on the reasonable-doubt standard, and does not shift to the defendant on the theory that negating that element constitutes an affirmative defense. <em>Winship; Patterson; Frost.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">{\u00b6 40} That is not to say that R.C. 2925.03(B)(1) does not implicate an affirmative defense. It does, but only to the extent that an accused must prove that he fits within one of the exempted occupations the section identifies. At least with respect to physicians who are \u201clicensed health professionals,\u201d that is an insignificant burden and in the present case was a matter the state conceded and on which the proof that it offered was based. That proof likewise demonstrates the privilege that R.C. 3719.06(A)(1) confers on licensed physicians to prescribe controlled substances. That in exercising the privilege, defendant was not \u201cacting in the course of professional practice, in accordance with the laws regulating the professional\u2019s practice,\u201d which deprives him of the privilege in order to create criminal liability, remains a matter on which the state has the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">{\u00b6 41} The Supreme Court of Ohio has not addressed this issue specifically. However, in <em>State v. Sway </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 112, 15 OBR 265, 472 N.E.2d 1065, the Supreme Court held: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>ment charging defendant with ten violations of R.C. 2925.03(A)(1) alleges, with respect to each of the ten counts charged, that defendant\u2019s \u201cconduct was not in accordance with Chapters 3719, 4729, and 4731 of the Revised Code, in violation of 2925.03 of the Revised Code.\u201d The state\u2019s charging document thus set up the alleged failure as an element of the offenses with which he was charged.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>{\u00b6 42} \u201cA physician who unlawfully issues a prescription for a controlled substance not in the course of the bona fide treatment of a patient is guilty of selling a controlled substance in violation of R.C. 2925.03.\u201d Id. at syllabus. That positive statement of the law comports with the view that it is the state\u2019s burden to prove the basis for criminal liability in R.C. 2925.03(B)(1). Further, in <em>Sway </em>the court noted that the bill of particulars the state had filed alleged the defendant physician\u2019s failure to conform to the standards of his profession in prescribing the medication concerned. Likewise, in the present case, the indict-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>{\u00b6 43} The proposed instructions that the state filed indicates that the state viewed the alleged failure as part of its burden of proof. The proposed instruction states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cIf you find that the defendant physician authorized prescriptions for a controlled substance not in the course of the legitimate treatment of a patient, and not having a bona fide or good faith intention to practice medicine, you must find that defendant acted outside the scope of Chapters 4729, 4731, and 3719 of the Ohio Revised Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">{\u00b6 45} That the state viewed defendant\u2019s alleged failures to act in accordance with applicable laws and regulations as part of the state\u2019s burden of proof is also apparent from the transcript of the conference on the instructions the court proposed to give. When the court indicated its intent to also give an affirmative defense instruction, Attorney Rowland, who had been assigned by the State Pharmacy Board to assist in the prosecution, expressed his \u201cconcern about indicating that R.C. 2925.03(B)(1) is an affirmative defense,\u201d and further told the court that \u201cthe Court\u2019s instructions on what the State must prove, I think, appropriately indicates what the State must prove,\u201d adding that \u201ccounsel for the defense has indicated that in his proposed instructions.\u201d Defense counsel joined the state in the concerns it expressed, asking that his proposed instruction instead be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">{\u00b6 46} Responding to these contentions of counsel, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-9\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cAs far as the issue of whether or not a physician acting in the course of the bona fide treatment of patients, whether or not that\u2019s an affirmative defense, the Court would concede that it is kind of duplicative in this case because one of the elements that the State\u2019s required to prove is that the defendant\u2019s conduct was not in accordance with certain chapters of the Revised Code; and presumably if the State proves that, then that should be the end of the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-10\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cBecause an affirmative defense would be that he did act in accordance with those provisions of the Revised Code, and it is kind of duplicative; but in the Court\u2019s reviewing of the Ohio Jury Instructions, it did have acting in the course of the bona fide treatment of patients as an affirmative defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-11\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cAnd, again, even though there\u2019s some overlap \u2014 and I agree with counsel that it does seem to be an element of the State\u2019s case \u2014 I think for purposes of just maybe making it a little more clear to the jury that that\u2019s the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>specific element of the offense that the defendant is challenging. I think I\u2019ll leave it as an affirmative defense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">{\u00b6 50} The portion of Ohio Jury Instructions (\u201cOJI\u201d) to which the court referred is Section 525.03, which contains the following comment at paragraph 12:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cR.C. 2925.03(B) creates certain exceptions to the prohibitions of R.C. 2925.03(A). The Committee believes these are affirmative defenses under R.C. 2901.05(C)(2) or in the nature of affirmative defenses and must be treated as such. See <em>State v. Little </em>(March 14, 1991) [8th Dist. No. 57033, 1991 WL 34870], 1991 Ohio App. LEXIS 1053; <em>State v. Hassell </em>(May 5, 1993) [1st Dist. No. C-920530, 1993 WL 231701], 1993 Ohio App. LEXIS 2364.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">{\u00b6 52} Neither decision to which the OJI comment refers, <em>Little </em>or <em>Hassell, </em>involved alleged violations of R.C. 2925.03(A)(1). Rather, both involved charges of carrying concealed weapons in violation of R.C. 2923.12(A)(2), the weapon being a handgun. Paragraph (C)(1) of R.C. 2923.12 states: \u201cThis section does not apply to * * * law enforcement officers, authorized to carry concealed weapons * * * and acting within the scope of their duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">{\u00b6 53} The defendant in <em>Hassell </em>was an officer of the Cincinnati Metropolitan Housing Authority who claimed that he was acting in the course of his official duties when he shot a suspect. The defendant in <em>Little </em>was a security guard who had been authorized by a local police department to carry a firearm that was discovered in his knapsack. In both cases, the appellate courts held that R.C. 2923.12(C)(1) created an affirmative defense to criminal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">{\u00b6 54} Both the affirmative defense in R.C. 2923.12(C)(1) pertaining to law-enforcement officers and the criminal liability for a violation of R.C. 2923.03(A)(1) imposed on licensed health professionals by R.C. 2925.03(B)(1) depend on the exercise of a privilege conferred by law. However, the particular exercise of the privilege contemplated by R.C. 2923.12(C)(1), an officer\u2019s acting in the course of official duties, involves conduct that is not an element of the offense to which it applies, carrying a concealed weapon in violation of R.C. 2923.12(A). On the other hand, as we explained, the failure to act in accordance with law contemplated by R.C. 2925.03(B)(1) is an element of the conduct prohibited by R.C. 2925.03(A)(1) when it is committed by a licensed physician in the exercise of the privilege conferred on him. Therefore, per <em>Winship, </em>the burden of its proof cannot shift to the accused, irrespective of its similarity to other affirmative defenses such as R.C. 2923.12(C)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">{\u00b6 55} The rule of <em>Winship </em>prevents the burden of proving the matters that R.C. 2925.03(B)(1) involves from being a defense on which an accused \u201ccan fairly be required to adduce supporting evidence,\u201d which is a necessary feature of an affirmative defense defined by R.C. 2901.05(C)(2). In addition, per that section, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>the affirmative defense must be one \u201cinvolving an excuse or justification peculiarly 'within the knowledge of the accused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">{\u00b6 56} Whether a law-enforcement officer was acting within the course of his official duties involves a matter of subjective intent that is \u201cpeculiarly\u201d within the officer\u2019s knowledge. Defendant Nucklos\u2019s alleged failure to comply with the requirements imposed by Ohio Adm.Code 4731-21-02 et seq. would involve matters that are within his knowledge, but not <em>peculiarly </em>(characteristically, distinctly, or exceptionally) so. Those regulations impose extensive record-keeping requirements pertaining to each duty they impose on physicians who prescribe controlled substances for intractable and persistent pain. As it did here, the state may offer evidence proving that a physician\u2019s records or lack thereof evidence the violation of law that R.C. 2925.03(A)(1) and (B)(1) involves, without any proof of why the defendant physician acted as he did. They are matters of objective fact for which a physician must, per the regulations, maintain records that reflect that those matters occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">(\u00b6 57} For the foregoing reasons, we believe that the advice in paragraph 12 of Section 525.03 of the OJI is incorrect and misleading, and, as it did in the present case, that it has the capacity to lead the trial courts to commit error. OJI is a respected and authoritative source of the law, but it is merely a product of the Ohio Judicial Conference and not binding on the courts. Therefore, adherence to its terms does not insulate a court from reversal when reversible error is committed. We strongly urge the editors of OJI to expunge its comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">(\u00b6 58} By adhering to OJI as it did, telling the jury that proof of his compliance with applicable laws and regulations is an affirmative defense that defendant had the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence, and that in order to convict the jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant\u2019s conduct in that same regard was not in accordance with law, the instruction the court gave was internally inconsistent and confusing. By its terms, the instruction also shifted the burden to prove an element of the offense to the defendant, which <em>Winship </em>prohibits. The error is reversible.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">{\u00b6 59} As a final matter, the state contends that defendant acquiesced in the court\u2019s error. The record does not support the state\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">{\u00b6 60} Defense counsel\u2019s alleged \u201cacquiescence\u201d was to the court\u2019s definition of \u201cbona fide,\u201d not to the affirmative-defense instruction the court proposed to give. The transcript reflects that both the state and defendant proffered instructions that were consistent with the rule of <em>Sway </em>and set up no affirmative defense, and that defendant objected to the court\u2019s failure to give his requested instruction. When defendant stated that he intended his objection to the court\u2019s affirmative-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>defense instruction to be sufficient for purposes of Crim.R. 30, which requires a particularized objection \u201cbefore the jury retires to consider its verdict,\u201d the court twice replied, \u201cSure.\u201d Therefore, we believe that the error was preserved, not waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">{\u00b6 61} Defendant\u2019s assignment of error \u201cF\u201d is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">DEFENDANT\u2019S ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR \u201cC\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">{\u00b6 62} \u201cThe prior \u2018bad act\u2019 evidence, the so-called civil judgment, was inadmissible and unduly prejudiced defendant before the jury; the court should have declared a mistrial at the beginning of the trial; now, this court must vacate the conviction, and remand for a new trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">{\u00b6 63} During his opening statement, the special prosecutor assigned by the State Pharmacy Board told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">{\u00b6 64} \u201cOne of your first witnesses that you\u2019re going to hear is a gentleman from the Ohio Bureau of Workman\u2019s Compensation. He\u2019s going to tell you that there was a civil judgment against the defendant several years ago, a very substantial civil judgment, a civil judgment that tells us an idea of why this doctor would practice the way you\u2019re going to hear he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-10\">{\u00b6 65} \u201cHe needed some money. He needed a lot of money, and he needed it fast; and how did he do that? A doctor who has an office in Columbus decided one day a week, he\u2019ll come to this county, this city, and open an office one day a week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-11\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cYou\u2019re going to hear that the patients that he saw were only allowed to come in with cash, none of this insurance stuff. Cash. And a substantial sum of cash before you get to see the doctor; and then what the doctor did with you was basically, \u2018What do you want?\u2019 And those patients got the drugs that they wanted as long as they paid the cash.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-12\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cNow, the State doesn\u2019t have to show motive, doesn\u2019t have to prove motive; and the Judge will tell you that. But we\u2019ve all got to wonder why would somebody do these things? Why would a doctor traffic in drugs? Why would a doctor sell drugs when he could be treating legitimate patients? So you\u2019ll hear some of that testimony as to why.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-13\">{\u00b6 68} Defendant didn\u2019t object to the prosecutor\u2019s statement when it was made. Instead, after the conclusion of the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement, defendant moved for a mistrial, arguing that by mentioning the civil judgment against defendant the prosecutor had \u201cpoisoned the minds of these jurors in an inappropriate way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-14\">{\u00b6 69} The trial court overruled the defendant\u2019s motion on a finding that evidence of the civil judgment was admissible pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B) to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>motive. The court also found that the probative value of the evidence is not outweighed by the danger of prejudice or confusion or misleading the jury. The court went on to give the jury a cautionary instruction that it could consider any evidence of a civil judgment only to show defendant\u2019s \u201cmotive for why he may or may not have committed the crimes with which he is charged\u201d and not for any other purpose, including \u201cbad character,\u201d or that defendant \u201cwould have acted in conformity with that bad character with respect to the charges with which he\u2019s charged today.\u201d The court repeated the cautionary instruction after the evidence was admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">{\u00b6 70} We find no error in the trial court\u2019s ruling. The evidence that the prosecutor told the jury it would hear concerning a civil judgment against defendant was admissible per Evid.R. 404(B) to prove his motive for committing the crimes alleged: a need for money. No mistrial was warranted, and the court\u2019s cautionary instructions avoided any undue prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">{\u00b6 71} Defendant changes his tack on appeal. He argues that the prosecutor\u2019s statement was objectionable because the evidence the state subsequently introduced through testimony of an employee of the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation failed to show that a civil judgment had been granted against defendant when the alleged offenses took place. Rather, the witness testified that an audit performed in 2000 found that defendant substantially overbilled the bureau for services and that defendant owed the Bureau approximately $623,000 in reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">{\u00b6 72} The fact that the state\u2019s evidence failed to support the particulars of the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement concerning the existence of a civil judgment does not render the statement objectionable or justify a mistrial. The variance was available for defendant\u2019s exploitation in cross-examination. Defendant made no attempt to do that with respect to the alleged civil judgment, and instead challenged the witness\u2019s testimony concerning the findings the audit produced and defendant\u2019s knowledge of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">{\u00b6 73} Defendant\u2019s contention at trial was that he had been \u201cseverely prejudiced by this testimony\u201d of alleged overbilling. No doubt, the evidence not only showed an alleged motive for the crimes with which defendant was charged, but it also implied dishonesty. However, it was not so unfairly prejudicial that it should have been excluded pursuant to Evid.R. 403. <em>State v. Geasley </em>(1993), 85 Ohio App.3d 360, 619 N.E.2d 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">{\u00b6 74} We find no abuse of discretion on the error assigned. The cautionary instructions the trial court gave avoided any undue prejudice. Defendant\u2019s assignment of error \u201cC\u201d is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>DEFENDANT\u2019S ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR \u201cD\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\">{\u00b6 75} \u201cThe state\u2019s character assassination continued with other \u2018bad acts\u2019 evidence including a seized shotgun brandished before the jury, irrelevant patient medical records, slanderous expert testimony on the inadmissible records, <em>faux </em>pain patients (the undercover agents), and objectionable hearsay allegations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">{\u00b6 76} In this assignment of error, defendant contends that the trial court erred when it admitted certain evidence pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B): a loaded shotgun found in the search of defendant\u2019s office and seized by law-enforcement officers and medical records of over 200 other patients concerning which the state\u2019s expert witness testified, as well as the testimony of three undercover police officers that the state also offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">{\u00b6 77} The state responds that the loaded shotgun was admissible to show defendant\u2019s \u201cstate of mind,\u201d i.e., that because his practice was run on a cash-payment basis, \u201cthe shotgun was to protect himself from the drug dealers he was supplying with OxyContin.\u201d The state made that same contention at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">{\u00b6 78} Evid.R. 404(B) and its companion statutory provision, R.C. 2945.59, are concerned with extrinsic acts. \u201cAn extrinsic act is simply any act which is not part of the operative facts or episode of the case; i.e., it is \u2018extrinsic\u2019 usually because of a separation of time, space, or both.\u201d Weissenberger\u2019s Ohio Evidence Treatise (2006), Section 402.21. \u201cGenerally, extrinsic acts may not be used to suggest that the accused has the propensity to act in a certain manner.\u201d <em>State v. Crotts, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 432, 2004-Ohio-6550, 820 N.E.2d 302, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">{\u00b6 79} Obviously, defendant did not use the loaded shotgun to write the prescriptions for the three patients whose diagnosis and treatment by him the indictment concerns. Its presence in his office is remote from the operative facts of the criminal conduct alleged. Nevertheless, insofar as the shotgun was in defendant\u2019s office while those patients were examined and treated there, which is a reasonable implication, the shotgun and its presence are not matters separated by time and space from the criminal offenses in which defendant is alleged to have engaged. Therefore, evidence that the loaded shotgun was found in defendant\u2019s office is not \u201cextrinsic\u201d to the criminal conduct alleged, and Evid.R. 404(B) is not implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">{\u00b6 80} The evidence the state offered concerning defendant\u2019s treatment of other patients, the three undercover officers and over 200 others whose medical records were introduced through the state\u2019s expert witnesses, is more problematic.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">{\u00b6 81} R.C. 2901.21(A) conditions criminal liability on findings that an accused committed an act or omission prohibited by law, with the requisite degree of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>mental culpability. R.C. 2925.03(A)(1), the drug-trafficking statute defendant was accused of violating, requires proof that the accused acted \u201cknowingly.\u201d R.C. 2901.22(B) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-5\">{\u00b6 82} \u201cA person acts knowingly, regardless of his purpose, when he is aware that his conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when he is aware that such circumstances probably exist.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">{\u00b6 83} Because a culpable mental state involves an accused\u2019s state of mind, it typically must be proved by circumstantial evidence: evidence of one thing from which another may be inferred. Evidence of the conduct prohibited by law ordinarily permits an inference that the accused acted knowingly when he engaged in the conduct. Evidence of matters extrinsic to that prohibited conduct in which the accused also engaged may also be offered for that purpose pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B), subject to two limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">{\u00b6 84} Per the first sentence of the rule, \u201c[ejvidence of the other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith.\u201d The provision extends the exclusionary principle of Evid.R. 404(A) to extrinsic evidence offered for a purpose that Evid.R. 404(A) prohibits. Thus, \u201c[generally, extrinsic acts may not be used to suggest that the accused has the propensity to act in a certain manner.\u201d <em>State v. Crotts, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 432, 2004-Ohio-6550, 820 N.E.2d 302, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">{\u00b6 85} \u201cRule 404(B) creates a forbidden two-step causal relationship, where an extrinsic act inferentially indicates a character trait or general propensity, which in turn inferentially indicates the commission of the act which is part of the operative facts of the case. * * * The rule, in essence, prohibits the argument which would suggest that because a person acted in a particular way on a distinct, specific occasion, that person likely acted in the same way with regard to the operative facts of the instant litigation.\u201d Weissenberger, Section 404.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">{\u00b6 86} After stating the basic rule of exclusion, the second sentence of Evid.R. 404(B) indicates that evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts may be admissible to prove consequential facts other than conforming conduct. The list of purposes set out is not exclusive or exhaustive. Neither do they constitute exceptions to the prohibitions in the prior sentence. They are merely illustrative of purposes for which extrinsic evidence may otherwise be offered to prove a fact other than propensity and conforming conduct when that fact is probative of the actor\u2019s mental state and relevant to the particular degree of culpability an offense involves. The burden is on the proponent of extrinsic act evidence to demonstrate that the relevancy of the extrinsic act does not pertain to character and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>conforming conduct. <em>State v. Skatzes, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 195, 2004-Ohio-6391, 819 N. E.2d 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">{\u00b6 87} Relying 'on Evid.R. 404(B), the state argues that evidence concerning defendant\u2019s treatment of other patients in a way similar to his treatment of the three named in the indictment was admissible to show \u201cintent, preparation, plan, knowledge and absence of mistake or accident.\u201d In support of its argument, the state contends that the evidence of defendant\u2019s treatment of other patients shows that the conduct alleged in the indictment was not a mistake, because his treatment of these other patients was the same, he never obtained records of prior medical treatment for any of his patients, and made no referrals of any of them. The state further contends that the testimony of its three experts was admissible in order to make those showings.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">{\u00b6 88} The state\u2019s argument relies on the very inferential pattern that Evid.R. 404(B) prohibits: proof of an extrinsic act that inferentially indicates a propensity that, in turn, inferentially indicates commission of an act that is part of the operative facts of the offenses alleged. Weissenberger, Section 404.21. Stated more simply, because he did it once, it is reasonable to find that he did it again. We necessarily reject the state\u2019s arguments. Nevertheless, we will consider the state\u2019s contentions that the other-act evidence concerned was admissible per Evid.R. 404(B) because it was probative of defendant\u2019s intent, preparation, plan, knowledge and absence of mistake or accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">{\u00b6 89} It is fundamental to any of the matters in Evid.R. 404(B) and R.C. 2945.59 that in order for other-act evidence to be admissible to prove it, the matter must be relevant to a question \u201cat issue\u201d in the litigation. <em>State v. Smith </em>(1992), 84 Ohio App.3d 647, 617 N.E.2d 1160. Because both the rule and statute codify an exception to the common law, they must be strictly construed against admissibility of other-act evidence. <em>State v. Burson </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St.2d 157, 67 O.O.2d 174, 311 N.E.2d 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">{\u00b6 90} To be admissible, the other-act evidence must tend to show by substantial proof one or more of the things the rule or statute enumerates. <em>State v. Broom </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 277, 533 N.E.2d 682. Such evidence is never admissible when its sole purpose is to establish that the defendant committed the act alleged in the indictment. <em>State v. Flonnory </em>(1972), 31 Ohio St.2d 124, 60 0.0.2d 95, 285 N.E.2d 726. Rather, the evidence must tend to prove one or more of the matters in Evid.R. 404(B), which in turn is itself relevant to prove the criminal offenses alleged. <em>State v. Crotts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">{\u00b6 91} Defendant testified that he believed that he had complied with all applicable regulations when prescribing OxyContin to his patients. That is evidence concerning defendant\u2019s state of mind, and extrinsic evidence is admissi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>ble to rebut it if the evidence might tend to prove that defendant understood the wrongful nature of his acts. For example, evidence that a prior, similar wrongful act on a defendant\u2019s part has been the subject of his arrest or conviction or prior law-enforcement encounters would be probative of his knowledge that his conduct was wrongful. <em>State v. Greer </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 139, 20 O.O.3d 157, 420 N.E.2d 982.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">{\u00b6 92} Evidence that defendant engaged in the same wrongful conduct when he treated other patients does not demonstrate that when he treated the patients the charges in the indictment involve, defendant acted in the knowledge that his conduct was wrongful. It merely proves prior, conforming conduct, and in that regard is inadmissible per Evid.R. 404(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">{\u00b6 93} Defendant did not claim that his alleged failure to act in accordance with applicable law was accidental. To the extent that his claim was one of a mistaken belief, which likewise involves his intent, evidence of the defendant\u2019s extrinsic acts is admissible to prove that defendant had on prior, similar occasions acted in accordance with law. Evidence that defendant had likewise failed to act in accordance with law on other, similar occasions is not probative that his alleged criminal conduct was the product of a mistake. It is merely proof of conforming conduct and prohibited by Evid.R. 404(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">{\u00b6 94} Defendant\u2019s identity was not in issue with respect to the charges alleged. His motive was in issue, and extrinsic act evidence concerning his financial difficulties was admissible to prove that he had a specific reason to commit the criminal acts charged. Evidence of his treatment of other patients was not probative of his motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">{\u00b6 95} Extrinsic evidence is admissible to prove a defendant\u2019s scheme, plan, or system when the evidence is probative of a sequence of events leading up to the crime charged or preparatory of the crime charged. Weissenberger, Section 404.28. Defendant\u2019s diagnosis and treatment of other patients preceded the crimes charged or were contemporaneous with those crimes. However, they were not a part of a sequence of events constituting a scheme, plan, or system to commit the crimes alleged. They were merely more of the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">{\u00b6 96} Nothing in the state\u2019s evidence concerning defendant\u2019s treatment of his other patients is probative of whether he failed to act in accordance with law when he committed the crimes alleged in the indictment, except that as evidence it demonstrates a propensity to commit the crimes charged because it portrays conforming conduct. Evidence is inadmissible for that purpose. Evid.R. 404(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">{\u00b6 97} The trial court abused its discretion when it admitted evidence of defendant\u2019s extrinsic acts in treating patients other than the three whose treatment forms the charges against defendant in the indictment. Unlike the issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>the affirmative defense instruction, which is confined to defendant\u2019s conviction for drug trafficking, R.C. 2925.03(A)(1), this error also goes to the charges for defendant\u2019s violation of R.C. 2925.23(A), illegal processing of drug documents, precluding conviction on the R.C. 2925.23(A) violations alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">{\u00b6 98} Defendant\u2019s assignment of error \u201cD\u201d is sustained. Having sustained defendant\u2019s assignments of error \u201cF\u201d and \u201cD,\u201d we will order defendant\u2019s convictions reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b93-7\">Wolff, P.J., and Fain, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
