And counsel even goes so far as to <em>redraft </em>their opponent\u2019s brief, inserting the jumble of letters and numbers into the paragraphs \u2014 even the references to the record. Thus bollixed up and unreadable, the brief comes out to 38.5 pages, instead of the regulation 35. Egad. And M &amp; M makes some other objections to the form of the insurers\u2019 brief, which we deem even more piddling.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-20\">{\u00b6 3} Our dreary day has been enlivened by the thought that lawyers care about one another\u2019s prose so much as to redraft it. And that this dispute is so close that it may turn on a few extra pages of a lawyer\u2019s argument. We can\u2019t wait to read the final version \u2014 or maybe we should wait for the movie.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>{\u00b6 4} As to citations, they <em>belong </em>in footnotes. Putting goofy letters and numbers in the middle of paragraphs destroys readability. We had to do that with typewriters, just as we had to use underlining because typewriters did not have italics. No more.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">{\u00b6 5} But M &amp; M\u2019s counsel makes one proper point: the insurers\u2019 brief uses talking footnotes interspersed with citation footnotes. Using talking footnotes detracts from the gain in readability achieved by taking the citations out of the text \u2014 if footnotes are not for citations only, then the brief declines into lawreviewesque unreadability.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">{\u00b6 6} The insurers respond to M &amp; M\u2019s motion by stating that, at least on most points, M <em>&amp; </em>M is nitpicking or flat-out mistaken. They even cite the first edition of this author\u2019s legal writing book (it is now in its third edition). And to clear up any possible problem, they have redrafted and resubmitted their brief \u2014 we now have <em>three </em>versions- \u2014 shortening it somehow but <em>not </em>taking out the talking footnotes \u2014 having read only part of the cited treatise. We note, though, that the insurers still use 12-point type for the footnotes. We would approve 10-point, which would make their brief even shorter.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">{\u00b6 7} We venture a guess that this court\u2019s eventual opinion resolving this dispute will be fewer than 20 pages. To both sides we suggest that less is usually more.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">{\u00b6 8} And because three judges of the appellate court have nothing better to do than referee a dispute about brief formatting, we hold as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">{\u00b6 9} (1) The insurers\u2019 redrafted brief (the one they redrafted, not the one M &amp; M redrafted for them) is substituted for their original one, not because we would have done so in any event, but because it is slightly easier to read, though we wish they had retired the talking footnotes;</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">{\u00b6 10} (2) Were the reply brief not already filed, we would hold that counsel for M &amp; M, obviously having free time on their hands, should use some to whittle down their reply brief to 11 pages rather than 15, as they have wasted 4 pages on this motion. But the reply brief is 10 pages, so the penalty is perhaps self-imposed; and</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">{\u00b6 11} (3) Now that the pleadings are complete, perhaps the case can be decided on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">So ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b184-12\">Gorman and Sundermann, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
