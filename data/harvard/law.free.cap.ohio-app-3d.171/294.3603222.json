Shaffer, appeals the January 23, 2006 judgment entry of the Stark County Court of Common Pleas entering judgment in favor of defendants-appellees Canton Christian Home and the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation pursuant to a jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">Statement of the Facts and Case</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">{\u00b6 2} On October 21, 2003, appellant worked as an employee of Canton Christian Home, Inc. During the course of her employment, appellant sustained an industrial injury, and the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation allowed appellant\u2019s claim for the conditions of sprain thoracic region, sprain lumbar region, and sprain of the neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant then filed a request to have her claim additionally allowed for the conditions of C5-6 and C6-7 disc herniations, aggravation of pre-existing T12-L1, L4-5, and L5-S1 disc herniations, and aggravation of pre-existing degenerative disc disease at T12-L1, L4-5, and L5-S1. On June 18, 2004, the district hearing officer issued an order allowing the further claims. Appellee Canton Christian Home filed an appeal from the district hearing officer\u2019s order. On August 5, 2004, the staff hearing officer issued an order denying the further allowances. Appellant appealed the staff hearing officer\u2019s order to the Industrial Commission of Ohio. On August 18, 2004, the Industrial Commission refused the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">{\u00b6 4} On June 3, 2005, appellant filed her complaint in the trial court to further participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund. The matter proceeded to a jury trial before Magistrate Dean Dahl by stipulation of the parties on January 12, 2006. The jury returned a verdict in favor of appellees. On January 23, 2006, the trial court entered judgment in appellees\u2019 favor pursuant to the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-13\">{\u00b6 5} Appellant now appeals, assigning as error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-14\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cI. The trial court erred by denying plaintiff/appellant the right to introduce medical testimony on her inability to function or work and her need for surgery to demonstrate how she aggravated her pre-existing conditions resulting from her industry injury on October 21, 2003.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>{\u00b6 7} In the single assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred in excluding evidence of appellant\u2019s medical inability to work and her need for surgery to demonstrate an aggravation of her pre-existing conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">{\u00b6 8} We are unpersuaded by appellant\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in not allowing the testimony relative to her need for surgery on her neck. The anticipated neck surgery at issue did not involve the conditions appellant now claims were aggravations. Rather, the surgery concerned only the two neck herniations that were claimed to be directly caused by the injury. Appellant\u2019s assignment of error does not reach the claims for new injury to her neck. Appellant did not introduce testimony relative to a need for surgery as to her aggravated back conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">{II9} Accordingly, we will proceed to address appellant\u2019s argument relative to the trial court\u2019s exclusion of evidence regarding her inability to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">{\u00b6 10} Aggravation of a pre-existing condition qualifies as an \u201cinjury\u201d under Ohio\u2019s workers compensation system. <em>Ackerman v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1936), 131 Ohio St. 371, 6 O.O. 85, 3 N.E.2d 44. An aggravation need not be \u201csubstantial\u201d to qualify an employee for coverage. <em>Schell v. Globe Trucking, Inc. </em>(1990), 48 Ohio St.3d 1, 548 N.E.2d 920. Rather, aggravation of the symptoms of the underlying pre-existing condition supports a claim for aggravation <em>of </em>the preexisting condition itself. <em>Gower v. Conrad </em>(2001), 146 Ohio App.3d 200, 765 N.E.2d 905. \u201c \u2018The key is whether the aggravation * * * had an impact on a person\u2019s bodily functions or affected an <em>individual\u2019s ability to function or work. \u2019 </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., quoting <em>Boroff v. McDonald\u2019s Restaurants of Ohio, Inc. </em>(1988), 46 Ohio App.3d 178, 181, 546 N.E.2d 457. Aggravation of a pre-existing condition can be demonstrated \u201c \u2018through either symptoms, (\u201cdebilitating effects\u201d), or physiological changes not due to the normal progression of the [condition].\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Hess v. United Ins. Co. of Am. </em>(1991), 74 Ohio App.3d 667, 679, 600 N.E.2d 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\"> {\u00b6 11} At trial, appellant introduced the deposition testimony of Dr. Mark R. Grubb. Dr. Grubb testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cQ. Doctor, at this point, I\u2019d like to ask you for your opinions and, first of all, ask in your opinion, Doctor, based on reasonable orthopedic certainty and probability do you believe that the herniations that you\u2019ve identified in the cervical spine were a result of Leona\u2019s industrial injury on October 21, 2003?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-10\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cFirst of all, do you have an opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-11\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cMr. Aronoff: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-12\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-13\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cQ. And what is your opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>{\u00b6 17} \u201cMr. Aronoff: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-4\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cA. They were causally related.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cQ. And secondly, Doctor, do you have an opinion, again, within reasonable orthopedic certainty and probability as to whether or not the herniations at the levels of T12-L1, L4-5, and L5-S1 were aggravated as a result of her industrial injury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cMr. Aronoff: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cQ. And what is your opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cMr. Aronoff: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-10\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cA. That they were, indeed, aggravated by the injury suffered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-11\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cQ. And what is the basis for your opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-12\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cMr. Aronoff: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-13\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cA. Basis of my opinion is primarily, predominantly the initial office visit including the history, physical examination, as well as review of the diagnostic tests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-14\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cQ. And is that the, also the basis for your early opinion on the herniations in the neck?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-15\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-16\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cQ. Do you have an opinion as to whether or not the degenerative disc disease that was identified in the MRI of the lumbosacral spine was aggravated as a result of the mechanism of injury leading up to her Workers\u2019 Comp, claim on October 21, 2003?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-17\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cMr. Aronoff: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-18\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-19\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cQ. And what is your opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-20\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cMr. Aronoff: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-21\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cA. That, indeed, the degenerative disc disease was aggravated by the work injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-22\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cQ. I want to show you what\u2019s been marked as Plaintiffs Exhibit 6 and ask you if, if those are disability statements that you wrote for Leona Shaffer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-23\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cMr. Aronoff: Objection. Move to strike anything to disability which isn\u2019t an issue in this lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-24\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cA. Okay. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>{\u00b6 39} \u201cQ. Are those? Okay. And do you \u2014 can you refer to \u2014 what period of time was she taken off work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-5\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cMr. Aronoff: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cA. From 10/21/03 to 2000 \u2014 February 1st, 2004.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cQ. And I believe there\u2019s a second page to that exhibit. Was the disability then extended to an estimated date of March 1, 2004?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">{V43}\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cMr. Aronoff: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-10\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cBy Mr. Tsangeos:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-11\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cQ. Is the fact that someone is temporarily disabled as a result of an injury, is that something that you take into consideration or a factor that you consider in rendering an opinion on whether or not someone has suffered either a pre-existing, an aggravation to a pre-existing herniation or an aggravation to preexisting degenerative disc disease?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-12\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cMr. Aronoff: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-13\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cA. I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not sure.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-14\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cQ. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-15\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cA. \u2014I\u2019m understanding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-16\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cQ. Let me try it a different way. If someone suffers an injury at work and then later is taken off work because they\u2019re unable to perform the same duties they were before, is that period of temporary disability something that you can \u2014 you take into consideration to determine whether or not they aggravated pre-existing conditions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-17\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cMr. Aronoff: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-18\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-19\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cQ. And how is that relevant or how is that important in determining whether or not somebody has aggravated either a pre-existing herniation or preexisting degenerative disc disease?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-20\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cMr. Aronoff: I\u2019ll just note a continuing objection to this line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-21\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cA. Well, predominantly that the symptoms have been raised to such a point that the patient is un, unable to perform their duties at work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-22\">{\u00b6 57} The following exchange then occurred at trial with regard to the testimony:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-23\">{-\u00b6 58} \u201cMr. Tsangeos: Thank you, Your Honor. The issue that the Court is addressing right now is whether or not Doctor Grubb can testify about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>claimant\u2019s inability to return to her former position of employment due to what he believes are the further allowed medical conditions in this claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cDoctor Grubb has testified is that you can aggravate preexisting degenerative disk disease. All the Doctors in this case have admitted that she had degenerative disk disease in her back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">{\u00b6 60} \u201cHowever, the testimony will be that that preexisting degenerative disk disease never stopped her from working, never prevented her from doing her job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until after this industrial injury that she is now unable to return to work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-8\">{\u00b6 62} \u201cSo something has happened between before this industrial injury and after that has prevented her from going back to work. It is not just the degenerative disk disease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-9\">{\u00b6 63} \u201cDoctor Grubb has testified that factors he considers to show aggravations of preexisting conditions are complaints of symptoms and the inability to return to her former position of employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-10\">{\u00b6 64} \u201cIf this Court is going to allow Doctor Grubb to testify to this jury that, yes, the fact that she can\u2019t go back to work is a factor that I take into consideration, then I don\u2019t see why the Doctor can\u2019t go one step further and say yes, as a matter of fact I found she has been unable to return to her former position of employment due to the aggravation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-11\">{\u00b6 65} \u201cSo I get the sense that the reason the Court is not going to do it is because it is relying on the fact it feels that this evidence is being presented to show extent of disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-12\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cThat\u2019s not why we are offering the evidence, and extent of disability relates to either a permanent-partial disability; and we are not presenting the evidence to show that, or evidence of being unable to return to work refers to collecting temporary-total compensation and we are not presenting the evidence in any way to suggest that she should be paid for the time she is off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-13\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cThat we understand falls within the purview of the Industrial Commission, but we are offering the evidence to show that she has had an aggravation to the extent that she can not go back to work and doing the things she had done before and the Doctors are disabling her for that reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-14\">{\u00b6 68} \u201cWhile we are on it, the Doctors will also testify to surgery; and the Court has also ruled that we can\u2019t mention surgery as part of this case, but the Doctors have also said that changes in treatment will also be a factor that can be taken into consideration when determining aggravations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-15\">{\u00b6 69} \u201cI would just like to note an exception to the court\u2019s ruling and preserve my right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>{\u00b6 70} \u201cThe Court: Mr. Aronoff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">{\u00b6 71} \u201cMr. Aronoff: The Court has already ruled. We have already discussed it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">{\u00b6 72} \u201cThe fact of the matter is that you know, the treatment this person may or may not have is not relevant to this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\">{\u00b6 73} \u201cThe Court: Again to the extent that the argument shows extent of injury, I am sustaining the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">{\u00b6 74} \u201cHowever, to the extent that it shows that it is a matter that the Doctor used in determining his diagnosis, objection overruled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">{\u00b6 75} The trial court sustained appellees\u2019 objections in the deposition transcript excluding Dr. Grubb\u2019s testimony relative to appellant\u2019s inability to return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">{\u00b6 76} Appellant argues the trial court erred in excluding the testimony as the evidence is a factor in determining whether she suffered an aggravation of her pre-existing herniation or degenerative disc disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">{\u00b6 77} R.C. 4123.512 divests the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction relative to an appeal on the issue of extent of disability. However, appellant did not appeal the issue of extent of disability. Rather, appellant sought to introduce evidence relative to her symptoms, treatment, and inability to work related to aggravation of the injury sustained on October 21, 2003. Therefore, the evidence is relevant and probative on the issue of whether appellant aggravated her preexisting conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">{\u00b6 78} Appellant also introduced the testimony of Dr. Stan Anderson, her family practice physician. Dr. Anderson testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-13\">{\u00b6 79} \u201cQ. Can someone aggravate preexisting degenerative disk disease?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-14\">{\u00b6 80} \u201cA. Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-15\">{\u00b6 81} \u201cQ. What factors do you look at to determine whether or not a patient has aggravated or worsened their preexisting herniations or degenerative disk disease?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-16\">{\u00b6 82} \u201cA. You look at symptoms. Again let me give another analogy. I am going to use an analogy of a spur because in a sense arthritis and spurs are somewhat similar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-17\">{\u00b6 83} \u201cBut if you have a heel spur and that spur on your heel really bothers you so every time you put your foot down you get that horrible pain right on the heel, the treatment for it is to try to rest the heel, to try to give it some ice, to try to get the inflammatory response to go down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>{\u00b6 84} \u201cSo that when somebody has a heel spur, it is the resolution of symptoms, not the resolution of the spur that indicates success.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">{\u00b6 85} \u201cSo that when a person who has a spur, whether it is on the spine or whether it is in the heel, ends up feeling better, we don\u2019t say, oh, your degenerative arthritis went away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">{\u00b6 86} \u201cWhat we say is, is that the inflammation that is associated with the abnormality has cleared so that way in which we try to approach this is we try to approach it to say what do we need to do to decrease the inflammation to decrease symptoms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">{\u00b6 87} \u201cQ. Do you look at any other factors besides symptoms to determine if there has been an aggravation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">{\u00b6 88} \u201cA. Symptoms are the critical thing. Obviously if somebody has no symptoms but they have no use, so symptom is I am telling you. A sign is a physical examination component.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-9\">{\u00b6 89} \u201cSo we look at, in medicine we call it symptoms and signs or signs and symptoms. So the sign would be any testing that is done in the office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-10\">{\u00b6 90} \u201cSo the answer is you look at the history, what they are telling you, then you look at the testing, what have I been able to find based on my examination. What about changes in treatment, can that be a factor to determine that somebody has suffered an aggravation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-11\">{\u00b6 91} \u201cMr. Aronoff: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-12\">{\u00b6 92} \u201cThe Court: Overruled. I believe we know the parameters that we are dealing with here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-13\">{\u00b6 93} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-14\">{\u00b6 94} \u201cQ. Have you seen Leona professionally, say, over the last year?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-15\">{\u00b6 95} \u201cA. Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-16\">{\u00b6 96} \u201cQ. Is she still having pain and problems in her upper extremity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-17\">{\u00b6 97} \u201cA. Definitely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-18\">{\u00b6 98} \u201cQ. Still having problems with the neck?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-19\">{\u00b6 99} \u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-20\">{\u00b6 100} \u201cQ. Is she still having pain and problems with her low back and complaints of pain going down the leg?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-21\">{\u00b6 101} \u201cA. It is so intense for her that she has described for me that she is unable to lift up grandchildren. She is having a hard time doing normal functions. Her symptoms are completely explained best by herniated disks and joint and degenerative disk disease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>{\u00b6 102} \u201cQ. But you told us, Doctor, haven\u2019t you, that she had this degenerative disk disease and she had herniation back in 1996, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\">{\u00b6 103} \u201cA. Right; yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">{\u00b6 104} \u201cQ. As far as you were aware, was she still able to continue to work and do her job functions from \u201996 up to the date of her injury on October 21 of 2003?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">{\u00b6 105} \u201cA. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">{\u00b6 106} \u201cQ. Is she able to go back to work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\">{\u00b6 107} \u201cA. No, no. Any lifting causes her incredibly intense pain.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">{\u00b6 108} Dr. Anderson then opined appellant\u2019s symptoms were caused by an aggravation of her pre-existing conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">{\u00b6 109} Dr. Anderson\u2019s testimony did not specifically state that he considered her inability to work as a factor in determining whether she aggravated her preexisting underlying condition. Appellees cite appellant\u2019s own testimony relative to her inability to work. However, we find there is a significant difference between appellant\u2019s fact testimony as a lay witness and that of a medical expert offering expert opinion as to symptoms or signs used in diagnosing whether there has been an aggravation of pre-existing conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">{\u00b6 110} Upon review of the record, we find that appellant was materially prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s exclusion of Dr. Grubb\u2019s testimony relative to appellant\u2019s inability to work as a consideration in formulating his expert opinion that appellant had suffered an aggravation of her pre-existing condition. Appellant experienced symptoms consistent with an aggravation of her pre-existing condition. The symptoms impacted her ability to work, which should have been considered by the jury in determining whether appellant suffered an aggravation of her pre-existing conditions.
