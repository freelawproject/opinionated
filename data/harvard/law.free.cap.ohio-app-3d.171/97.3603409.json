Nevins III was convicted of one count of felonious assault with a firearm specification after a jury trial in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas. The charges stemmed from the shooting of Cory Pettis at the corner of McCabe Avenue and Wexford Place in Dayton during the afternoon of April 29, 2005. Nevins was apparently seeking retribution for an attack on Wendell Carter that had occurred a short time earlier. Pettis was not involved in the attack on Carter, and he was returning from shopping for items for his daughter\u2019s birthday party when he was assaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-14\">{\u00b6 2} A jury trial was held on October 25, 26, and 28, 2005, during which the state presented six witnesses. Pettis did not appear to testify. After a hearing, the court found that Pettis was unavailable under Evid.R. 804(A)(5), and it admitted, through another witness, Pettis\u2019s preliminary-hearing testimony and his identification of Nevins from a photo spread. At the conclusion of the trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>the jury found Nevins guilty of felonious assault and the firearm specification. The court sentenced Nevins to eight years of incarceration for the felonious assault with an additional three years of actual incarceration for the firearm specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">{\u00b6 3} Nevins appeals from his conviction, raising three assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">{\u00b6 4} I. \u201cThe trial court committed reversible error in its determination that witness Cory Pettis was unavailable to testify at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">{\u00b6 5} In his first assignment of error, Nevins claims that the trial court erred in ruling that Pettis was unavailable to testify at trial. He claims that as a result, the court erroneously allowed Pettis\u2019s preliminary-hearing testimony to be read into the record by Detective DeBorde.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">{\u00b6 6} Decisions regarding the admissibility of evidence at trial are within the broad discretion of the trial court and will be upheld absent an abuse of discretion and material prejudice. <em>State v. Noling, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 44, 2002-Ohio-7044, 781 N.E.2d 88, \u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">{\u00b6 7} A declarant must be unavailable to testify in order for the declarant\u2019s hearsay statements to be admissible. <em>Barber v. Page </em>(1968), 390 U.S. 719, 722, 88 S.Ct. 1318, 20 L.Ed.2d 255; <em>Ohio v. Roberts </em>(1980), 448 U.S. 56, 65, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2538, 65 L.Ed.2d 597. Under Evid.R. 804(A)(5), a witness is unavailable if he \u201cis absent from the hearing and the proponent of the declarant\u2019s statement has been unable to procure the declarant\u2019s attendance (or in the case of a hearsay exception under division (B)(2), (3), or (4) of this rule, the declarant\u2019s attendance or testimony) by process or other reasonable means.\u201d \u201cA witness is not considered unavailable unless the prosecution has made reasonable efforts in good faith to secure his presence at trial.\u201d <em>State v. Keairns </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St.3d 228, 230, 9 OBR 569, 460 N.E.2d 245; <em>Barber, </em>390 U.S. at 724-725, 88 S.Ct. 1318, 20 L.Ed.2d 255. The burden of proving unavailability is on the state. <em>State v. Smith </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 344, 348, 12 O.O.3d 313, 390 N.E.2d 778; <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 74-75, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">{\u00b6 8} Pettis testified at the preliminary hearing and was cooperative with the prosecutor\u2019s office prior to trial. However, immediately before trial was to begin, the prosecutor informed the court in chambers that he had not been able to contact Pettis. The prosecutor stated that Pettis and his wife, Dealiger Pettis (\u201cDealiger\u201d), had been residentially served with a letter and subpoena and that they had come to the prosecutor\u2019s office as scheduled for the pretrial conference. Pettis had indicated at that time that he had been offered $1,500 not to testify but that he wished to go forward with the case. A couple of days later, the prosecutor had spoken with Dealiger and told her that he would arrange transportation for trial. The prosecutor had not been in contact with Pettis since, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>and he stated that he sent detectives and two investigators from the prosecutor\u2019s office to look for Pettis. The prosecutor represented to the court that Detective Michael Galbraith had made contact with Dealiger and that she said that someone had come by and offered more money to Pettis not to testify. The prosecutor indicated that a material witness warrant and a continuance might be necessary if Pettis did not appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">{\u00b6 9} The trial began on October 25, 2005, as scheduled. At 3:42 p.m. that day, the state called Dealiger to testify. Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, the state asked Dealiger whether Pettis had been subpoenaed, and she responded that he had. Dealiger testified that Pettis was gone when she woke up and that she had not seen him that morning. She further stated that she had been trying to call and find her husband all day but that she had not been able to find him. Over defense counsel\u2019s continued objections, Dealiger further stated that someone who had been watching the trial had stopped by her house a few days prior to the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">{\u00b6 10} The next day, the state called Detective Michael DeBorde to testify about his investigation of the assault. After defense counsel objected to De-Borde\u2019s testifying to Pettis\u2019s identification of Nevins in a photo spread, the court held a hearing on whether Pettis was an unavailable witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">{\u00b6 11} At the unavailability hearing on October 26, 2005, Sherri Peterson, the docket secretary for the prosecutor\u2019s office, testified that on October 12, 2005, she sent Pettis and Dealiger a pretrial letter informing them of a pretrial conference on October 19, 2005, and that they were required to appear for trial at 9:00 a.m. on October 25, 2005. Peterson prepared subpoenas for Pettis and Dealiger, and she included a copy of the unfiled subpoenas in the pretrial letter. Peterson sent the letter to 630 Groveland Avenue, Dayton, Ohio, the Pettises\u2019 address. The subpoenas were then sent to the clerk of court\u2019s office to be filed and served. The court\u2019s docket confirmed that subpoenas for Pettis and Dealiger were filed and issued on October 12, 2005, and it indicated that Dealiger was served on October 17, 2005. The court took judicial notice that there was no return of service for Pettis.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">{\u00b6 12} Regina Hankins, the victim advocate for this case, testified that she met with Pettis and Dealiger on October 19, 2005. During their meeting, Pettis and Dealiger stated to her that they had been subpoenaed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">{\u00b6 13} Detective Michael Galbraith testified that at approximately 9:00 a.m. on October 25, 2005, Detective Michael DeBorde asked him to attempt to locate Pettis. Galbraith and Detective Daryl Smith drove to Haber and McCabe and walked from there toward Pettis\u2019s apartment. As they were walking to the apartment, the detectives were \u201cflagged down\u201d by Dealiger. When the detectives asked her whether her husband was at the house, Dealiger responded that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>had not seen him since she had gotten up that morning, that she had no idea where he was, and that she was out looking for him, too. The officers returned to the Pettises\u2019 home with Dealiger. The detectives searched the kitchen and living room area of the home but did not go upstairs. Galbraith asked the Pettises\u2019 children, who were coming down the stairs, whether their father was home, and they responded that he was not. Dealiger told the detectives that she noticed that he was gone when she woke up and was concerned that he was not going to make it to the trial, so she looked at various apartments in the neighborhood where she thought he might be. Dealiger repeated that she had not been able to locate Pettis. Dealiger also mentioned that Pettis had been offered $2,000 to $3,000 not to testify. Galbraith gave Dealiger his business card and telephone number and asked her to call him if she had any contact with Pettis or if she learned where he might be located. Dealiger did not contact him. Galbraith testified that he searched for Pettis between 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">{\u00b6 14} In addition to the above testimony, the trial court considered the testimony that Dealiger had given during the state\u2019s case-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">{\u00b6 15} At the conclusion of the hearing testimony, the state represented to the court that an investigator from the prosecutor\u2019s office had driven around with Dealiger in an attempt to locate Pettis, but the state was unable to reach him and get him to the court in time for the hearing. The trial court responded, \u201cWe\u2019re fine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">{\u00b6 16} Based on the evidence presented, the court concluded that Pettis had been subpoenaed, that he had made himself unavailable, and that the state had made reasonable efforts to locate him.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">{\u00b6 17} On appeal, Nevins asserts that the court\u2019s finding that Pettis was unavailable was erroneous for three reasons. First, he argues that the state did not make a good-faith effort to secure Pettis\u2019s appearance at trial, because no subpoena was served. Second, he claims that the state failed to make reasonable efforts to locate him. Third, Nevins argues that the court improperly relied upon Dealiger\u2019s testimony during the state\u2019s case-in-chief because no motion for a determination of unavailability had been filed at the time of her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">{\u00b6 18} Upon review, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that Pettis was unavailable. Both Dealiger and Hankins testified that Pettis acknowledged that he had received the subpoena. Although the court\u2019s docket did not include a return of service of the subpoena, Dealiger\u2019s and Hankins\u2019s testimony reasonably established that he received it. Although it is possible that Pettis received only the prosecutor\u2019s courtesy copy of the unfiled subpoena, the evidence does not require that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>{\u00b6 19} Moreover, the trial court did not err in considering Dealiger\u2019s testimony that her husband received a subpoena in ruling on his unavailability. That testimony was offered under oath during the state\u2019s case-in-chief after the trial court ruled that an explanation for Pettis\u2019s absence was relevant. Although neither party had formally requested a hearing on Pettis\u2019s unavailability at that time, Nevins was aware that Pettis\u2019s absence and the existence of a subpoena had been placed at issue. Nevins had an opportunity to cross-examine her on that issue when she testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">{\u00b6 20} Finally, the trial court reasonably concluded that the state made a reasonable, good faith effort to locate Pettis. The state sent a detective to Pettis\u2019s residence to locate him, and the detectives investigated whether he was there. The detectives were informed by Pettis\u2019s wife that she had checked several addresses in the neighborhood where she thought Pettis might be and that she could not find him. Detective Galbraith provided her information on how to contact him if she had other ideas of where to look or if she came into contact with him. Based on Galbraith\u2019s testimony, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that in the absence of any additional guidance on where to look, the officer\u2019s actions constituted a reasonable effort to locate Pettis.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">{\u00b6 21} The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">{\u00b6 22} II. \u201cThe trial court committed reversible error in allowing a prior out-of-court statement by Corey Pettis to be admitted as evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">{\u00b6 23} In his second assignment of error, Nevins claims that the trial court erred in permitting Detective DeBorde to testify that Pettis had identified Nevins in a photo spread. The trial court found that the testimony was admissible under Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">{\u00b6 24} Evid.R. 801(C) defines \u201chearsay\u201d as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d \u201cStatement\u201d includes an oral or written assertion and a person\u2019s nonverbal conduct if it is intended by him as an assertion. Evid.R. 801(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">{\u00b6 25} Pettis identified Nevins from the photo array that DeBorde showed to him. DeBorde testified that Pettis placed his initials above photo number four, wrote the number four down in the bottom right corner of the photo array, and signed the photo array. DeBorde testified that Pettis \u201cidentified Mr. Nevins in that picture\u201d and that Nevins was photo number four.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">{\u00b6 26} By placing his initials above photo number four and writing that number below, Pettis made an out-of-court statement, which was then offered through DeBorde to establish that Nevins was Pettis\u2019s assailant. Although Pettis\u2019s identification was not made orally, DeBorde\u2019s testimony of Pettis\u2019s identification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>is hearsay. As stated as an example in Binder, Hearsay Handbook (4th Ed.2001), Section 1:2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-4\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c[A] witness to a crime may be asked by the police to pick out the culprit from a lineup. The witness may say, \u2018The man on the left did it.\u2019 Or the witness may designate the man on the left on a written form. Or the witness may silently point to the man. In any one of these cases, the witness has made an assertion. If at trial a policeman relates what he observed the witness say or do at the lineup to identify the culprit, the testimony of the policeman is hearsay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">{\u00b6 28} Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c), which concerns prior identifications by a witness, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cA statement is not hearsay if * * * [t]he declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is * * * (c) one of identification of a person soon after perceiving him, if the circumstances demonstrate the reliability of the prior identification.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">{\u00b6 30} As the rule makes clear, \u201c[i]dentification testimony is not admissible per Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c) unless the person who made the out-of-court identification testifies at trial and is subject to cross-examination.\u201d <em>State v. White, </em>Montgomery App. No. 20324, 2005-Ohio-212, 2005 WL 120059, \u00b6 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">{\u00b6 31} In the present case, Pettis did not appear to testify at trial, and, consequently, he was not subject to cross-examination at trial on his selection of Nevins from the second photo array. Accordingly, Pettis\u2019s identification of Nevins did not fall within Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c), and it was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">(\u00b6 32} The state argues that Pettis\u2019s absence from the trial was not fatal to the admissibility of his prior identification for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">{\u00b6 33} First, the state argues that Pettis\u2019s prior identification was constitutionally admissible because Pettis testified about his photographic identification of Nevins and was cross-examined on that issue at the preliminary hearing. The state thus argues that Pettis\u2019s prior identification satisfies the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">{\u00b6 34} In <em>Roberts, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that hearsay testimony of an unavailable witness was admissible if it bore \u201csufficient indicia of reliability.\u201d 448 U.S. at 66,100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597. In <em>Roberts, </em>the court found that the absent witness\u2019s preliminary-hearing testimony bore sufficient indicia of reliability because defense counsel had an adequate opportunity to cross-examine the witness at the preliminary hearing, counsel availed himself of that opportunity, and the transcript afforded the trier of fact sufficient basis for evaluating the truth of the witness\u2019s prior statement. Id. at 73,100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>{\u00b6 35} In <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004), 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, the Supreme Court rejected the practice of allowing the use of an unavailable witness\u2019s out-of-court statement if it had sufficient indicia of reliability, reasoning that the practice violated the accused\u2019s right to confront the witnesses against him. <em>Crawford </em>held that a testimonial statement from a witness who does not appear at trial is inadmissible against the accused unless the witness is unavailable to testify and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the witness. Id. at 59, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. Thus, when the state wishes to offer the statements of an unavailable declarant, the pivotal questions are whether the hearsay statements in question are properly characterized as testimonial and, if so, whether the accused had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">{\u00b6 36} The Ohio Rules of Evidence require an additional layer of analysis. Because testimony may be admissible under the Confrontation Clause yet inadmissible under the rules of evidence, and vice versa, see <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, the declarant\u2019s statements must fall within the constitutional requirements <em>and </em>the rules of evidence to be admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">{\u00b6 37} The state correctly notes that Pettis was cross-examined at the preliminary hearing regarding his identification of his shooter. He testified that he was asked to identify the shooter by photographic line-up on two occasions. Pettis indicated that he gave a description of the shooter\u2019s face, of the weapon, and of the shooter\u2019s car to the police. Pettis did not identify anyone in the first photo line-up. Over the next two weeks, Pettis heard rumors about who may have been involved. The police prepared a second photo array. Pettis testified that was \u201cable to pick someone\u201d out of the second photo line-up immediately. During his preliminary-hearing testimony, Pettis did not identify Nevins as the person whom he had selected from the line-up.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">{\u00b6 38} We agree with the state that Pettis\u2019s preliminary-hearing testimony was constitutionally admissible under <em>Crawford. </em>We likewise agree that Pettis\u2019s identification of Nevins during the photo line-up was admissible under the Confrontation Clause, because Pettis was unavailable, his statement to DeBorde was testimonial, and Nevins had an adequate opportunity to cross-examine Pettis at the preliminary hearing on the circumstances of his identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">{\u00b6 39} However, although Pettis testified at the preliminary hearing that he selected \u201csomeone\u201d from the photo line-up, Pettis did not, at that time, specifically identify Nevins as his shooter, either by reiterating his prior identification from the photo array or by identifying him at the hearing itself. Accordingly, DeBorde\u2019s testimony that Pettis identified Nevins from the photo array exceeded the scope of Pettis\u2019s preliminary-hearing testimony, and it was not admissible under Evid.R. 804(B)(1) as former testimony. The state cannot bootstrap <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>DeBorde\u2019s testimony that Pettis identified Nevins to Pettis\u2019s prior testimony describing the circumstances of his identification of his assailant but without making an identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">(\u00b6 40} Second, the state claims that Pettis\u2019s statement to DeBorde was admissible as corroborative evidence under <em>State v. Lancaster </em>(1971), 25 Ohio St.2d 83, 54 O.O.2d 222, 267 N.E.2d 291, paragraph five of the syllabus. In <em>Lancaster, </em>the Supreme Court held: \u201cPrior identification of the accused may be shown by the testimony of the identifier, or by the testimony of a third person to whom or in whose presence the identification was made, where the identifier has testified and is available for cross-examination, not as original, independent or substantive proof of the identity of the accused as the guilty party, but as corroboration of the testimony of the identifying witness as to the identity of the accused.\u201d Id. The <em>Lancaster </em>rule has been modified by Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c), which does not require the testifying witness to identify the accused at trial. <em>State v. Anderson </em>(Mar. 23, 1994), Montgomery App. No. 13003, 1994 WL 95228.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">{\u00b6 41} In this case, although DeBorde\u2019s testimony corroborated Pettis\u2019s prior testimony regarding the photo arrays, it did not reiterate prior trial testimony by Pettis as to the identity of his assailant, because no prior testimony identifying Nevins existed. Contrast <em>In re Hart </em>(Mar. 8, 2002), Montgomery App. No. 18801, 2002 WL 360648. DeBorde\u2019s testimony that Pettis identified Nevins was the only evidence that Nevins was Pettis\u2019s assailant, and it was inadmissible under <em>Lancaster </em>and Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">{\u00b6 42} Third, the state claims that a \u201creasonable view of the evidence indicates that [Pettis\u2019s] unavailability was due to wrongdoing on the part of Nevins.\u201d Under Evid.R. 804(B)(6), a statement by an unavailable witness is admissible against a party if \u201cthe unavailability of the witness is due to the wrongdoing of the party for the purpose of preventing the witness from attending or testifying.\u201d Evid.R. 804(B)(6) further provides: \u201cHowever, a statement is not admissible under this rule unless the proponent has given to each adverse party advance written notice of an intention to introduce the statement sufficient to provide the adverse party a fair opportunity to contest the admissibility of the statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">{\u00b6 43} Although acknowledging that it did not \u201cstrictly comply with the rule\u2019s requirement to provide advance written notice,\u201d the state asserts that it gave sufficient notice to Nevins to provide him a fair opportunity to contest the admissibility of the photo identification. The state notes that Nevins knew of Pettis\u2019s unavailability on the first day of trial and that DeBorde did not testify until the second day of trial. Although Pettis\u2019s potential unavailability was raised during the first day of trial and there was evidence through the testimony of Galbraith and Dealiger that Pettis had been offered money not to testify, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>state failed to comply with the requirements of Evid.R. 804(B)(6). The state did not ask for a determination of Pettis\u2019s unavailability before DeBorde\u2019s testimony on Pettis\u2019s photo identification of Nevins, and the state argued that the identification was admissible under Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">{\u00b6 44} Finally, we find that the admission of DeBorde\u2019s reiteration of Pettis\u2019s identification of Nevins was prejudicial. The identity of Pettis\u2019s assailant was a central issue in the case, and the only additional evidence that Nevins was the assailant was a weak inference that associated him with an \u201cEbony\u201d whose boyfriend was identified by unknown persons when the shooting occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">{\u00b6 45} The second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">{\u00b6 46} III. \u201cThe trial court committed reversible error in allowing testimony by corrections officer Jeffrey Vest on records of people who had visited defendant in jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">{\u00b6 47} In his third assignment of error, Nevins claims that the trial court erred in permitting the testimony of Jeffrey Vest, a corrections officer with the Montgomery County Sheriffs Office who worked in the Jail Records Division. Vest testified that jail visitation records showed that Ebony Perkins visited Nevins at the Montgomery County Jail on several occasions. Nevins argues that Vest\u2019s testimony had minimal probative value and was highly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">{\u00b6 48} During the state\u2019s case, Robin Garrett, a witness to the assault, testified that she was at a house on Groveland Avenue when the shooting occurred. She testified that there were several people around, including a crowd behind her. Garrett testified that she did not know who was \u201cdoing the shooting over there\u201d until the crowd started to say his name. Garrett heard people in the crowd yell, \u201cThat\u2019s Pooh. That\u2019s Ebony baby Daddy.\u201d Garrett interpreted the statement to mean that Pooh was the boyfriend of a girl named Ebony. Garrett did not know Pooh, but indicated that she had a neighbor named Ebony Perkins. Vest subsequently testified that computerized jail visitation records revealed that Ebony Perkins visited Nevins in jail on several occasions. Nevins objected to Vest\u2019s testimony on the grounds that it prejudicially revealed that he was incarcerated and that it was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">{\u00b6 49} Evidence is relevant when it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Evid.R. 401. Relevant evidence must be excluded under Evid. R. 403(A), however, \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.\u201d \u201c[Djespite the mandatory terms of Evid.R. 403(A), when considering evidence under that rule, the trial court is vested with broad discretion and an appellate court should not interfere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>absent a clear abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Harding, </em>Montgomery App. No. 20801, 2006-Ohio-481, 2006 WL 267323, at \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">{\u00b6 50} Nevins asserts that Vest\u2019s evidence was highly prejudicial because it informed the jury that he was incarcerated prior to trial. We disagree. Dayton police officer Mark Ponichtera had previously testified, without objection, that he arrested Nevins at 1606 Bancroft Street. Vest\u2019s testimony merely relayed that Nevins received several visitors in jail after his arrest. As stated in <em>State v. Hamilton </em>(Apr. 18, 1985) Cuyahoga App. No. 48945, 1985 WL 7984: \u201cSurely a jury is not naive and does realize the jail is a part of the criminal justice system. Visiting a defendant in jail is not in and of itself a prejudicial statement under these circumstances. The question posed by the prosecutor could have just as well evoked sympathy for the defendant.\u201d The fact that Nevins received several visits from Perkins after his arrest was not overly prejudicial, and the court did not err on this basis. We further disagree with Nevins that Vest\u2019s evidence was irrelevant. The inference that Nevins is Pooh based solely on Perkins\u2019s visits to Nevins in jail is not a strong one. However, we do not find that the evidence is irrelevant or created a danger that the jury would be misled or confused. The jury could evaluate for itself whether Vest\u2019s and Garrett\u2019s testimony supported an inference that Nevins is Pooh and, thus, the shooter. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it permitted Vest\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">{\u00b6 51} The third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">{\u00b6 52} The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b146-9\">Fain and Walters, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b146-10\">Judge Sumner E.
