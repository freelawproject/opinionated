Lindman, appeals the May 30, 2006 judgment entry entered by the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division, which approved and adopted the magistrate\u2019s December 28, 2005 decision. Defendant-appellee is Leslie Geissler, formerly known as Lind-man.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant and appellee were married in 1989. Four children were born as issue of the marriage, to wit: Irena, born December 18, 1987, Erik, born November 13, 1989, Bruce Jr., born September 27, 1991, and Alexander, born June 8, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">{\u00b6 3} On June 16, 1995, appellant filed a complaint for divorce in the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division. The trial court filed a judgment entry/decree of divorce on November 3, 1995. Pursuant to the decree, appellant was designated the residential parent and legal custodian of the children during specified times, and appellee was designated the residential parent and legal custodian at all other times. Appellant was ordered to pay appellee child support in the amount of $915 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">{\u00b6 4} On May 28, 2003, appellee filed a motion for modification of the shared-parenting plan, the establishment of child support, and a clarification of child-care payment. Therein, appellee alleged that at the time the parties had entered into a shared-parenting plan in 1997, appellant was paying her $1,200 per month as \u201creasonable child care\u201d for the parties\u2019 children, and since that time, appellant had reduced the payment to $600 per month, claiming that the older children did not need child care. Appellant subsequently filed a motion for child support. The magistrate conducted a hearing on the motions on December 1, 2003. By a decision filed January 7, 2004, the magistrate modified the parties\u2019 companionship schedule and ordered appellant to pay child support to appellee in the amount of $900 per month, which was a deviation from the guidelines based upon the significant amount of time appellant had companionship with the children. Appellant filed timely objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. By a judgment entry filed August 20, 2004, the trial court overruled appellant\u2019s objections and approved and adopted the magistrate\u2019s January 7, 2004 decision as the order of the court. Appellant appealed to this court, asserting: \u201cThe trial court erred when it failed to designate [appellee] as the obligor and [appellant] as the obligee on the child support worksheet.\u201d This court sustained the assignment of error, finding: \u201cPursuant to R.C. 3119.07(A), appellant, therefore, should have been designated the obligee and appellee the obligor on the child support worksheet.\u201d <em>Lindman </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number><em>v. Lindman, </em>Delaware App. No. 04CAF09065, 2005-Ohio-4708, 2005 WL 2174617, \u00b6 32. We reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">{\u00b6 5} Based upon this court\u2019s remand, appellant filed a motion for cancellation of child-support order on September 9, 2005. Appellee filed a complaint for change of custody, a deviation on child support, and/or an amendment to the shared-parenting plan on October 7, 2005. Thereafter, appellant filed a motion for contempt and a restraining order, asserting that appellee continued to interfere with the companionship schedule and made threats of violence against him. The magistrate conducted a hearing on December 9, 2005. By a decision filed December 28, 2005, the magistrate found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-6\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe parties entered into a Shared Parenting Plan that designates the Father as the \u2018sole residential parent,\u2019 even though under the Ohio Revised Code neither parent in a shared parenting plan is to be designated at [sic] the \u2018sole residential parent.\u2019 Accordingly, the plan is amended so that the Plaintiff-Father is the residential parent for school placement purposes. The Father shall be the residential parent during those times that the children are with him, and the Mother shall be the residential parent during those times that the children are with her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-7\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cChild support payments previously ordered to be paid by the Plaintiff-Father shall continue at the rate previously ordered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-9\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-10\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe Plaintiff-Father\u2019s Motion for a finding of Contempt of court and for a Restraining Order is hereby denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-11\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-12\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe foregoing orders are supported in part by significant changes in the family\u2019s circumstances, including the threatened withdrawal of the time the children spend with their Mother after the school day ends and financial hardships in the home of the Mother. The foregoing orders are necessary to protect the best interests of all of the children involved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-13\">{\u00b6 13} The magistrate issued findings of fact and conclusions of law on April 4, 2006. Appellant filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision and supplemental objections to the findings of fact and conclusions of law. By a judgment entry filed May 30, 2006, the trial court overruled and/or denied all of appellant\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-14\">{\u00b6 14} It is from this judgment entry that appellant appeals, raising the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>{\u00b6 15} \u201cI. The trial court erred when it failed to act upon the appeals court\u2019s mandate that the father be designated the obligee and the mother be designated the obligor on the child support worksheet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cII. The trial court erred in failing to deny the defendant mother\u2019s complaint for change of custody, deviation on child support, and/or amendment to the shared parenting plan, on the grounds that no change in circumstances had occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cIII. The trial court erred designating the plaintiff mother the obligee on the child support worksheet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-7\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cIV. The trial court erred in modifying the shared parenting arrangement to grant co-residential status to the mother and remove the father as the sole residential parent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-8\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cV. The trial court erred in failing to hold the defendant mother in contempt for willfully and repeatedly violating the companionship rights of the father, and for threatening the life of the father.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">{\u00b6 20} In his first assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred in failing to act upon this court\u2019s remand order to designate appellant as the obligee and appellee as the obligor on the child support worksheet. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">{\u00b6 21} This court previously ruled on the legal question as to which party should be designated the obligee and which party should be designated the obligor, reversing the trial court\u2019s original designation of appellee as the obligee and appellant as the obligor. The doctrine of the law of the case mandates that lower courts must apply the law as determined by appellate courts on \u201clegal questions involved for all subsequent proceedings at both the trial and reviewing levels.\u201d <em>Nolan v. Nolan </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 1, 11 OBR 1, 462 N.E.2d 410. The doctrine of the law of the case is applicable herein to the extent that the trial court must designate appellant as the obligee and appellee as the obligor through the period prior to the magistrate\u2019s conducting the hearing on December 9, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">{\u00b6 22} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b692-14\">{\u00b6 23} In his second assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred in granting appellee\u2019s complaint for change of custody, deviation on child support, and/or amendment to the shared-parenting plan. Specifically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>appellant argues that there was no change in circumstance significant enough to require a modification of the parties\u2019 existing shared parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">{\u00b6 24} R.C. 3109.04 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(E)(1)(a) The court shall not modify a prior decree allocating parental rights and responsibilities for the care of children unless it finds, based on facts that have arisen since the prior decree or that were unknown to the court at the time of the prior decree, that a change has occurred in the circumstances of the child, the child\u2019s residential parent, or either of the parents subject to a shared parenting decree, and that the modification is necessary to serve the best interest of the child. In applying these standards, the court shall retain the residential parent designated by the prior decree or the prior shared parenting decree, unless a modification is in the best interest of the child and one of the following applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-7\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c(i) The residential parent agrees to a change in the residential parent or both parents under a shared parenting decree agree to a change in the designation of residential parent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-8\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c(ii) The child, with the consent of the residential parent or of both parents under a shared parenting decree, has been integrated into the family of the person seeking to become the residential parent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-9\">{\u00b628} \u201c(iii) The harm likely to be caused by a change of environment is outweighed by the advantages of the change of environment to the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">{\u00b6 29} Before we analyze whether a change in circumstance warranting a modification occurred, we must review the provision in the parties\u2019 shared-parenting plan to determine whether the parties\u2019 agreement allowed for a deviation without meeting the statutory requirements. The shared-parenting plan provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-11\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cFather agrees to use the Mother as the child-care provider and will not use a third party day-care provider without just cause as long as the Parties reside in the Delaware City school district. Father agrees to pay reasonable day care charges to the mother when she is the day-care provider. In the event that the Father changes the day-care arrangement, then the Wife may by letter petition the court for an immediate hearing thereon. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">{\u00b6 31} We hold that the parties\u2019 shared-parenting plan provides appellee with an opportunity to be heard <em>if </em>appellant changes the daycare arrangement. If such a change occurs, appellee is not required to meet the statutory requirements to establish a change in circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-13\">{\u00b6 32} Appellee testified that appellant informed her of his desire to have the children ride the school bus home to his residence on the days he had companion<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>ship with the children, rather than having the children go to appellee\u2019s home, as was the routine. However, that change never occurred. Appellee acknowledged this fact in her testimony. Because appellant never altered the children\u2019s after-school arrangement with appellee, in order for the trial court to modify the existing shared-parenting plan, appellee must satisfy the statutory factors set forth in R.C. 3109.04. We note that if appellant had unilaterally effectuated a change, he would be estopped from asserting that appellee had failed to demonstrate a significant change of circumstances, as the shared parenting plan allows appellee to request an immediate hearing if appellant effectuates a change.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">{\u00b6 33} We now analyze R.C. 3109.04 to determine whether the trial court properly found a change in circumstance to warrant a modification of the parties\u2019 parental rights. There are certain statutory factors that a trial court is required to consider in determining whether modification of custody is appropriate. These factors that are set forth in R.C. 3109.04(E)(1)(a). First, a trial court must determine whether there has been a change in circumstances. R.C. 3109.04 does not define \u201cchanges in circumstances\u201d; however, courts have generally held the phrase to note \u201can event, occurrence, or situation which has a material and adverse effect upon a child.\u201d <em>Rohrbaugh v. Rohrbaugh </em>(2000), 136 Ohio App.3d 599, 604-605, 737 N.E.2d 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">{\u00b6 34} The trial court herein found that the modification was \u201csupported in part by significant changes in the family\u2019s circumstances, including [appellant\u2019s] threatened withdrawal of the time the children spend with [appellee] after the school day ends and the financial hardships in the home of the [appellee].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">{\u00b6 35} We conclude that appellant\u2019s \u201cthreat\u201d to reduce the time the children spent with appellee is not sufficient to establish a significant change of circumstance, and the trial court\u2019s modification of the parental rights on this basis was erroneous. The trial court also found that the modification was supported by the financial hardships in appellee\u2019s home. Appellee testified that she works approximately six hours a week as a waitress in a restaurant at Buehler\u2019s Market. Appellee explained that she started working when appellant\u2019s support checks were escrowed as a result of the ongoing litigation. She also testified that not receiving support and being required to pay support to appellant would be devastating.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">{\u00b6 36} Upon review of the record, we find no documentation to support appellee\u2019s claim of financial hardship. The record is devoid of any evidence establishing that appellee\u2019s financial situation had significantly changed from the time of inception of the party\u2019s original agreement to the time of the hearing. Again, appellee is basing the change of circumstance on a situation that had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>yet occurred. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court erred in finding these changes significant enough to warrant modification of the parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">{\u00b6 37} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Ill, IV</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">{\u00b6 38} In light of our disposition of appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, we sustain appellant\u2019s third and fourth assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">{\u00b6 39} In his final assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred in failing to hold appellee in contempt for willfully and repeatedly interfering with appellant\u2019s companionship rights and for threatening appellant\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">{\u00b6 40} Absent an abuse of discretion, this court will not reverse the decision of a trial court in a contempt proceeding. <em>State ex rel. Delco Moraine Div., Gen. Motors Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 48 Ohio St.3d 43, 44, 549 N.E.2d 162. An abuse of discretion is more than an error of law or judgment, but rather, it is a finding that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. Under this standard of review, an appellate court may not merely substitute its judgment for that of the trial court. <em>Pons v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 619, 621, 614 N.E.2d 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">{\u00b6 41} A review of the record reveals that appellant filed contempt charges against appellee in September, 2005, stating that appellee had refused to release the children to appellant when he arrived to pick them up for his companionship time. Following a hearing, the trial court found appellee in contempt, imposed a fine of $50, and instructed the parties to strictly follow the companionship schedule henceforth. In November 2005, the parties executed an out-of-court agreement to amend the Thanksgiving holiday visitation schedule. Appellee refused to abide by the agreement, which provoked appellant to file contempt charges on December 7, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">{\u00b6 42} The trial court addressed the issue during the hearing on the motion for change of custody. Appellee admitted sending the children to her parents\u2019 home in Indianapolis during appellant\u2019s visitation time, and that that conduct was against appellant\u2019s wishes and the parties\u2019 out-of-court amended agreement. However, appellee claimed that she was forced to sign the out-of-court amended agreement. The trial court chastised the parties, stating, \u201cI told you two when you were here before, you two do not have the authority to modify your agreement. This type of stuff is total bull. OK? You have a court order on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>visitation. It takes a court order to change the visitation. Not some document signed by either party and I told you both before because the two of you cannot play nice with each other; that you are to strictly follow the rules as to the visitation, as far as it goes to the local rules.\u201d Thereafter, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion for contempt, and that ruling was memorialized in the magistrate\u2019s December 28, 2005 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">{\u00b6 43} Upon review of the entire record in this matter and given the parties\u2019 past history, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion for contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">{\u00b6 44} Appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">{\u00b6 45} The judgment of the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b696-9\">Gwin, P.J., and Farmer, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
