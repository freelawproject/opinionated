Painter, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">{\u00b6 1} Sometimes the government is too zealous in protecting us. Here, the defendant-appellant, Ohio Department of Commerce, Division of Financial Institutions (\u201cDFI\u201d), denied plaintiff-appellee Kenneth D. Roth\u2019s application for a loan-officer license for failing to disclose two misdemeanor convictions from 15 years, now 18 years, earlier. Roth appealed, and the trial court reversed the DFI\u2019s decision and ordered it to award Roth a \u201cconditional loan officer license\u201d as long as he was not convicted of a new criminal offense. The DFI, ever vigilant, has appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">{\u00b6 2} And because the statute does not provide for conditional loan-officer licenses, we must reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">\n<em>I. A 59-Word Question</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">{\u00b6 3} In March 2002, Roth submitted a loan-officer license application to the DFI. Question five asked the applicant, \u201cHave you or has any company for which you have been an officer, or more than 5% owner or director, ever been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any criminal offense, including, but not limited to, theft, receiving stolen property, embezzlement, forgery, fraud, passing bad checks, money laundering, or drug trafficking, or any criminal offense involving money or securities?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">{\u00b6 4} This convoluted sentence scores a zero on the Flesch Reading Ease test. And on the Flesch-Kinkaid grade level, it scores a 28.6, meaning that one needs 28.6 years of schooling to readily understand it.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">{\u00b6 5} The question tracks R.C. 1322.031(A)(2) except that the statute only sets out the specific criminal offenses; the \u201cany criminal offense, including, but not limited to\u201d probably is justified under R.C. 1322.031(A)(4), which states, \u201cAny further information that the superintendent requires.\u201d If the DFI wanted to know whether the applicant had been convicted of <em>any </em>criminal offense, why didn\u2019t it just say so? Instead, it threw that simple inquiry into a 59-word sentence. If the government asks a question, it should be in plain English.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">{\u00b6 6} Roth answered the question, \u201cNo.\u201d Unfortunately for Roth, that was not the truth. In 1988, at 18, Roth pleaded guilty to passing bad checks,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and less than a year later, he pleaded guilty to criminal damaging.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The passing-badehecks charge came about after he had agreed to cash a check for a girlfriend. His girlfriend had stolen the check from her mother and then had forged her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>mother\u2019s name. Roth maintained that he did not know that his girlfriend had forged the check, agreed to reimburse the girlfriend\u2019s mother ($100), and pleaded guilty to passing bad checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">{\u00b6 7} Roth\u2019s conviction for criminal damaging also occurred when he was 18 years old, after he had attended a Halloween party where the parents of the partygiver were out of town. The party got out of control, and some of the homeowners\u2019 personal property was damaged. Roth was originally charged with aggravated burglary because the partygiver claimed that he was not at the party and did not know anything about it. The partygiver later recanted, and the charge was amended to criminal damaging. Roth pleaded guilty to criminal damaging after he admitted to being at the party, but he claimed that he had pleaded guilty only because he could not prove that he did not damage any of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">{\u00b6 8} A year after Roth\u2019s application, in April 2003, the DFI notified Roth that it intended to deny his loan-officer application because \u201c(1) he had been convicted of passing bad checks in 1988 and he had not proven that he is honest, truthful, and of good reputation, and that there is no basis in fact for believing that he will not commit another offense involving bad checks or offense involving money; (2) in 1989 he had been convicted of criminal damaging; (3) he violated R.C. 1322.07(A) by failing to disclose his convictions on his loan officer license application; (4) he violated R.C. 1322.07(B) by making a false statement of a material fact or by omitting a statement required on the licensing application; and (5) because his character and general fitness did not command the confidence of the public and warrant the belief that his business will be operated honestly and fairly in compliance with the purposes of R.C. 1322.01 [through] 1322.12 \u2014 the Ohio Mortgage Broker Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">{\u00b6 9} Roth appealed the DFI\u2019s decision, and an administrative hearing occurred, at which Roth explained his convictions. The hearing officer noted in his recommendation that Roth seemed to have changed his life after his convictions. Roth had lived on his own during his high-school years and did not finish high school. After his two criminal convictions, Roth passed the General Educational Development test (\u201cGED\u201d), was admitted to Southern Ohio College for one semester, and then transferred to Miami University. Roth graduated from Miami with a bachelor\u2019s degree in finance, met and married his wife, had two children, and was active in his church and in coaching his children\u2019s soccer and baseball teams.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">{\u00b6 10} The hearing officer noted that Roth\u2019s failure to disclose his criminal convictions was a violation of R.C. 1322.07(A). (R.C. 1322.07(A) forbids a person from obtaining a license through any false or fraudulent representation of a material fact or through any substantial misrepresentation in a license applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>tion.) But because the convictions occurred within a brief period of time 15 years earlier when Roth was 18, and because Roth had made a \u201cremarkable redirection in his life,\u201d the hearing officer recommended that Roth be granted a license. The hearing officer based this recommendation on his findings that Roth had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) he was honest, truthful, and of good reputation; (2) there was no basis for believing that he would commit a similar offense again; and (3) his \u201ccharacter and general fitness command the confidence of the public and warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly and fairly in compliance with\u201d R.C. 1322.01 through 1322.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">{\u00b6 11} It took <em>two more years </em>for the DFI to issue an order denying Roth\u2019s loan-officer license application. The wheels grind slowly, but they ground up Roth. In its June 2005 order, the DFI rejected the hearing officer\u2019s recommendation because it did not believe that Roth had met his burden to show that his employment record and activities since his convictions demonstrated that he was honest, truthful, and of good reputation. The DFI essentially did not believe that the evidence put forth by Roth, his testimony as well as that of his two employers, who had known him for less than two years, had met his burden to show that he was honest, truthful, and of good reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">{\u00b6 12} Roth appealed this decision to the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas. The magistrate recommended affirming the DFI\u2019s final order, but the court issued an order modifying the magistrate\u2019s decision and conditionally granting a loan-officer license. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">\n<em>II. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">{\u00b6 13} A person denied a license may appeal from the agency\u2019s order to the common pleas court in the county where the person lives.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under R.C. 119.12, the common pleas court may consider the whole record to determine whether the agency\u2019s order is \u201csupported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is in accordance with law.\u201d And the judgment of the common pleas court shall be final and conclusive unless reversed, vacated, or modified on appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The appeal can be taken by either the party or the agency, and it should proceed under the Ohio Rules of Appellate Procedure and R.C. Chapter 2505.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">{\u00b6 14} The Ohio Supreme Court has construed R.C. 2506.04 so that the common pleas courts and the courts of appeals apply different standards of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>review for administrative appeals.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The common pleas court considers the whole record, \u201cincluding any new or additional evidence submitted under R.C. 2506.03, and determines whether the administrative order is unconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unsupported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">{\u00b6 15} But the standard of review to be applied by the court of appeals is more limited.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As the court noted in <em>Henley v. Youngstown Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>\u201cThis statute grants a more limited power to the court of appeals to review the judgment of the common pleas court only on \u2018questions of law,\u2019 which does not include the same extensive power to weigh \u2018the preponderance of substantial, reliable and probative evidence,\u2019 as is granted to the common pleas court. * * * It is incumbent on the trial court to examine the evidence. Such is not the charge of the appellate court. * * * The fact that the court of appeals * * * might have arrived at a different conclusion than the administrative agency is immaterial. Appellate courts must not substitute their judgment for those of an administrative agency or a trial court absent the approved criteria for doing so.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\n<em>III. Loan-Officer Licenses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">{\u00b6 16} In its first assignment of error, the DFI argues that the trial court erred as a matter of law by ordering it to issue a conditional loan-officer license. The DFI maintains that the Ohio Mortgage Broker Act does not provide for conditional or provisional licenses. The DFI is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">{\u00b6 17} R.C. Chapter 1322 governs loan-officer licensure and does not provide for the issuance of a conditional license. \u201cNo person * * * shall act as a loan officer without first having obtained a license from the superintendent.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And for a person to obtain a loan-officer license, that person must meet the conditions for licensure as prescribed in R.C. 1322.041. Those conditions include having never been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any criminal offense.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If the person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any criminal offense, the applicant must then prove by a preponderance of the evidence that \u201cthe applicant\u2019s activities and employment record since the conviction show that the applicant is honest, truthful, and of good reputation, and there is no basis in fact for believing that the applicant will commit such an offense again.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">{\u00b6 18} While we understand the trial court\u2019s desire to allow Roth to obtain a loan-officer license, its manner of doing so was not appropriate and contrary to law. Roth has seemingly changed his life \u2014 he appears to be a model citizen with a wife and two children, he is active in his church, and he volunteers as a coach for his children\u2019s athletic teams. His crimes were misdemeanors and were committed when he was 18 years old, some 18 years ago. As the DFI hearing officer noted in his recommendation, Roth had made a \u201cremarkable redirection in his life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">{\u00b6 19} Despite this remarkable redirection, we are constrained to hold that the trial court erred as a matter of law by ordering DFI to issue a conditional loan-officer license so long as Roth refrained from committing any other criminal offense. The statute simply does not provide any authority for the trial court to do so. We thus sustain the DFI\u2019s first assignment of error and reverse the judgment of the trial court. The DFI\u2019s second assignment of error is now moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">{\u00b6 20} We remand the cause to the trial court. Perhaps that court can take evidence and decide whether the DFI\u2019s decision was \u201csupported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and [wa]s in accordance with law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">{\u00b6 21} We also note that the statute does not preclude Roth from reapplying for a loan officer license. As the hearing officer noted, had Roth answered question five correctly and disclosed the convictions, \u201cthis Hearing Officer would have little difficulty concluding that the events occurred so long ago and under circumstances so markedly different from today\u2019s circumstances that [Roth] would be unlikely to commit such offenses again and that he should be granted a license.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">{\u00b6 22} We also suggest to the DFI that it revise its application to be readable by ordinary citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b369-11\">Hendon, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b369-12\">Sundermann, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-12\">.
