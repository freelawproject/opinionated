Both attorneys contend that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to award them the full amount of fees requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">{\u00b6 2} We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion with regard to the fee awarded to Holm. However, the trial court did abuse its discretion to the extent that it denied Holm the right to collect on any charges not yet incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">{\u00b6 3} We conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in determining the appropriate fee award for Denicola. Accordingly, the orders of the trial court from which this appeal is taken are affirmed in part and reversed in part, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">{\u00b6 4} Leona Kendall died testate on April 1, 2003. Attorney Ronald Denicola was hired by Charles Kendall, a son of the decedent, to represent the estate. A will was admitted to probate in the Hamilton County Probate Court, and Charles Kendall was appointed executor of the will. Thereafter, on March 26, 2004, a later will was admitted to the Montgomery County Probate Court, and Lois Gwin was appointed to act as executor of the estate. Holm was retained as attorney for the estate in Montgomery County. On May 5, 2004, the Hamilton County Probate Court terminated the action in Hamilton County.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">{\u00b6 5} Of relevance to this appeal, in September 2005, Gwin filed applications requesting approval of attorney fees for both Denicola and Holm. The applications sought attorney fees in the sum of $4,518.52 for Denicola and $15,000 for Holm. At a hearing on her fee, Holm presented the testimony of an attorney, Konrad Kuczak, who opined that Holm\u2019s fee was reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-13\">{\u00b6 6} Following the hearing, the magistrate found that after the date the case was terminated in Hamilton County, Denicola continued to keep time records for \u201cvarious kinds of work he completed at the request of the executor and Attorney Carol Holm.\u201d The magistrate further found that the work performed by Denicola was \u201cuseful to the estate.\u201d However, the magistrate found that the work Denicola performed could have been \u201cmore economically performed either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>by the fiduciary or by Attorney Holm or a secretary or paralegal in Attorney Holm\u2019s office.\u201d Thus, the magistrate awarded the sum of $1,062.27 to Denicola as fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">{\u00b6 7} With regard to Holm, the magistrate found that the expert was not credible. The magistrate further found that Holm had been required to file amended pleadings in order to correct errors in her work on the estate. The magistrate also noted that the court issued three citations for failure to complete forms in a timely manner. The magistrate found that Holm was not entitled to $15,000 in fees, but awarded her the reduced sum of $5,500 as attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">{\u00b6 8} Holm and Denicola filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. The trial court overruled these objections and entered an order adopting the magistrate\u2019s decision. Both Holm and Denicola filed appeals from the denial of their fee requests. The appeals have been consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">(\u00b6 9} Holm\u2019s first, second, third, fourth, and sixth assignments of error all challenge the order of the trial court as being against the weight of the evidence:</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe trial court erred in refusing to honor the attorney fee application of Holm, making a judgment against the manifest weight of evidence, and this amounted to an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe trial court erred in asserting that the magistrate had correctly reviewed the case in light of the Code of Professional Responsibility, DR-2 106(b). The magistrate made no reference to DR 2-106. Correct findings of fact would not support the court\u2019s assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion in rejecting the explanations of counsel on difficulties of filing documents and instead imposed draconian penalties on counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe trial court erred in calculating attorney fees based upon percentages.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-13\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe trial court erred in giving no credibility to expert witness testimony, and the court\u2019s finding was contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-14\">{\u00b6 15} Holm contends that the order of the trial court is not supported by the evidence. Specifically, she argues that the trial court erred by using a percentage calculation in setting her fee and by failing to find credible the testimony of her expert. She further argues that the trial court incorrectly found that the magistrate considered the Code of Professional Responsibility in determining whether her fees were reasonable. Finally, she argues that the evidence refutes the trial court\u2019s finding that her fees were not reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>{\u00b6 16} The issue of attorney fees in probate proceedings is addressed in R.C. 2113.36, which states: \u201cWhen an attorney has been employed in the administration of the estate, reasonable attorney fees paid by the executor or administrator shall be allowed as a part of the expenses of administration. The court may at any time during administration fix the amount of such fees and, on application of the executor or administrator or the attorney, shall fix the amount thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cReasonable attorney fees must be based upon the actual services performed by the attorneys and upon the reasonable value of those services as determined from the evidence which must substantiate the award of fees as being reasonable.\u201d <em>Watters v. Love </em>(1965), 1 Ohio App.2d 571, 578, 30 O.O.2d 595, 206 N.E.2d 39. Pursuant to Sup.R. 71, when determining the reasonableness of attorney fees, a trial court must consider the factors set out in DR 2-106 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. Those factors are time and labor involved; novelty and difficulty of the issues; professional skill required; inability to accept other cases; fee customarily charged; amount at stake and results obtained; time limitations; nature of client relationship; experience, reputation and ability of attorney; and whether the fee is fixed or contingent.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">{\u00b6 18} We begin with Holm\u2019s claim that the order of the trial court is erroneous because the trial court incorrectly found that the magistrate followed the guidelines of the Code of Professional Responsibility in setting the amount of her fee. Holm\u2019s claim is based upon the following sentence: \u201cThe Magistrate correctly reviewed this case in light of the factors in the Ohio Code of Professional Responsibility.\u201d Holm notes, correctly, that the magistrate\u2019s decision did not make reference to the Code or DR 2-106 and did not affirmatively cite the factors contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">{\u00b6 19} We find that this argument lacks merit. First, the trial court was not claiming that the magistrate had cited the Code in his decision. Instead, the trial court was merely explaining that after it had reviewed the magistrate\u2019s decision, it determined that the magistrate\u2019s decision was in accord with the provisions of the Code. Indeed, the order of the trial court continues on, after the aforementioned sentence, by explaining why the Code supported the magistrate\u2019s decision. Second, we note that the magistrate\u2019s decision, while not explicitly citing the Code provisions, does make reference to them. For instance, with regard to the novelty and difficulty of the case, the magistrate stated that the \u201cestate did have some unique problems,\u201d which the magistrate duly noted. The magistrate also reviewed the time and labor involved \u2014 his decision made specific references to the different tasks performed by Holm. The magistrate also considered the professional skill required for the administration of the estate and noted that quite a bit of the work performed was routine probate work and that Holm had to do additional work in order to correct errors in her filings. Finally, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>magistrate stated that he had issued three citations due to the failure to timely complete filings. Based upon this record, we reject this claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">{\u00b6 20} We next address Holm\u2019s argument that the trial court erred because it calculated her fees based upon percentages. In support, she cites the following passage from the trial court\u2019s decision: \u201cFurther, the estate is valued at less than $110,000 with the bulk consisting of one piece of real estate. If the requested attorney fees were granted, then nearly 13% of the estate would go to Holm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">{\u00b6 21} We do not read this to support the claim that the trial court improperly based Holm\u2019s fee on a percentage calculation. Instead, after again reading the entire order, we note that the trial court mentioned this figure in relation to its discussion of the Code of Professional Responsibility. Further, the trial court noted that \u201cdue to Holm\u2019s errors the case became more complicated than necessary.\u201d Thus, it appears that the purpose of the above-cited passage was to compare the size of the estate to the results of Holm\u2019s performance as it related to the determination of whether her fees were reasonable and necessary. Therefore, we find no error with regard to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">{\u00b6 22} Holm also contends that the trial court erred by \u201cgiving no credibility to\u201d the testimony provided by her expert witness, Konrad Kuczak. Holm correctly notes that Kuczak testified that her fees were reasonable and necessary. However, we note that Kuczak also testified that he is not an expert with regard to probate cases. He further testified that he did not perform an \u201caudit of the bill against the work product,\u201d and thus, he was unable to answer questions with regard to specific portions of Holm\u2019s bill. Indeed, Kuczak testified that the bill \u201cjust seemed reasonable comparative to the work product that I observed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">{\u00b6 23} The trial court is in the best position to weigh the credibility of the proffered testimony; thus, an appellate court is guided by the presumption that the findings of the trier of fact are correct. <em>Seasons Coal Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 10 OBR 408, 461 N.E.2d 1273. As the trier of fact, the probate judge observes the witnesses and their demeanor, gestures, and voice inflections, making the judge the best judge of credibility. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">{\u00b6 24} After reviewing the transcript, we cannot say that the magistrate or the trial court erred by failing to credit Kuczak\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">{\u00b6 25} Next, we address the issue of whether the decision of the magistrate and the order of the trial court are supported by the evidence. The payment of reasonable attorney fees lies within the probate court\u2019s sound discretion. <em>In re Estate of Fugate </em>(1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 293, 298, 620 N.E.2d 966. Judgments supported by some competent, credible evidence going to all the essential elements of the case will not be reversed by a reviewing court as being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>against the manifest weight of the evidence. <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">{\u00b6 26} In this case, although there were numerous beneficiaries of the estate, there were few assets. There is no evidence that the matter was complex or presented novel issues of law. Further, although Holm filed \u201cnumerous motions, applications, accounts, and reports,\u201d the court noted that \u201cin many instances amended pleadings were required due to errors in Holm\u2019s initial pleadings.\u201d Thus, the trial court found that \u201cdue to Holm\u2019s errors the case became more complicated than necessary.\u201d Further, the court issued three citations due to the failure to file documents in a timely fashion. The trial court also considered the requested fee to be unreasonable in light of the size of the estate. Finally, the trial court noted that Holm had removed more than $5,000 from the estate to her account without prior approval of the court, despite the fact that Sup.R. 71(B) provides that \u201cattorney fees for the administration of estates shall not be paid until the final account is prepared for filing unless otherwise approved by the court upon application and for good cause shown.\u201d All of these factors combined compelled the magistrate and trial court to conclude that Holm\u2019s requested fee was not reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">{\u00b6 27} We cannot say, after reviewing the record, that the trial court abused its discretion with regard to the amount of fees awarded to Holm in this case. Accordingly, Holm\u2019s first, second, third, fourth, and sixth assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">{\u00b6 28} Holm\u2019s fifth assignment of error provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-9\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion when it reduced attorney fees for which no application had yet been made nor yet awarded, and further denied any future attorney fees from September 28, 2005, regardless of the work required beyond that date.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">{\u00b6 30} Holm contends that the trial court erred when it ruled that she would not be awarded any fees for work done on the estate subsequent to its decision regarding the September 29, 2005 request for $15,000 in fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">{\u00b6 31} We note that in its decision, the trial court stated that Holm \u201cis awarded $5,500.00 for attorney\u2019s fees for services rendered and to be rendered in this case.\u201d Thus, Holm correctly asserts that the trial court\u2019s decision prevents her from filing a request for fees for any work performed after the original request.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">{\u00b6 32} If Holm has rendered services to the estate since the date of her request for fees, the trial court is obligated to review any request for fees for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>such services to determine whether they are reasonable. To conclude summarily that no further fees will be considered, without first determining whether they are reasonable and necessary, is premature and constitutes an abuse of discretion. Thus, to the extent that this assignment of error involves the issue of fees incurred after the date of the September 29, 2005 request for fees, it is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">{\u00b6 33} Denicola\u2019s first and second assignments of error state as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cThe court below erred in reducing the fees of Denicola which reduction was an abuse of its discretion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cThe court below erred in failing to find the fees of Denicola represent a claim of a creditor against the estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">{\u00b6 36} Denicola contends that the trial court erred by failing to award him the full amount of his fees. Alternatively, he contends that any fees charged after the date of the termination of the action in Hamilton County must be treated as the claims of a creditor against the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">{\u00b6 37} We begin by noting that according to his itemized bill, Denicola charged fees of $3,850 for his services performed while attorney for the estate in Hamilton County. Thereafter, he charged $1,137.50 for work performed at the behest of the executor and Holm. The total fee charged was $4,987. While the magistrate opined that the work performed by Denicola was \u201cuseful\u201d to the estate, the magistrate approved only $1,062.27 of the total charges. The magistrate\u2019s decision appears to be based entirely upon a finding that Denicola had been paid prior to approval of the charges and upon a finding that the work performed after the termination date could have been \u201cmore economically performed either by the fiduciary or by Attorney Holm or a secretary or paralegal in Attorney Holm\u2019s office.\u201d The trial court merely reiterated these findings by the magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">{\u00b6 38} We conclude that the trial court abused its discretion with regard to Denicola\u2019s claims. First, it is clear that Denicola\u2019s claims were effectively divided into two categories by the magistrate: the portion charged for work performed as the attorney for the estate, and the portion charged thereafter. With regard to the first portion, the trial court must utilize the provisions of R.C. 2113.36 in determining whether the fees should be paid. We cannot say that either the trial court or the magistrate did so. Furthermore, it appears that the magistrate and the trial court did not even consider the charges for the period prior to the termination of the Hamilton County action. Instead, it appears that they focused solely on the fees charged thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">{\u00b6 39} With regard to the charges incurred after the termination of the Hamilton County action, we note that the magistrate concluded that Denicola was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>not the attorney for the estate. However, the trial court mentioned the provisions of R.C. 2113.36 as controlling with regard to that portion of the fee request.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">{\u00b6 40} We conclude that Denicola\u2019s work was performed while acting as an attorney for the estate or while acting at the request of the executor, of Holm, or of both. Even though he was not the attorney of record for the estate after the date of the Hamilton County termination, he was essentially acting as the attorney for the estate. Thus, we further conclude that all of his work can be considered as that of an attorney for the estate, regardless of when it was performed. The trial court, therefore, must consider his entire fee request in light of the provisions of R.C. 2113.36 and the Code of Professional Responsibility. This the trial court did not do. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion. This cause will be remanded to the trial court for a redetermination of the fee request in light of the provisions of the Code. The trial court need not hold a new hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">{\u00b6 41} Denicola\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained, and his second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">{\u00b6 42} The order of the trial court from which this appeal is taken is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b155-10\">Brogan and Grady, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
