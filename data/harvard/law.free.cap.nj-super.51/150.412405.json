J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AkWT\">Defendant appeals from a County Court judgment entered upon a jury verdict, sentencing him to a term of three to five years in State Prison for larceny of a ring.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">On October 8, 1956 the Essex County grand jury returned an indictment in three counts charging that on July 30, 1956 defendant (1) willfully entered the room of one Estelle Grossbardt with intent to steal, in violation of <em>N. J. S. 2A :9A-l; </em>(2) stole a platinum diamond ring belonging to her valued at $2,750, and (3) stole another of her rings, worth $500, both in violation of <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:119-2. At the outset of the trial the court granted the prosecution\u2019s motion to sever the third count, and the cause thereafter proceeded on the first two counts \u2014 entering with intent to steal, and larceny of the platinum diamond ring.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">The evidence disclosed that the complaining witness, Mrs. Estelle Grossbardt, was a guest at Goldman\u2019s Hotel, a resort hotel in West Orange, New Jersey, during the 1956 summer vacation period. She was accompanied by her two children, aged ten and two, and their \u201cgoverness,\u201d a girl of 17 or 18. Mr. Grossbardt joined his family on weekends. During her stay at the hotel Mrs. Grossbardt and her children \u2014 and her husband on weekends \u2014 all occupied the same room, while the \u201cgoverness\u201d occupied a separate room. The Grossbardt room <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>was located on the ground floor of the hotel. Access to the room was off a central corridor which led in one direction to the main lobby at the front of the hotel and in the other direction to a side door opening onto the parking lot and also to a door in the rear leading to the swimming pool area.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Mrs. Grossbardt had brought with her a quantity of her personal jewelry, consisting of a platinum diamond ring, charm bracelet, cultured pearls, wrist watch and other items. She kept this jewelry in an unlocked jewel box on top of her dresser. The door of her room was never locked except when she was inside asleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Mrs. Grossbardt testified that on Sunday evening, July 29, she wore some of her jewelry, including the platinum diamond ring and the charm bracelet. When she returned to her room in the early hours of Monday, July 30, she placed this jewelry in the unlocked box on the dresser and went to sleep. At about 11 a. m., after Mr. Grossbardt had departed for the city, the room was left empty and unlocked. Mrs. Grossbardt did not look into her jewel box again until 7 o\u2019clock the next evening, Tuesday, when she discovered that all her jewelry was missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">It was proved that the charm bracelet was pawned at a pawnshop in New York City on Monday, July 30, between 3:30 and 4:30 p. m. The State\u2019s handwriting expert, comparing the name signed on the pawn ticket, \u201cMax Doreshorne,\u201d with samples of defendant\u2019s handwriting, testified that in his opinion they all were written by one and the same person. The clerk who actually handled the pawn transaction was not called as a witness by the State, although he was still employed at the pawnshop and his name and address were known to the police. Instead, the assistant manager testified as to the fact and time of the pawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">The evidence further showed that on Tuesday, July 31, between noon and 1 p. m., defendant entered a jewelry store in Poughkeepsie, New York, ownd by Morris and Eae White, showed Mrs. White a platinum diamond ring he said he had found lying in the street, and asked whether the stone was glass or diamond. She took the ring to her husband at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>rear of the store and he, being\u2019 suspicions, instructed her to call the police. They soon arrived and requested defendant to accompany them to police headquarters where, in response to their questioning, he informed them he was employed as a salesman by a pipe and tobacco company and had been making calls on his customers in Poughkeepsie that morning, and that as he crossed the street he saw a shining object in the gutter, picked it up and took it into the jewelry store to see if it had any value. Mrs. Grossbardt identified this ring, as well as the charm bracelet, as her property.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">As defendant had told the police, he was a salesman for a New York City company engaged in the importing and wholesaling of pipes and smokers\u2019 articles. The State introduced order slips showing that on Monday, July 30, defendant had taken orders from four different customers, three located in Newark and one in East Orange, New Jersey. The prosecution offered no proof, however, of the time of day when the respective orders were talren or the means of transportation then being used by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Accepting as true the testimony of Mrs. Grossbardt that her hotel room was not empty until 11 a. m. Monday, and the fact that her charm bracelet was pawned between 3 :30 and 4:30 p. m. that same afternoon, the obvious conclusion is that her jewelry must have been taken between those hours and transported to New York City. The only evidence placing defendant at the scene of the crime was the testimony of Maclyn Goldman, one of the owners of the hotel, and Herbert Eine, who described himself as in charge of athletic and social programs there.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Goldman\u2019s testimony essentially was that the person appearing in a photograph which had been shown him by the police prior to the trial \u2014 it was stipulated that this was a police photograph of defendant \u2014 had been a dinner guest at the hotel a week or two before July 30, 1956. However, when he looked at defendant in the courtroom he was not so sure of his identification; he said that defendant resembled someone he had seen at the hotel, but whether defendant himself had been there he did not know. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>the trial resumed in the afternoon the witness was again shown defendant\u2019s police picture, and he then testified that he had seen the man in the picture in and about the hotel within a week or two of the date in question. On cross-examination he stated that he could not say the person in the photograph was the man he had seen at the hotel. He said that defendant bore a very strong resemblance to the man he had seen, but when asked directly, \u201cIs he or is he not the man,\u201d he replied \u201cI can\u2019t answer that question, sir.\u201d The rest of Goldman\u2019s testimony concerned the number of guests at the hotel on a summer weekend, 500 to 600; the fact that there were 150 to 170 employees on the weekend of the robbery, 30 to 40% of them \u201cnew faces\u201d; that there were three exits out of the hotel from Mrs. Grossbardt\u2019s room, and the windows in her room could be opened from the inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">Pine testified that he had seen defendant in the lobby of the hotel during the summer of 1956, but when asked to give the month he replied he could not. The State\u2019s attorney then said he had no further questions, but when defense counsel moved to strike Pine\u2019s testimony as being too remote in time and not connected, he resumed direct examination. Upon further probing by rather leading questions, to which no objection was entered, the time the witness said he saw defendant in the hotel lobby was narrowed to a Saturday night between July 15 and July 30. He could not recall just what Saturday night it was, but it was after 8 p. m. lie remembered the time, so he explained, because at that hour every one not a guest at the hotel would be asked to leave preparatory to the evening show in the hotel\u2019s night club. Pine remembered seeing defendant wandering alone through the main lobby, but he could not recall how he was dressed and he did not tell him to leave. Although the general practice was to question a person who was not a guest, Pine did not stop or question defendant on that particular evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">At the close of the State\u2019s case defendant moved to dismiss both counts of the indictment because of the State\u2019s failure to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case. The motion was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>denied. Defendant did not take the stand; his wife was his only witness. She testified that she worked in New York City and defendant had picked her up at her place of employment every Saturday evening during the summer of 1956 and then spent the entire evening with her. Upon the completion of her testimony defendant again, unsuccessfully, moved for a judgment of acquittal. The court then charged the jury, stating that the case was one founded in circumstantial evidence and directing that it could return a verdict of guilty or not guilty on both counts, or guilty on one and not on the other. In concluding he made the comment, which he said the jury was not required to accept, that it seemed to him that under the facts of the case \u201cthe verdict should be either guilty on both counts or not guilty on both counts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">The jury could not agree on the first count (entering with intent to steal), and a mistrial was declared as to it. It returned a verdict of guilty on the second count (larceny). Defendant moved for a new trial because the verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence and the court erred in, not granting his motions for acquittal; the verdict was inconsistent and a compromise verdict; there was trial error in the admission of the police photograph and a police fingerprint chart, and there were errors in the charge. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">On appeal defendant claims that (1) the evidence does not support the larceny charge and the motions for judgment of acquittal should therefore have been granted; (2) the trial court\u2019s charge with respect to defendant\u2019s failure to testify was erroneous; (3) he was prejudiced by the improper admission of evidence and the improper remarks of jeweler White, who testified for the State; and (4) the verdict was inconsistent and a compromise verdict. After the completion of the oral argument we requested both sides to file supplemental briefs covering the following points:</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">(1) On the hypothesis that defendant had an arrangement with someone in Goldman\u2019s Hotel to steal jewelry (not necessarily the jewelry in this case) and then turn it over to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>him for disposal, would such an arrangement, followed by the disappearance of the jewelry which occurred in this case, if assumed to be a theft, make defendant guilty of the offense as an accomplice or accessory either before or after the fact?</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">(2) Assuming that the circumstantial proof was not sufficient for submission to the jury of the hypothesis of defendant\u2019s guilt of personal theft, is the theory set out in (1) a sufficiently probable hypothesis from the facts proven so as to have warranted submission of the issue of defendant\u2019s guilt to the jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">(3) Is the foregoing a sufficient basis to sustain a conviction where the indictment charged theft but did not charge defendant as an accomplice or accessory, and where the trial court did not submit to the jury the theory of defendant\u2019s guilt as an accomplice or accessory?</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">The evidence against defendant was entirely circumstantial. The exacting standard that the State must meet in such a case was laid down by the Supreme Court, speaking through Justice Wachenfeld, in <em>State v. Donohue, </em>2 <em>N. J. </em>381, 390, 391 (1949), where it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">\u201c* * * In order to justify a conviction on such evidence, all of the circumstances not only must concur to indicate a defendant\u2019s guilt but they must also be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. It is not enough that they coincide to render probable the hypothesis advanced by the prosecution; they must also exclude beyond a reasonable doubt every other hypothesis except that of guilt * * * Where the essential facts are proved, and where they cannot be rationally explained on any theory other than that the defendant is guilty of the crime charged, such circumstantial evidence will be considered as convincing as evidence of a direct and positive character.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">And see <em>State v. Rogers, </em>19 <em>N. J. </em>218, 232 (1955); <em>State v. Rhams, </em>14 N. <em>J. </em>282, 285 (1954); <em>State v. </em>Pincus, 41 <em>N. J. Super. </em>454, 459 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956); <em>State v. Vitale, </em>35 <em>N. J. Super. </em>568, 571-572 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955); <em>State v. Williams, </em>16 <em>N. J. Super. </em>372, 383 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951); <em>State v. Fox, </em>12 <em>N. J. Super. </em>132 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951). In <em>State v. Bulna, </em>46 <em>N. J. Super. </em>313, 317 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>affirmed 27 <em>N. J. </em>93 (1958) without further discussion of this point, we said that \u201cwhere the proofs of the State are circumstantial, and, at the end of its case, \u2018reasonably and fairly\u2019 make for a hypothesis of innocence, there should be an acquittal notwithstanding that an inference of guilt is also possible,\u201d at the same time pointing out that the much stronger criterion found in cases like <em>Donohue, Rhams </em>and <em>Fox </em>was a doctrine widely held.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Viewing the-evidence adduced by the State in its most favorable light, it was proved that the jewelry was stolen on Monday, July 30, 1956, between 11 A. m. and 4:30 p. m. (the disappearance of property from the place where the owner put it, without the owner\u2019s knowledge or consent, is evidence of theft, 32 <em>Am. Jur., Larceny, </em>\u00a7 136, <em>p. </em>1047, and note 8 (1941)); on the day of the alleged theft defendant had taken orders in Newark and East Orange which, it may judicially be noticed, are some miles removed from Goldman\u2019s Hotel in West Orange; the. charm bracelet was pawned that same afternoon in New York City (which also may be noted as being well over a dozen miles away by the most direct route), and the handwriting expert testified that defendant had signed the pawn ticket; the day following the theft defendant was found in possession of the platinum diamond ring in Poughkeepsie, New York; and defendant apparently had been seen in Goldman\u2019s Hotel within several weeks prior to the time of the theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">We recognize that defendant\u2019s recent possession of the Grossbardt jewelry was a circumstance to be considered by the jury, and in connection with other evidence could raise an inference or rebuttable presumption of his guilt of their theft. <em>State v. Lax, </em>71 <em>N. J. L. </em>386 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1904); 1 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence (12th ed. </em>1955), \u00a7 135, <em>p. </em>254; 9 <em>Wigmore on Evidence (3rd ed. </em>1940 and 1957 <em>Supp.), </em>\u00a7 2513, <em>p. </em>417; 32 <em>Am. Jur., Larceny, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 140-143, <em>pp. </em>1052 <em>et seq. </em>(1940); 52 <em>C. J. S. Larceny, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 105-110, <em>pp. </em>924 <em>et seq. </em>(1947). This rule must, however, be applied within the context of the principle set out in the <em>Bulna, Rogers, Donohue </em>and other eases cited above, which protects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>a defendant who is subject to conviction on circumstantial evidence alone. We have here, under the rule of recent possession just stated, a situation where the facts proved are consistent with an hypothesis of defendant\u2019s guilt of the crime charged. But the test of the <em>Bulna </em>line of cases is two-pronged: the evidence must also exclude the possibility of reasonably and fairly arriving at a conclusion of innocence. Eor the reasons about to be stated we have concluded that the proofs in the instant case, purely circumstantfal as they were, did not exclude a reasonable hypothesis of innocence of the theft charged, so that the trial court should have granted defendant\u2019s motions for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\"> Although there are several possible explanations of defendant\u2019s possession of the missing G-rossbardt jewelry that are consistent with his innocence of its theft, the one that instantly comes to mind, and the most probable, is that the person who actually got possession of the jewelry by larceny or otherwise delivered the items to defendant for disposal. If this was the case, defendant would be guilty of receiving stolen property, <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:139-1, and not of its theft. We note in this connection that the statute provides that mere possession of property within one year from the date that it was obtained by theft, robbery, or otherwise unlawfully or fraudulently, \u201cshall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction,\u201d unless the accused show to the satisfaction of the jury that it was a gift not received from a minor under 16, or that he paid a fair and reasonable value for it and that it was not received from a minor under 16, or that he bought it from one in a regular and established business for dealing in such property, or that he reported the transaction to the local police at the time of such receiving or buying, or that where the property was obtained from a minor under 16, he communicated with the police and obtained their approval. Thus, <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:139-1 itself raises a strong but rebuttable presumption of guilt of receiving stolen goods, a significant consideration in a circumstantial case like this where defendant was charged with larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>A receiver of stolen goods is guilty of a distinct, substantive offense. He is not an accessory to the theft, nor to a prior receiving or possessing of the stolen property. The thief and the receiver are not accomplices. <em>State v. Vanderhave, </em>47 <em>N. J. Super. </em>483, 486 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957); <em>State v. Fox, </em>12 <em>N. J. Super. </em>132, 138 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951); <em>State v. Gaddis, </em>131 <em>N. J. L. </em>44, 46 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1943); <em>State v. Rachman, </em>68 <em>N. J. L. </em>120, 122 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1902); <em>State v. Calvin, </em>22 <em>N. J. L. </em>207, 209 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1849). We perceive, of course, the seeming paradox of holding defendant innocent of the criminal charge of theft because it would be entirely reasonable and fair to conclude that he is guilty of another crime \u2014 receiving stolen property. Our duty, however, is to decide the issue of defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence of the crime with which he has been charged in the indictment, larceny. We cannot usurp the functions constitutionally allocated to our law enforcement officials and the grand jury. 1947 <em>Const., Art. </em>I, <em>par. </em>8. We are bound by the decisions which for more than a century have held theft and the receiving of stolen property to be entirely separate and distinct offenses. Since an indictment for larceny will not support a conviction for receiving stolen property, the probability of defendant\u2019s guilt of the latter and innocence of the former calls for reversal in the factual setting here present.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">We are not concerned here, as the dissenting opinion suggests, with any rule for admeasuring the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence to sustain a conviction for larceny. The question, plainly and simply, is whether the <em>Donohue </em>principle, quoted above, is to be put to one side on a suspicion (or even a firmly held conviction) that defendant was in some way guilty of infracting the criminal law. We do not sustain convictions merely because of the presence of an aura of criminality. There should be no predilection to send a defendant to jail for larceny, or accessory to larceny, where the proofs leave open the very definite probability that he was a receiver of stolen goods and therefore innocent of the crime charged \u2014 and this no matter how accurately the rule on circumstantial evidence may have been charged to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>We are constrained to note that the evidence would seem to supply a much greater support for the charge of receiving stolen property than for its theft. There was no direct evidence placing defendant at or immediately near the hotel premises on the day of the alleged theft nor, indeed, was it actually proved that defendant was in the State of New Jersey during the hours when the theft must have been committed. Further, the evidence identifying defendant as having been at the hotel within the two weeks preceding the disappearance of the jewelry was greatly vitiated by the effort expended in extracting this modicum of proof from the witnesses. We deem it entirely likely, in view of the obvious size and popularity of the hotel, its large staff and the appreciable employee turn-over, especially on weekends, that the one who took the jewelry must have been familiar with the Grossbardt family and the habits of Mrs. Grossbardt with respect to her valuables. That person entered her hotel room when it was empty, and there was no evidence that anything other than the jewelry box was disturbed. Everything points strongly toward this having been an \u201cinside job,\u201d and that defendant\u2019s role was that of a \u201cfence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">The pawning of the jewelry under an assumed name, the Poughkeepsie charade, the possible presence of defendant at the hotel sometime earlier that summer, his presence in Newark and East Orange at an unspecified hour and in an unspecified conveyance on the day the jewelry disappeared\u2014 all mentioned in the dissent \u2014 do not destroy the probable explanation of defendant\u2019s having been a receiver. Nor does the fact that the bracelet was pawned within some four or five hours after the hotel room was left empty. The facts definitely permit the inference that whoever took Mrs. Grossbardt\u2019s valuables knew that defendant was available, or would readily be available, at a place in New York City (or indeed New Jersey) to receive what he had for disposal. We cannot jump the factual gap, left open by a total absence of proof, that this made defendant an accessory to a <em>theft.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Our determination above is dispositive of the questions posed by us folio-wing the oral argument and discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>in the supplemental brief. There can be no question but that defendant would be an accessory and accomplice, and punishable as a principal, if he had aided, commanded, induced or procured another to steal Mrs. Grossbardt\u2019s jewelry. <em>N. J. S. </em>24:85-14; <em>State v. Cooper, </em>10 <em>N. J. </em>532, 568 (1952); <em>State v. Seaman, </em>10 <em>N. J. Super. </em>439 <em>(App. Div. </em>1949), certification denied 6 <em>N. J. </em>456 (1951). Aside from the fact that the record does not substantiate either directly or by inference an hypothesis that defendant had an arrangement with any one at the hotel or elsewhere to <em>steal </em>jewelry from hotel guests and to dispose of it through him, the reasonable hypothesis of guilt as a receiver, discussed above, would exclude his conviction as an accomplice or accessory to the theft. Additionally, the case was tried on the single theory that defendant himself had entered the hotel room and had removed the jewelry, and this is reflected in the court\u2019s comment that the verdict should be guilty on both counts or on neither. We note, further, that the jury was not charged on the theory that defendant was an accomplice or accessory. Had there been sufficient proof to submit the case to the jury on the latter theory, assuming there was no problem insofar as receiving stolen property is concerned, the indictment charging him as a principal would, of course, have been sufficient. <em>State v. Ullrich, </em>10 <em>N. J. </em>146, 151 (1952); <em>State v. Kuznitz, </em>36 <em>N. J. Super. </em>521, 530-531 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955); <em>State v. Seaman, </em>above, 10 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at <em>pages </em>444-445; <em>State v. Wilson, </em>80 <em>N. J. L. </em>467 (E <em>&amp; A. </em>1910), affirming 79 <em>N. J. L. </em>241 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1910); 4 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law and Procedure, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1789, 1791, <em>pp. </em>610, 613 (1957). The fact remains, however, that the State\u2019s evidence' reasonably and fairly made tenable the hypothesis that defendant was a receiver, and therefore innocent of the crime charged, whether as principal or accessory to the larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">In view of our disposition of the case, it is unnecessary to discuss the other grounds of error raised by defendant. Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Confoed, J.

I am persuaded that the evidence here justifies affirmance of the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">If the jury credited the testimony of the handwriting expert which tended to establish that the defendant had pawned one of the stolen pieces of jewelry in New York City the day of the theft, it was entitled to find that the defendant was in possession of some of the stolen articles within hours or minutes after they were taken. Moreover, he was undeniably shown to be in possession of one of the articles the next day in Poughkeepsie, New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The overwhelming weight of authority is that the recent possession after larceny of stolen goods warrants the inference that the possessor was the thief, or, at least, that coupled with other inculpatory evidence, a jury verdict of guilt based! thereon will be sustained. 52 <em>C. J. S. Larceny </em>\u00a7\u00a7 105-110;. <em>pp. </em>924, 935, and the other authorities for these propositions cited in the majority opinion. Literally scores of cases are cited for these rules in these works. In <em>State v. Lax, </em>71 <em>N. J. L. </em>386, 387 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1904), the court approved the rule that the possession by the defendant of stolen goods \u201c'at a time not too long after the stealing, is a circumstance; for the jury to consider and weigh in connection with the other evidence [on the issue of guilt of theft].\u201d In <em>State v. Dunlap, </em>103 <em>N. J. L. </em>209 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1927), the court sustained a conviction of larceny based largely upon the circumstantial evidence of possession of the stolen goods shortly after their theft where it might also have been argued, as. does the majority here, that the evidence pointed also to the hypothesis of guilt of receiving; and see <em>State v. Janiec, </em>20 <em>N. J. Super. </em>471, 481 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">It has been held in those jurisdictions where possession alone is not sufficient that slight inculpatory evidence additional to that of recent possession of stolen goods will suffice to sustain a conviction. Examples thereof are the giving of false explanations of possession, <em>People v. Crotty, </em>70 Cal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number><em>App. </em>515, 233 <em>P. </em>395 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1925); <em>People v. Farrell, </em>67 <em>Cal. App. </em>128, 227 <em>P. </em>210 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1924), or selling the property under an assumed name, <em>People v. Lang, </em>142 <em>Cal. </em>482, 76 <em>P. </em>232 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1904), or other conduct with respect to the goods betraying or evidencing \u201ca guilty mind.\u201d <em>State v. Kinghorn, </em>109 <em>Mont. </em>22, 93 <em>P. 2d </em>964 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1939); and see <em>McCutcheon v. State, </em>140 <em>Tex. Cr. R. </em>74, 143 <em>S. W. 2d </em>611 <em>(Cr. App. </em>1940) (selling property under an assumed name); and see <em>State v. Janiec, supra </em>(20 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at <em>page </em>481). In the present case there was the pawning of some of the jewelry under an assumed name, the fantastic explanation to the Poughkeepsie jeweler of having found one of the pieces in the street, the evidence of defendant having been seen on the hotel premises during the summer, and the proof of his presence in Newark and East Orange on the day of the theft. Most damaging is the proximity in time betw\u00e9en the period when the jewelry was stolen and the hour the same day when defendant was pawning one of the articles in New York City. The shorter the period of time between theft and possession by the defendant the stronger the justification for the inference of theft. 52 <em>C. J. S. Larceny </em>\u00a7 109, <em>p. </em>934, <em>note </em>47.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">The majority assert that the rule of inference of guilt from recent possession must be applied \u201cwithin the context of the principle\u201d set out in the <em>Bulna, Rogers </em>and <em>Donohue </em>cases cited in their opinion concerning the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence. I would suggest, rather, that when the accumulation of judicial experience in the review of convictions of a particular type of crime distills a specific rule, widely applied, for admeasuring the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence to sustain a conviction of such a crime, the general rules of sufficiency of evidence should be applied with deference to the special applicability of the particular rule. And so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">But even were we here to apply literally the <em>Bulna </em>rule requiring an acquittal on appeal if the proofs \u201creasonably and fairly make for a hypothesis of innocence\u201d of the crime charged., I cannot agree with the conclusion of the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>that such a determination is called for in this case because of the asserted predicate that the most probable explanation of defendant\u2019s possession of the jewelry if it was stolen is that he received it from the thief without being himself implicated in the theft; and that where the circumstantial proofs point to a crime other than that charged there must be an acquittal. As already noted, the defendant was in possession of at least one of the articles the same day and within less than four hours after they were taken. In my judgment there is a much stronger basis for belief that, if he did not personally steal the jewelry, he was in complicity with another who did, which would justify his conviction as a principal on the hypothesis that he was an accessory in the crime. <em>N. J. S. </em>2A :85-14; <em>State v. Western Union Telegraph Co., </em>12 <em>N. J. </em>468, 495 (1953). The mere fact that the evidence would justify an inference of receiving cannot derogate from the effect of the proofs in permitting the stronger inference of stealing, directly or indirectly. <em>Cf. State v. Giordano, </em>121 <em>N. J. L. </em>469, 472 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1939). The majority opinion, while accepting the hypothesis of receiving, rejects the tenability of the hypothesis of theft on the basis that there is a \u201ctotal absence of proof\u201d thereof. But it is obvious that there is no more direct proof for one theory than the other. There is a circumstantial foundation for either.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">I fear that in their quotation from <em>State v. Donohue, </em>2 <em>N. J. </em>381, 390, 391 (1949), the rule requiring the State in a circumstantial evidence situation to \u201cexclude beyond a reasonable doubt every other hypothesis except that of guilt,\u201d and using it as a guide for appellate action, the majority have lost sight of our <em>caveat </em>in <em>State v. Bulna, </em>46 <em>N. J. Super. </em>313, 317, 318 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957), that this is a rule to be charged the jury, not a rule by which a trial or appellate court may properly undertake itself to admeasure the proofs and thereby determine whether the defendant should be or should have been acquitted. <em>State v. Boyd, </em>137 <em>N. J. L. </em>23, 26 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1948), affirmed 137 <em>N. J. L. </em>615 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1948). The correct rule is explicitly stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>by Judge Clapp in <em>State v. O\u2019Shea, </em>28 <em>N. J. Super. </em>374, 378 (1953), affirmed 16 <em>N. J. </em>1 (1954), by Mr. Justice Case in the <em>Boyd </em>case, <em>supra, </em>and by Judge Daniel J. Brennan in an opinion adopted by the Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Rhams, </em>14 <em>N. J. </em>282, 285 (1954). I am persuaded that the conversion of the rule from one to be charged for the guidance of the jury to one for the admeasurement of the proofs for sufficiency on a motion for acquittal, or by an appellate court on review of a conviction, see <em>State v. Fox, </em>12 <em>N. J. Super. </em>132, 137 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951), is not a sound conception and operates to put the judge in the jury box, as well as to place an intolerable handicap on the State in criminal cases based upon circumstantial evidence. It is functionally as wrong as it would be to say that in a civil ease a judge should direct a verdict for the defendant if <em>he himself </em>finds from his own examination of the evidence that the plaintiff did not sustain his burden by a preponderance of the credible proofs. I do not believe that the \u00a1holdings or the opinions in <em>State v. Donohue, supra, </em>and <em>State v. Rogers, </em>19 <em>N. J. </em>218, 232 (1955), are contrary to the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The rule under discussion was appropriately and correctly charged to the jury in the present case, substantially in the language of the <em>Donohue </em>and <em>Boyd </em>cases, and in the context of the pervading principle that the defendant must be found to be guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. This done, the requirements of the cases were satisfied. So long as we are satisfied that there was a basis for the inference of guilt, and that reasonable minds might differ as to whether it should be drawn consistently with the requirements of finding proof beyond a reasonable doubt and the special rule of excluding every hypothesis except that of guilt, the function of drawing or rejecting the inference was exclusively for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">I find no basis for reversal in any of the other assertions of trial error by the defendant and I would therefore affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
