That when the train reached 53rd street and Eighth avenue, he got off the car; that then he was in a place of safety, and that although the platform was not emptied, but as he himself testified, he had no more space to stand in than before, he, knowing his danger, voluntarily went on the platform again, and that this was negligence on his part. To which appellant\u2019s counsel replied, <em>u </em>I think the respondents ought to have taken two or three from that platform and put them over on the platform, they could have closed the gates then.
