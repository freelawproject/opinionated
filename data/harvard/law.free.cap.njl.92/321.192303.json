Tie was convicted by a vote of four to two of the council. Of those voting in the affirmative one councilman preferred the complaint against him and three councilmen were called as witnesses against him. One of the councilmen who, under the theory of a fair trial required by the mandate of the statute, was supposed at least to have heard the testimony upon which he was called upon to base his judgment, was not present at the first hearing, and, consequently, heard none of the testimony presented at that session. He, subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>quently, was called as a witness against the prosecutor and eventually assisted in determining the inquiry adversely to the prosecutor. It is hardly necessary- in considering the legislative prerequisites of a fair trial to say more than that it is obvious that this proceeding did not conform to the recognized rules governing such procedure. A fair trial, in the generic language of Mr. Webster in the <em>Dartmouth College </em>Case, 4 <em>Wheat. </em>518, 581, is a proceeding \u201cwhich hears before it condemns; which proceeds upon inquiry, and renders judgment only after trial.\u201d Specifically, it is held to be that a hearing shall be accorded to the alleged delinquent by an impartial and disinterested tribunal. 2 <em>Abb. Mun. Corp. </em>1663; <em>Pinkermann </em>v. <em>Rusling, </em>64 <em>Conn. </em>517; <em>Streeter </em>v. Worcester, 177 <em>Mass. </em>29.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The rule is fundamental that a person who has not- heard the testimony in a given case occupies no legal status as arbiter or judge to adjudicate upon the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">This infirmity was accentuated by the fact that the police rules of schedule of alarm calls for failure to' comply Avith which he was adjudged guilty, were not introduced in evidence, and this omission presents a clear failure of proof in the case to sustain the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The resolution in question will be set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
