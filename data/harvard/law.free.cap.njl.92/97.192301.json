GUSTAV M. KUTSCHINSKI, PROSECUTOR.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b141-9\">Submitted July 3, 1918</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AAu\">Decided November 18, 1918.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b141-10\">The act concerning forcible entry and detainer does not confer the right upon a tenant to bring an action, under that act, against his landlord for failing to deliver possession of premises demised to the tenant.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-11\">On <em>certiorari </em>removing judgment of the District Court of tbe First Judicial District of North Hudson.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b141-12\">Before Justices Parker and Minturn.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b141-13\">For the prosecutor, <em>Clarence Kelsey.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b141-14\">For the respondent, <em>Charles </em>W. <em>Kappes.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"ATW\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b141-16\">Minturn, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ay1\">The suit was in the nature of a forcible entry and detainer; its distinctive variation being that the parties were reversed, <em>i. </em>&lt;?., the tenant sued the landlord for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>failing to deliver possession of the demised premises, and attempts to sustain Ms action under the provisions of the act concerning forcible entry and detainer. <em>Comp. Stat., p. </em>2598.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The complaint alleges the agreement of hiring of a dwelling-house in the township of North Bergen, and the payment of one month\u2019s rent thereunder, and then proceeds to allege the placing by the defendant of a padlock on the apartment door, and the use of force and threats to prevent the plaintiff from taking possession; also notice by plaintiff of a demand for possession served upon the defendant; and then concludes that defendant' \u201cwillfully with force and strong hand holds and keeps possession,\u201d by reason whereof he is guilty of unlawful detainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The jury found defendant \u201cguilty of unlawful detainer whereof the complainant hath charged him,\u201d and judgment was accordingly entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The jurisdiction of the District Court to entertain such a suit is challenged <em>in limine, </em>but we do not deem it necessary to pass upon that question,' since the more fundamental inquiry is presented whether the statute giving the right of action concedes a similar right to one occupying the legal status of this plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">Tire district courts are specifically given jurisdiction of this class of actions by the statute creating them. <em>Comp. Stat., p. </em>1962. Whatever legal basis for a claim of this nature the plaintiff has, as a tenant against his landlord, must be found in the statute creating the right of action; for concededly at common law his action <em>civiliter </em>was in trespass <em>quare clausum fregit, </em>ejectment or case. <em>Butts </em>v. <em>Voorhees, </em>13 <em>N. J. L. </em>13.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">The fifth section of our statute concedes the right and remedy to a \u201clandlord or landlords, lessor or lessors, or the person to whom the remainder or reversion\u201d of the <em>locus in quo </em>shall belong.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">The defendant in the action is defined to be, \u201cA tenant or tenants for a term of life or lives, year or years, or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>person or persons who are or shall be In possession\u201d of the <em>locus in quo. </em>Manifestly this record presents a situation of the reverse order, and without considering the other questions presented in the briefs, the conclusion must he obvious that the case, as one of unlawful detainer, was <em>coram non judiee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">In the language of Mr. Justice Elmer, in <em>Houghton </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>33 <em>N. J. L. </em>338, 341, \u201cThe object of the statute was to give a summary and easy remedy to a landlord whose possession was unlawfully detained from him.\u201d' Also <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Nicholson, 2 Id. </em>307.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The judgment will be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
