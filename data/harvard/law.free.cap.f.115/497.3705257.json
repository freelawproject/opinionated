This ground may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">This broad claim cannot be sustained, because the Eickemeyer patent is not for two distinct inventions, \u2014 a novel coil and a new method of double-layer winding, \u2014 but is for a novel coil, or a series of such coils, which may be collected on the armature core in several types of winding. There is no' suggestion in the specification that Eickemeyer was the inventor of a new method of double-layer winding. This method is referred to in the specification simply as \u201cone of the arrangements\u201d in which \u201cit is sometimes desirable\u201d to make such a disposition of the two sides of the coil; and, to make his meaning perfectly clear, the patentee adds these words: \u201cThese coils have the same general characteristics of those previously described.\u201d There is no doubt that all the patentee intended to cover by claim 4 was an alternative arrangement of his novel coil in a particular type of double-layer winding. If the claim is to be read in connection with the specification, or any significance is to be attached to the words \u201csubstantially as described,\u201d it plainly must be limited to the coils of the patent. To hold that the claim is a valid claim not only for the detachable counterpart coils of the patent) but for all forms of coils which are detachable and counterpart when placed on the armature core in the double-layer winding described, would be to extend the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>patent far beyond its original scope and purpose, as is manifest by the clear and oft-repeated statement by Eickemeyer of his invention in the specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Petition for rehearing denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
