We are also of the opinion that the averments in the petition of facts intended to show that the debt of Ewing to one of the petitioners was fraudulently contracted were impertinent, and should have been stricken out. The questions seem too clear to require discussion. '</p>\n<p id=\"b739-15\">The order overruling the demurrer is reversed, with costs, and with instructions to the court below to- make an order sustaining the demurrer, and, at its discretion, authorizing an amendment of the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
