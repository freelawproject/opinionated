We find that the charge as given was correct, and fully stated the propositions of law involved in the case, and that the requested charges, so far as they announce correct propositions of law, were included in and covered by the main charge as given, and hence were properly refused. The judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
