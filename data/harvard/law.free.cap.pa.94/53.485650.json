J., the plaintiff showed title derived through one Eleazer Carey. The defendants set up a title commencing with one John Decker about 1836. In rebuttal the plaintiff offered in evidence a contract between Carey and Decker dated August 29th 1839, for land described as \u201call the land on the north side of the south branch of the Tunkhannock creek, contained in a certain tract in the warrantee \u00f1am\u00e9 of Henry Rogers'.\u201d This to be followed by evidence that Decker held the land in dispute under this contract, and to be followed by evidence of an ejectment by Carey against Decker for the land as described in the aforesaid contract, a recovery in said action, the issue of a \u2022 writ of <em>habere facias possessionem </em>therefor, and the execution of a lease on August 24th 1842, by Carey to Decker, for the land as described in the contract of 1839, when it was agreed by Decker, as the tenant of Carey, that he would deliver up possession of the land on the 1st of April following, and still further to be followed by evidence that Decker remained in possession of the land in dispute by virtue of said lease, and not adversely to plaintiff\u2019s title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-8\">Defendants objected that the evidence was incompetent and inadmissible, because it would vary a writing by parol testimony and transfer the title of land without a writing, in contravention of the Statute of Frauds. That it was inadmissible to prove that a man entered into possession of one piece of land under a contract that calls for another piece of land. That so far as this evidence goes to make out an independent title, it was only competent in chief, and not in rebuttal. Objections sustained and offer rejected. (First assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-9\">The plaintiff also offered in evidence an exemplification from a sheriff\u2019s deed-book of a sheriff\u2019s deed to one Philip Rykert in 1812. The record did not disclose, however, what land was conveyed by this deed. Objected to and objection sustained.

' That such <em>k </em>mistake may be shown by parol evidence, and the instrument reformed accordingly, and this by the exercise of the equity powers inherent in all our courts of civil jurisdiction, is fully declared by the cases of Huss v.

But it was .offered in connection with evidence that John Decker held the land in dispute under the contract. This was sufficient to entitle the contract to go to the jury. If Decker actually held the land under this contract, it was competent evidence; its effect was for the jury and they'might infer a mistake in the warrantee name used therein. The objection that it should have been offered in chief was not well taken. The plaintiff showed title derived through Eleazer Carey. The' defendants set u'p title by possession, commencing with John Decker. To rebut this the plaintiff proposed to show that Decker\u2019s possession was not adverse to plaintiff\u2019s title, but on the contrary that his possession of the land in dispute was obtained by virtue of this contract with Carey, and that subsequently, Carey brought ejectment thereon against Decker and recovered, and issued a writ of <em>habere facias possessionem; </em>that to avoid being turned out, Decker leased the land in dispute, and on the 24th of August 1872, executed a writing under seal, intended to cover this land, and agreeing as tenant of Carey, to deliver up the possession thereof on the first of April ensuing. This evidence was strictly rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">There is nothing upon the record to show that the evidence .rejected by the court, and which forms the subject of the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>assignment, was irrelevant. ' The description contained in the <em>vena, ex. </em>is not given, nor are we informed what land the sheriff\u2019s deed embraced. We can guess, it is true, but that does not enable us to say the rejection of the offer was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
