This appraisement was made in accordance with the provisions of the second section of the above act. Upon the basis thus taken, the valuation amounted to $51,652,650. The'tax on this amount was $154,957.95, which sum was paid on January 15th 1880. The accounting officers of the state were not satisfied wdth this appraisement, and they made a valuation' of the capital stock based upon its actual value in cash, as ascertained by its selling price in public market during the period extending from the 1st to the 15th day of November 1879. This calculation resulted in a valuation of $66,804,094, on which the tax was $200,412.27, or $45,454.32 over the amount already paid by the company, and this amount said officers settled against the company as the balance due to the Commonwealth. The company appealed from this settlement to the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin county, and after the case was at issue upon a plea of <em>nil </em>debet, an agreement was filed, wherein it was, inter alia, stipulated :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-7\">3. That the valuation of stock on which the settlement in this ease was made, was based upon the actual value of the stock in cash, as ascertained by its selling price in public market during the period extending from the first to the fifteenth days of November 1879.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-8\">4. That this case shall be tried by the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin county, without the intervention of a jury, under the provisions of the Act of Assembly of 22d April 1874, Pamph. L. 1874, p. 109, and the company shall have the right to take an appeal from the settlement made against it by the accounting officers, and to take a w'rit of error to the Supreme Court without the entry of security.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-9\">The court, Henderson, A. L. J., found the foregoing facts, and decided in favor of the Commonwealth for $47,727.03. Exceptions were filed which the court overruled, and judgment was entered on the court\u2019s decision. The defendant then took this writ, and alleged that the court erred in not holding that the true measure for fixing the value of the stock for taxation under the Act o\u00ed 1879, for the year, ending the first Monday in November 1879, is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>average market value during the said year, when not less than the amount indicated by dividends, and not the average value between the- first and the fifteenth of November 1879.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b480-6\"><em>James A. Logan </em>and <em>Hall $ </em>Jordan, for plaintiff in error.\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACA\">When, under the second section of the Act of 1879, the dividend equals or exceeds six per cent, <em>during the year </em>ending the first Monday of November, then such dividend is the measure of liability for taxation; but when the dividend is less, then the secretary and treasurer are to appraise the stock at its actual value in cash, hot less, however, than the average price which it \u201csold for <em>during said year,\u201d </em>and not less than the value indicated by the \u201camount of the dividends made or declared\u201d within that year.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-7\">The time for making the appraisement is one thing; but the period to be embraced within it is another and quite different thing. For the latter the statute fixes but one neriod, the whole financial year, and neither the state officers nor the company officers can legally take or adopt any other. It is unreasonable to suppose the legislature ever intended to designate a time to be included in the appraisement other than that for which the tax is imposed; and there is nothing in the statute to show it ever so intended. The intent was to first during the year fix the value as determined by the dividends when they showed a value equal to par, or more, by amounting to six per cent, or above, or when this failed, and the stock presumably below par, that an appraisement should fix its actual value within the year as the measure of taxation. Moreover, the date of appraisement thus adopted by the state officers, was within the next succeeding financial year to that now under consideration; and, in the nature of the case, may be included by the officers of the corporation in its return for the-financial year ending on the first Monday of November 1880.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-8\">If the Commonwealth\u2019s position is within the letter it is not within the spirit and intention of the act. The letter must, in the construction of the act, yield to the intention as gathered from the whole body of the act: Potter\u2019s Dwarris on Statutes 189; Rex <em>v. </em>Loxdale, 1 Burr. 447; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Fraim, 4 Harris 163; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Navigation Co., 16 P. F. Smith 81; Durousseau <em>v. </em>United States, 6 Cranch 314. If there be any doubt about the proper construction of a statute for raising revenue, such doubt will always be resolved in favor of that construction which conforms to the power of the legislature : Cooley on Taxation 41, 42; Washington Avenue, 19 P. F. Smith 352.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b480-9\"><em>Lyman H. Grilbert, </em>Deputy Attorney-General, and <em>Henry W. Palmer, </em>Attorney-General, for the Commonwealth-</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJG\">The right to make an assessment for taxation is a matter of statutory grant, and without express warrant of law does not exist. Where it has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>conferred it must be exercised in the manner in which the legislature directs. These are elementary doctrines of taxation. When a duty of assessing for taxation is laid upon any tax official, the rule of law, unless words to the contrary are used, requires the taxable property to be assessed according to the value it bears at the time when the assessment shall be made.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Abi\">June 19th 1880.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-6\">Cooley upon Taxation, p. 261, states: \u201cEvery person is therefore to be taxed for the year upon his personalty, estimated as of the time of the assessment, and every parcel of land, according <em>to </em>its value at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-7\">Accepting this as an accurate statement of the law upon this subject, we contend that where there is a direction to assess it is necessary to use direct and positive language in the taxing statute to justify the assessment being based upon any other value than that which the property represents at the time the assessment is made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-8\">The Act of 1879, in unmistakable words, requires the assessment to be made \u201cbetween the first and the fifteenth days of November of each year.\u201d If \u201c actual value in cash\u201d is equal to or greater than the average price which said stock sold for during said year, and not less than the price or value as indicated or measured by the amount of dividends made or declared, in both instances the \u201cactual value in cash\u201d is to be the price at which the stock shall be assessed, and nothing in the section alters the. rule of law that the value in cash is to be the cash value at the time of the assessment. It is only when the \u201c actual value in cash\u201d is lower than the value as ascertained by these two tests that it is to be disregarded and the taxable value of the stock is not to be its cash value at the time of the assessment. Whether the method of making the assessment in this case was well or badly chosen is not a question for judicial concern or decision: Kittanning Coal Co. <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 29 P. F. Smith 100. To the objection that the tax is measured by a period of time in regard to which no tax is imposed, the ready reply is that the legislature has the authority to do so.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b481-9\">Mr. Justice Paxson,</author>\n<p id=\"AqDz\">delivered the opinion of the court,</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">This case involves but a single question. The Pennsylvania Railroad Company having declared less than six per cent, dividends for the financial year ending on the first Monday of November 1879, it became necessary, under the Act of 7th of June of that year, Parnph. L. 172, to make an appraisement of its capital stock for the purposes of taxation. This was done by the secretary and treasurer, and a return thereM made to the auditor-general\u2019s office. The par value of the stock so returned was $63,870,200, and its cash value $51,652,650. The tax on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>sum, at three mills on the dollar, amounted to $154,975.95, which was promptly paid by the company. The value of the stock was fixed by taking its average market value from the first Monday of November 1878, to the first Monday of November 1879.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The auditor-general and state treasurer not being satisfied with \u25a0 the valuation placed upon the stock by the company\u2019s officers, proceeded to make another valuation, as authorized by the second section of the Act of 1879, and fixed its value at $66,804,094, the tax upon which amounts to $200,412.27, being $45,454.32 in excess of the amount paid by the company. This result was obtained by taking its selling price in the public market from the 1st to the 15th of November 1879. The court below sustained the action of the state authorities, and gave judgment against the company for $47,727.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The contention on the part of the company is that the stock should have been appraised at its average selling value during the year for which the tax is laid, and not at its value from the 1st to the 15th of November succeeding; in other words, that the stock must be appraised at the average price for which it sold for during the year.</p>\n<p id=\"AF7N\">The Act of Assembly does not say so. It requires an appraise* ment to be made between the 1st and 15th day of November, of the stock of non-dividend paying corporations, or those paying less than six per cent., said stock is to be appraised at its cash value, '\u201cnot less, however, than the average price which said stock sold for during said year.\u201d If the legislature intended to have the stock appraised at its average price during the year, it was very easy to' have said so. We find nothing in the act from which such intent can be gathered with any reasonable certainty. On the contrary, the use of the words-\u201c not less, however, than the \u00e1verage price which said stock sold for during said year,\u201d necessarily implies the power to appraise the stock at more than its average price during the year. The construction of the act contended for by the company would expunge the words above quoted, or render them nugatory. It is our duty to give them effect if consistent with other portions of the statute. They mean just this: that if the stock of the compapy is lower when the appraisement is made in November than it was during the previous year, it shall be appraised at not less than the average selling price for the year. On the other hand, if it is higher in November, it may be appraised at its increased value. If it be objected to this view that the advantage is all on the side of the state, we may safely concede it to be so. The object of the act was to raise revenue, and. it appears to have been drawn with care, and in the interests of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">We are of opinion that the learned judge of the court b.elow ruled the law correctly, and his judgment is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
