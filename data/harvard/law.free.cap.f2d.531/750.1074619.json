The trial court dismissed the action for Woodburn\u2019s failure to comply with 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d). That section provides that \u201c[n]o civil action may be commenced . until the [plaintiff] . . . has given the Secretary [of Labor] . . notice of an intent to file such action . . . within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful practice occurred\u201d. The district court heard testimony with respect to LTV\u2019s motion to dismiss and found that Woodburn orally notified the Department of Labor of his intention to sue more than 180 days after his allegedly discriminatory discharge from LTV. In light of its finding that LTV\u2019s failure to offer Woodburn reemployment did not constitute a continuing violation of ADEA, the court held that such notice, even if otherwise valid, was untimely-</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">The question on appeal, then, is whether a discriminatory discharge and failure to reemploy the plaintiff amount to such a continuing violation that the 180-day notice requirement is tolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">We note first that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-9\">the 180 day notice was intended to insure that potential defendants would become aware of their status and the possibility of litigation reasonably soon after the alleged discrimination .... In turn this would promote the good faith negotiation of employers during the 60 day conciliation period</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqh\"><em>Powell v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., </em>5 Cir. 1974, 494 F.2d 485, 488. Moreover, we have observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6F\">the notice alerts the Secretary of Labor to situations which affect other employees and allows him to determine whether agency litigation should be initiated. . It enhances employee/employer relations by encouraging voluntary rectification and precludes premature resort to the courts, conserving judicial resources.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">Edwards <em>v. Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Sales, Inc., </em>5 Cir. 1975, 515 F.2d 1195, 1198. With this understanding of the purposes of \u00a7 626(d), we turn to the precise question presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">In <em>Powell, supra, </em>we rejected a similar \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d argument attempting to justify late notice. There, the plaintiff alleged a discriminatory failure to hire. We found no sufficient continuing violation. The notice was filed more than 180 days after the employer had hired the last person to fill the vacancy that the plaintiff had sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-13\">Here, it appears that hiring and firing in jobs similar to Woodburn\u2019s continued after Woodburn\u2019s discharge. In <em>Powell, </em>the Court noted that the employer had stopped hiring altogether. <em>Powell, </em>therefore, is arguably support for the theory that continued hiring of others constitutes a \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d. To so hold, however, would almost eliminate any practical effect of the notice provision. It would be unreasonable to construe \u00a7 626(d) so as to frustrate the intent of Congress to encourage mediation and reconciliation. Moreover, as has been suggested, \u201cthe critical factor in finding a continuing violation [after an] initial layoff [is] . . . the repeated refusal of the company to rehire the plaintiff in accordance with [his] seniority rights as provided for in [a] collective bargaining agreement\u201d. <em>Hiscott v. General Electric Co., </em>6 Cir. 1975, 521 F.2d 632, 635. LTV had no contractual obligation to rehire Woodburn.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-15\">There was no continuing violation in <em>Powell, </em>and no evidence here of \u201covert, documented company policies\u201d, 494 F.2d at 489, which might constitute an excuse for late notice. The plaintiff, by failing to give the required notice within the statutory time period, has no cause of action under ADEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
