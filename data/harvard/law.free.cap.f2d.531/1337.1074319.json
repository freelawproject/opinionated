We affirm the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-5\">The Government began deportation proceedings against Tuan in September 1973. At his show cause hearing petitioner conceded his deportability under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1251(a)(9), but he sought an adjustment of his status from nonimmigrant to permanent resident, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1255. The Immigration Judge refused Tuan\u2019s request for adjustment, (i) on the basis that he was statutorily ineligible for readjustment because his required labor certification, 8 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1182(a)(14), was issued pursuant to misrepresentation by Tuan, and (ii) in the exercise of his discretion on the basis of his finding that Tuan had a preconceived intent to remain in the United States which was not balanced by any equities warranting adjustment of status. The Board dismissed the appeal on the basis of (ii), Tuan\u2019s preconceived intent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1396-6\">On direct appeal to this Court, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1105a, we review the denial of discretionary relief narrowly. <em>Jarecha v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, </em>5 Cir., 1969, 417 F.2d 220, 224. We find that the Immigration Judge\u2019s conclusion that Tuan had preconceived intent to remain in the United States was based on substantial evidence<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and was not arbitrary or capricious. Tuan was accorded all of the requirements of due process by a full hearing before the Immigration Judge and appeal to the Board as well as this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1396-8\">. The Board did not rule on (i) because of conflicting evidence concerning the issuance of the labor certification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1396-9\">. Tuan entered on a business visitor\u2019s visa representing the Full Hand Company of Taiwan. Within a month he filed an application for his labor certification using a letter of recommendation prepared by a Taiwan employer six months before Tuan\u2019s arrival in the United States.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
