Justice Swepston</author>\n<p id=\"Agf\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The question involved in this appeal is the constitutionality of Ch. 209, of the Public Acts of 1955, known as \"The Industrial Building Bond Act of 1955\u201d. That is, whether or not said Act and the actions which are sought to be taken thereunder violate Art. II, Section 29 of our State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Said Act need not be copied in this opinion in full but is attached hereto as Appendix A (see post, p. 20) and only the substance of such parts of said Act will be stated as deemed advisable.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Art. II, Section 29 of the State Constitution provides in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEi\">\u201cSec. 29. Counties and towns \u2014 Power to tax\u2014 Credit. \u2014 The General Assembly shall have power to authorize the several counties and incorporated towns in this State, to impose taxes for County and Corporation purposes respectively, in such manner as shall be prescribed by law; and all property shall be taxed according to its value, upon the principles established in regard to State taxation. But the credit of no County, City or Town shall be given or loaned to or in aid of any person, company, association or corporation, except upon an election to be first held by the qualified voters of such county, city or town, and the assent of three-fourths of the votes cast at said election. Nor shall any county, city or town become a stockholder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>with, others in any company, association or corporation except upon a like election, and the assent of a like majority. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Pursuant to this Act, the town of Lebanon has made a contract with Hartmann Luggage Company, a Wisconsin corporation, for the lease for a period of 25 years, with renewal privileges, of a factory building to be constructed by said municipality with the proceeds of the bonds authorized by the Tennessee Industrial &amp; Agricultural Development Commission and the Building Committee which after a full hearing, has made all necessary findings required by the terms of said Act and has authorized the issuance and sale of $350,000 of bonds in accordance with said statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">All other necessary legal steps have been taken by the City of Lebanon including an election by which much more than three-fourths of the qualified voters, as required by the statute, have voted in favor of the execution of the purposes permitted by said statute by the City of Lebanon.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The complainant, R. B. McConnell, being the elected and qualified Commissioner of Finance &amp; Revenue of said City of Lebanon, by reason of certain published opinions of this Court, entertains a doubt as to his authority to execute and attest the bonds intended to be issued under said proceedings. Hence, he has filed this bill seeking a declaratory judgment as to the validity of same. All of the foregoing facts are averred in the original bill and the fact that said Commissioner of Finance &amp; Revenue of said City deems said proceedings to be unconstitutional. The answer of the City of Lebanon admits all of these averments of the original bill except the allegation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>^constitutionality of these Acts, -which the answer asserts to be in all respects constitntional. The answer farther avers that for the period from 1900 to 1950, according to the Federal Censas, the Coanty of Wilson has lost 760 citizens and from 1950 to 1955, said Coanty has lost 147 citizens. That said loss has not been dae to lack of birth of children becaase in the City of Lebanon and Wilson Coanty the school rooms are crowded and overflowing; that 10 and 20 years ago whereas they had 40 to 60 children in one of the grades in elementary school with two classes and two teachers, they now have 250 to 300 children in the same classes in the elementary schools with 8 and 9 teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\">That there is only one reason for this loss of popalation, which is a lack of job opportnniti.es for the citizens of Lebanon and Wilson Coanty, which forces their citizens to migrate to other states which are more indns-trialized and provide employment for them. Farther that the State of Tennessee, in 1950, lost one Congressional seat becaase it did not keep pace with the increased popalation generally over the preceding ten-year period, and that if the same rate of migration of the people of said City and Coanty continue at the same rate, the State will lose another Congressional seat in the next decade.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">Farther, that from 1950 to 1956 the State of Tennessee lost 80,000 citizens throagh migration and that said condition has been the sabject of articles appearing in some of the leading newspapers of the State. The resalt of all of the above, it is averred, is that the cities, coanties and the State of Tennessee are sn\u00edfering a great financial loss by reason of the cost incnrred in edacating its children, which apon finishing school or college, are forced to emi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>grate to other states where job opportunities and the quantity of pay is more attractive and available. It is further averred that the average, family income throughout the United States is $3,400 as compared to the average family income of $2,400 in the City of Nashville.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Further, that the State of Tennessee and its component parts consisting of the counties and towns throughout the State, have in a number of instances lost industries to other states, especially in the south, because this State heretofore has had no financial plan or program effective through the instrumentality of the arms of the State Government, that is, the counties and cities.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The Chancellor heard the cause on bill and answer. He filed a full memorandum opinion in which he held first, that the said statute and the proceedings taken thereunder by the City of Lebanon were for a public purpose. Secondly, that even though for the sole private purpose to aid private industry, yet since the bonds were issued pursuant to the terms of the statute and were ratified by a three-fourths vote in the referendum election, that they would be valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Counsel for appellees make the same insistence in their reply brief on appeal. That is, that the bonds are issued for a public purpose, but that, even if they were for the purpose purely private of aiding private industry, they would nevertheless be valid under the second paragraph of said above quoted constitutional provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">We are not prepared to agree with this insistence by counsel for appellees that, even though these bonds are not issued for a corporate or public purpose, that they would nevertheless be valid because they were approved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>by a vote of three-four tbs of the qualified voters. Counsel cites <em>Azbill v. Lexington Mfg. Co., </em>188 Tenn. 477, 221 S.W. 2d 522; <em>Ferrell v. Doak, </em>152 Tenn. 88, 275 S.W. 29, 46 A.L.R. 590; and <em>Berry v. Shelby County, </em>189 Tenn. 532, 201 S.W. 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">So far as we have been able to find there are only two cases in Tennessee that even intimate that the second paragraph, <em>supra, </em>of said constitutional provision authorizes the lending of aid or credit for a private purpose to a private individual or corporation on a mere vote of the qualified number of voters. Both of these cases are in 188 Tenn. The first is <em>Carter v. Beeler, </em>188 Tenn. 328, 335, 219 S.W. 2d 195, 198, in which there is an inadvertent statement referring to the second paragraph, <em>supra, </em>of the constitutional provision relating to the lending of credit, and it is clearly erroneous. It is there stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">\u2018\u2018This provision of the Constitution applies to situations where the credit of a county or city is to a private corporation or individual <em>and for purposes that are not county purposes. Berry v. Shelby County, </em>139 Tenn. 532, 201 S.W. 748; <em>Patterson v. Washington County, </em>136 Tenn. 60, 188 S.W. 613.\u201d (Emphasis ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The latter part of the above quotation is not supported by either case cited. In the Patterson case (136 Term. 60, 188 S.W. 615), the <em>purpose was public, </em>that is, the building of county roads and the Court simply held that that did come under the first clause of said constitutional provision and not under the clause we have described herein as the second paragraph. It merely stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">\u201cThe clause last referred to inhibits the lending of credit to a private enterprise except upon an election to be held under its provisions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>That, however, is a far cry from stating that such private enterprise need not be the means of effectuating a corporate purpose. For example, a city subscribing to stock in a gas light corporation, a private enterprise, to be constructed for the principal purpose of supplying gas to the city and its inhabitants, as in the case of <em>City of Memphis v. Memphis Gayoso Gas Co. </em>(before 1870) 56 Tenn. 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\">Moreover, in <em>Berry v. Shelby County, </em>supra, after referring on page 540 of 139 Tenn., on page 750 of 201 S.W. to said second paragraph, which originated in the Constitution of 1870, Mr. Chief Justice M. M. Neil stated unequivocally on page 541 of 139 Tenn., on page 750 of 201 S.W.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-4\">\u201cFurthermore, such lending of aid or subscription of stock must be for a county or corporation purpose, under the express terms of the constitutional provision quoted: and Mr. Justice Turley, in <em>Nichol v. (Mayor, etc., of Town of) Nashville, </em>supra (28 Tenn. 252), suggested that this would be true even without a formal requirement of the Constitution. However, such is the positive requirement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">In further analysis and exposition of said Art. II, Sec. 29, after defining direct and indirect purpose, it is made clear in the <em>Berry case, </em>supra, that the requirement that the purpose be corporate pervades the entire provision. On page 543 of 139 Tenn., on page 750 of 201 S.W., it is pointed out that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">If the purpose be direct, and be accomplished by direct action of the county or city, as in building, or employing others to build for it, the county\u2019s bridge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>or the city\u2019s waterworks, to be owned by the county or the city, the matter falls under the first part of section 29, no election is required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Immediately following that, it is stated that even if a direct, as well as an indirect, purpose is to be accomplished by a county or city lending its credit to some other and separate entity, or by subscribing to stock therein, then the facts fall within the second provision which requires an election, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Then in the same <em>Berry case, </em>supra, 139 Tenn. on page 543, 201 S.W. on page 750, the Court cited <em>Colburn v. Chattanooga Western Railroad Co., </em>94 Tenn. 43, 28 S.W. 298. In that case, the County of Hamilton had entered into a contract for the railroad company to unite with it in the building of a public county bridge to be used jointly by the railroad and the county. The special act purporting to authorize this contract <em>did not contain a provision for submitting the matter to a vote of the people. </em>The Court held, says Mr. Chief Justice M. M. Neil, that for this reason the contract was void; that it constituted a lending of the credit of the county to the railroad company, and, <em>though for an undoubted county purpose, </em>which the county by its own individual efforts, a county bridge, might have rendered effectual, yet it could not unite with another in such an enterprise without the sanction of the popular vote under the second paragraph of Section 29, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">In the Berry case the enabling act and the resolution of the county court sought to accomplish a public purpose, that is, to <em>donate </em>a sum of money to Bolton College, a trust for the education of the poor white children of Shelby County, but the act was invalid, because it did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>not require an election by the qualified voters of the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">In the Colburn case on page 53 of 94 Tenn., on page 30\u00cd of 28 S.W. last full paragraph, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">\u201cIt is evident that the letter and spirit of this provision is that the county shall not be a stockholder not joint owner with any company, association, or corporation in any enterprise or improvement, <em>although it mag be one in which the county may be otherwise authorized to enter.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Again, in <em>Johnson City v. Charleston, C. &amp; C. Railroad Co., </em>100 Tenn. 138, 143, 44 S.W. 670, 671, after quoting the first three clauses of Art. II, Section 29, that opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">\u201cHere are three sentences or clauses. The first, which constituted the whole of that section in the constitution of 1834, states, generally, the purposes for which the legislature may \u2018authorize\u2019 counties and incorporated towns to impose taxes. The second and third, which originated with the constitution of 1870, and were designed to cut off existing* evils, and prevent their recurrence, define certain things which no county, town, or city may do <em>in the exercise of such authority when granted, except upon a prescribed condition.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">The other case in which there appears to be a statement contrary to the above is <em>Azbill v. Lexington Mfg. Co., </em>supra. On page 483, of 188 Tenn., <em>on page </em>525 of 221 S.W. 2d it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-10\"><em>\u201cFerrell v. Doak, </em>supra, is controlling here. That case makes it clear that the town of Lexington is without authority to expend the tax money in the construct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>tion of this factory, or to give its credit to this private corporation without first having been anthorized to submit and then submitting the matter to and procuring the approval of the voters as required by Article 2, Section 29 of our Constitution. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">The result in that case was correct for two reasons: first, because under <em>Ferrell v. Doak, </em>it was not a <em>corporate </em>purpose and second, even if it had been a corporate purpose, there was <em>no </em>provision for an <em>election </em>by the people of the town of Lexington. It is so well settled and so fundamental that the public taxes or, which is the same thing, the public credit can not be donated or applied to anything but a public use or corporate purpose that this statement in the Azbill case can not be construed otherwise than as an inadvertence. No such thing could be done even if the vote of the people was 100%, because, if they could vote a gift to one individual or corporation, they could likewise vote a gift to each citizen or corporation in the city or the county, which, of course, was never contemplated by the constitutional provision and could wreck the economy of any city or county or State.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Taxation is a mode of raising revenue for <em>public purposes only. Taylor McBean &amp; Co. v. Chandler, </em>56 Tenn. 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">This is so even when there is no express restriction in the Constitution and such a constitutional provision is simply declaratory of the common law. 84 C.J.S. Taxation secs. 13, 14, p. 64. Also, 51 Am.Jur. 372, sec. 321 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">A governmental body can not lend its credit or subscribe for stock or issue bonds without the possibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>that, in the absence of fnnds on-pay-day, it may have to raise fnnds by taxation. See Judge Turley\u2019s statement in <em>Nichol v. Mayor of Town of Nashville, </em>supra, 28 Tenn. at pages 264-265.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The resnlt of the foregoing is that assignment No. 3 must be sustained. We have deemed it necessary to dispose of this assignment first, because if the fact alone that more than three-fourths of the qualified voters of the city of Lebanon had voted in favor of the foregoing proceedings was a sufficient compliance with said second paragraph of the constitutional provision in question, then there would be no necessity for considering the first proposition raised, that is, whether the proposed venture is a corporate' purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Coming now to the more difficult question of what is a corporate purpose, there is no need to refer to the number of Tennessee cases which deal with corporate purposes or county purposes, because they have been collated in <em>Berry v. Shelby County, </em>supra, on page 541 and page 542 of 139 Tenn., on page 750 of 201 S.W. and our own cases declare that what is a county or corporate purpose is incapable of an exact and all-inclusive definition and that each case must turn upon its own facts. That is the universal rule, see 8 Vand.L.R., 732, et seq.; 51 Am. Jur. 377, sec. 326, et seq.; 84 C.J.S. Taxation sec. 15 et seq., p. 65. In the early case of <em>Nichol v. Mayor of Town of Nashville, </em>28 Tenn. 252, the Court said in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">\u201cThey are or may be made to be as numerous and diversified as may be found requisite by experience to promote the peace, health, comfort and prosperity of its corporators, and anything which promotes these things is or may be constituted a legitimate corporate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>purpose. Perhaps I might divide corporate purposes into two classes: those which are direct and those which are indirect. A direct corporate purpose might be styled to be which, in its direct and immediate consequences, operates upon the interests of the corporation. Such would be all police regulations for the government of the town, the promotion of good order, the protection of its citizens from the lawless, the suppression of vice, the opening and preservation of highways, streets, and alleys, the erection of market-houses and hospitals, supplying the town with water, etc. And indirect corporative purpose might be styled to be one which does not, in its direct and immediate consequences, operate upon the corporations but the beneficial effects of which are to be experienced in a remoter degree, and which have to be traced to their source before they can be duly comprehended and appreciated. Such are all facilities of canals, roads, the improvement of rivers, by which their navigable use is extended, by all which the commercial interest of a town is increased and expanded by reason of the increased facilities of communication thus furnished, by means of which the wealth of its population, individually, and collectively, is increased, with a consequent increase of the comforts and enjoyments of life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">In one of the later cases involving a condemnation proceeding, that is, <em>Knoxville Housing Authority, Inc., v. City of Knoxville, </em>174 Tenn. 76, 83, 123 S.W. 2d 1085, 1087, the late Mr. Chief Justice Green, after stating the insistence of the property owners whose property was about to be condemned, that the Housing Authority was not a public use, had this to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>\u201cThe courts reason that the primary object of all government is to foster the health, morals and safety of the people. That slum districts with their filthy, congested, weather-exposed living quarters are breeding places of disease, immorality and crime. The character of the houses in such districts make of them a fire hazard. The existence of such districts depresses the taxable value of neighboring property and deprives the State of revenue. The State is also put to great expense in combating disease, crime and conflagration originating in such localities. They menace not only the health, safety and morals of those living therein, but since disease, crime, immorality and fires can with difficulty be confined to points of origin, these districts are a menace to the whole community \u2014 indeed, a menace to the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-5\">\u201cWithout dissent, therefore, the courts have reached the conclusion that slum clearance was a <em>public purpose </em>and that Housing Authorities serve a <em>public use. * * *\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">In spite of the broad definitions of the preceding two cases, as well as cases in our State intervening those two, the traditional concept has been that taxation to aid private concerns and individuals has customarily been accepted as not being for a public purpose, 51 Am.Jur. 408, sec. 372; <em>Citizens\u2019 Savings &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. City of Topeka, </em>1874, 20 Wall. 655, 87 U.S. 655, 22 L.Ed. 455, cited in 8 Vand.L.R., 734, <em>supra. </em>Our own case of <em>Ferrell v. Doak, </em>supra, 1925, followed the above majority view and cited the above mentioned Topeka case, as well as others holding the same view. This case, at first blush, would seem to be conclusive of the question here in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>We are of opinion, however, that the instant case can be sonndly distinguished from that case. In the first place, the authority for the attempted issue and sale of $200,000 of bonds was a Private Act relating to the city of Lebanon alone. It did not purport to express any public policy of the State. Second, it did not undertake to set out any standards or checks for guiding the authorities who are to have charge of the making of the contracts for the necessary land, or the contracts for the buildings, or for the leasing of the buildings when completed, nor any of the other similar matters contained in the present Act under consideration. It does not appear from the opinion whether the provision of the Private Act requiring a vote of the citizens of Lebanon was complied with or not. The fact that it was not mentioned in the opinion, however, and that the case was decided on the broad principle that it was not a corporate purpose would more strongly indicate that there was an election, for otherwise that point would have in all probability been raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Again, there was a mere recitation in the first section that it was necessary to properly protect the industrial interests of a city by having these buildings available for any factories, mills or manufacturing plants who might wish to locate there and that same would increase the business interests of the community and bring in new citizens but there is no indication of any crisis, so to speak, involved in the factual situation. Moreover, another object recited was that it was not right and proper for any citizens to spend their money for the housing of such industries as might want to come to the town and that the burden should be distributed over all taxpayers and citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>On the other hand, 30 years later we have a Public Act, the one under discussion, which in Section 3 thereof clearly describes the evils which demand corrective public action and expressly and emphatically declares the public policy of the State and in subsection (h) thereof declares <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>that the means and measures herein authorized to promote said enterprises are, as a matter of public policy, for the public purposes of the several municipalities, and the State of Tennessee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Then Section 8 provides for the findings that must be made by the State committee which is set up by Section 6 before a county or a city may undertake to consummate a transaction authorized by this statute, and before the bonds can be approved by a vote of the citizens, they must be approved by the State Building Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\"> Then with the showing made by the allegations in the answer which must be taken as true on a hearing on a bill and answer, we have presented to us a situation that is quite different from that existing 30 years ago. It is the difference between a mere incident and a virtual crisis. Thus becomes applicable the principle of constitutional law that a legislative enactment may be held unconstitutional under one set of facts and constitutional under another set of facts as illustrated by the authorities cited in the brief. <em>Kansas City So. R. Co. v. Anderson, </em>233 U.S. 325, 34 S.Ct. 599, 58 L.Ed. 983; <em>Chastleton Corp. v. Sinclair, </em>264 U.S. 543, 44 S.Ct. 405, 68 L.Ed. 841; <em>Nashville Chattanooga. &amp; St. Louis Ry. v. Walters, </em>294 U.S. 405, 55 S.Ct. 486, 79 L.Ed. 949, the last being a case arising in this State. Hence, we do not overrule <em>Ferrell v. Doak, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">This Court will take judicial notice of the change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>in the agricultural economy of this section of the country due in a large measure to the mechanization of farm operations, thus causing the country people to move to the towns and cities where work is available and, if work is not available in those places within the State, then the emigration occurs to other states, principally where industrial jobs and a weekly payroll are available.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\">Under such conditions as are made to appear herein, as well as what is judicially known by this Court, is the State held to be powerless and to be forced to remain supine and impotent? We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"> It is axiomatic and a fundamental principle of representative government that the power of the Legislature is restricted only by the Constitution of the State. It is also a fundamental rule that an act of the Legislature will be upheld if it can be justified upon any rational ground. <em>Joyner v. Priest, </em>173 Tenn. 320, 117 S.W. 2d 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">In <em>Citizens\u2019 Savings &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. City of Topeka, </em>supra, 22 Wall. 664, 87 U.S. 664, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">\u201cIt is undoubtedly the duty of the legislature which imposes or authorizes municipalities to impose a tax to see that it is not to be used for purposes of private interest instead of a public use, and the courts can only be justified in interposing when a violation of this principle is clear and the reason for interference cogent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">In <em>Davis v. City of Taylor, </em>1934, 123 Tex. 39, 67 S.W. 2d 1033, 1034, the Texas Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">\u201cUnless a court can say that the purposes for which public funds are expended are clearly not public purposes, it would not be justified in holding invalid a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>legislative act or provision in a city charter providing funds for such purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">In <em>People ex rel. Thompson v. Chicago &amp; N. W. Ry. Co., </em>1947, 397 Ill. 319, 74 N.E. 2d 510, 512, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">\u201cTo justify a court in declaring a tax invalid on the ground that it was not imposed for a public purpose, the absence of a public interest must be clear and palpable. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">See, also, <em>State ex rel. Thomson v. Giessel, </em>1953, 265 Wis. 207, 60 N.W. 2d 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">It is a widely known fact that the North and East have been losing industry to the South and West in this country; that industry is being located in States where all things are most favorable; that population shift is controlled by the location of industry. The result is, as reflected by the record herein, the matter of inducing industry to locate in this State has become a matter of great public concern, as so made to appear in Section 3 of the questioned Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">The modern tendency is to meet that challenge by appropriate legislation. See <em>Albritton v. City of Winona, </em>181 Miss. 75, 178 So. 799, 115 A.L.R. 1436; <em>Dyche v. City of London, Ky., </em>288 S.W. 2d 648; <em>Miller v. Policy Jury of Washington Parish, </em>226 La. 8, 74 So. 2d 394; <em>Carmichael v. Southern Coal &amp; Coke Co., </em>301 U.S. 495, 57 S.Ct. 868, 81 L.Ed. 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">The alternative of the failure to do so is to make probable a gradual lowering of the standard of living of the mass of citizens of this State. An inadequate number of jobs means an over supply of labor, which usually results <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>ultimately in a lowering of wages. Low wages and unemployment are twin evils that usually lead to a sub-standard diet, hunger, ill health and even crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">To provide against such evils is clearly a public or corporate purpose. To accomplish that purpose, the legislature may provide any method or means not prohibited by the Constitution, State or Federal. By the within statute it is sought to be accomplished by authorizing a city or a county, acting under reasonable safeguards provided by the statute, to lend its aid to a private corporation, if approved by vote of the people in accordance with the second section of Art. II, Section 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">We do not conceive that <em>Holly v. City of Elizabethton, </em>193 Tenn. 46, 241 S.W. 2d 1001, or <em>Darnell v. Montgomery County, </em>202 Tenn. 560, 308 S.W. 2d 373, are relevant to either question in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">In the light of the foregoing factual situation and the authorities referred to, we are of opinion that Ch. 209, Public Acts of 1955, is a valid enactment and that said statute and the proceedings of the town of Lebanon thereunder are not in violation of Art. II, Section 29 of the Constitution of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The assignment to the contrary is overruled and the decree of the Chancellor as modified is affirmed. The costs will be paid by the City of Lebanon.</p>\n<judges id=\"b533-8\">Neil, Chiee Justice, and Pbewitt, Justice, dissent.</judges>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>Appendix A</p>\n<p id=\"Alv\">Public Chapter No. 209</p>\n<p id=\"AZ3\">Senate Bill No. 501</p>\n<p id=\"A9R\">By</p>\n<p id=\"AGp\">Maddox</p>\n<p id=\"AIi\">Industrial Building Bond Act</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">An Act authorizing any county or incorporated city or town of this State individually or jointly to construct, acquire, purchase, reconstruct, improve, better or extend industrial buildings; providing for the leasing or rental of such buildings to industrial concerns; authorizing and regulating the issuance of revenue and revenue deficiency bonds for financing such industrial buildings; providing for the payment of such bonds, including authority to pledge the full faith and credit of the county or incorporated city or town; providing for the rights of the holders of such bonds; and establishing a Building Finance Committee of the Tennessee Industrial and Agricultural Development Commission and providing for the appointment, powers and duties thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">Section 1.

The Act provides \u201cfor the pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>ment of such bonds, including authority to pledge the full faith and credit of the county or incorporated city or town\u201d (Caption of the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-3\">Pursuant to this Act the Town of Lebanon has made a contract with Hartmann Luggage Company, a Wisconsin corporation, for the lease for 25 years, with renewal privileges, of a factory building to be constructed by the Town of Lebanon for its use, etc. It has authorized the issuance of bonds in the total amount of $350,000, the same having been approved by the Tennessee Industrial &amp; Agricultural Development Commission, and also by a three-fourths majority of the qualified voters of said Town.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">The appellant has questioned the constitutionality of this Act on the ground that it violates Article II, Section 29, of the State Constitution in that it authorizes the levy and collection of taxes upon all the property of citizens in the Town of Lebanon for the support of a private industry, and is not \u201cfor County or Corporation purposes \u2019 \u2019. In other words, in the instant case the Town of Lebanon is lending its credit to a private corporation and not for a public or municipal purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The Act defines \u201cindustrial building\u201d.

Subsection (a) declares that the State of Tennessee is suffering a loss in its population by reason of lack of employment, etc.; (b) \u201cThat the conditions of unemployment existing Statewide in Tennessee be relieved thereby reducing the evils attendant thereto.\u201d Another purpose appears in sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>section (c) <em>\u201cThat the average family income in Tennessee he raised and increased as much as </em>possible(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">By other sections there is created an agency called \u201cThe Tennessee Industrial and Agricultural Development Commission\u201d, also a \u201cBuilding Finance Committee \u2019 \u2019, clothed with certain duties and responsibilities with regard to the approval or disapproval of municipal or county bonds, designed to give employment to certain of its citizens, and to provide a means of \u201cincreasing the average family income\u201d in the county or city affected; also to prevent the loss of population to the State, and more especially the area complaining of unemployment, etc. It is furthermore disclosed as a part of the State\u2019s public policy that the State\u2019s unemployment problem is such .\u201cthat there is the resultant evil of hunger and crime\u201d which is sought to be alleviated by this Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The Town of Lebanon answered the complainant\u2019s bill and insisted that the Act was constitutional in all respects ; that the issuance of the bonds was in compliance \u25a0with the Act herein assailed and that the contract with the Hartmann Luggage Company of Wisconsin was for a public purpose in that it was necessary to the general economic welfare of the Town, i. e. to relieve the unemployment of its citizens. It paints conditions of unemployment in Lebanon as being sorrowful in the extreme.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">While the cause was heard on bill and answer, which requires the Court to accept the answer as true, we cannot accept the conclusions therein stated as true. It is a great strain on one\u2019s credulity to accept as true the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>averment that anybody is hungry in the Town of Lebanon, and that there are the twin evils of disease and crime resulting from unemployment.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">Contention is made by connsel for Lebanon that the Act should be held constitutional because it is declaratory of the State\u2019s public policy. I readily concede that the Legislature is privileged to declare the public policy of the State, which generally speaking the courts must uphold. But this is true only where the public policy so declared is not contrary to plain constitutional inhibitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The present statute goes far beyond anything that was ever contemplated by the framers of our constitution. To be sure the Legislature has authorized cities and counties to establish \u201cpoor farms\u201d to care for indigent people who have no home, and have appropriated small sums of money from time to time for this purpose since the early history of the State. But no city or county has ever loaned its credit to any private industry for purposes set forth in that statute. Nor has it ever been thought that measures to \u201cincrease the average family income\u201d and to prevent the emigration of its citizens to other States to get a job, or a better paying job, was within the domain of the State\u2019s public policy. Moreover, under the provisions of this Act any town or county may by a vote of three-fourths of its citizens vote itself into bankruptcy in order to meet higher wages in the great industrial centers in the north and east. It is a well recognized fact that some responsible Union labor representatives are now insisting upon what is called \u201ca guaranteed annual wage. \u2019 \u2019 Can; it be said in truth and as a matter of law under the Constitution that any Act purporting to meet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>sneh. competition is constitutional? The majority opinion apparently holds to this view. To which I must respectfully dissent. Is it at all possible within constitutional limitations for the State to declare as a part of its public policy that the several municipalities of this State are privileged to match wages and hours of employment with the ever increasing wage scale in other states, and impose a tax (the amount not limited) to support it? This problem cannot be solved by any statutory formula, and the same is true in preventing emigration to greener industrial fields.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-3\">If the contract between the Town of Lebanon and the Luggage Company is not in aid of a municipal purpose, it cannot be constitutionally made so by three-fourths of the voters in the town in favor of it. If the validity of any Act of the Legislature is to be determined by counting votes in a city election the Constitution has no probative force whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The case at bar is controlled by <em>Ferrell v. Doak, </em>152 Tenn. 88, 275 S.W. 29, 46 A.L.R. 590, wherein this Court held that a Private Act authorizing a tax against the City of Lebanon for the purchase of a box factory was in violation of Article II, Section 29, of the Constitution because it was for a private purpose as distinguished from a \u201cpublic use\u201d. The box factory was not under the control of the town authorities. Neither is the Luggage Company in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The cases of <em>Azbill v. Lexington Mfg. Co., </em>188 Tenn. 477, 221 S.W. 2d 522, and <em>Holly v. City of Elizabethton, </em>193 Tenn. 46, 241 S.W. 2d 1001, do not support the defendant\u2019s contention that even if it were for a private purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>it was valid because it was favored by a three-fourths vote in the referendum election above referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-3\">This Court has never departed from <em>Ferrell v. Doak, </em>supra (152 Tenn. 88, 275 S.W. 31), wherein it was held as settled law that \u201ctaxation cannot be imposed for the purpose of establishing, aiding, or maintaining private business enterprises whose sole object is the private emolument of the proprietors, <em>no matter how beneficial to the community such enterprises may be\u201d, </em>citing numerous authorities. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">In both the Azbill case and the Holly case the bonds issued were <em>revenue bonds </em>to be liquidated by rentals from the industrial buildings. No tax upon the property owners was authorized for this purpose. While the Holly case holds that the lease of an industrial building is \u201cat least incidentally for a public purpose\u201d, (193 Tenn. 46, 241 S.W. 2d 1005) there is a clear and justifiable inference that had the Act authorized a tax upon the City of Eliza-bethton and its citizens to support it the Act would not have been approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The issue in this case falls within the narrow compass of what constitutes a public or a governmental purpose. These terms have been defined many times by various law writers, and by our own Court in <em>Ferrell v. Doak, </em>supra. When these definitions are considered, even in a technical sense, \u201ca public purpose\u201d is one that affects a political subdivision of the State as a body politic. In other words, it must affect all the people in some material way, not a limited number in a special way.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The case of <em>Nichol v. Mayor of Town of Nashville, </em>28 Tenn. 252, strongly relied on in the majority opinion does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>not support the contention of the defendant Town of Lebanon. The holding of the Gonrt in that case by Mr. Justice Tnrley was that subscription to the stock of the N. C. &amp; St. L. Railway (running from Nashville to Chattanooga) was for a public purpose. The Court was there dealing with a public service corporation. At that time (1847) the City of Nashville as a municipality was in dire need of public transportation. The two cases cited by Judge Turley as supporting authority dealt with public service corporations. Transportation vitally affected the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The case at bar should also be distinguished from <em>Knoxville Housing Authority, Inc., v. City of Knoxville, </em>174 Tenn. 76, 123 S.W. 2d 1085, 1087, where property was sought to be condemned for a \u201cslum-clearance\u201d project. The right to take certain property under the power of eminent domain in aid of the project was well stated by Mr. Chief Justice Green, as follows: \u201cThe courts reason that the primary object of all government is to foster the health, morals and safety of the people. That slum districts with their filthy, congested, weather-exposed living quarters are breeding places of disease, immorality and crime.\u201d Other good and sufficient reasons were stated by him to which there can be no dissent. But there is no contention by defendant\u2019s counsel in the case at bar that the erection of an industrial building in Lebanon, to be used by a private corporation, is essential as a governmental project to prevent \u201cdisease, immorality and crime\u201d, or for the promotion of public health, morals and the safety of the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">It is my sincere conviction that the contract between the Town of Lebanon and the Luggage Company is in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>valid because it is in violation of the express provisions of the Constitution of this State in that the erection and maintenance of the industrial building is in aid of a private business.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Peewitt, Justice (dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">I most respectfully dissent from the majority opinion filed herein. In doing so, I have carefully read <em>Nichol v. Mayor and Aldermen of Town of Nashville, </em>28 Tenn. 252; <em>Ferrell v. Doak, </em>152 Tenn. 88, 275 S.W. 29, 46 A.L.R. 590; <em>Azbill v. Lexington Mfg. Co., </em>188 Tenn. 477, 221 S.W. 2d 522; and <em>Holly v. City of Elizabethton, </em>193 Tenn. 46, 241 S.W. 2d 1001.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">We must keep in mind, I think, that under the Constitution, Article 2, Section 29, which gives the cities the right to levy taxes, that the \u201ccorporation purposes respectively,\u201d is the only right that the town, or city, has to levy taxes, and it must be for a corporate, or public purpose regardless of the further provisions of the Article of the Constitution in reference to a three-fourths majority voting in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">In <em>Nichol v. Mayor and Alderman of Town of Nashville, </em>supra, the Court had this to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-9\">\u201cBut be this as it may, we think that the Legislature, most clearly, has no power to delegate to a county or corporate town the power of levying taxes for any other than county or corporation purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">Thus the county, or town, has no greater power than the Legislature, and certainly the Legislature would not have any right to levy a tax unless it was for a corporate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>purpose. We think the rule and language used by this Court in <em>Ferrell v. Doak, </em>152 Tenn. 88, 275 S.W. 29, 46 A.L.R. 590, which was followed by us in <em>Azbill v. Lexington Mfg. Co., </em>188 Tenn. 477, 221 S.W. 2d 522, are controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">It seems to me that the views expressed in <em>Ferrell v. Doak, </em>supra, and <em>Azbill v. Lexington Mfg. Co., </em>supra, fortify my views.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">In the Holly case, the Act in question was held unconstitutional but the court there expressly said that the bonds issued did not pledge the public credit, hut only provided that the bonds and interest should he paid hy the rentals on the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">In the present case the public funds of the City of Lebanon are to be turned over and used by a strictly private corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">It is further set out in the majority opinion that this plan will help and alleviate the poor by giving them employment. It is true that many people might be benefited by the employment in the organization, but nevertheless we cannot escape the conclusion that public money and the public credit is going into a strictly private organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">I think this policy is unsound and, if followed, would be dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">I therefore register this dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
