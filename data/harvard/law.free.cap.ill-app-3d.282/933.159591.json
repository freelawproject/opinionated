The trial court order granted IBC\u2019s combined motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to section 2 \u2014 615 and section 2 \u2014 619 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Code) (735 ILCS 5/2 \u2014 615, 2 \u2014 619 (West 1994)). The court granted the section 2 \u2014 615 motion on the issue of proximate cause. The court granted the section 2 \u2014 619 motion on the issue of waiver of liability. On appeal, the Village contends that the trial court erred because (1) IBC\u2019s negligence was a proximate cause of plaintiffs\u2019 injuries; and (2) the waiver of liability did not bar the complaint.</p> <p id=\"b953-10\" pgmap=\"953\">On the night of October 24, 1992, plaintiffs, John Bradley Indlecoffer and Cindy Richter, were participating in a treasure hunt sponsored by IBC. During the treasure hunt, plaintiffs were injured when the motor vehicle in which they were riding as passengers collided with another motor vehicle at the intersection of Mill Creek Road and Route 173 in Lake County. On October 7, 1993, plaintiffs filed a complaint against the Village alleging, in pertinent part, that the Village negligently \"failed to maintain the roadway in a reasonable manner by failing to remove branches which had for months obstructed the traffic stop sign located at the intersection to the extent that the driver of the vehicle in which Plaintiffs were riding did not view the stop sign until it was too late to stop the vehicle.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b953-11\" pgmap=\"953(9) 954(55)\">After answering plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, the Village filed a third-party complaint for contribution against IBC. The trial court dismissed the Village\u2019s complaint without prejudice, and the Village then filed an amended third-party complaint for contribution against IBC. The amended complaint, which refers to IBC both as \"IBC\u201d and as \"the third party defendant,\u201d and to the Village as \"Wadsworth,\u201d contained the following relevant allegations:</p> <blockquote id=\"b954-3\" pgmap=\"954\">\"3. That Immanuel Baptist Church sponsored a treasure hunt on October 24,1992, wherein each participant was required to pay a $10.00 registration fee to the third-party defendant.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b954-4\" pgmap=\"954\">4. That at the time and place of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries, plaintiffs were active participants in the TBC Treasure Hunt\u2019. Further, that the driver of the vehicle in which plaintiffs were traveling at the time of the occurrence, David Plunkett, was also a participant in the IBC Treasure Hunt.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b954-5\" pgmap=\"954\">5. That immediately prior to the commencement of the IBC Treasure Hunt, certain organizers of the event surveyed, inspected and timed the routes on the circuit between the various clue sites.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b954-6\" pgmap=\"954\">6. That the third party defendant promulgated rules by which the treasure hunt was to be carried out. Further that the participating teams competed against one another and a winner was to be adjudged at the conclusion of the competition. The primary judging criteria [szc] for the contest was the speed at which a team could negotiate the course within the set time limitation.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b954-7\" pgmap=\"954\">7. That the contest was organized in such a manner that the teams of contestants moved through a circuit of clue locations in the same order and that an advantage could be gained by one team from following the vehicle of another team that had solved the riddle of the next clue site. Further, that plaintiff\u2019s [szc] team and driver believed they were being followed by other teams in the competition on several occasions during the night of October 24, 1992.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b954-8\" pgmap=\"954\">8. That the IBC treasure hunt rules required that the participants engage in complex problem solving while operating a motor vehicle on unfamiliar roadways.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b954-9\" pgmap=\"954\">9. That plaintiff\u2019s [szc] team of treasure hunt participants stopped at the clue location on north Mill Creed [szc] Road immediately prior to the collision at Route 173 and Mill Creek Road. When plaintiff\u2019s [sz'c] team believed it had solved the clue, several team members executed a prearranged signal and the plaintiff\u2019s [szc] group rushed back to its vehicle hoping to avoid being followed by other teams who had not yet solved the clue to the next location for themselves.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b954-10\" pgmap=\"954(24) 955(27)\">10. That plaintiff\u2019s [szc] team was forced to return to the Mill Creek Road clue site after going a short distance, when it was discovered that no one had retrieved the required 'clue sheet\u2019 from that location. Plaintiffs [sic] vehicle then hurriedly left the site traveling southbound on Mill Creek Road.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b955-3\" pgmap=\"955\">11. That the vehicle in which plaintiffs were riding was driven at a speed well in excess of the speed limit as it approached the intersection of Route 173 and Mill Creek Road.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b955-4\" pgmap=\"955\">12. That southbound traffic on Mill Creek Road was regulated by a stop sign located on the northwest corner of the above intersection. Further that at the time of the collision, the stop sign was clearly visible for a distance of more than 300 feet north of the intersection.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b955-5\" pgmap=\"955\">13. That the intersection of Route 173 and Mill Creek Road was illuminated at the time of the collision by an overhead street light located on the southeast corner of the intersection.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b955-6\" pgmap=\"955\">14. That David Plunkett and the other contest participants in the plaintiffs [sic] vehicle failed to identify the above stop sign until their vehicle was approximately 50 feet north of the intersection. Said vehicle was traveling at an excessive speed that would not allow it to be stopped prior to the intersection with Route 173.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b955-7\" pgmap=\"955\">15. That the vehicle in which plaintiffs were riding entered the intersection with Route 173 and Mill Creek Road without first stopping and collided with another automobile traveling eastbound on Route 173.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b955-8\" pgmap=\"955\">16. That at the time and place of plaintiffs\u2019 injuries, Immanuel Baptist Church owed a duty to exercise reasonable care in its organization of the TBC Treasure Hunt\u2019 and the instruction and supervision of the participants.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b955-9\" pgmap=\"955\">17. That if the trier of fact determines that Wadsworth is liable to the plaintiffs, which liability is expressly denied by Wadsworth, then plaintiffs\u2019 damages were caused by the negligence of Immanuel Baptist Church in one or more of the following respects:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b955-10\" pgmap=\"955\">a. Promulgated rules that encouraged contestants to operate motor vehicles in a careless and reckless manner during their participation in the treasure hunt activities;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b955-11\" pgmap=\"955\">b. Failed to adequately instruct, monitor and supervise contestants\u2019 safe participation in the treasure hunt activities;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b955-12\" pgmap=\"955\">c. Failed to adequately prevent and/or warn against the participants\u2019 violation of state traffic laws;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b955-13\" pgmap=\"955\">d. Failed to warn treasure hunt participants concerning dangers it knew or should have known were presented by the rules which it promulgated for the event; and</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b955-14\" pgmap=\"955\">e. Failed to warn treasure hunt participants of dangers it knew were posed by the conditions present at the intersection of Route 173 and Mill Creek Road.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b956-2\" pgmap=\"956\">18. That as a result of the aforesaid acts and/or omissions, Immanuel Baptist Church proximately caused or contributed to David Plunkett\u2019s operation of the motor vehicle in a manner which resulted in the damages claimed by the plaintiffs.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b956-3\" pgmap=\"956\">IBC responded to the Village\u2019s amended complaint for contribution with a combined motion to dismiss the complaint under sections 2 \u2014 615 and 2 \u2014 619 of the Code. 735 ILCS 5/2 \u2014 615, 2 \u2014 619 (West 1994). In its motion to dismiss under section 2 \u2014 615, IBC contended that it owed no duty to plaintiffs and that any alleged negligence by IBC was not the proximate cause of plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. In its motion to dismiss under section 2 \u2014 619, IBC contended that plaintiffs each voluntarily executed a written waiver of liability that released IBC from all liability related to the treasure hunt. IBC argued that the waiver of liability also discharged it from all liability for any contribution to any other tort-feasor.</p> <p id=\"b956-4\" pgmap=\"956\">On July 6, 1995, the trial court entered an order on the matter. The order (1) denied IBC\u2019s section 2 \u2014 615 motion to dismiss on the issue of duty; (2) granted IBC\u2019s section 2 \u2014 615 motion to dismiss on the issue of proximate cause; (3) denied IBC\u2019s section 2 \u2014 619 motion to dismiss on the waiver of liability issue as to Indlecoffer; and (4) granted IBC\u2019s section 2 \u2014 619 motion to dismiss on the waiver of liability issue as to Richter.</p> <p id=\"b956-5\" pgmap=\"956\">On August 29, 1995, the trial court entered an order granting IBC\u2019s motion for a finding of a final judgment under Supreme Court Rule 304(a) (155 Ill. 2d R. 304(a)). The order stated that there was no just reason to delay the enforcement or appeal of the trial court\u2019s July 6, 1995, order dismissing the Village\u2019s amended complaint for contribution. The Village\u2019s timely appeal followed.</p> <p id=\"b956-6\" pgmap=\"956\">We will first address the issue of waiver of liability. The trial court granted IBC\u2019s section 2 \u2014 619 motion to dismiss the Village\u2019s complaint for contribution on the waiver of liability issue only with respect to Richter. The court denied the motion as to Indlecoffer. The record shows that Richter subsequently voluntarily dismissed her action against the Village.</p> <p id=\"b956-7\" pgmap=\"956\"> On appeal, IBC contends that the issue of waiver of liability is moot because of Richter\u2019s voluntary dismissal. IBC argues that, in view of Richter\u2019s voluntary dismissal, there is no longer a controversy regarding contribution as to Richter, and because the trial court dismissed the Village\u2019s amended complaint on the basis of waiver of liability only with respect to Richter, the waiver of liability issue is moot. We agree.</p> <p id=\"b956-8\" pgmap=\"956(26) 957(110)\">An issue is moot if an actual controversy between the parties no longer exists and the interests or the rights of the parties are no Ionger in controversy. Novak v. Rathnam, 106 Ill. 2d 478, 482 (1985). In this case, Richter\u2019s voluntary dismissal ended the controversy between Richter and the Village. Consequently, there is no longer a need for the Village to seek contribution from IBC as to Richter. Because the trial court dismissed the Village\u2019s amended complaint for contribution on the issue of the waiver of liability only as to Richter, there is no longer an actual controversy between the parties with respect to the issue of waiver of liability. Thus, the waiver of liability issue is moot. Accordingly, it is unnecessary for us to further consider the issue in this appeal.</p> <p id=\"b957-3\" pgmap=\"957\"> We will next briefly discuss the issue of duty. In its appellate brief, the Village raised the issue of IBC\u2019s duty to plaintiff Indlecoffer. In its brief, IBC responded that we should strike and disregard the section of the Village\u2019s brief that deals with the duty issue. IBC based its position on the fact that the trial court order that the Village appealed from specifically denied IBC\u2019s motion to dismiss on the issue of duty.</p> <p id=\"b957-4\" pgmap=\"957\">We agree with IBC that because the trial court specifically denied IBC\u2019s motion to dismiss with respect to the issue of duty, it was unnecessary for the Village to raise the issue of duty on appeal. It is apparent on the face of the trial court order that the trial court did not dismiss the Village\u2019s complaint on the ground of a failure to establish a duty. Consequently, we will disregard the section of the Village\u2019s brief that addresses the duty issue.</p> <p id=\"b957-5\" pgmap=\"957\">We next turn to the central issue of this appeal, the issue of proximate cause. The trial court dismissed the Village\u2019s complaint for contribution against IBC as to both plaintiffs on the ground that the complaint failed to sufficiently establish proximate cause between IBC\u2019s alleged negligent conduct and plaintiffs\u2019 injuries.</p> <p id=\"b957-6\" pgmap=\"957\">On appeal, the Village asserts that IBC argued in its motion to dismiss the amended complaint that any negligence on IBC\u2019s part was not a proximate cause of the underlying accident, but instead was merely a condition to the occurrence of the accident. The Village further asserts that IBC contended that any negligence on its part was superseded by the alleged intervening negligence of the Village and/or the driver of the vehicle in which plaintiffs were riding when they were injured (hereinafter the driver) and that these instances of intervening negligence were the proximate cause of plaintiffs\u2019 injuries.</p> <p id=\"b957-7\" pgmap=\"957(39) 958(47)\">The Village contends on appeal that neither its alleged negligence nor the driver\u2019s alleged negligence constituted intervening acts that superseded IBC\u2019s negligent conduct in sponsoring and organizing the treasure hunt. The Village argues that IBC\u2019s conduct was therefore a proximate cause of plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. The Village asserts that the trial court erred in deciding the proximate cause issue as a matter of law when jurors could come to different conclusions based on the facts of this case and the inferences to be drawn from those facts.</p> <p id=\"b958-3\" pgmap=\"958\">IBC responds, as it did below, that its alleged conduct was not a proximate cause of plaintiffs\u2019 injuries as a matter of law. IBC argues that (1) its alleged conduct was not a cause of plaintiffs\u2019 injuries, but was, at most, a condition; and (2) the negligent conduct of both the Village and the driver was an intervening act that superseded any causation attributable to IBC.</p> <p id=\"b958-4\" pgmap=\"958\">In reviewing the dismissal of a complaint under section 2 \u2014 615, a reviewing court must determine whether the complaint, when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, alleged facts sufficient to establish a cause of action upon which relief may be granted. Ziemba v. Mierzwa, 142 Ill. 2d 42, 46 (1991). The review is de novo, and, therefore, a reviewing court is not required to defer to the trial court\u2019s judgment. Stinson v. Physicians Immediate Care, Ltd., 269 Ill. App. 3d 659, 661-62 (1995).</p> <p id=\"b958-5\" pgmap=\"958\"> A court should grant a section 2 \u2014 615 motion to dismiss only if it clearly appears that no set of facts could ever be proved that would entitle the plaintiff to recover. Mt. Zion State Bank &amp; Trust v. Consolidated Communications, Inc., 169 Ill. 2d 110, 115 (1995). In reviewing an order that granted a section 2 \u2014 615 motion to dismiss, a court should take as true all well-pleaded facts and all reasonable inferences from those well-pleaded facts. Mt. Zion State Bank, 169 Ill. 2d at 115.</p> <p id=\"b958-6\" pgmap=\"958\"> In order to state a cause of action in negligence, the plaintiff must plead sufficient facts to establish that the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care, that the defendant breached that duty, and that the breach was the proximate cause of injuries to the plaintiff. Vaughn v. City of West Frankfort, 166 Ill. 2d 155, 157-58 (1995). In this case, the negligence factor on which the trial court based its dismissal order was proximate cause. Proximate cause is generally a factual matter for a jury to decide. Espinoza v. Elgin, Joliet &amp; Eastern Ry. Co., 165 Ill. 2d 107, 114 (1995).</p> <p id=\"b958-7\" pgmap=\"958(98) 959(49)\">In Lee v. Chicago Transit Authority, 152 Ill. 2d 432 (1992), our supreme court discussed proximate cause at some length. In Lee, the court stated that proximate cause consists of two distinct elements: cause in fact and legal cause. 152 Ill. 2d at 455. A defendant\u2019s conduct is a cause in fact of the plaintiff\u2019s injury if the conduct was a material element and substantial factor in bringing about the injury. 152 Ill. 2d at 455. Where reasonable minds could differ as to whether a defendant\u2019s conduct was a cause in fact of the plaintiff\u2019s injury, then the matter is for the jury to decide. 152 Ill. 2d at 455. Legal cause turns on foreseeability because negligent conduct is deemed a proximate cause of an injury if a reasonable man would foresee the injury as a likely result of the conduct. 152 Ill. 2d at 456.</p> <p id=\"b959-4\" pgmap=\"959\">In this case, to support its position that its conduct was not a proximate cause of plaintiffs\u2019 injuries but merely a condition, IBC relied heavily on Quintana v. City of Chicago, 230 Ill. App. 3d 1032 (1992). In Quintana, the plaintiff, a pedestrian, was crossing a city street at an intersection where the traffic lights were inoperable. 230 Ill. App. 3d at 1033. As the plaintiff was crossing the street, a collision occurred in the intersection involving two or more cars, and one of the cars struck the plaintiff, injuring her. 230 Ill. App. 3d at 1033. The plaintiff brought a negligence action against the drivers of the cars involved in the accident and against the city. The trial court granted the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that the city\u2019s failure to maintain traffic lights was not a proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. 230 Ill. App. 3d at 1033-34.</p> <p id=\"b959-5\" pgmap=\"959\">In affirming, the appellate court particularly noted that both drivers testified that as they approached the intersection they observed that the traffic lights were not operating. Each also testified to having come to a stop before entering the intersection. The court concluded that the accident must have occurred because one of the drivers disobeyed a statutory requirement to regard the inoperative signal light as a stop sign.</p> <p id=\"b959-6\" pgmap=\"959\"> Accordingly, the court found that the inoperative traffic lights were merely a condition by which the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were made possible and that any causal connection between the city\u2019s conduct and the plaintiff\u2019s injuries was broken by the conduct of the car drivers in consciously failing to heed a statutory duty to stop at an inoperative signal light. 230 Ill. App. 3d at 1035. In its analysis, the Quintana court stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b959-7\" pgmap=\"959\">\"If the negligence charged does nothing more than furnish a condition by which the injury is made possible and that condition causes an injury by the subsequent, independent act of a third person, the creation of the condition is not the proximate cause of the injury where the subsequent act is an intervening efficient cause which breaks the causal connection between the original wrong and the injury, and itself becomes the proximate or immediate cause.\u201d 230 Ill. App. 3d at 1035.</blockquote> <p id=\"b959-8\" pgmap=\"959(45) 960(27)\">We note that in the present case, unlike the facts of Quintana, the Village\u2019s complaint alleged that the plaintiff failed to see the obscured stop sign in time to stop before entering the intersection. We consider this circumstance to be an important distinction in our analysis of whether plaintiffs action can be regarded as an intervening cause sufficient to break the causal connection between any negligence of IBC and the injury.</p> <p id=\"b960-3\" pgmap=\"960\">We are aware that Illinois courts recognize the distinction between a condition and a cause. See, e.g., Thompson v. County of Cook, 154 Ill. 2d 374, 383 (1993). However, we agree with a recent appellate court opinion which stated that ''[framing the analysis in terms of 'condition versus cause\u2019 does little to resolve questions of breach of duty and proximate cause in a particular case.\u201d Jefferson v. City of Chicago, 269 Ill. App. 3d 672, 675 (1995).</p> <p id=\"b960-4\" pgmap=\"960\"> We believe that the better analysis in resolving a proximate cause question focuses on foreseeability. Under a foreseeability analysis, the negligence of a defendant does not constitute a proximate cause of a plaintiffs injuries if some intervening act supersedes the defendant\u2019s negligence, but if the defendant could reasonably foresee the intervening act, then the intervening act does not relieve the defendant of liability. Bentley v. Saunemin Township, 83 Ill. 2d 10, 15 (1980).</p> <p id=\"b960-5\" pgmap=\"960\">In this case, the Village\u2019s amended complaint sought contribution from IBC because of IBC\u2019s alleged negligence. The complaint alleged that (1) plaintiffs were injured while participating in a treasure hunt that IBC sponsored, organized, and controlled through rules that IBC promulgated; (2) IBC surveyed, inspected, and timed the treasure hunt course; (3) the treasure hunt rules encouraged contestants in the treasure hunt to operate motor vehicles in a careless and reckless manner while participating in the treasure hunt because the participating teams competed against each other with the winning team to be determined by the speed with which the team negotiated the treasure hunt course; and (4) during the treasure hunt, while speeding, the vehicle carrying plaintiffs failed to stop for a stop sign and therefore collided with another car in the intersection of Mill Creek Road and Route 173.</p> <p id=\"b960-6\" pgmap=\"960(121) 961(26)\"> Based on these allegations, viewed in the light most favorable to the Village, IBC could have reasonably foreseen the purported intervening acts in this case. Through its sponsorship of the treasure hunt, unlike the defendant city in Quintana, IBC played an active role in the events surrounding plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. Through its organization of the treasure hunt, IBC caused the treasure hunt contestants to participate in teams, riding in cars through a circuit of clue locations. Through the treasure hunt rules, which it promulgated, IBC set a process in motion that could reasonably be expected to cause drivers of the cars in the treasure hunt to speed. A car speeding while participating in the treasure hunt could reasonably be foreseen to be unable to stop for a stop sign or other traffic control device, enter an intersection without stopping, and collide with another vehicle.</p> <p id=\"b961-3\" pgmap=\"961\">Through its survey and inspection of the routes on the treasure hunt circuit, IBC arguably should have noticed whether the stop signs at the intersections along the treasure hunt course were obscured. If any stop sign was obscured, then it was reasonably foreseeable that the obscured stop sign would exacerbate the danger to the treasure hunt participants as the car in which they were riding might be speeding as it approached the intersection controlled by the obscured stop sign and, as a result, be unable to stop.</p> <p id=\"b961-4\" pgmap=\"961\">Thus, under the facts of this case as alleged in the Village\u2019s amended complaint, we cannot say, as a matter of law, that the purported intervening acts were the kind of new and independent force that would break the causal connection between IBC\u2019s alleged negligence and plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. See Jefferson, 269 Ill. App. 3d 672. Once it is established that the causal connection between the original wrong and the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries may be unbroken, a jury can consider that there may be more than one proximate cause. Jefferson, 269 Ill. App. 3d 672.</p> <p id=\"b961-5\" pgmap=\"961\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that whether IBC\u2019s conduct proximately caused plaintiffs\u2019 injuries in this case is for the jury to determine. Consequently, the trial court erred when it dismissed the Village\u2019s amended complaint for contribution on the issue of proximate cause.</p> <p id=\"b961-6\" pgmap=\"961\">We therefore reverse the trial court order and remand the cause for further proceedings.</p> <p id=\"b961-7\" pgmap=\"961\">Reversed and remanded.</p> <p id=\"b961-8\" pgmap=\"961\">RATHJE, J., concurs.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b961-9\" pgmap=\"961\">JUSTICE INGLIS,</author> <p id=\"AIP\" pgmap=\"961\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b961-10\" pgmap=\"961\">I respectfully dissent from the opinion of the majority and would affirm the order of the circuit court. I believe the result reached by the majority in this case imposes an unreasonable duty on IBC.</p> <p id=\"b961-11\" pgmap=\"961(76) 962(87)\">The majority concludes that, by taking an active role in the events surrounding plaintiffs\u2019 injuries, it was reasonable for IBC to foresee that the vehicle in which plaintiffs were occupying would speed through a stop sign and would collide with another vehicle. The test here is whether the first wrongdoer reasonably might have anticipated the intervening cause as a natural and probable result of its own wrongdoing. Lindenmier v. City of Rockford, 156 Ill. App. 3d 76, 91 (1987). I do not believe IBC reasonably could have anticipated that the vehicle plaintiffs were occupying would disregard the law merely because they were participating in a game. \" 'As a practical matter, legal responsibility must be limited to those causes which are so closely connected with the result and of such significance that the law is justified in imposing liability.\u2019 \u201d Novander v. City of Morris, 181 Ill. App. 3d 1076, 1080 (1989), quoting W. Prosser, Torts \u00a7 41, at 236 (4th ed. 1971).</p> <p id=\"b962-4\" pgmap=\"962\">After concluding that there is a foundation for proximate cause, the majority further imposes a duty on IBC to inspect the route of the treasure hunt for obscured stop signs, a step not mandated by their analysis of foreseeability. The implications of this result would foreclose all group-sponsored activity using vehicles. The duty imposed by the majority would seemingly require IBC to trim foliage obscuring stop signs. Is IBC to undertake the responsibility of the agencies to which we pay our tax dollars to maintain the public highways? The costs and consequences of creating such a duty are great.</p> <p id=\"b962-5\" pgmap=\"962\">In this case, I would affirm the dismissal of the Village\u2019s complaint against IBC on the issue of proximate cause.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
