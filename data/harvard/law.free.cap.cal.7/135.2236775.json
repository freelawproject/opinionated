Farmer, the wife of the plaintiff. The complaint further shows that the so-called endorsements were written across the face of the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-14\">The bill offered in evidence is drawn on Adams &amp; Co., Boston, by Adams &amp; Co., of San Francisco, in favor of Lydia B. Farmer, and across its face is written the names of E. W. Tracy, agent, and of Cram, Rogers, &amp; Co. The bill has the following endorsement : <em>\u201c </em>Pay to bearer, Lydia B. Farmer.\u201d The non-payment and protest of the note was proved, and also the genuineness of the signature of defendants, and plaintiff rested his case. The defendants thereupon moved for a nonsuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-15\">The Court took the motion under advisement, and allowed evidence of demand on and refusal to pay by defendants, on the ground that they were mere agents of Adams &amp; Co., to be introduced by defendants. The motion for nonsuit was then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>overruled, under the exception of defendants, who then introduced the evidence of Tracy to show the object of the defendants in countersigning drafts of Adams &amp; Co. of San Francisco, sent to them for sale, to be to avoid loss which might occur if the drafts were lost before reaching Yreka. The Court below gave judgment for plaintiff. Defendants moved for a new trial, which being overruled, they appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b146-5\"><em>Cartter and Hartley </em>for Appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-6\">The plaintiff failed to prove a sufficient case for the consideration of the Court sitting as a jury; for that the complaint shows that, the bill of exchange or draft therein described, was endorsed by defendants, but the bill or draft introduced in evidence shows that the firm-name of the defendants was written across the face of the bill or draft, and again, that the complaint describes a bill of exchange drawn by Adams &amp; Co., payable to their order, (that is, to the order of Adams &amp; Co., the drawers,) but the bill of exchange given in evidence, is payable to the order of Lydia B. Farmer.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b146-7\"><em>Judah </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Aei\">Heydenfeldt, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AyV\">delivered the opinion of the Court\u2014Murray, C. J., concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">The declaration describes the bill sued on as payable to the order of Adams &amp; Co., whereas the bill introduced in evidence is payable to the order of Lydia B. Farmer.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">It was proper to take advantage of this variance between the pleadings and proof, by objecting-to the evidence when offered, or moving for a nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">The great necessity for a correct description of commercial paper, when sued on, is to enable one recovery to operate a bar to any subsequent action for the same cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">After the motion for nonsuit, the Court might, upon terms, have allowed an amendment of the declaration, if it would not have operated a surprise upon the defendants, but as this was not done, the judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
