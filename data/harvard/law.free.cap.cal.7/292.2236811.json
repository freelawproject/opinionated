Both parties claim under deeds derived from one Roland G-elston.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-16\">It appears from the record, that in April, 1852, one Clough, attorney of Gelston, sold a number of lots, including those in controversy, to Reynolds, defendant\u2019s grantor. The deed was recorded in the proper office, but in the record the number and description of these lots wero, by mistake, omitted. , Afterwards Clough sold the lots to John S. Fowler, under whom the plaintiff claims. Subsequent to the record of Fowler\u2019s deed, Clough procured the record to be amended by interlining the nWnber and description of the omitted lots. The plaintiff purchased in good faith without actualnotice of defendant\u2019s title; and he en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>tered into possession of the property, and continued to occupy it, at the commencement of this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-5\">The Court below rendered a decree in favor of plaintiff Chamberlain, ordering defendant's deed from Gelston to be canceled, and perpetually restraining him from setting up title to the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-6\">Defendant moved for a new trial, which being denied, he appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b303-7\"><em>Joseph W. Winans </em>for Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-8\">The conveyance to Reynolds was recorded in the county recorder\u2019s office, as provided in section twenty-four of the \u201c act concerning conveyances,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-9\">By such recording, under section twenty-five of said act, it \u201clegally imparted notice of the contents thereof,\u201d <em>i. e. </em>of the contents of the conveyance\u2014not of the record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-10\">If the recorder committed a clerical error in the recording of the deeed, by leaving out a part of the estate conveyed thereby, that error does not make the conveyance any less a recorded conveyance. The act only requires that it shall be recorded to impart notice. It was recorded, even if incorrectly recorded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-11\">Again, the correction having been made in the record of the conveyance, becomes a part of the record, and applies and relates back to the time of the original recording of the conveyance. The correction cannot be considered as a separate record; it is a part, and an inseparable part, of the record of the whole instrument, and of that record as a whole. That record is but a unit, indivisible, and in its character of unit, embraces all its parts.

It was the duty of the grantee, when he discovered the omission, to have his deed rerecorded ; and then, so far as this block is concerned, it would be notice from .the latter date, which would be officially certified to, by the recorder or auditor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-14\">Where there is a mistake in the recording of an instrument, a subsequent <em>bona fide </em>purchaser is bound only to the extent set forth in the record.

J., concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The evident design of the Registration Act was, by establishing a notice equally accessible to all, to protect subsequent <em>bona fide </em>purchasers. The doctrine of constructive notice, under registration laws, has always been regarded as a harsh necessity, and the statutes which create it have always been subjected to the most rigid construction.\u201d Call <em>v. </em>Hastings, 3 Cal., 179. \u25a0 So far as the lots in controversy are affected, the deed of Reynolds was not recorded, until the title of plaintiff's grantor was <em>perfected; </em>and, conceding the propriety of the interlineation, it could only impart notice from the time it was made, and could in no way impair or defeat a title previously acquired. Our statute provides that \u201c Every conveyance, certified and recorded in the manner prescribed in this act, shall, from the time of filing the same with the recorder for record, impart notice to all persons of the contents thereof.\u201d See \u00a7 25, p. 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">We think the design and intention of this act was to give constructive notice of the facts which appeared upon the face of the record, and that it could not operate as notice of such portions of the deed as, through mistake or carelessness, are not entered of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">In this view, we are sustained by decisions of various States. In Erost <em>v. </em>Beckman, 1 John. Oh. R., a mortgage for three thousand dollars, which by mistake was recorded as a mortgage for three hundred dollars, was held valid, as against a subsequent purchaser, only for three hundred dollars. So, in Sawyer <em>v. </em>Craige, 10 Vt. R., 555, a deed for the east half of a certain lot was erroneously recorded as a deed to the west half. It was-held invalid, as against\" a subsequent <em>bona fide </em>purchaser of the east half. See also 20 Ohio R., 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
