The defendant plead not guilty. In the course of the trial, counsel offered testimony to prove the general character of the defendant, and asked a witness the following questions: \u201c Do you know defendant\u2019s general reputation amongst his neighbors for morality and good behavior?\u201d \u201cDo you know defendant\u2019s general character ?\u201d The Court below refused to admit the evidence, or permit the witness to answer the questions. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>which, defendant excepted. The only witness in the case for the prosecution was the mother of the child.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-5\">Defendant appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b140-6\"><em>C.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AmA\">delivered the opinion of the Court\u2014Burnett, J., concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">The appellant was convicted of an assault, with the intent to commit a rape. Several grounds of error are relied on for reversal. Those which go to the indictment should have been taken by demurrer. See Crim. Code, \u00a7 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">The evidence set out in the record, is plain and unequivocal. Evidence of good character is only admissible in doubtful cases, and when admitted, should <em>\u201c </em>be restricted to the trait of character which is in issue, and ought to bear some analogy and reference to the nature of the charge.\u201d 3 Greenleaf Ev., \u00a7 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">In the case of McDaniel <em>v. </em>The State, (8 Smedes and Marshall, 416,417,) the Supreme Court of Mississippi lay down the rule, that where evidence touching the general character of the party is admitted, it ought manifestly to bear reference to the nature of the charge against him. But this evidence of good character in relation to the particular crime charged, seems to be only admissible in cases where the guilt of the party accused is doubtful. See also Douglass <em>v. </em>Toucey, 2 Wend., 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-12\">It is further alleged, that the Court erred in admitting the evidence of the child. The record does not show that she ever testified in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-13\">The instructions of the Court were correct, and we can discover no error in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-14\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
