Defendant moved for a new trial, which being denied, he appealed from the judgment and the order denying a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b98-6\"><em>S. M. Bowman </em>for Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-7\">The count below erred in overruling the demurrer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-8\">The words alleged in the first and second counts are not <em>per se </em>actionable, and no special damage is shown. Mor does it appear to whom the words were spoken, nor by whom the plaintiff was refused employment; in fact, it does not appear in what manner the plaintiff had sustained any damage whatever. This is not correct pleading according to the forms of the common law. The loss of employment is the gist of the action, so far as the first two counts allege. The damage should be specially averred with every necessary fact, showing how it accrued.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-9\"><em>\u201cAverment of Special </em>Damage.\u2014Where it is necessary to the action that special damage should be proved, or where it is intended to prove it, it should be specially averred; for no special damage can, according to the modern doctrine, be given in evidence which is not laid in the declaration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-10\">\u201c Thus, the averring that several customers left the plaintiff\u2019s house, is no allegation of special damage, for pleadings must specify the names of persons who left.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-11\">\u201cAnd, in accordance with the same rule, if the damage consists in the loss of marriage, the name of the individual must be given, and the plaintiff is bound by the name given, and cannot substitute another on the trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-12\"><em>\u201c </em>Where the special damage consists in the plaintiff\u2019s having been prevented from selling his estate, it must appear how he was prevented, as that he took steps to sell, when the bidding was stopped by the defendant\u2019s acts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-13\">\u201c The object of the rule is that the defendant may be apprised of what he comes to answer.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-14\">Cooke on the Law of Defamation, \u00a7 10, pp. 102-3; Stephen on PL, 352; 1 Starkey on Slander, 440-1, (side page); 1 Chit. PL, 397, (side page); Herrick <em>v. </em>Lapham, 10 John., 281.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-15\">The demurrer pointed directly to these defects, and specified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>them. It would seem perfectly clear that the judgment should be reversed for this error alone, unless we are to disregard all well-settled rules of pleading in such cases.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b99-5\"><em>Sloan &amp; hove </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b99-6\">No brief on file.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b99-7\">Murray, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AHS\">delivered the opinion of the Court\u2014Terry, J., concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">The declaration was sufficient to maintain an action of slander. The words are charged to have been spoken of and concerning the defendant as a clerk or tradesman, which, it is alleged in sxibstance, was his profession, and in such cases, the rule is well established, that it is unnecessary to allege special damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">The want of a proper statement precludes us from examining the other assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
