After the expiration of his term of office, the plaintiff recovered a judgment against Adams &amp; Co., attached the money remaining in Endicott\u2019s hands, and now seeks to make him and his sureties officially liable for the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-6\">Defendant demurred. The demurrer was sustained, and plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b155-7\"><em>McFarland, and Caldwell </em>for Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-8\">Where it is shown to the Court that the sheriff individually is unable to respond, which may be done by affidavit, the remedy is complete on the official bond of the sheriff for a default or misconduct of said officer while he shall continue to discharge any of the duties, or hold said office.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-9\">See <em>2 </em>Wend. R., p. 299, in the case of Anderson <em>v. </em>Hitchcock, where it is decided \u201cthe Court are authorized to order the bond of the sheriff to be put in suit without requiring that a previous recovery shall have been had against the sheriff.\u201d \u201c It is no longer necessary to show a recovery,\u201d but in the exercise of a sound discretion the Court are of opinion \u201c it should be shown to the Court, which may be done by affidavit, that the sheriff is individually unable to respond in damages for the default or misconduct alleged against him.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-10\">It would be a ruinous doctrine, that under such circumstances the defaulting sheriff is only \u201c liable in the same manner and to the same extent as any other garnishee, and no further.\u201d The law has wisely provided a further liability in the bond.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b155-11\"><em>McConnell </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-12\">This action is on the bond of Endicott, or in other words, it is a proceeding against him in an official capacity, and against his sureties as guarantors of his official conduct, for an act or rather an omission to do an act after the expiration of his term of office, and not pertaining to his official duties. It is not, of course, denied that the liability of a sheriff or other ministerial officer may continue after his term of office has expired, in respect to such matters as come into his hands during his term. But here it is expressly shown by the complaint, that the attachment sued out by plaintiff was never in the hands of Endicott, but was served on him as garnishee by his successor in office.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-13\">If the garnishment was properly made, and he had in his possession at the time any funds belonging to Adams &amp; Co., why, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>he is liable in the same manner and the same extent as any other garnishee, and no further.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b156-5\">Murray, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AZZ\">after stating the facts, delivered the opinion of the Court\u2014Terry, J., and Burnett, J., concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The complaint was demurred to, and the demurrer properly sustained. There was no relation between the present plaintiff and Endicott that would render him officially liable. Although responsible to Adams &amp; Co., he was, so far as the plaintiff is concerned, a mere bailee of Adams &amp; Co., and could only be garnisheed as a private individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
