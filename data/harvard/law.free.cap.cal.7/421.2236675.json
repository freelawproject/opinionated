That he had converted a portion of the money into gold-dust, which, with the remainder of the money, had been stolen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-15\">That he had used reasonable care, diligence, and skill in the custody and preservation of the same. The answer specifically denied a demand. At the trial, after plaintiff had rested his case the defendant moved for a nonsuit on the ground that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>demand was alleged or proved. The Court denied the motion, and afterwards instructed the jury \u201c that no demand was necessary in this action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-5\">Judgment for plaintiff, and defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b432-6\"><em>Crocker &amp; Robinson </em>for Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-7\">The complaint does not set forth facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, in this, to wit: A deposit of money, for a specific purpose, is alleged, and there is no allegation of a demand, or account of the money.

R.; 1 Chitty Plead., 331, and authorities cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-8\">The Court erred in overruling the motion for nonsuit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-9\">1. Because there was no evidence showing the money to have been delivered to defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-10\">2. There was no demand for a return or account proved, and the Court ruled it was unnecessary to prove such demand, therefore the Court cannot infer a demand from the testimony.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b432-11\"><em>Smith &amp; Hardy </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b432-12\">Murray, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aqr\">delivered the opinion of the Court\u2014Burnett, J., concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-13\">The plaintiff employed the defendant, as an agent, to buy gold-dust, allowing him a certain per cent, on each one thousand dollars purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-14\">The declaration alleges a deposit \u2022 of nine hundred and forty dollars for this purpose, and a refusal by the defendant, on demand, to account for, or pay over said money, or its equivalent in gold-dust.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-15\">The answer specifically denies a demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-16\">The defendant moved for a nonsuit, on the ground that no demand had been proved. The Court below overruled the motion-, at the same time instructing the jury that a demand need not be shown. This was error. \u201c In an action against an agent, for not accounting, etc., a request to account and pay over the balance must be stated.\u201d 1 Chitty\u2019s Pleading, \u00a7 331, and the cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-17\">If necessary to be stated, it must be proven, as the <em>allegata </em>and <em>probata </em>must correspond.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-18\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
