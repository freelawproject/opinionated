A motion having been made by the defendant, Tarpey, on his answer to dissolve the injunction heretofore granted at the hearing thereof, the plaintiffs introduced, in evidence, a copy of the Ca\u00f1ada del Rincon grant, certified under the hand and seal of John C. Hays, Surveyor-General for California, to be a correct copy of the original on file in his office; and also a copy, certified to by the secretary of the United States Land Commissioners. The Court below having afterwards dissolved the injunction on the ground that no sufficient predicate had been laid for the introduction of the copies, the plaintiffs appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b298-10\"><em>Wallace and Peckham </em>for Appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-11\">The copy of the grant under the certificate of the Surveyor-General, was admissible; 1 Green. Ev., \u00a7\u00a7 470-482-485; Rex <em>v. </em>Smith, 1 Strange, 126; U. S. <em>v. </em>Percheman, 7 Peters, 51, 85; 14 Peters, in U.

But if there was any doubt upon this question at common law, it is settled by the Statutes of 1856, page 21.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-12\">The copy of the grant under the affidavit of the secretary of the United States Land Commission, was admissible. See the authorities last cited, and Statutes of 1854, p. 67, \u00a7 21.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-13\">No question is made to the competency of the certificate of the Surveyor-General, or his power to certify. The only question is, <em>\u201c </em>Was the absence of the original sufficiently accounted for to let in the copies in either case <em>V\u2019 </em>The reason why private papers are not provable by copy until the original is accounted for, is, because the original is the best evidence. The reason of this rule is, to prevent mistakes, errors, or variances between the original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>and copy. But in this case, the genuineness of the original and correctness of the copy being agreed to, the reason of the rule ceases, and the copy should be admitted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-5\">Greenleaf says, that it is not necessary to prove any matters of public history affecting the whole people, nor public matters affecting the government of the country. 1 Green.

If these officers have adopted a rule, refusing to allow original papers to be taken from the the files, that fact should have been shown by affidavit, before evidence of their contents could be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
