that by virtue of said written permission, the said Nieto entered upon said tract of land, in said year, with his cattle and other property, and laborers, and erected a house and corral thereon, and enclosed and cultivated one hundred and sixty acres, part of which land so enclosed and cultivated was on said tract, and a part adjoining thereto, on the north side thereof; that said Nieto continued there, so occupying said land, until his death, which occurred in the year eighteen hundred and four; that during said occupancy, he had a large amount of cattle and horses upon said tract, for the purpose of grazing thereon; that at his death, said Nieto left four children\u2014Jos\u00e9 Antonio, Juan Jos\u00e9, Manuel, and <em>Antonio Maria, the latter of whom is the father of plaintiffs ; </em>that in the year eighteen hundred and fifteen, the father of the plaintiffs married Josefa Cota, the mother of the plaintiffs; <em>that after the death of Manuel Nieto, his said children continued to occupy the tract of land above described, with boundaries as above specified, by and under the same permission given their father, and in the same manner, until the year eighteen hundred and thirty-two, when said Jos\u00e9 Antonio and said Antonio Maria died; that from </em>1796 <em>until </em>1833, <em>the said tract, with the said boundaries above specified, were known and respected by the neighbors; </em>that no part of said land was inclosed, only as aforesaid; that in the year 1833, Juan Jos\u00e9 Nieto, Manuel Nieto, Josefa Cota, and Catarina Ruis, widow of said Jos\u00e9 Antonio, agreed verbally to make a partition of said land, as above bounded, and to apply to Jos\u00e9 Figueroa, then Governor of California, for the grant of the same, according to the division; that division was thereupon then made between them, of said land; that said Governor did make and issue his several grants, dated May 21,1834, one grant to each of said parties, for the portion and parts of said tract allotted to them by said partition; that by said grant, Juan Jos\u00e9 Nieto had two parcels thereof, known as the \u201cCoyotes\u201d and \u201cAlamitos;\" to Manuel Nieto, one part thereof, known as \u201cLos Sierritos;\u201d to Catarina Ruis, one part thereof, known as the \u201c Bolsas;\u201d that said part allotted upon said division, and granted to Josefa Cota, is known as the \u201c Santa Guertridis,\u201d being the land sued for in this suit; that no grant had at any time been made or issued to said Manuel Nieto in his lifetime, or to his children after his death, or said persons, only as above-mentioned; <em>that the children of said Manuel Nieto, when so occupying the land as aforesaid, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number><em>claimed to be owners </em>thereof; that in the year 1827, Juan Jos\u00e9 \u00a1Nieto claimed that the land had been granted to his father, but that, in the year 1820, he had been ordered by the Governor (Sola) of California to kill the horses thereon, or leave the rancho, and in obedience thereto he had killed the horses. That after the said grant of said land to said Josefa Cota, <em>she continued to live upon said land with her children, </em>(the plaintiffs,) <em>until the twenty-seventh day of December, </em>1848, when she conveyed the same by deed to the defendant, for a full and valuable consideration, with notice of no other title than the said grant made to her by the said Governor; and that the said defendant has continued in possession thereof from the time of said purchase to the present time; that between the time of said purchase by said defendant and the year 1851, the defendant made improvements on said land of the value of five thousand dollars, with the knowledge of the plaintiffs, without objection by them, or claim to said land being by them made; that she received, in part payment of said land, money, which was by her applied to one-third of the payment of a tract of land which she purchased in Los Angeles, on which she continued to reside with her children, the said plaintiffs, until her death, since which time the said plaintiffs have continued to occupy and enjoy the same;, that said Josefa Cota died in the year 1847; that the plaintiffs were born as follows : Petra, in the year 1816; Concepcion, in the year 1819; Diego, in the year 1823; Jos\u00e9 Antonio, in the year 1828; Maria Dolores, in the year 1830; and Jos\u00e9 Jesus, in the year 1831.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-5\">Upon these facts, the Court states the law to be, that the plaintiffs have no title to the land sued for in this suit, and are not entitled to recover.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AAL\">after stating the facts as above, delivered the opinion of the Court on the first hearing of this cause\u2014HeydenEEiiDT, J., and Terry, J., concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-18\">We shall not take up the arguments of the counsel in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>order in which they were made, as it will not be necessary to pass on all the points raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The finding of the Court below, that Manuel Nieto, the ancestor of the plaintiffs, entered into possession by virtue of a permission, or license, from the Spanish Government, to graze his cattle thereon, and not under a deed, or grant, is undoubtedly correct, if drawn alone, from the parol evidence adduced to rebut the presumption of a grant which would arise from his ancient possession and occupation; for the presumption of a grant arising from these circumstances, like any other presumption, may be rebutted by proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The finding of the Court, however, in the present case, as we think, was against the legal effect of the decree of July 27,1833, which expressly recites that the land in question had been granted to Nieto, and that he, the Governor, had seen the proceedings wherein was contained the grant of said land by his Excellency Governor Pedro Pages.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Admitting, for the sake of the argument, Nieto never had any title to land in dispute, except a mere permission to occupy, in other words, that he was a mere tenant-at-will of the Spanish crown, still it cannot be denied, that even if the fee was in the government of Mexico, at the date of this decree, she would be estopped from denying the title of Manuel Nieto and his heirs. In other words, whether the land belonged to Mexico, or not, Figueroa, as the political chief of the territory, had the authority to bind the government by his acts or admissions in relation to the public lands, and having, in a solemn decree, declared the title of said lands was originally in Manuel Nieto, the government was estopped from denying such admission, or re-granting the premises to another. When this decree, which is the foundation of the subsequent grant, is examined in connection with the petition of Grijalba, and the grant to Josefa Cota, all doubt upon the subject is at once relieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">The petition has already been set out, and states, in substance, what is published in the decree, viz.: that Manuel Nieto held the land in question by a grant which had been lost. The deed recites :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-9\">\u201c That whereas, Josefa Cota, wife of Don Antonio Maria Nieto, has shown that she is entitled to the estate of the deceased, Manuel Nieto, and, taking into consideration the ancient and peaceable possession which she has had of the place,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">How had Josefa Cota shown herself entitled to the estate of her husband? Certainly in no other way than by the petition of Grijalba, and if entitled to the estate, what was her interest ? Simply such as might arise by reason of her position, as the natural and legal guardian of her children, the infant heirs of Manuel Nieto, deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">The deed goes on, and recites that it is made in conformity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>with the previous decree of July 27th, 1833. No new title is attempted to be given, but, as we think by reference to this decree, it was the intention of Figueroa to declare the heirs of Manuel Nieto to be the owners of the land by virtue of a preexisting deed, and to assign to each one his share, by way of partition, as he most undoubtedly had the right to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The argument that the document through which the plaintiffs claim is not a grant, but a simple recognition of title, is strengthened by the fact that different words are employed in it from those ordinarily used. The depositions of C. E. Carr, Clerk of the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, and Capt. H. W. Halleck, both of thorn have been officially connected with the ancient records of California, and have examined them, show that the word <em>conced\u00e9r, </em>to grant, was technical, and that the word <em>declarar, </em>to declare, had probably never been used except in the single case of the Nieto grants; and that these grants ordinarily contained the provision of subjection to the approval of the Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">It is contended that the fact that the deed to Josefa Cota contains conditions, the non-compliance with which subjects the land to forfeiture and denouncement, is an argument going to show that the Governor believed he was making a new grant, instead of declaring the title to be in the heirs of Nieto, by a prior <em>one; </em>otherwise, these words would not have been inserted, as he had no power to annex conditions to a previous perfect title. The answer to this is, that the deed, as before said, was made in conformity with the decree, and as the title was admitted to be in Nieto, the conditions were of no effect, and ought not properly to have been inserted in the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">This view of the legal effect of the grant by Figueroa to Josefa Cota, would be conclusive upon the rights of the parties, were it not for a fact in the record upon which there appears to be no finding of the Court, and which seems not to have entered into consideration in the decision of the case <em>below; </em>that is, that the sale to Carpenter, the grantor of the defendants, was made in pursuance of a decree of the Court of First Instance of Los Angeles, and that the Judge of said Court made said order of sale in conformity with the direction, in writing, of Micheltorena, at that time Governor of California, vested with plenary powers. It is in evidence that these orders were based upon the representation of Josefa Cota, the natural guardian of the infant heirs, and that the land was sold and the proceeds applied to their maintenance and support.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Now, whether the Court of First Instance had the inherent power to order a sale in such cases or not, is a matter of little consequence, inasmuch as the proceeding was authorized by the Governor, who was vested with all power, and whose acts the law presumes to have been done correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>On this point we are satisfied that the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover, and although the judgment below was against them, for different, and as we suppose wrong reasons; still, as the result is correct, we will not disturb it.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">On the re-hearing at this Term, Murray, C. J., delivered the opinion of the Court\u2014Terry, J., concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">In the previous opinion of this Court, the judgment of the District Court was affirmed, not upon the view taken of the case by the Court below, but on the ground that the sale of the property in question by Josefa Cota was authorized by the Governor of the Territory and a Judge of the First Instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Upon a petition for a re-hearing, our attention has been called to the fact that the defence on which our opinion was predicated, was abandoned in the Court below. Under these circumstances, the judgment must be reversed ; and as it appears from the record, that the defendant may have a defence to the action on the ground assumed by this Court as the basis of its former decision, a new trial is ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
