The second issue is whether the organization\u2019s members may claim a charitable deduction for the portion of their premium payments that exceeds the actual cost to the organization of providing insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b890-14\">Respondent American Bar Endowment (ABE) is a corporation exempt from taxation under \u00a7 501(c)(3) of the Code, which, with certain exceptions not relevant here, exempts organizations \u201corganized and operated exclusively for ... charitable ... or educational purposes.\u201d ABE\u2019s primary purposes are to advance legal research and to promote the administration of justice, and it furthers these goals primarily through the distribution of grants to other charitable and educational groups. All members of the American Bar Association (ABA) are automatically members of ABE. The ABA is exempt from taxation as a \u201cbusiness league\u201d under \u00a7 501(c)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-15\">ABE raises money for its charitable work by providing group insurance policies, underwritten by major insurance companies, to its members. Approximately 20% of ABE\u2019s members participate in the group insurance program, which offers life, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2429\">*2429</page-number>health, accident, and disability policies. ABE negotiates premium rates with insurers and chooses which insurers shall provide the policies. It also compiles a list of its own members and solicits them, collects the premiums paid by its members, transmits those premiums to the insurer, maintains files on each policyholder, answers members\u2019 questions concerning insurance policies, and screens claims for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">There are two important benefits of purchasing insurance as a group rather than individually. The first is that ABE\u2019s size gives it bargaining power that individuals lack. The second is that the group policy is experience-rated. This means that the cost of insurance to the group is based on that group\u2019s claims experience, rather than general actuarial tables. Because ABA members have favorable mortality and morbidity rates, experience-rating results in a substantially lower insurance cost. When ABE purchases a group policy for its members, it pays a negotiated premium to the insurance company. If, as is uniformly true, the insurance company\u2019s actual cost of providing insurance to the group is lower than the premium paid in a given year, the insurance company pays a refund of the excess, called a \u201cdividend,\u201d to ABE. Critical to ABE\u2019s fund-raising efforts is the fact that ABE requires its members to agree, as a condition of participating in the group insurance program, that they will permit ABE to keep all of the dividends rather than distributing them pro-rata to the insured members.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">It would be possible for ABE to negotiate lower premium rates for its members than the rates it has charged throughout the relevant period, and thus receive a lower dividend. However, ABE prices its policies competitively with other insurance policies offered to the public and to ABE members. 761 F.2d 1573, 1575 (CAFC 1985). In this way ABE is able to generate large dividends to be used for its charitable purposes. In recent years the total amount of dividends has exceeded 40% of the members\u2019 premium payments. <em>Ibid. </em>ABE advises its insured members that each member\u2019s share of the dividends, less ABE\u2019s administrative costs, constitutes a tax-deductible contribution from the member to ABE. Thus the after-tax cost of ABE\u2019s insurance to its members is less than the cost of a commercial policy with identical coverage and premium rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">In 1980 the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) advised ABE that it considered ABE\u2019s insurance plan an \u201cunrelated trade or business\u201d and that the profits thereon were subject to tax under \u00a7\u00a7 511-513. Subsequently IRS audited ABE\u2019s tax returns for 1979 and 1980 and assessed a tax deficiency on ABE\u2019s net revenues from the insurance program. ABE paid those taxes, as well as taxes on the 1981 revenues. After exhausting administrative remedies, it brought an action for a refund in the Claims Court, arguing that its revenues from the insurance program were not subject to tax. At approximately the same time, the individual respondents, who were participants in the ABE insurance program but who had not originally deducted any part of the insurance premiums as charitable contributions, brought suit for refunds in the Claims Court as well. The individual respondents argued that they were entitled to charitable deductions for a portion of those premium payments. The two suits were consolidated for trial in the Claims Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">The Claims Court entered judgment for ABE in its suit, finding that ABE\u2019s provision of insurance to its members did not constitute a \u201ctrade or business\u201d subject to tax. 4 Cl.Ct. 404 (1984). It found for the Government, however, on the individual respondents\u2019 claims. The court concluded that a taxpayer may claim a charitable contribution for a portion of a payment for goods or services only when he can show that \u201che bought goods or services for more than their economic value, with the intention that the excess be used to benefit a charitable enterprise,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 415 (citation omitted), and that the individual respondents had not established these facts. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2430\">*2430</page-number>Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed as to ABE\u2019s taxes. 761 F.2d, at 1577. As to the individual respondents, however the court reversed and remanded for further factfinding. We granted the Government\u2019s petition for certiorari on both issues, 474 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 522, 88 L.Ed.2d 455 (1985), and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">We recently discussed the history and structure of the unrelated business income provisions of the Code in <em>United States v. American College of Physicians, </em>475 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 1591, 89 L.Ed.2d 841 (1986). The Code imposes a tax, at ordinary corporate rates, on the income that a tax-exempt organization obtains from an \u201cunrelated trade or business ... regularly carried on by it.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 512(a)(1), 511(a)(1). An \u201cunrelated trade or business\u201d is \u201cany trade or business the conduct of which is not substantially related ... to the exercise or performance by such organization of its charitable, educational, or other purpose,\u201d \u00a7 513(a). The Code thus sets up a three-part test. ABE\u2019s insurance program is taxable if it (1) constitutes a trade or business; (2) is regularly carried on; and (3) is not substantially related to ABE\u2019s tax-exempt purposes. Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.513-l(a), 26 CFR \u00a7 1.513-l(a) (1985); <em>American College of Physicians, supra, </em>at -, 106 S.Ct., at 1594. ABE concedes that the latter two portions of this test are satisfied. 761 F.2d, at 1576. Its defense is based solely on the proposition that its insurance program does not constitute a trade or business.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-14\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b892-15\">In the Tax Reform Act of 1969, Pub.L. 91-172, 83 Stat. 487, Congress defined a \u201ctrade or business\u201d as \u201cany activity which is carried on for the production of income from the sale of goods or the performance of services,\u201d \u00a7 513(c). The Secretary of the Treasury has provided further clarification of that definition in Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.513-l(b) (1985), which provides: \u201cin general, any activity of [an exempt] organization which is carried on for the production of income and which otherwise possesses the characteristics required to constitute \u2018trade or business\u2019 within the meaning of section 162\u201d is a trade or business for purposes of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 511-513.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-16\">ABE\u2019s insurance program falls within the literal language of these definitions. ABE\u2019s activity is both \u201cthe sale of goods\u201d and \u201cthe performance of services,\u201d and possesses the general characteristics of a trade or business. Certainly the assembling of a group of better-than-average insurance risks, negotiating on their behalf with insurance companies, and administering a group policy are activities that can be\u2014and are\u2014provided by private commercial entities in order to make a profit. ABE itself earns considerable income from its program. Nevertheless, the Claims Court and Court of Appeals concluded that ABE does not carry out its insurance program in order to make a profit. The Claims Court relied on the former Court of Claims holding, in <em>Disabled American Veterans v. United States, </em>650 F.2d 1178,1187 (1981), that an activity is a trade or business only if \u201coperated in a competitive, commercial manner.\u201d See 4 Cl.Ct., at 409. Because ABE does not operate its insur-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2431\">*2431</page-number>anee program in a competitive, commercial manner, the Claims Court decided, that program is not a trade or business. The Court of Appeals adopted this reasoning. 761 F.2d, at 1577.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">The Claims Court rested its conclusion on four factors. First, it found that \u201cthe program was devised as a means for fundrais-ing and has been so presented and perceived from its inception.\u201d 4 Cl.Ct., at 409. Second, the court found that the program\u2019s phenomenal success in generating dividends for ABE was evidence of noncommercial behavior. The court noted that ABE\u2019s insurance program has provided $81.9 million in dividends in its 28 years of operation, and concluded that such large profits could not be the result of commercial success, but must proceed from the generosity of ABE\u2019s members. Third, and most important, in the court\u2019s view, was the fact that ABE\u2019s members collectively had the power to change ABE\u2019s conduct of the insurance program so as to drastically reduce premiums. That the members had not done so was strong evidence that they sought to further ABE\u2019s charitable purposes by paying higher insurance rates than necessary. Fourth, because ABE did not underwrite insurance or act as a broker, it was not competing with other commercial entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">It appears, then, that the Claims Court viewed ABE as engaging in two separate activities\u2014the provision of insurance and the acceptance of contributions in the form of dividends. If so, the unspoken premise of the Claims Court\u2019s decision is that ABE\u2019s income is not a result of the first activity, but of the second. There is some sense to this reasoning; should ABE sell a product to its members for more than that product\u2019s fair market value, it could argue to the IRS that the members intended to pay excessive prices as a form of contribution, and that some formula should be adopted to separate the income received into taxable profits and nontaxable contributions. Even if we viewed it as appropriate for the federal courts to engage in such a quasi-legislative activity, however, there is no factual basis for the Claims Court\u2019s attempt to do so in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">We cannot agree with the Claims Court that the enormous dividends generated by ABE\u2019s insurance program demonstrate that those dividends cannot constitute \u201cprofits.\u201d Were ABE\u2019s insurance markedly more expensive than other insurance products available to its members, but ABE nevertheless kept the patronage of those members, we might plausibly conclude that generosity was the reason for the program\u2019s success. The Claims Court did not find, however, that this was the case. ABE prices its insurance to remain competitive with the rest of the market. 4 Cl.Ct., at 406. Thus ABE\u2019s members never squarely face the decision whether to support ABE or to reduce their own insurance costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">The Claims Court concluded that \u201csuch profit margins [as ABE\u2019s] cannot be maintained year after year in a competitive market.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 410. The court apparently reasoned that ABE\u2019s staggering success would inevitably induce other firms to offer similar programs to ABA members unless that success is the result of charitable intentions rather than price-sensitive purchasing decisions. It is possible, of course, that ABE\u2019s members genuinely intend to support ABE by paying higher premiums than necessary, and would pay those high premiums even if a competing group insurance plan offered very low premiums. But that is by no means the only possible explanation for the market\u2019s failure to provide competition for ABE.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Lacking a factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2432\">*2432</page-number>basis for concluding that generosity is at the core of ABE\u2019s success, we can easily view this case as a standard example of monopoly pricing. ABE has a unique asset\u2014its access to the ABA\u2019s members and their highly favorable mortality and morbidity rates\u2014and it has chosen to appropriate for itself all of the profit possible from that asset, rather than sharing any with its members.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">The argument that ABE\u2019s members could change the insurance program and receive the bulk of the dividends themselves if they so desired is unconvincing. Were ABE to give each member a choice between retaining his pro-rata share of dividends or assigning them to ABE, the organization would have a strong argument that those dividends constituted a voluntary donation. That, however, is not the case here. ABE requires its members to assign it all dividends as a condition for participating in the insurance program. It is simply incorrect to characterize the assignment of dividends by each member as \u201cvoluntary\u201d simply because the members theoretically could band together and attempt to change the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Again, the Claims Court put too much weight on an unsupported assumption. It found that the program was \u201coperated with the approval and consent of the ABA membership,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>observing that the program had met with \u201csurprisingly little dissent,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 411, even though there were \u201cample\u201d opportunities for members to change policies with which they disagree, <em>ibid. </em>We believe that those facts cannot carry the weight that the Claims Court put on them. Perhaps each member that purchases insurance would, given the option, pay excessive premiums in order to support ABE\u2019s charitable purposes; however, that is not the only possible explanation for the members\u2019 failure to change the program. Any given member might feel that the potential savings in insurance costs are not sufficient to justify the effort required to mount a challenge to ABE\u2019s leadership. Many might not want to \u201cmake waves\u201d and upset a program that generates tax-free income for ABE and charitable deductions for their fellow members. The members\u2019 theoretical ability to change the program, therefore, is at best inconclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">The Claims Court also erred in concluding that ABE\u2019s insurance program did not present the potential for unfair competition. The undisputed purpose of the unrelated business income tax was to prevent tax-exempt organizations from competing unfairly with businesses whose earnings were taxed. H.R.Rep. No. 2319, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., 36 (1950); see <em>United States v. American College of Physicians, </em>475 U.S., at-, 106 S.Ct., at 1594. This case presents an example of precisely the sort of unfair competition that Congress intended to prevent. If ABE\u2019s members may deduct part of their premium payments as a charitable contribution, the effective cost of ABE\u2019s insurance will be lower than the cost of competing policies that do not offer tax benefits. Similarly, if ABE may escape taxes on its earnings, it need not be as profitable as its commercial counterparts in order to receive the same return on its investment. Should a commercial company attempt to displace ABE as the group policyholder, therefore, it would be at a decided disadvantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-12\">The Claims Court failed to find any taxable entities that compete with ABE, and therefore found no danger of unfair competition. It is likely, however, that many of ABE\u2019s members belong to other organiza<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2433\">*2433</page-number>tions that offer group insurance policies. Employers, trade associations,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and financial services companies frequently offer group insurance policies. Presumably those entities are taxed on their profits, and their policyholders may not deduct any part of the premiums paid. Such entities may therefore find it difficult to compete for the business of any ABE members who are otherwise eligible to participate in these group insurance programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\">The only valid argument in ABE\u2019s favor, therefore, is that the insurance program is billed as a fund-raising effort. That fact, standing alone, cannot be determinative, or any exempt organization could engage in a tax-free business by \u201cgiving away\u201d its product in return for a \u201ccontribution\u201d equal to the market value of the product. ABE further contends that it must prevail because the Claims Court found that ABE\u2019s profits represent contributions rather than business income; ABE argues that we may not upset that finding unless it is clearly erroneous. Cf. <em>Carter v. Commissioner, </em>645 F.2d 784, 786 (CA9 1981) (question of profit motive for purposes of \u00a7 162 is one of fact). The undisputed facts, however, simply will not support the inference that the dividends ABE receives are charitable contributions from its members rather than profits from its insurance program. Moreover, the Claims Court failed to articulate a legal rule that would permit it to split ABE\u2019s activities into the gratuitous provision of a service and the acceptance of voluntary contributions, and we find no such rule in the Code or regulations. Even if we assumed, however, that the court\u2019s failure to attach the label \u201ctrade or business\u201d to ABE\u2019s insurance program constitutes a finding of fact, we would be constrained to hold that finding clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">Section 170 of the Code provides that a taxpayer may deduct from taxable income any \u201ccharitable contribution,\u201d defined as \u201ca contribution or gift to or for the use of\u201d qualifying entities, \u00a7 170(c). The individual respondents contend that the excess of their premium payments over the cost to ABE of providing insurance constitutes a contribution or gift to ABE.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">Many of the considerations supporting our holding that ABE\u2019s earnings from the insurance program are taxable also bear on the question whether ABE\u2019s members may deduct part of their premium payments. The evidence demonstrates, and the Claims Court found, that ABE\u2019s insurance is no more costly to its members than other policies\u2014group or individual\u2014available to them. Thus, as we have recognized, ABE\u2019s members are never faced with the hard choice of supporting a worthwhile charitable endeavor or reducing their own insurance costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">A payment of money generally cannot constitute a charitable contribution if the contributor expects a substantial benefit in return. S.Rep. No. 1622, 83rd Cong., 2d Sess., 196 (1954), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1954, p. 4629; <em>Singer Co. v. United States, </em>196 Ct.Cl. 90, 449 F.2d 413 (1971). However, as the Claims Court recognized, a taxpayer may sometimes receive only a nominal benefit in return for his contribution. Where the size of the payment is clearly out of proportion to the benefit received, it would not serve the purposes of \u00a7 170 to deny a deduction altogether. A taxpayer may therefore claim a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2434\">*2434</page-number>deduction for the difference between a payment to a charitable organization and the market value of the benefit received in return, on the theory that the payment has the \u201cdual character\u201d of a purchase and a contribution. See, <em>e.g., </em>Rev.Rul. 67-246, 1967-2 Cum.Bull. 104 (price of ticket to charity ball deductible to extent it exceeds market value of admission); Rev.Rul. 68-432, 1968-2 Cum.Bull. 104, 105 (noting possibility that payment to charitable organization may have \u201cdual character\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">In Rev.Rul. 67-246, <em>supra, </em>the IRS set up a two-part test for determining when part of a \u201cdual payment\u201d is deductible. First, the payment is deductible only if and to the extent it exceeds the market value of the benefit received. Second, the excess payment must be \u201cmade with the intention of making a gift.\u201d 1967-2 Cum.Bull., at 105. The Tax Court has adopted this test, see <em>Murphy v. Commissioner, </em>54 T.C. 249, 254 (1970); <em>Arceneaux v. Commissioner, </em>36 TCM 1461, 1464 (1977); but see <em>Oppe-wal v. Commissioner, </em>468 F.2d 1000, 1002 (CA1 1972) (expressing \u201cdissatisfaction with such subjective tests as the taxpayer\u2019s motives in making a purported charitable contribution\u201d and relying solely on differential between amount of payment and value of benefit).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">The Claims Court applied that test in this case, and held that respondents Broadfoot, Boynton, and Turner had not established that they could have purchased comparable insurance for less money. Therefore, the court held, they had failed to establish that the value of ABE\u2019s insurance to these respondents was less than the- premiums paid. 4 Cl.Ct., at 415-417. Respondent Sherwood demonstrated that there did exist a group insurance program for which he was eligible and which offered lower premiums than ABE\u2019s insurance. However, Sherwood failed to establish that he was aware of that competing program during the years at issue. Sherwood therefore had failed to demonstrate that he met the second part of the above test\u2014that he had intentionally paid more than the market value for ABE\u2019s insurance because he wished to make a gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">The Court of Appeals, in reversing, held that the Claims Court had focused excessively on the taxpayers\u2019 motivation. In the Court of Appeals\u2019 view, the necessary inquiry was whether \u201cthe transaction was ... of a business and not a charitable nature,\u201d considering all of the circumstances. 761 F.2d, at 1582. The Court of Appeals therefore remanded for redetermination under that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">We hold that the Claims Court applied the proper standard. The <em>sine qua non </em>of a charitable contribution is a transfer of money or property without adequate consideration. The taxpayer, therefore, must at a minimum demonstrate that he purposely contributed money or property in excess of the value of any benefit he received in return. The most logical test of the value of the insurance respondents received is the cost of similar policies. Three of the four individual respondents failed to demonstrate that they could have purchased similar policies for a lower cost, and we must therefore assume that the value of ABE\u2019s insurance to those taxpayers at least equals their premium payments. Had respondent Sherwood known that he could purchase comparable insurance for less money, ABE\u2019s insurance would necessarily have declined in value.to him. Because Sherwood did not have that knowledge, however, we again must assume that he valued ABE\u2019s insurance equivalently to those competing policies of which he was aware. Because those policies cost as much as or more than ABE\u2019s, Sherwood has failed to demonstrate that he intentionally gave away more than he received.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">We hold that ABE\u2019s insurance program is a \u201ctrade or business\u201d for purposes of the unrelated business income tax. We further hold that the individual taxpayers have not established that any portion of their premium payments to ABE constitutes a charitable contribution. Accordingly, we reverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2435\">*2435</page-number>the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand to that court with instructions to reverse the judgment of the Claims Court with respect to ABE and to affirm the judgment of the Claims Court with respect to the individual taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Justice POWELL and Justice O\u2019CON-NOR took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b892-12\">. Section 162 permits a taxpayer to deduct \u201call the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business.\u201d Undoubtedly due to the desirability of tax deductions, \u00a7 162 has spawned a rich and voluminous jurisprudence. The standard test for the existence of a trade or business for purposes of \u00a7 162 is whether the activity \"was entered into with the dominant hope and intent of realizing a profit.\" <em>Brannen </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>722 F.2d 695, 704 (CA11 1984) (citation omitted). Thus several Courts of Appeals have adopted the \"profit motive\u201d test to determine whether an activity constitutes a trade or business for purposes of the unrelated business income tax. See <em>Professional Insurance Agents of Michigan </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>726 F.2d 1097 (CA6 1984); <em>Carolinas Farm &amp; Power Equipment Dealers v. United States, </em>699 F.2d 167 (CA4 1983); <em>Louisiana Credit Union League </em>v. <em>United States, </em>693 F.2d 525 (CA5 1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b893-7\">. One obvious consideration is that ABE\u2019s tax-exempt status would make it difficult for private firms to compete, see <em>infra, </em>at 2432. In addition, as the Claims Court recognized, 4 Cl.Ct., at 414, the provision of group insurance coverage to a particular group may have the characteristics of a natural monopoly. The potential savings in insurance costs might decrease rapidly as the group splits into competing components. Finally, if the cost of assembling information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2432\">*2432</page-number>about a particular group and maintaining an accurate list of members is high, the provision of group insurance might be economically feasible only if that cost can be shared among a variety of services performed by the group policyholder. In that case pre-existing groups like the ABA or a trade association would obviously have a considerable advantage over new entrants. The record here is barren of facts concerning these hypotheses, and we express no opinion as to their accuracy. We present them, however, to demonstrate that it is incorrect to assume, as did the courts below, that ABE\u2019s profitability must result from the generosity of its members.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b895-5\">. The unrelated-business-income cases cited in n. 1, <em>supra, </em>all concerned group insurance programs offered by trade associations to their members. In each case the Court of Appeals held that those programs constituted a taxable trade or business. The Claims Court distinguished those cases on the grounds that they involved organizations exempt as business leagues under \u00a7 501(c)(6) rather than as charities under \u00a7 501(c)(3). That distinction, however, is insubstantial. Business leagues engage in fund-raising for exempt purposes just as charities do. The taxpayers in those cases could have claimed that the excess dividends constituted tax-exempt membership fees, just as ABE claims that they constitute tax-exempt charitable contributions. Both claims fail for the same reasons.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b897-7\">Justice STEVENS,</author>\n<p id=\"aff-dedup-0\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">The charitable work of the American Bar Endowment is funded, in large part, through a procedure in which the Endowment provides insurance policies for participating American Bar Association members, and the members assign the dividends to the ABE. The primary question presented is whether that assignment of dividends is taxable as an unrelated \u201ctrade or business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">\u201cThe problem at which the tax on unrelated business income is directed ... is primarily that of unfair competition.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The unrelated business tax was adopted in 1950, and substantially revised in 1969. It is useful to recall the kind of situation that gave rise to the unrelated business tax. Perhaps the best known case involved the C.F. Mueller Company. The Mueller company was a longstanding macaroni concern. It was acquired and operated for the benefit of the New York University School of Law, and its profits were donated to the University. The Internal Revenue Service claimed that the macaroni company\u2019s profits should be taxable, like any other competitive macaroni company, to avoid giving this competitor an unfair advantage. Although longstanding precedent seemed to be against the Commissioner, the Tax Court was sufficiently concerned about the implications that it agreed with the Commissioner. Ultimately, the Court of Appeals reversed, relying on precedent; by that time, however, Congress had acted and imposed a tax on unrelated business income. See <em>C.F. Mueller Co. v. Commissioner, </em>190 F.2d 120 (CA3 1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-15\">In considering the ABE insurance fund-raising, then, it is appropriate to assume that, if the ABE were funded by operating a normal macaroni company and receiving an unfair competitive advantage from its tax exemption, it would be a \u201ctrade or business\u201d within the Act and taxable. On the other hand, it is equally clear that, if the ABE simply provided insurance for ABA members at very low cost, and sent the insurance dividends with an urgent request that the dividends be assigned to the Endowment, the arrangement would not be a \u201ctrade or business,\u201d and would not be taxable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The central issue in this case is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2436\">*2436</page-number>thus whether the ABE\u2019s insurance program should be viewed as akin to the macaroni company, and thus a \u201ctrade or business,\u201d or as akin to the dividend assignment request, and thus not a \u201ctrade or business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">I believe that the ABE\u2019s activities are far closer to the latter than the former for two reasons. First, there is no danger of unfair competition, the problem that the unrelated business tax addresses. Second, the program has functioned as a charitable fundraising effort, rather than as a business.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">An understanding of the purpose of the unrelated business income tax exposes a basic error in the Court\u2019s analysis. As noted, that purpose is to protect commercial enterprises from the unfair competition that may be generated by the operation of competing businesses by tax-free organizations. There is no evidence in the record, despite more than three weeks of trial and numerous witnesses, to support the notion that the Endowment\u2019s provision of insurance to its members has had any competitive impact whatsoever. The Court relies on a parade of hypothetical to justify its conclusion that there is some effect on competition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court is, however, unable to point to a single piece of evidence in the record to justify its conclusion about the effect on competition. \u201cSpeculation about hypothetical cases illuminates the discussion in a classroom, but it is evidence and historical fact that provide the most illumination in a courtroom.\u201d <em>Brown Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor Authority, </em>476 U.S.-,-, 106 S.Ct. 2080, 2088, 90 L.Ed.2d 552 (1986) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). The trial judge scoured the record for evidence pointing to a harmful effect on competition, and found none.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The absence of evidence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2437\">*2437</page-number>record, rather than the Court\u2019s ruminations about possibilities and likelihoods, should control our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">The legislative history further underscores the fact that the ABE insurance operation poses none of the possible effects on competition that the unrelated business tax was intended to address. Congress has twice made clear that insurance programs by other nonprofit organizations are not subject to the unrelated business tax. When Congress substantially revised the unrelated business tax in 1969, the accompanying legislative history emphasized that the group tax policies provided by fraternal organizations were not intended to be subject to the unrelated business tax.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Similarly, when a question arose concerning the taxability of income from insurance programs administered by veterans\u2019 organizations, Congress enacted legislation to ensure that the insurance income would not be taxed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Indeed, Congress found the taxation of the veterans\u2019 insurance operations so contrary to its intent that it took the unusual step of making the 1972 Amendment fully retroactive to 1969.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">The Government argues that these developments actually support its position because the need for congressional attention, and the emphasis on the \u201csubstantially related\u201d prong for the fraternal societies, reveal that, without such attention, and without such a substantial relationship, the activity should be presumptively taxable. Particularly when the general legislative purpose of preventing unfair competition is considered, however, these legislative developments have a different significance. For they highlight the fact that the \u201cmarket\u201d in which the ABE is competing, even temporarily leaving aside the complete absence of evidence of harm to competitors, is itself already partially exempt from the unrelated business income tax provisions, and the possible threat to competition becomes all the more hypothetical and remote.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-11\">Ironically, moreover, the tax-exempt alternative suggested by the Government would have a far more obvious effect on competition than the ABE\u2019s current fund-raising process. For the ABE would then be offering insurance rates dramatically lower than those available elsewhere. If speculation of the kind indulged in by the majority is appropriate, that speculation surely should include the realization that the tax-exempt alternative\u2014in which the ABE would merely recover its actual costs of managing the program and return all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2438\">*2438</page-number>the premium refunds to the individual policyholders\u2014would attract more than the 20% of the ABA membership that currently hold ABE policies; it would appeal to those who simply want an insurance bargain rather than those who also want to make a charitable contribution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">It is not completely surprising that a consideration of the purpose of the unrelated business tax in light of the record developed at the extensive trial leads to a conclusion that the ABE\u2019s program should not be taxed. For the Government itself initially held such a view.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Furthermore, the ABE\u2019s insurance program was initiated in 1955 as a pioneering, and widely publicized, effort in charitable fundraising. When Congress revamped the unrelated business tax in 1969, there was no suggestion that it was intended to apply to' this venerable and successful program, and the IRS did not so interpret it until several years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">In short, a proper consideration of the purpose of the unrelated business tax leads to a conclusion that the ABE\u2019s insurance program is not a \u201ctrade or business.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b900-12\">Not only does the ABE program completely fail to raise the concerns against which the unrelated business tax is directed, but it is also operated as a charitable fundraising endeavor.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-13\">The learned trial judge expressly found, after hearing a good deal of evidence, that the assignment of the dividends was the result of charitable intentions, rather than a commercial transaction. First, he found that, since the program\u2019s inception, for three decades, the ABE has trumpeted the insurance program as a charitable fund-raising activity, and that it has been so understood.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The trial court emphasized that even members who testified against the ABE viewed the insurance program as strictly a charitable fundraising effort.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Second, the court specifically found that the reason for the Endowment\u2019s enormous profits was the charitable intent of the members.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Finally, the court emphasized that, all of the factors of the program, taken together, compel the conclusion that the ABE procedure was operated as, and understood to be, charitable fundraising rather than a business.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2439\">*2439</page-number>Notwithstanding the Court of Appeals\u2019 explicit endorsement of the trial judge\u2019s findings,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> this Court speculates that the members\u2019 assignment of their premium refunds was not \u201cvoluntary\u201d because the assignment was a condition to participating in the insurance program.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This speculation rests on a remarkably unrealistic appraisal of the intelligence and independence of the lawyers who participate in the ABE program. Those who elected to buy the insurance and contribute the premium refunds to the Endowment clearly understood the legal consequences of the transaction, and were free to purchase insurance elsewhere if they did not want to make the requested charitable contribution.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">The Court\u2019s opinion also seems to rest on the notion that the ABE members who purchased insurance were somehow coerced by a monopolist.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> But this is absurd. There is nothing in the record to suggest that the insurance policy offered by the \u00c1BE to its members was so attractive that the ABE could foist some unwanted condition upon its members. After all, only 20% of the membership purchased the policies. This transaction has none of the earmarks of an improper tying arrangement.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">Finally, the Court states that \u201cthere is no factual basis\u201d for an assumption that the large revenues generated by the insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2440\">*2440</page-number>program were the result of the members\u2019 charitable motivation rather than the market value of the insurance package, see <em>ante, </em>at 2431. But this is what the Claims Court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-4\">\u201cI am persuaded that if the American Bar Association Plan were not viewed as a fundraising enterprise and were not viewed by the overwhelming majority of the membership as something to be tolerated as, to be sure, an economic expense but one for the good of the profession, and for the greater good of society, that it would not exist, it could not have existed, it could not have survived, it would not have survived to today. And at least on the basis of this record those are my findings on that point.\u201d App. 505. See also 4 Cl.Ct., at 405, n. 1 (incorporating oral findings of fact).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">I believe that we are bound by that finding. The Court\u2019s suggestion to the contrary notwithstanding,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> rejecting that finding would run afoul of the \u201ctwo court rule,\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> would decide the case on a ground expressly disavowed by the Government, and would conflict with the record. That finding, combined with the other findings and with a proper analysis of the purpose and scope of the unrelated business tax, requires a conclusion that the ABE has been operated as a charitable fundraising effort, rather than as a commercial business.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">The ABE\u2019s program poses no harm to competitors and has been operated as a charitable fundraising activity. Depending on its members\u2019 agreement to assign their dividends, it is far less like the operation of a competitive macaroni company than like the provision of insurance as a service with a request for the dividends. In my opinion, the Court of Appeals and the Chief Judge of the Claims Court were both quite correct in concluding that, on the basis of the record generated at the vigorously contested trial, the tax that the Government seeks to collect in this case was not the kind of tax that Congress intended to impose.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b897-10\">.
