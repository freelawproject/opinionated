Hughes, </em>305 Or 286, 751 P2d 775 (1988). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">In <em>Hughes, </em>the Supreme Court held that we erred in reinstating a penalty for the employer\u2019s failure, pending appeal, to pay interim compensation that had been calculated on the full amount of interim compensation that had been awarded, even though the award was for a period that included time during which the claimant was working. The Supreme Court reasoned that \u201ccompensation cannot be paid when there is no basis upon which to calculate it,\u201d 305 Or at 294, and that, under <em>Bono v. SAIF, </em>298 Or 405, 692 P2d 606 (1984), there was no basis for an award of interim compensation for the period during which the claimant was working. Accordingly, the Supreme Court held that the part of the award of interim compensation for a period when he was working was \u201cnever due\u201d under ORS 656.262(10) and, therefore, that the employer should not have been assessed a penalty for failure to pay it pending appeal. ORS 656.313(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Applying the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning here, there was \u201cno basis upon which to calculate\u201d the award of interim compensation to claimant, who never ceased working. <em>Georgia-Pacific v. Hughes, supra, </em>305 Or at 294. Accordingly, the award was \u201cnever due\u201d and was not \u201ccompensation\u201d within the meaning of ORS 656.313.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b420-8\"> In <em>Hughes, </em>the Supreme Court confirmed that an award of interim compensation that is \u201cdue\u201d must be paid pending appeal. ORS 656.313(1). The claimant there did not seek review of the Board\u2019s order which had reduced the interim compensation to cover only the period when the claimant was not working.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
