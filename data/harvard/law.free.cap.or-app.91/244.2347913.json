This case involves the same issue as <em>Lundsten v. MVD, </em>91 Or App 95, 754 P2d 592 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">After a fatal automobile accident, petitioner was convicted of the crimes on September 1,1983. Almost three years later, on August 11, 1986, the Clackamas County District Attorney\u2019s office sent a record of the convictions to MVD, which thereupon revoked petitioner\u2019s driving privileges for one year, effective November, 1986, pursuant to ORS 809.410(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Petitioner argues, on review, for the first time, that MVD erred in suspending his driving privileges after notice of the convictions, because the notice was not sent to MVD within 24 hours after sentencing, pursuant to <em>former </em>ORS 482.480(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He contends that <em>former </em>ORS 482.480(2) was intended as a statute of limitations. As in <em>Lundsten v. MVD, supra, </em>even if petitioner had preserved his statutory argument below, we need not reach it, because the actual suspension period does not exceed that required by statute. Under <em>former </em>ORS 482.430 and <em>former </em>ORS 482.500(1) (b) (A), MVD should have revoked petitioner\u2019s driving privileges for five years for his conviction of manslaughter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Had there been no delay in MVD\u2019s receipt of the record of conviction, and had MVD imposed a five-year revocation, the revocation would have ended in August, 1988. In fact, the actual revocation was for only one year, ending November, 1987. Petitioner has suffered no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Affirmed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-7\"> <em>Former </em>ORS 482.480 was <em>repealed by </em>Or Law 1983, ch 338, \u00a7 978, and <em>replaced by </em>ORS 810.370, effective January 1,1986. Or Laws 1983, ch 338, \u00a7 384, <em>as amended by </em>Or Laws 1985, ch 16, \u00a7 199 and Or Laws 1987, ch 138, \u00a7 1. The pertinent old and new statutory provisions are substantially similar. ORS 810.370 also requires the convicting court to forward a record of a conviction to MVD within 24 hours of sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b290-8\"> <em>Former </em>ORS 482.430 and <em>former </em>ORS 482.500 were <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 1983, ch 338, \u00a7 978 and <em>replaced by </em>ORS 809.410, effective January 1, 1986. Or Laws 1983, ch 338, \u00a7 353, <em>as amended by </em>Or Laws 1985, ch 16, \u00a7 166. The hearings officer noted that a question remains as to why MVD imposed only a one-year revocation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b291-4\"> Petitioner\u2019s second argument, that MVD was estopped from suspending his driving privileges for one year in 1986, because it had already done so in 1983 as a result of the same fatal accident, is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
