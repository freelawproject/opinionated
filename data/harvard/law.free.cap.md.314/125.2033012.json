We hold that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">We therefore conclude that a police officer who drives a law enforcement vehicle during an emergency without using its siren is immune from liability for simple negligence under Md.Code (1977, 1987 RepLVol.), Transportation Art., \u00a7 19-103.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">While driving to the scene of an emergency on October 9, 1985, in response to a call that a fellow officer was \u201cdown\u201d or needed assistance, Police Officer Brian David Schwab (Schwab) struck Jackson H. Taylor (Taylor). Taylor, who had been participating in a labor demonstration in the area, died later that day. At the time of the accident, the patrol car\u2019s lights had been flashing, though the parties contest whether the siren was on.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">Taylor\u2019s widow sued both Schwab and the City of Baltimore (City) for negligence. The officer moved for summary judgment on the ground of immunity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The City moved to dismiss the claim to the extent the amount exceeded the statutory limits of section 19-103. The court granted Schwab\u2019s motion<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and certified the judgment as final under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Md. Rule 2-602. We review the case on certiorari to the Court of Special Appeals, prior to that court\u2019s ruling on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Under the Transportation Art., \u00a7 19-103(b)(l),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">[a]n operator of an emergency vehicle, who is authorized to operate the emergency vehicle by its owner or lessee, is immune from suit in his individual capacity for any damages resulting from a negligent act or omission while operating the emergency vehicle in the performance of emergency service as defined in subsection (a) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Thus a driver\u2019s immunity is predicated on 1) the performance of \u201cemergency service\u201d and 2) the use of an \u201cemergency vehicle.\u201d Schwab\u2019s performance of emergency service is not disputed; whether the vehicle is an emergency vehicle is disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Mrs. Taylor contends that the police car could not be \u201can emergency vehicle\u201d under the statute unless the siren was operating. Because the use of the siren is a disputed issue of material fact, she claims that summary judgment was inappropriate and should have been denied. Schwab argues that the police car was an emergency vehicle regardless of the use of the siren; because the siren\u2019s use was not a material fact, he argues that summary judgment could be and was appropriately rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">An emergency vehicle \u201cmeans any of the following vehicles that are designated by the Administration as entitled to the exemptions and privileges set forth in the Maryland Vehicle Law for emergency vehicles: (1) Vehicles of federal, State, or local law enforcement agencies; ____\u201d Md. Code (1977, 1987 Repl.Vol.), Transportation Art., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>\u00a7 11-118(1);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>see id. </em>at \u00a7 19-103(2) (using this definition of emergency vehicle for purposes of immunity). Police vehicles are \u201centitled to\u201d special driving privileges<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> when responding to an emergency, Md.Code (1977, 1987 Repl. Vol.), Transportation Art., \u00a7 21-106(a)(l), and using audible signals. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 21-106(c). However, a police vehicle equipped with a siren is still <em>\u201cdesignated by the Administration </em>as entitled to\u201d these privileges regardless of whether or not the siren is ever used. As we have previously noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-4\">the failure to sound the audible signal merely strips the authorized vehicle of its privilege to proceed without regard to speed limitations, right of way provisions, traffic control devices and other rules of the road____ [F]ailure to sound the audible bell, siren or exhaust whistle does not make driving an authorized emergency vehicle on a highway illegal, it merely results in a requirement that such vehicle be operated in accordance with all appropriate rules of the road, the same as any private or conventional vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-6\"><em>Sullivan v. Costanza, </em>258 Md. 672, 675, 267 A.2d 87, 89-90 (1970).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Officer Schwab\u2019s vehicle was that of a designated law enforcement agency and was equipped with the required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>signal devices. The operator of the vehicle could have achieved the privileges listed in section 21-106(b). But regardless of whether those privileges were obtained through the use of a siren, the car was still an \u201cemergency vehicle\u201d under the statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because Schwab was driving an emergency vehicle during an emergency, he was immune from simple negligence suits under section 19-103.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT TAYLOR.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b192-12\">. The motion to dismiss became a motion for summary judgment when the judge considered affidavits in making his ruling. Md. Rule 2-322(c). On summary judgment, all inferences are taken in favor of the non-moving party. Thus the trial court assumed, without deciding, that Schwab had not used his siren.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b192-13\">. The trial judge did not rule on the City\u2019s motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b194-8\">. In addition, an emergency vehicle must be equipped with a device capable of giving an audible signal. Md. Code (1977, 1987 Repl.Vol.), Transportation Art., \u00a7 22-218(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b194-9\">. These privileges include the ability to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-10\">(1) Park or stand without regard to the other provisions of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-11\">(2) Pass a red or stop signal, a stop sign, or a yield sign, but only after slowing down as necessary for safety;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-12\">(3) Exceed any maximum speed limit, but only so long as the driver does not endanger life or property; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-13\">(4) Disregard any traffic control device or regulation governing direction of movement or turning in a specified direction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-14\">Md.Code (1977, 1987 Repl.Vol.), Transportation Art., \u00a7 21-106(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b194-15\">. In <em>Sullivan, </em>this Court found that operating an emergency vehicle without an audible signal is not contributory negligence per se.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b195-6\">. Such an interpretation is consonant with the statute\u2019s history. As amended in 1970, the definition of emergency vehicle included the following: \u201c[List of vehicles]. Only the foregoing described emergency vehicles which are designated or authorized by the Commissioner shall be entitled to the exemptions and privileges granted elsewhere in this article.\u201d Md. Code (1957, Repl.Vol.1970), Art. 66'A \u00a7 1-103. This provision makes it clear that designation is the only requirement for the listed vehicles to achieve the privilege of emergency vehicle status.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">In 1977, the statute was amended as follows: \" \u2018Emergency vehicle\u2019 means any of the following vehicles that are designated by the Administration as entitled to the exemptions and privileges set forth in the Maryland Vehicle Law for emergency vehicles: [list of vehicles].\u201d Md. Code (1957, 1977 Repl.Vol.), Transportation Art., \u00a7 11-118. The revisor\u2019s note indicates that this change was purely stylistic. Act of March 8, 1976, ch. 14, 1977 Md. Laws 610, 611. Thus the legislature did not intend to create a new requirement that a vehicle must achieve privileges in order to become an emergency vehicle. Rather a vehicle is entitled to achieve privileges <em>because </em>it is an emergency vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
