What might have been a routine proceeding went awry for two basic reasons \u2014 the defendant\u2019s trial attorney<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> carefully orchestrated the proceedings to produce a result which was the very antithesis of his plea, and the trial judge erred in his assessment of the legal consequences of what had transpired. Offended by the tactics of defense counsel, but believing himself bound to this course of action, the trial judge found the defendant not guilty of the offense to which the plea had been proffered, and granted Bittinger\u2019s motion to dismiss the remaining charges. In doing so, Judge Eschenburg told the State\u2019s Attorney, \u201cI hope you go to the Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>... never have I ever wanted to be reversed so badly in all my life.\u201d The State did, and we shall.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AFR\">The charges in this case grew out of a confrontation between Bittinger and an off duty police officer at the Mini Market in Ocean City. As the officer, in civilian clothes, was attempting to enter the market, Bittinger exited, pushing the officer out of the way and directing abusive and threatening language toward him. Shortly thereafter, friends of Bittinger\u2019s, who were waiting in a nearby vehicle, became involved. Ultimately, Bittinger withdrew a knife from his pocket, opened and locked the blade, and approached the officer with the knife extended in front of him, saying \u201cI am going to kill you.\u201d When Bittinger was approximately an arm\u2019s length from him, the officer produced his off duty pistol, and identified himself as a police officer. Bittinger said, \u201cOh shit,\u201d and thus ended the confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">A two-count criminal information was filed in the Circuit Court for Worcester County charging Bittinger with assault with intent to murder, and assault. On the day scheduled for trial, the State\u2019s Attorney offered an amended information, and the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">STATES ATTORNEY: Your honor, I am presenting to the court this morning an amended Criminal Information in this proceeding. Upon acceptance of a plea of guilty to this charge, the amended charge, the State will be nol prossing the two counts from the original charge, which were assault with an intent to murder and simple assault. The amended charge is carrying a dangerous weapon with intent to injure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">* # * * * #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">THE COURT: I assume this amended Criminal Information is part of a plea bargain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-10\">DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>THE COURT: Mr. Bittinger, do you agree with this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Akt\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">THE COURT: All right, it\u2019s received and accepted by the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Judge Eschenburg then advised and questioned the Defendant in accordance with the requirements of Maryland Rule 4-242(c), after which he said, \u201cI am satisfied the plea is given freely, knowingly, and voluntarily.\u201d He then directed the Defendant to be seated and turned to the State\u2019s Attorney for a proffer of facts that would establish the factual basis for the plea. Following an extensive proffer, to which Bittinger and his counsel agreed with only minor corrections, Judge Eschenburg began to announce his finding concerning the sufficiency of the factual predicate, when he was interrupted by Bittinger\u2019s counsel. The following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">THE COURT: Based upon the statement of facts\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AB2\">DEFENSE ATTORNEY: If I may, prior to the court entering a plea finding, I understand the plea bargain arrangement is that upon acceptance of a plea of guilty the court or the State\u2019s Attorney would be nol prossing the other charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY: That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-9\">THE COURT: I would imagine that is what he had in mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-10\">DEFENSE ATTORNEY: With regard to a plea of guilty, the court must find the factual predicate with the State\u2019s statements of fact prior to entering a finding of guilt. I\u2019d ask the court to review <em>In re Daryl L., </em>decided July 14th of this year, prior to a finding of guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">It soon became apparent that Bittinger\u2019s counsel was arguing that the court could not pronounce a finding of guilt pursuant to the plea, because the factual predicate was lacking. The amended information charged Bittinger with openly carrying a dangerous and deadly weapon with the intent to injure, a violation of Md.Code (1957, 1982 Repl. Vol., 1986 Cum.Supp.) Art. 27, \u00a7 36(a). The problem, said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Bittinger\u2019s counsel, was that \u00a7 36(a) explicitly excluded \u201cpenknives without switchblade\u201d from its coverage, and the knife used by Bittinger was a penknife without a switchblade. Counsel\u2019s case reference was to <em>In re Daryl L., </em>68 Md.App. 375, 511 A.2d 1108 (1986), in which the Court of Special Appeals held that an eight and one-half inch folding knife with a locking mechanism, but without a switchblade or gravity opening feature, was a penknife within the meaning of the exclusion of \u00a7 36(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">We are without a clear description of the knife. In his proffer of facts, the State\u2019s Attorney told the court Bittinger \u201cpulled a knife out of his pocket, with his left hand the defendant took the knife, opened the blade and locked it.\u201d Defense counsel described the weapon as \u201ca buck knife, folding into the handle.\u201d The State\u2019s Attorney apparently agreed that the knife was a penknife without switchblade within the meaning of the exclusionary language of \u00a7 36(a), and we proceed on that assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Bittinger\u2019s counsel then argued that even though his client could not be found guilty, Bittinger had fulfilled his part of the bargain, and the State was obliged to enter a <em>nolle prosequi </em>on each assault charge, as it had promised. Bittinger\u2019s counsel said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">[A]s the State\u2019s Attorney proffered to the court, upon acceptance of a plea of guilty from the Defendant, the State will be nol prossing the remaining charges. The plea has been accepted. We met our part of the bargain, we have pled guilty, and the plea was accepted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">At this point in the proceedings, the judge had determined that Bittinger\u2019s plea was voluntary and intelligent. He had not yet determined that there was an adequate factual basis for the plea. He had heard the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s proffer of facts and apparently was about to resolve that question when Bittinger\u2019s counsel interrupted to inform him that there was no factual basis for the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">The record is clear that the plea agreement was expressly conditioned upon the acceptance of the plea of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>guilty. At the outset of the proceedings, the State\u2019s Attorney said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">Upon acceptance of a plea of guilty to this charge, the amended charge, the State will be nol prossing the two counts from the original charge, which were assault with an intent to murder and simple assault.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">On at least two occasions, Bittinger\u2019s counsel confirmed the existence of that condition.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">If I may, prior to the court entering a plea finding, I understand the plea bargain arrangement is that upon acceptance of a plea of guilty the court or the State\u2019s Attorney would be nol prossing the other charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">And as the State\u2019s Attorney proffered to the court, upon acceptance of a plea of guilty from the Defendant, the State will be nol prossing the remaining charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHd\">The condition was never met. In no sense had the plea of guilty been accepted. When a plea of guilty is accepted, there is a conviction, and nothing remains to be done but the imposition of sentence. <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 242, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 1711, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969); <em>Sutton v. State, </em>289 Md. 359, 364, 424 A.2d 755 (1981). Here, the trial judge not only refused to accept a plea, but entered a finding of not guilty as to that charge.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The specific condition of the plea agreement not having been met, Bittinger\u2019s motion to dismiss the assault charges should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">Although our holding in this case turns upon the fact that the plea had never been accepted, we do not suggest that Judge Eschenburg would have been without authority to strike the acceptance of the plea had Bittinger\u2019s counsel waited until just after acceptance to suggest the inadequacy of the factual predicate. A defendant may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>mount a challenge to the plea with the trial court during the time the case remains within that court\u2019s jurisdiction, and may thereafter seek to challenge the plea in the appellate courts. A defendant successful in challenging the plea must realize, however, that the remedy is ordinarily to place the parties in their original position. <em>Sweetwine v. State, </em>288 Md. 199, 421 A.2d 60 (1980); <em>Rojas v. State, 52 </em>Md.App. 440, 450 A.2d 490 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Bittinger suggests that he will be severely prejudiced by the guilty plea proceedings if the State is allowed to proceed on the original charges, because during the plea procedure he confessed certain facts to be true. His fears are groundless. The rationale of <em>Kercheval v. United States, </em>274 U.S. 220, 223-25, 47 S.Ct. 582, 583, 71 L.Ed. 1009 (1927), is fully applicable to this case, so that neither the fact of Bittinger\u2019s plea nor any admissions made by him in the course of the plea proceedings will be admissible at the trial of the issues in the assault cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WORCESTER COUNTY DISMISSING THE CHARGES OF ASSAULT WITH INTENT TO MURDER AND ASSAULT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.
