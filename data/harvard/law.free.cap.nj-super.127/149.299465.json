J. Super. </em>78 (1973), and those which follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number> Appellant\u2019s contention that as a \u201cjudicial officer\u201d he is removable only by impeachment pursuant to <em>N. J. Const. </em>(1947), Art. VII, \u00a7 III, par. 1, would if accepted leave him totally immune from removal on the charge here levelled against him \u2014 practicing law while a judge of compensation. That constitutional provision, which subjects to liability to impeachment \u201cThe Governor and all other State officers,\u201d extends only to commission of a misdemeanor. Appellant\u2019s offense was not a misdemeanor. He concedes ho is not impeachable under <em>N. J. Const. </em>(1947), Art. VI, \u00a7 VI, par. 4, nor removable under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:1B-1 <em>et seq., </em>which are confined to judges of named courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The essential inquiry here is whether judges in compensation are officers or employees in the Executive Branch of the State Government. If they are, they are not excluded from the Governor\u2019s power to remove any state \u201cofficer or employee,\u201d under <em>N. J. Const. </em>(1947), Art. V, \u00a7 IV, par. 5, by reason of the exception therein for a \u201cjudicial officer.\u201d We agree with Judge Kimmelman\u2019s determination that the latter exception was not intended to apply to officers in the Executive Branch whatever the judicial nature of their functions and that appellant is an administrative judge in the Executive Branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
