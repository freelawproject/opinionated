A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Aa9\">These defendants appeal their convictions for armed robbery. The offense took place October 4, 1968 at the home of Joseph Celona, Pleasantville, Yew Jersey. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>At the time Celona was at the dining room table counting the day\u2019s receipts from his retail store. In the living room of the home were Mrs. Mary Heckroth, who is Celona\u2019s sister, and their elderly parents. When Celona answered a knock on the door, defendants entered, announcing \u201cThis is a stick up.\u201d Defendant Ernest Pace had a shotgun and defendant Raymond Davis brandished a pistol. The thieves took $1,200 to $1,500 in cash and checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Both defendants offered an alibi. Pace did not testify but produced three witnesses who claimed that he was in Chicago at the time of the offense. His aunt, Mary Ann Williams, testified that on October 1 Pace left for Chicago in her car to obtain some personal papers she had left there. He returned October 8. Mrs. Evelyn Barber, Pace\u2019s fiancee, said that she, Wanda Williams and another young woman had accompanied Pace to Chicago, leaving New Jersey October 1 and returning about October 8. Miss Williams, Pace\u2019s cousin, also corroborated the alibi. The other participant in the trip did not testify because, it was said, she remained in Chicago. Obviously, the jury did not believe the alibi.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">To rebut the alibi the State called William Harris. He testified that he had a conversation with Pace on November 14, 1968, during which Pace claimed that he was in Camden on October 4 and in Newark after that, returning to Atlantic City on October 11. Neither Harris\u2019 occupation nor his reason for the conversation with Pace was brought out on direct. Harris was in fact Pace\u2019s parole officer, and Pace was on parole at the time of the Celona robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">Disregarding his attorney\u2019s advice, Pace had it brought out on cross-examination that Harris was a parole officer, that Pace was on parole on October 4, and that his departure from the State without permission would have been a violation of parole. It was also established that the interview by Harris took place while Pace was confined in the Atlantic County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Jail. Proper objection was made to Harris\u2019 testimony on the ground that its admission violated <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 <em>U. S. </em>436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><em>Miranda </em>bars from evidence statements taken by law enforcement officers as a result of custodial interrogations unless prior thereto the accused has been advised of a well-known litany of rights and has knowingly and voluntarily waived them. <em>State v. Hampton, </em>61 <em>N. J. </em>250, 265 (1972); <em>Mathis v. United States, </em>391 <em>U. S. </em>1, 88 S. Ct. 1503, 20 L. Ed. 2d 381 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">We need not decide whether the interrogation by Harris, directed solely to Pace\u2019s parole and not part of an ongoing investigation of a subsequent crime, required the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. We hold that the exclusionary rule of <em>Miranda </em>does not reach the State\u2019s presentation of Harris\u2019 testimony in rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">That <em>Miranda </em>does not bar all use of voluntary in-custody statements taken by law enforcement officers in the absence of the required warnings and a waiver thereof was made clear in <em>Harris v. New York, </em>401 <em>U. S. </em>222, 91 S. Ct. 643, 28 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1971). Here, as in <em>Harris, </em>no question has been raised concerning the voluntariness of the statements involved. <em>Harris </em>held that a defendant\u2019s <em>non-Miranda </em>statement, while not available during the State\u2019s case in chief, could be used to affect the defendant\u2019s credibility. The <em>Harris </em>rationale of permitting the impeachment use of evidence not available to the State on its main case is not a new one. Annotation, \u201cImpeachment of accused as witness by use of involuntary or not properly qualified confession,\u201d 89 <em>A. L. R. </em>2d 478 (1963). <em>Harris </em>was anticipated by this court in <em>State v. Kimbrough, </em>109 <em>N. J. Super. </em>57, 65-68 (App. Div. 1970). See also, <em>State v. Slobodian, </em>120 <em>N. J. Super. </em>68 (App. Div. 1972), certif. den. 62 <em>N. J. </em>77 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">It is true that <em>Harris </em>arose in a context where the non <em>-Miranda </em>statement was used in cross-examination followed by an instruction that the statement could only be considered by the jury in assessing the defendant\u2019s credibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>and not as evidence of guilt. We do not read <em>Harris, </em>however, as elevating such a limiting instruction to the level of a constitutional command. During the course of its opinion the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">Assuming that the exclusionary rule has a deterrent effect on proscribed police conduct, sufficient deterrence flows when the evidence in Question is made unavailable to the prosecution in its case in chief. [401 <em>U. S. </em>at 225, 91 S. Ct. at 645.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">and further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">The shield proyided by Miranda cannot be perverted into a license to use perjury by way of a defense, free from the risk of confrontation with prior inconsistent utterances. [401 <em>U. S. </em>at 226, 91 S. Ct. at 616.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">We think it clear that if <em>Miranda </em>cannot be converted .into a license to commit perjury, it cannot also exist as a license to suborn it. In light of <em>Harris </em>there is <em>no </em>just reason to frustrate truth in the criminal process by forcing the State to withhold from legitimate rebuttal a voluntary statement of the accused otherwise inadmissible solely because it was taken in violation of <em>Miranda. </em>The testimony of Harris was properly admitted in rebuttal as an admission of defendant Pace.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number><em>We </em>are not implying that the door is now open to the acceptance in rebuttal of <em>non-Miranda </em>statements as substantive proof in virtually every case where defense evidence is offered. We stress that such statements can only be received as <em>legitimate </em>rebuttal. Thus, the essential prelude to admissibility is that the conflict between defense proofs and the <em>non-Miranda </em>statement must be in sharp focus.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">[The court here considered other points raised by defendant and found them without merit.]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-9\"> The State offers an alternate hypothesis to sustain admission of Harris\u2019 evidence which we note but do not pass on. The thesis is that because of the special relationship between a parolee and his parole officer, interrogations by the latter are outside <em>Miranda. </em>The cases agree that a parole officer may testify in a parole revocation hearing concerning admissions secured from the parolee by an interrogation not preceded by <em>Miranda </em>warnings even where that interrogation took place in a custodial setting. <em>People v. W., </em>24 <em>N. Y. </em>2d 732, 302 N. Y. S. 2d 260, 249 <em>N. E. </em>2d 882 (Ct. App. 1969) ; <em>Clark v. State, </em>222 So. 2d 766 (Fla. D. Ct. App. 1969) ; <em>State v. Jackson, </em>16 <em>Ariz. </em>App. 476, 494 <em>P. </em>2d 376 (Ct. App. 1972). Courts have split upon the issue of whether the results of a parole officer\u2019s questioning, aimed solely at the parole function and not preceded by <em>Miranda </em>warnings, may be admitted in a prosecution for a new offense. Answering in the negative is <em>State v. Lekas, </em>201 <em>Kan. </em>579, 442 <em>P. </em>2d 11 (Sup. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>1968), while <em>Nettles v. State, </em>248 <em>So. </em>2d 259 (Fla. D. Ct. App. 1971) takes the opposite view. Compare, however, <em>Mathis v. United States, supra, </em>and see also <em>State v. Barnes, </em>54 <em>N. J. 1 </em>(1969), <em>cert. </em>den. 396 U. <em>S. </em>1029, 90 S. Ct. 580, 24 L. Ed. 2d 525 (1970). It might also be noted that where the pax-ole relationship was perverted by using it as a subterfuge for an investigation into a subsequent offense, the results of that endeavor were held inadmissible. <em>People v. Way, </em>65 <em>N. Y. Misc. </em>2d 865, 319 <em>N. Y. S. </em>2d 16 (Cty. Ct. 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Cf. <em>State v. Burt, </em>107 <em>N. J.
