Also acknowledged was that a Board\u2019s acceptance or rejection of the testimony of witnesses, where such choice was reasonable, was conclusive on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>On the basis of plaintiff\u2019s proofs Judge Lane specifically found reasons for the grant of a (d) variance and rejected the Board\u2019s specifications in denying the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">The Board has found;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">\u201c. . . that the relief requested by the applicant cannot be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without substantially impairing the intent and purpose of the zone plan and zoning ordinance of the Borough of Shrewsbury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">1. The proposed use would cause additional congestion at an already congested intersection;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">2. There is no way to prevent traffic from crossing the highway and creating additional risks to the motorists at the intersection ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">3. The land in question could be put to a better and higher use;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-9\">4. Additional gas stations are not needed in the Borough of Shrews-bury and would not benefit the residents of the Borough of Shrews-bury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-10\">5. The area involved is adjacent to an area which is composed of a large tract of land which is undeveloped;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-11\">6. The proposed use could have a deleterious effect on the future development of the surrounding undeveloped land;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-12\">7. No hardship has been shown by the applicant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-13\">8. There are three Shell gas stations within a short distance of the residents of the Borough of Shrewsbury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-14\">9. Gasoline stations are not a permitted use in the Borough of Shrewsbury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-15\">10. The use sought is not particularly fitted to the location for which the variance is sought and special reasons do not exist for the granting of the variance . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-16\">The findings of a Board of Adjustment must be substantially grounded in sufficient competent evidence. <em>Izenberg v. Board of Adjustment of City of </em>Paterson, 35 <em>N. J. Super. </em>583, 588 (App. Div. 1955); <em>Dolan v. DeCapua, </em>16 <em>N. J. </em>599, 610 (1954); <em>Stolz v. </em>Ellenstein, 7 <em>N. J. </em>291, 295 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-17\">Here, <em>we </em>hold that the Board\u2019s findings were at best conclusional and not fairly supported by the proofs submitted. Significantly, the Board did not specifically find plaintiff\u2019s proofs incredible or unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b84-19\">Kolovsky, J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A6V\">(dissenting). An applicant for a use variance under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:55-39(d) has the burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>establishing (1) that \u201cspecial reasons\u201d exist for the variance and <em>(2) </em>that the variance \u201ccan be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and will not substantially impair the intent and purpose of the zone plan and zoning ordinance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">In my opinion, the finding of the Board of Adjustment (Board) that \u201cspecial reasons do not exist for the granting of the variance\u201d sought by Shell Oil Company (Shell) was not arbitrary or unreasonable and indeed was mandated by the proofs before it. From my reading of the applicable authorities, I am satisfied that there was no warrant for the trial court\u2019s order directing the Board to recommend to the Borough\u2019s governing body that Shell be granted a variance to allow it to operate a gasoline service station \u2014 a use not permitted in the zone under the Borough\u2019s zoning ordinance \u2014 on the 1.7 acre tract which Shell had obligated itself to purchase if it was able to obtain the variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Apposite is what this court said, in reversing a trial court judgment ordering a Board of Adjustment to recommend a variance, in <em>Mahler v. Borough of Fair Lawn, </em>94 <em>N. J. Super. </em>173 (App. Div. 1967), which was affirmed unanimously on the opinion below in 55 <em>N. J. </em>1 (1969). In <em>Mahler, supra, </em>we noted (at 183) that in a situation such as is here presented,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">The resolution * * of the appeal must center about two problems: (a) did special reasons exist here which could have justified the board in recommending a variance, and (b) was the denial in this case so unjustified on the law and the facts as to have called for the reversal and mandate for variance by the court?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">The <em>Mahler </em>opinion, after discussing at length what may constitute a \u201cpermissible\u201d basis for a \u201cspecial reasons\u201d variance under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:55-39 (d) grounded upon the zoning criterion of the \u201cpromotion of the general welfare\u201d, then continued at 185-186:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-9\">In any case, however, the conclusive consideration here is that, whether or not the hoard could properly have <em>granted </em>a variance recommendation in this situation, there is utterly no basis for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>judicial conclusion that it acted arbitrarily, capriciously or unreasonably in exercising its discretionary ffttasi-judicial powers by <em>denying </em>such a recommendation. And that is the controlling criterion on judicial review, whether the board grants or denies a variance. <em>Kramer v. Board of Adjustment, Sea Girt, supra, </em>45 <em>N. J., </em>at pp. 296-297.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-4\">Our cases recognize that there is an area of special discretion reposed in the local agencies within which, in many situations, either the grant or denial of a (d) variance would be judicially sustained. The board of adjustment weighs the facts and the zoning considerations, <em>pro </em>and <em>con, </em>and will be sustained if its decision comports with the statutory criteria and is founded in adequate evidence. See <em>Rain or Shine Box Lunch Co. v. Newark Board of Adjustment, </em>53 <em>N. J. Super. </em>252, 259 (App. Div. 1958) ; <em>Yahnel v. Board of Adjustment, Jamesburg, supra, </em>79 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at p. 519.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">Moreover, as we stated in <em>Cummins v. Board of Adjustment, Leonia, </em>39 <em>N. J. Super. </em>452, 460 (App. Div. 1956), the judicial philosophy of sympathetic approach to local zoning decisions <em>(Ward v. Scott, </em>16 <em>N. J. </em>16, 23 (1955) is \u201ceven more cogently applicable to a case where we review a denial of a variance than where we review a grant, for generally speaking more is to be feared from a breakdown of a zoning plan by ill-advised grants of variances than by refusals thereof,\u201d citing <em>Beirn v. Morris, </em>14 <em>N. J. </em>529, 536 (1954). <em>Cf. Wilson v. Borough of Mountainside, </em>42 <em>N. J. </em>426, 443 (1964).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Shell\u2019s 1.7 acre tract is in a B-2 business zone in which, under the zoning ordinance, premises may be used for the following purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">1. Shopping centers limited to such uses as retail shops and stores, personal service establishments, professional and business offices, banks and restaurants except lunch wagons, diners, roadstands or outdoor drive-in refreshment stands. In addition, such shopping centers may also contain those uses set forth in Paragraph 2 hereafter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">2. Grocery, meat market, bakery, drugs and pharamaeeutical store, package liquor store, stationery, tobacco and newspaper store, barber or beauty shops, shoe repair shops, dry cleaning pick-up shops, professoinal offices, banks and fiduciary institutions, department stores, hardware stores, auto part stores, apparel shops, any other retail shop not specifically hereinabove enumerated, such as jewelry, hat, leather goods, hand bag, books, gifts, music and similar retail enterprises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">While the ordinance requires a minimum lot area of 300,000 square feet in B-2 zones, the deficiency in lot area of the 1.7 acre tract is of no material significance. The owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>of the tract would be entitled, under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:55-39 (c), to a variance from the 300,000 square foot area requirement of the ordinance and to such other variances from the \u201cbulk\u201d provisions of the ordinance as may be necessary to enable it to use the 1.7 acre tract for one or more of the numerous uses permitted in a B-2 zone by the quoted provisions of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The trial court concluded that the \u201cspecial reason\u201d which entitled Shell to the use variance it sought was \u201cundue hardship\u201d. I find no warrant for such a conclusion in the record and, more significantly, no justification for holding that the Board acted arbitrarily in determining from the evidence before it that the asserted \u201chardship\u201d had not been proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">\u201cUndue hardship\u201d may of course constitute a \u201cspecial reason\u201d for a use variance. <em>Andrews v. Ocean Twp. Board of Adjustment, </em>30 <em>N. J. </em>245, 251 (1959). But undue hardship is not established by a showing that the proposed use would be more profitable to the owner than the permitted uses. \u201cThe extension by variance of land use zones is not to be measured by the dollar.\u201d <em>Schoelpple v. Woodbridge Twp., </em>60 <em>N. J. Super. </em>146, 153 (App. Div. 1960); <em>Jenpet Realty Co., Inc. v. Ardlin, Inc., </em>112 <em>N. J. Super. </em>79, 85 (App. Div. 1970), cert. denied 57 <em>N. J. </em>436 (1971); <em>Kohl v. Mayor and Council of Fair Lawn, </em>50 <em>N. J. </em>268 (1967). See also <em>Bern v. Fair Lawn, </em>65 <em>N. J. Super. </em>435 (App. Div. 1961), in which this court said at 450 :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">Uertainly a property owner is not entitled to a variance merely to serve the <em>most </em>profitable or economical use of the property if other less profitable uses are still reasonably feasible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">Here the trial court said in reaching its conclusion that \u201cundue hardship\u201d existed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">There was sufficient competent evidence to show that it would not be reasonably feasible to use the lot for any of the permitted uses. Unless used for a gasoline station the evidence indicates that the lot will remain vacant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>As I have heretofore noted, however, the controlling question is not whether \u201cthere was <em>sufficient </em>competent evidence to show that it would not be reasonably feasible to use the lot for any of the permitted uses.\u201d (Emphasis added) Rather it is whether the evidence was such that it was arbitrary and unreasonable for the Board to find otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">In mj1' view, not only did the evidence presented not rise to that stature, it would not support a finding that other permitted uses were not reasonably feasible on the 1.7 acre tract. At most, the -testimony of Shell\u2019s real estate expert, who noted that a shopping center was to be built on an adjoining tract, indicated that a gasoline station in the area was needed, that such use was the highest and best use to which the property could be put and would present fewer problems, traffic and otherwise, than would any of the uses permitted by the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">I would reverse.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
