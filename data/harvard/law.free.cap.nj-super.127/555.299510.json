A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AcMa\">Defendants Ered Cappadona and Charles Eisher were found guilty of robbery, in violation of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A :141\u20141, and being armed while committing the robbery, in violation of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:151-5, after a jury trial in the Superior Court of Middlesex County. The indictment returned by the state grand jury also named Alex Birnbaum, George Lattimore and Joan Janiszewski as defendants. Joan Janiszewski testified for the State. The State\u2019s main witness, however, was Jerome McKenney, a confessed accomplice to the present crimes who avoided prosecution by entering into a bargain with the Attorney General by pleading guilty to other offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">Each defendant raises several separate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">[There follows a discussion of the testimony at the trial and the various issues raised by defendant Cappadona, decided adversely to him on this appeal.]</p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">Defendant Eisher presents four reasons for reversal. lie first contends that he has been deprived of Ms right to a speedy trial as guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The issue was previously presented in a pretrial motion to dismiss, and denied. Thereafter defendant was granted leave to appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>and this court affirmed the denial of his motion to dismiss in an unpublished opinion. <em>State v. Fisher </em>(A-1967-71, decided April 21, 1972). Subsequently, the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 <em>U. S. </em>514, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 33 L. Ed. 2d 101 (1972), in which it was held, among other things, that the requirement that a demand for a specified trial date be made as a prerequisite to a motion to dismiss for failure to accord defendant a speedy trial was inconsistent with due process. In the opinion it was suggested that trial courts consider four factors in determining whether an indictment should be dismissed for delay in prosecution:- (1) the length of the delay, (2) the reason for the delay, (3) defendant\u2019s assertion of his right, and (4) prejudice to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"> Pisher urges that we reexamine our prior deter-mination in the light of <em>Barker v. Wingo, supra. </em>We are convinced that Barker should not be applied retrospectively. See <em>Stovall v. Denno, </em>388 <em>U. S. </em>293, 297, 87 S. Ct. 1967, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1199 (1967). Nevertheless, even under the standards set forth in <em>Barker, </em>denial of the motion to dismiss was not improper. The length of time from filing of the indictment to the time of trial was approximately two years; the reason for the delay was the inability of the prosecutor to produce the essential witness McKenney who was incarcerated in a federal institution and who was engaged-in giving testimony in many courts. As we noted in the prior opinion filed April 21, 1972, Pisher did not demand a specified trial date. There is nothing in the record to show that Pisher suffered any prejudice by way of inability to produce witnesses or otherwise. In fact, one of the strategies employed by his trial counsel was that the memory of the State\u2019s witnesses was blurred by the passage of time. Weighing all the factors, we find that the motion to dismiss was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Pisher next argues that the trial judge committed reversible error when he refused to allow the jury to take two letters written by McKenney to Joan Janiszewski into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>jury room during deliberation. Had McKenney denied or qualified the contents of the letters, their introduction would have been appropriate. <em>State v. Smith, </em>101 <em>N. J. Super. </em>10 (App. Div. 1968), certif. den. 53 <em>N. J. 577 </em>(1969). But the letters were disclosed to the jury on cross-examination and their content was admitted by McKenney.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Fisher\u2019s next argument concerns the trial judge\u2019s refusal to allow him to cross-examine McKenney as to psychiatric care which McKenney received in 1968. We find no error. McKenney\u2019s psychological state of mind in 1968 was not logically relevant to his credibility while testifying in 1972; <em>State v. Vigliano, </em>50 <em>N. J. </em>51 (1967) is inapposite. That decision rested upon the prosecutor\u2019s concealment of the fact that the State\u2019s primary witness had been committed to a hospital <em>during trial </em>and found by two examining physicians to be \u201cconfused and disoriented and suffering from senility, chronic brain syndrome associated with cerebral arteriosclerosis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Fisher\u2019s final argument concerns the propriety of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks during summation that the robbery was an inside job based on a tip from the switchboard operator, and his characterization of the defendants as \u201cbums.\u201d There was testimony by McKenney that a tip had been given to Fisher by ah employee of Great Eastern. Thus, the prosecutor\u2019s comment that the robbery was an \u201cinside job\u201d finds support in the evidence adduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">The comment that the inside tip came from a switchboard operator, while not supported by the record, was harmless. We fail to see any prejudice resulting to Fisher from the prosecutor\u2019s comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">The reference to defendants as iCbums\u201d during the prosecutor\u2019s summation was immediately objected to by Fisher. The court instructed the jury to disregard the comment. Under these circumstances we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">Prior to oral argument defendant Cappadona presented a motion for a new trial based upon allegedly newly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>discovered evidence to the effect that the State\u2019s principal witness, McKenney, had lied when he implicated Cappadona. We initially reserved decision on the motion pending oral argument. However, we have not considered the merits of the motion since, pursuant to the provisions of <em>B. 3 </em>:20-2, it should be presented to the trial court in the first instance. Our decision on the issues presented on the appeal is without prejudice to defendant\u2019s right to -present such a motion to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The judgments of conviction are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
