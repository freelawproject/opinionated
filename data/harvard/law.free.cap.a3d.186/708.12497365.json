Condron,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   appeal from the judgment of strict foreclosure rendered by the trial court in favor of the plaintiff\n   Nationstar Mortgage, LLC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, the defendants claim that the court improperly rendered judgment of strict foreclosure because (1) the plaintiff failed to satisfy a contractual condition precedent to foreclosure, namely, compliance with the requirement of notification by mail specified in the mortgage deed;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) the plaintiff failed to satisfy a statutory condition precedent, as required by the Emergency Mortgage Assistance Program (mortgage program) pursuant to the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 8-265ee(a) ; and (3) the plaintiff lacked the authority to foreclose. The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to dismiss the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the present appeal. On February 16, 2007, the defendants executed and delivered an adjustable rate promissory note (note) payable to the order of Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB (bank), in the original principal amount of $980,000. The loan was secured by a mortgage (mortgage deed) on the property. The mortgage deed was executed and delivered on February 16, 2007, to Mortgage Electronic\n   Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS), as nominee for the bank. The bank specially endorsed the note to Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc., which endorsed the note in blank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 1, 2007, Aurora Loan and Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc., entered into a written servicing\n   agreement (servicing agreement). Structured Asset Securities Corporation, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (Wells Fargo), and Aurora Loan entered into a written trust agreement, dated March 1, 2007 (trust agreement). Under the trust agreement, the defendants' note and mortgage deed became part of the trust. Wells Fargo, as trustee, is the owner of the debt under the trust agreement. Aurora Loan, or any successor in interest,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   is identified in the trust agreement as the master servicer and as a servicer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   MERS, as nominee for the bank, assigned the mortgage deed to Aurora Loan by virtue of a corporate assignment of the mortgage deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendants have been in default on the note and mortgage deed since at least May 1, 2009. On June 19, 2009, Aurora Loan, as the servicer of the loan at the time, sent a letter to the defendants,\n   <em>\n    by certified mail, return receipt requested\n   </em>\n   , notifying them that the loan was in default and advising them of the amount required to cure the default and reinstate the loan as of that date. On the same date, Aurora Loan also provided notice to the defendants by certified mail of their rights under the mortgage program, pursuant to the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-265cc through 8-265kk. The\n   defendants failed to cure the default and Aurora Loan elected to accelerate the balance due on the note, declare the note due in full, and foreclose the mortgage deed securing the note. Aurora Loan commenced the present foreclosure action against the defendants on November 19, 2009. Aurora Loan assigned the mortgage to the plaintiff by virtue of a corporate assignment of mortgage on June 29, 2012. On August 22, 2012, Wells Fargo, as trustee, provided a limited power of attorney to the plaintiff, as assignee of Aurora Loan. The plaintiff was in possession of the note and presented it to the court and to the defendants' counsel for inspection at the foreclosure trial. On April 8, 2013, Aurora Loan moved to substitute Nationstar Mortgage, LLC, as the plaintiff in the present action, and the court granted the motion to substitute on May 1, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The action was tried to the court on August 25, 2015. At trial, the defendants claimed that they did not receive either the default notice or the mortgage program notice from Aurora Loan. No evidence was offered by either party to show that the mortgage program notice or the default notice had been returned to Aurora Loan by the United States Postal Service (USPS) with an endorsement showing failure\n   of delivery. In addition, no evidence was offered of a return receipt confirming actual delivery. In its memorandum of decision, the court concluded that (1) the plaintiff had standing to prosecute the present foreclosure action; (2) the plaintiff had proven compliance with the notice provisions of the mortgage deed by a preponderance of the evidence; (3) the plaintiff had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the mortgage program notice was sent to the defendants by certified mail on June 19, 2009; and (4) the plaintiff was entitled to a judgment of strict foreclosure against the defendants. On appeal, the defendants challenge the propriety of that decision. Additional facts will be provided as necessary.\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We first address the issue of standing because an absence of subject matter jurisdiction would deprive this court of the opportunity to review any other matters raised in the present appeal.

The defendants claim that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that it had standing to foreclose because the plaintiff does not own the note and the note's owner, Wells Fargo, as trustee, did not authorize the plaintiff to foreclose in its own name. The plaintiff maintains that it has standing to foreclose in its own name because it was the holder of the note and it provided sufficient evidence of its authority to foreclose. We agree with the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Standing is the legal right to set judicial machinery in motion. One cannot rightfully invoke the jurisdiction of the court unless he [or she] has, in an individual or representative capacity, some real interest in the cause of action, or a legal or equitable right, title or interest in the subject matter of the controversy.... Where a party is found to lack standing, the court is consequently without subject matter jurisdiction to determine the cause....

When a holder seeks to enforce a note through foreclosure, the holder must produce the note. The note must be sufficiently endorsed so as to demonstrate that the foreclosing party is a holder, either by a specific endorsement to that party or by means of a blank endorsement to bearer. If the foreclosing party shows that it is a valid holder of the note and can\n   produce the note, it is presumed that the foreclosing party is the rightful owner of the debt. That presumption may be rebutted by the defending party, but the burden is on the defending party to provide sufficient proof that the holder of the note is not the owner of the debt, for example, by showing that ownership of the debt had passed to another party. It is not sufficient to provide that proof, however, merely by pointing to some documentary lacuna in the chain of title that\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   give rise to the possibility that some other party owns the debt. In order to rebut the presumption, the defendant must\n   <em>\n    prove\n   </em>\n   that someone else is the owner of the note and debt. Absent that proof, the plaintiff may rest its standing to foreclose on its status as the holder of the note.\" (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Henderson\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490414\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/167/1065/#p481\">\n    175 Conn.

Aurora Loan assigned its rights, title, and interest in the mortgage deed to the plaintiff by a corporate assignment of the mortgage on June 29, 2012. As a result, the court granted\n   Aurora Loan's motion to substitute Nationstar Mortgage, LLC, as the plaintiff in the present action, and the plaintiff is now the holder of the note endorsed in blank. The plaintiff presented the note to the court at the foreclosure trial. According to the trust agreement, however, Wells Fargo is the owner of the debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The issue is whether the plaintiff, despite not owning the note, demonstrated that it had the authority to foreclose on the mortgage deed securing the note.

On the basis of that evidence, the trial court held that the plaintiff satisfied its burden of proving that it had standing to foreclose the mortgage deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Our review of that evidence supports the trial court's findings and conclusion on the issue of standing. The plaintiff presented to the court the trust agreement and Kovalic testified as to the contents of the trust agreement, which pertained to Wells Fargo's authorization for the plaintiff to enforce the debt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trust agreement defines \"Master Servicers\" as \"[Aurora Loan], or any successor in interest, or if any successor master servicer shall be appointed as herein provided, then such successor master servicer.\" The plaintiff is, accordingly, a \"Master Servicer\" as defined by the trust agreement because the parties have stipulated to the fact that the plaintiff is a successor in interest to Aurora Loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Section 9.04 (a) of the trust agreement provides in pertinent part that a Master Servicer \"shall have full power and authority (to the extent provided in the applicable Servicing Agreement) to do any and all things that it may deem necessary or desirable in connection with the servicing and administration of the Mortgage Loans, including but not limited to the power and\n   authority ... to effectuate foreclosure or other conversion of the ownership of the Mortgaged Property securing any Mortgage Loan ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Moreover, Wells Fargo, as trustee, provided a limited power of attorney to the plaintiff. The limited power of attorney provided that the plaintiff has \"full authority and power to execute and deliver on behalf of the Trustee ... all documents and instruments necessary to conduct any (a) foreclosure, or (b) the taking of any deed in lieu of foreclosure, or (c) any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure or termination, cancellation, or rescission of any such foreclosure, or (d) any similar procedure (collectively, as applicable, a 'Foreclosure') ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The record supports the trial court's finding that Wells Fargo unequivocally manifested its intention to authorize the plaintiff to exercise its rights to enforce the debt. Accordingly, we conclude that the plaintiff had standing to maintain the foreclosure action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The defendants next claim that the court improperly determined that Aurora Loan satisfied a contractual condition precedent to the commencement of the present foreclosure action regarding notification by\n   mail\n   because (1) Kovalic's testimony about certain documents not in evidence was inadmissible hearsay and, as a result, there is no proof of mailing; (2) the notice was not sent by first class mail and, therefore, requires proof of actual delivery; and (3) there was no substantial compliance with the notice provision because there was no notice at all. We address each claim in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The defendants claim that Kovalic's testimony regarding the contents of business records that were not in evidence is inadmissible hearsay. Kovalic testified that he reviewed notes in the file, which indicated that the default letter was sent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The notes themselves were not introduced into evidence.

In this regard, we note that the defendants do not contest the admissibility of the default letter or Kovalic's testimony about the notations on the letter itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   During trial, Kovalic reviewed the default letter and testified that the default letter itself revealed that it was sent by certified mail. Based on his review of the file and his familiarity with industry practice, Kovalic testified as to the appearance of the default letter and noted significant markings on the letter that indicated that it was sent by certified mail. As he stated: \"[Y]ou've got, obviously, this was a letter that was generated to be sent and you know it has these dotted lines that would have been trifold, similar to say a W-2 tax form, says it was sent by certified mail, it has a tracking number, that tracking number is also on the flip side on the return receipt, same tracking number, and on both the return letter to [Aurora Loan] and to [the defendants]. So, I mean, using those three pieces of information right there, in addition to everything I've reviewed on my system, which is volumes of paperwork, thousands and thousands of pages of internal notes from [the plaintiff], previous notes from Aurora [Loan], all that, looking at this letter I can say that it was sent by certified mail,\n   and it's all right here, this is exactly what was sent, what was generated, folded along the lines, and sent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In light of (1) the letter and (2) Kovalic's testimony regarding notations on the letter and industry practice, we conclude that Kovalic's testimony regarding the notations in the file was merely cumulative. We are, therefore, satisfied that the court's improper admission of Kovalic's testimony regarding the notations in the file was harmless and the plaintiff has proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the notice of default letter was sent to the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We next consider whether the court properly determined that Aurora Loan complied with the requirement of notification by mail contained in the mortgage instruments. In its memorandum of decision, the court concluded that certified mail that is sent with a return receipt requested qualifies as \"first class mail\" for which notice is \"deemed to have been given\n   to Borrower when mailed,\" pursuant to \u00a7 15 of the mortgage deed. The defendants now challenge the propriety of that determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We begin by noting that the mortgage deed contains a condition precedent to a foreclosure proceeding.

Pursuant to \u00a7 22 of the mortgage deed, Aurora Loan was required to give notice of default to the defendants prior to commencing the present foreclosure action. As a result, we must determine whether the court properly determined that Aurora Loan complied with the notice requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   To answer that question, we must construe \u00a7 15 of the mortgage deed, which governs the method of delivery of the default notice. Section 15 provides that \"[a]ll\n   notices given by Borrower or Lender in connection with this Security Instrument must be in writing. Any notice to Borrower in connection with this Security Instrument\n   <em>\n    shall be deemed to have been given to Borrower when mailed by first class mail or when actually delivered to Borrower's notice address if sent by other means\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, a default notice sent by first class mail is entitled to a presumption of receipt, while notices sent by other means are not entitled to such a presumption. Rather, proof of actual delivery is required by the mortgage deed when the notice is sent by other means.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We already have concluded that the trial court properly determined that the notice of default letter was sent to the defendants by certified mail. See part II A of this opinion. Throughout this litigation, the defendants have argued that they \"did not receive either the default notice, required by the mortgage, or the [mortgage program] notice.\" At trial, the plaintiff did not present any evidence of actual delivery of the default notice, nor was the return receipt\n   that Aurora Loan requested furnished to the court. The question, then, is whether sending the default notice letter by certified mail without proof of the requested return receipt carries the presumption of receipt afforded to first class mail or whether certified mail is notice \"by other means\" requiring proof of actual delivery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We begin with the relevant legal authority and standard of review. \"It is well established that [n]otices of default and acceleration are controlled by the mortgage documents. Construction of a mortgage deed is governed by the same rules of interpretation that apply to written instruments or contracts generally, and to deeds particularly. The primary rule of construction is to ascertain the intention of the parties. This is done not only from the face of the instrument, but also from the situation of the parties and the nature and object of\n   their transactions....

If the intended\n   recipient is not available at the time a mail carrier attempts to deliver the letter, a notice of attempted delivery is left at the recipient's address and the mail is returned to the post office.

Id., 508.1.1.7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   At trial, the plaintiff's witness, Kovalic, acknowledged that critical distinction between certified mail and first class mail. He stated: \"[E]ven though we're only required to send by first class, in an effort to be more thorough and make sure regulatory things, briefs, letters, demand letters, acceleration letters, they're only required to be sent by first class mail, but we send them by certified mail in order to have an extra layer of security there. Plus, you don't want your neighbors to open up your mail, just throw it in your mailbox, you want your mailman to give you something like a notice like that personally.... If you have a mailbox anybody can open your mailbox and pull your mail out. You're delivering something by certified mail, the mailman has to hand it to you or you have to go to the post office and personally pick it up ... an agent or the addressee ... are the only people that can pick it up.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In considering the express language of the mortgage deed, the two types of mailings underscore what other jurisdictions have identified as the effective difference between the two mailings. First class mail enjoys a presumption of actual delivery, while other mailing services, to effect their purpose, necessarily require proof of actual delivery. Various courts in this country have noted such a distinction between first class and certified mail, including the United States Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Flowers,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276521\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/220/#p237\">\n    547 U.S. 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 237,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276521\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/220/#p237\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276521\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/220/#p237\">\n    164 L.Ed. 2d 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006), the United States Supreme Court recognized that the use of certified mail for official notices may have significant benefits for governmental agencies, because \"[u]sing certified mail provides the State with documentation of personal delivery and protection against false claims that notice was never received.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276521\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/220/#p237\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Of great significance to the present appeal is the court's observation that \"the use of certified mail might make actual notice less likely in some cases-the letter cannot be left like regular mail to be examined at the end of the day, and it can only be retrieved from the post office for a specified period of time.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276521\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/220/#p237\">\n    Id., at 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276521\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/220/#p237\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Other courts have similarly acknowledged a distinction between first class mail and certified mail.

It simply leaves the mail in the mailbox.... Certified mail, return receipt requested, tends to reduce later challenges by showing that the mail was actually delivered to the address of record and that the defendant had actual notice of the proceeding because the\n   defendant must sign for the mail in order to receive it.

For example, in cases arising in the context of a foreclosure proceeding, the Court of Appeals of Ohio held that \"no presumption of delivery arose\" where the plaintiff failed to comply with the notice requirement in the context of a foreclosure proceeding because the plaintiff \"did not mail a notice of default by ordinary mail, either contemporaneously with its certified-mail notice or after return of the certified-mail envelope.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    National City Mortgage Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Richards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3856066\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/182/534/#p545\">\n    182 Ohio App. 3d 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 545,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=913%20N.E.2d%201007\">\n    913 N.E.2d 1007\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). The court in\n   <em>\n    National City Mortgage Co.\n   </em>\n   noted: \"[The plaintiff] did not send the notice of default via first class mail.

Accordingly, we conclude that the notice sent by Aurora Loan to the defendants in 2009 was done so \"by other means.\" Section 15 of the mortgage deed thus indicates that the notice is \"deemed to have been given to Borrower\n   ... when actually delivered to Borrower's notice address ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The plaintiff has failed to submit a return receipt or any other evidence into the record to prove that the notice of default was actually delivered to the defendants by certified mail.

In each instance, the notice of default was actually received by the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In the present case, there is no evidence in the record that the notice of default was actually received as a result of the notice sent by certified mail. In fact, the defendants alleged that they never received the notice. The plaintiff now asks for us to apply the doctrine of substantial compliance to the method of mailing and the corresponding proof required to establish that the notice was received by the defendants. While we acknowledge the doctrine of substantial compliance applies in the context of reviewing the substance of the default notice, we decline to apply the doctrine where there is a contractual provision requiring proof of actual delivery for a notice of default sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, and there is no evidence that the defendants actually received the notice of default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Accordingly, the plaintiff failed to satisfy the contractual condition precedent to foreclosure because it failed to prove that the defendants received the notice of default letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The defendants' final claim is that a statutory condition precedent to the action\n   failed because the plaintiff\n   failed to introduce into evidence the certified mail receipt confirming that the mortgage program notice required by \u00a7 8-265ee(a) was actually delivered by certified mail. We note that, similar to the default notice, the defendants do not claim that the admission of the mortgage program notice into evidence was improper. Rather, the defendants claim that \u00a7 8-265ee(a) requires proof of actual delivery by certified mail and the plaintiff failed to meet that requirement. We disagree with the defendants' interpretation of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   We begin our review with the relevant standard of review. \"To the extent that our review requires us to construe statutory provisions, this presents a legal question over which our review also is plenary....

No such mortgagee may commence a foreclosure of a mortgage prior to mailing such notice....\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The defendants essentially argue that the language of \u00a7 8-265ee(a) requires that the plaintiff submit a proof\n   of mailing receipt from the United States Post Office to satisfy the statutory condition precedent to foreclosure. The plain language of \u00a7 8-265ee(a) contains no such requirement. Section 8-265ee(a) provides that \"a mortgagee ... shall give notice to the mortgagor by registered, or certified mail ....\" The defendants fail to cite case law in support of their interpretation of the statute and we decline to extend the requirements of the statute beyond the plain language to require proof of actual delivery.

Similar to our analysis in part II A of this opinion, the admission of Kovalic's testimony regarding his review of the record and the notes in the file was harmless because the evidence was cumulative. In addition, Kovalic testified as to other indications that revealed that the mortgage program notice had been sent, including \"a tracking number for the mail under the barcode at the top.\" Further, Kovalic testified as to his understanding of the mailing of the mortgage program letter as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \"[The Plaintiff's Counsel]: Now, is your understanding that the record of this document in DocTrack is it-would it be generated in a similar [way] as it would [the default notice]?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \"[Kovalic]: It would be the exact same thing and that's why the dates are important,\n   because these letters, and\n   I apologize as I'm not an attorney in the state of Connecticut, but these letters are traditionally, to the best of knowledge, sent at the same time and are required to be sent at or around the same time period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \"So just like the demand letter would have been generated, printed, folded by a machine, put in an envelope, and sent. [The mortgage program notice] would have been generated the same way. This is not a personalized letter, per se, somebody didn't sit and type this out word for word just like they didn't with the demand letter. There's certain information that's put into a system to generate this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \"And on [the default notice], I mean, there's-it basically it tells you that the mail has already been paid for, you know, that's usually not stamped unless it's been paid. So, you know, from my review of the file I can ascertain that this went to the homeowners roughly through that same process of being printed, of being generated, folded in the mailroom, put in an envelope. All this is done mechanically, and has been for years, and was sent-was put in the mail.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   As a result, the record supports the trial court's finding that the mortgage program notice was sent by certified mail. The statute does not require a return receipt and the lack of a return receipt in the record does not affect the plaintiff's compliance with the statute. Accordingly, the plaintiff has satisfied this statutory condition precedent to foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment in favor of the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Subsequent encumbrancers were also named as defendants in the trial court including National City Bank (National City), People's United Bank (People's United), formerly known as People's Bank, and Rosenthal &amp; Rosenthal, Inc.
