As a result of his statement, the defendant was convicted after a jury trial of disorderly conduct in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1), which criminalizes intentionally or\n   recklessly causing inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm by way of \"violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior ....\" The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgment of conviction, arguing that, under principles stemming from the first amendment to the United States constitution, there was insufficient evidence to sustain a guilty verdict as to the disorderly conduct charge.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Parnoff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=160%20Conn.%20App.%20270\">\n    160 Conn.

The Appellate Court reversed the judgment after concluding that the defendant's statement was not fighting words because, although inappropriate, the defendant's words were not likely to provoke an immediate and violent reaction from the water company employees.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Parnoff\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 281,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=125%20A.3d%20573\">\n    125 A.3d 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We agree with the Appellate Court and affirm its judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On the day of the incident, two employees of the Aquarion Water Company (water company) were sent to the defendant's property to perform fire hydrant maintenance. One of the two employees, Kyle Lavin, was an apprentice level employee working his fourth summer for the water company performing hydrant maintenance. Lavin needed assistance locating a fire hydrant on the defendant's property that he was scheduled to routinely service, and he called\n   fellow water company employee David Lathlean to help him. Lathlean was an experienced employee, having worked for\n   the water company for approximately ten years. Although the fire hydrant was located on the defendant's private property, the water company had a preexisting easement that spanned a radius of twenty feet beyond the fire hydrant and hydrant pipe.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Lavin and Lathlean arrived at the defendant's property in separate company branded trucks, wearing bright yellow company branded safety shirts and identification badges. They entered the property together and located the hydrant down a long driveway through a wooded area, approximately 100 feet from the defendant's residence. Upon inspecting the fire hydrant, Lavin and Lathlean discovered that one of its caps was missing. They then began to look for the cap in the vicinity of the hydrant, including in an open-ended shed with a canopy roof located several yards away. Lathlean entered the open-ended shed and discovered the hydrant's missing cap, which appeared to have a garden hose fitting welded into it. This indicated to Lathlean that someone had tampered with the hydrant because the water company does not permit the removal or modification of hydrant caps. As a result, the two employees called another water company employee, Beverly Doyle, who handled theft of service investigations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Shortly thereafter, the defendant's daughter, who had just arrived at the property to visit her parents, and the defendant's wife were approached by the water company employees. Lathlean first spoke to the defendant's daughter, conveying to her that he suspected someone had tampered with the hydrant. The daughter testified that Lathlean was \"[n]ot very nice, loud,\" and \"angry.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendant then appeared and approached Lavin and Lathlean to confront them about their presence on the property. The defendant was wearing shorts and no shirt, and he appeared disheveled. He was also carrying a can that he was using to collect worms from the ground in order to go fishing with his grandson, who was elsewhere on the property. Lavin looked on as Lathlean explained to the defendant that they were employed by the water company to perform hydrant maintenance and had discovered the altered hydrant cap. According to Lavin, the defendant was very upset, throwing his arms up and down, yelling, and he told them to leave his property multiple times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Despite Lathlean's explanation, the defendant told Lavin and Lathlean that they had no right to be on his property. According to Lathlean, the defendant then told him that, \"if [they] didn't get off his property, he was going to get a gun or something like that ... [t]o shoot [them].\" Although the defendant did not speak directly to Lavin, Lavin testified that he heard the defendant say, \" 'if you go into my shed, I'm going to go into my house, get my gun and [fucking] kill you.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Lathlean called the police, but the two employees remained on the property, even though they were trained by the water company to leave if a property owner became angry. Lathlean gave no outward reaction to the defendant's statement, testifying that \"it just bounced right off [of]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   me\" and that \"I just stood there and was like, okay then, you know, let's see what happens.\" Lathlean also testified that he was not frightened by the defendant's words. In fact, when Lathlean called the police, he referred to the defendant as merely \" 'a little crabby' \" and did not report anything about a gun. Although Lavin testified that the defendant's words\n   \"[a]bsolutely\" caused him alarm and trepidation, like Lathlean, he remained on the property. Nothing in Lavin's testimony indicated that he believed that the defendant was armed, and, thus, it did not appear that he was immediately capable of carrying out the threat. The defendant made no effort to return to his house to retrieve a gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After making the gun comment, the defendant walked away from Lavin and Lathlean and toward a nearby, fenced off animal pen. Lathlean began following the defendant around his property as the defendant continued to search for worms to collect. The defendant continued to repeatedly ask Lavin and Lathlean to leave his property. Around this time, Doyle arrived to investigate possible water contamination as a result of the tampering, and the defendant told her to leave the property too.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After Lathlean called the police, the defendant also called the police himself to report the incident. When the police officers arrived, the defendant admitted he had told Lavin and Lathlean he would shoot them with a gun. The officers repeatedly asked the defendant to step back so that they could privately interview the water company employees. When the defendant repeatedly refused to leave the immediate area, he was arrested. He was later charged with disorderly conduct in violation of \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1) and fourth degree criminal mischief in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-117a (a) (1) for tampering with the fire hydrant. The jury found the defendant not guilty of criminal mischief but found him guilty of disorderly conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, which reversed the judgment of conviction, remanded the case to the trial court, and directed that court to render a judgment of acquittal on the disorderly conduct charge. After reviewing the entire record, the Appellate Court concluded that the state had failed to present\n   sufficient evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant's statements were likely to provoke an immediate violent reaction, and, thus, they were not fighting words.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Parnoff\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=160%20Conn.%20App.%20270\">\n    160 Conn.

The defendant indicated he was going to retrieve a gun and either \"shoot\" or \"[fucking] kill\" the employees if they remained on his property or went into his shed. A reasonable person hearing either version would likely recognize its threatening nature. Therefore, we do not doubt that, under certain circumstances, such a statement could provoke a reasonable person to retaliate with physical violence to prevent the threat from being carried out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Nevertheless, even though threatening, we do not believe that the defendant's statement, considered in\n   context, was likely to provoke an immediate and violent\n   reaction because the objectively apparent circumstances did not indicate any immediate intent or ability on the part of the defendant to carry out that threat. The evidence established that the defendant was walking around, wearing only shorts, carrying what appeared to be a can of worms, and otherwise appeared to be unarmed. These facts indicate that the defendant would need to retrieve a gun to carry out his threat, suggesting his gun was at a different location and decreasing the likelihood that an addressee would consider any danger so imminent that he would feel compelled to react with violence to dispel it. The defendant was not heading in the direction of his residence, which was located approximately 100 feet away, where, by one account of the defendant's statement, he had said his gun was located. Instead, the defendant began walking toward his animal pen while searching for worms. Given that the defendant was in the presence of his family and did not appear to have the immediate ability to carry out his threat, his utterance was unlikely to constitute a serious expression of intent to harm. Therefore, we doubt that the defendant's statements, considered in context, would be viewed as so threatening that they would incite the average person in the water company employees' positions to imminent violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The improbability of a violent response is further supported by examining the \"personal attributes of the ... addressee[s] that are reasonably apparent ....\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Baccala\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489941\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/1/#p234\">\n    326 Conn. at 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489941\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/1/#p234\">\n    163 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, Lavin and Lathlean were professionals performing duties on behalf of the water company and acting within the scope of their employment.

As professionals, the nature of their daily work required them\n   to service hydrants using easements over private land without prior notice. This could precipitate encounters with confrontational property owners as part of their work. But because they were acting as professionals representing the water company, they \"would reasonably be expected to ... exercise a higher degree of restraint than the ordinary citizen\" and, thus, would be unlikely to react violently when faced with angry property owners.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Baccala\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 245,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489941\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/1/#p234\">\n    163 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489941\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/1/#p234\">\n    id., at 250, 252-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489941\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/1/#p234\">\n    163 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that objective \"inquiry must focus on the perspective of an average store manager\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Lathlean's and Lavin's heightened level of professional restraint undercuts the state's contention that the average employee in either of their positions would strike the defendant first to either forestall violence or, under the state's more strained argument, to respond to the \"humiliating\" and \"insulting\" nature of the threat.

The state contends this would cause the average addressee to feel \"vulnerable\" and \"exposed,\" and, thus,\n   more likely to strike the defendant to forestall violence. It is true that, in\n   <em>\n    Baccala\n   </em>\n   , we considered it significant that the store manager had \"a degree of control over the premises where the confrontation took place.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Baccala\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489941\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/1/#p234\">\n    326 Conn. at 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489941\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/1/#p234\">\n    163 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Seclusion alone, however, does not in our view elevate the circumstances in the present case so as to satisfy the imminent violence threshold. An average water company employee working in the field in Connecticut would routinely be present on private property in many settings, including in wooded areas, while interacting with irritable property owners. The mere secluded nature of the defendant's property does not convince us that the employees were likely to react with imminent violence, particularly given that there were two of them present and a third on her way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The state also contends that the average addressee would have been provoked to violence in order to \" 'beat [the defendant] to the punch,' \" or, in other words, preemptively forestall the defendant from carrying out his threat. We recognize that, although the imminent violence standard is objective, of course certain individuals might, under these circumstances, physically\n   react to forestall gun violence. Although this type of preemptive self-defense is feasible, so are a variety of other responses, such as retreat or de-escalating the confrontation. Ultimately, we conclude that the defendant's utterance falls short of provoking the\n   <em>\n    average\n   </em>\n   person in these workers' positions to react with immediate violence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A subjective analysis of the addressees' actual reactions confirms our conclusion that it was unlikely that\n   imminent violence would follow from the defendant's words. Though the fighting words standard is an objective inquiry, our decision in\n   <em>\n    Baccala\n   </em>\n   underscored that examining the subjective reaction of an addressee, although \"not dispositive,\" may be \"probative of the likelihood of a violent reaction.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Baccala\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489941\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/1/#p234\">\n    326 Conn. at 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489941\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/1/#p234\">\n    163 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Lathlean gave no reaction whatsoever-let alone a violent one. He testified that, not only was he not frightened by the defendant's words, but, rather, they \"bounced right off\" him, stating that, \"I just stood there and was like, okay then, you know, let's see what happens.\" Lathlean then proceeded to follow the defendant around the property, even though he was trained to retreat in the event that he encountered an angry property owner. In fact, when Lathlean called the police, he characterized the defendant as merely \" 'a little crabby' \" and made no mention at all of the defendant's gun threat. Although Lavin acknowledged that the defendant's words caused him \"alarm\" and \"trepidation,\" he too did not outwardly react or leave the premises. Given that the addressees' subjective reactions amounted to no reaction at all, their dispassion supports our independent conclusion that average water company employees in Lathlean's and Lavin's circumstances who were confronted by the defendant's threatening words, unaccompanied by any effectuating action, and who are trained to retreat from hostile situations, would not likely be incited to react imminently and violently.

I also agree with the majority that the statement of the defendant, Laurence V. Parnoff, does not fall within the fighting words exception to first amendment protection because a reasonable person in the position of the addressees would not have been provoked to violent retaliation under the circumstances of the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   I write separately, however, to highlight where my reasoning diverges from that of the majority. First, I think that focusing on the threatening nature of the speech to determine if it falls within the fighting words exception conflates two related but distinct exceptions to first amendment protection of speech: fighting words and true threats. Second, I think that the nature of the addressees' employment in the present case is distinguishable from that of the addressee in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Baccala\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489941\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/1/#p234\">\n    326 Conn. 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489941\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/1/#p234\">\n    163 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied, --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269522,12615607,12615608,12615609,12615610,12615611\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/510/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12615685,12615625,12615727,12615576,12615607,12615704,12615642\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/199/408/\">\n    199 L.Ed.2d 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017), and I therefore would not rely on the scope of the addressees' job duties in concluding that the defendant's statement did not amount to fighting words. I would reach that conclusion based on the content of the statement, under the circumstances of the present case. Third, the correct application of the exception to first amendment protection is not based on the charge\n   or charges leveled against the defendant but, rather, on the state's theory of the case. The state could have relied on the true threats exception because the language of the disorderly conduct statute under which the defendant was charged encompasses true threats. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1). Nevertheless, by failing to articulate a true threats theory, the state forfeited any such claim. Instead, the state's case erroneously relied on a claim\n   that the defendant's statement constituted fighting words. Accordingly, I respectfully concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   I agree with the facts and procedural history as set forth in the majority opinion. The defendant stated to two water company employees either \"if you go into my shed, I'm going to go into my house, get my gun and [fucking] kill you,\" or, that if the addressees did not leave his property, he was \"going to get a gun or something like that ... to shoot\" them. Intuitively, both statements are threats. See, e.g., American Heritage College Dictionary (4th Ed. 2007) (defining \"threat\" as \"[a]n expression of an intention to inflict pain, injury, evil, or punishment\"). Indeed, the state charged the defendant under \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1), which provides that \"[a] person is guilty of disorderly conduct when, with intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, such person ... [e]ngages in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or\n   <em>\n    threatening\n   </em>\n   behavior ....\" (Emphasis added.) Nevertheless, the state consistently argued that the defendant's statement was exempt from first amendment protection not because it was a true threat, but because it amounted to fighting words,\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   it was threatening.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   This convoluted argument has obfuscated the issues in the present case throughout its pendency. For example, in his closing argument before the jury, the prosecutor claimed that \"if the conduct consists purely of speech ... the speech must contain fighting words that would have a direct tendency to inflict injury or cause acts of violence.\" Accordingly, the trial court instructed the jury on the fighting words exception.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   At oral argument before this court, the state conceded that\n   its theory of the case was one of fighting words, not true threats. As a result of these rhetorical and strategic choices, the state conflated the fighting words and true threats exceptions to first amendment protection, and effectively swapped a viable exception for an inapplicable one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In light of this confusion, before setting forth my analysis of the issues presented in this appeal, I will summarize the relevant law and background. First, I note that I concur with the majority's conclusion that the standard of review is de novo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The state's confusion is understandable, given that true threats and fighting words are closely related in two important respects. First, true threats and fighting words are both exceptions to the protection afforded speech by the first amendment. See U.S. Const., amend. I ;\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Alvarez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407413\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/709/#p717\">\n    567 U.S. 709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 717,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407413\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/709/#p717\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407413\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/709/#p717\">\n    183 L.Ed.2d 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). Second, both the fighting words and true threats exceptions are grounded in distaste for violence and concern over the effect of words on the listener.

The majority correctly concludes that such a theory is unpersuasive in the present case.

See Webster's New World Dictionary (2d College Ed. 1972) (defining \"retaliate\" as \"to ... pay back injury for injury\" [emphasis added] ); see also Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th Ed. 2003) (defining \"retaliate\" as \"to return like for like; esp[ecially]: to get revenge\"). Illustrative of this distinction, in another context the Connecticut criminal jury instructions clarify that \"[t]he law stresses that self-defense cannot be retaliatory. It must be defensive and not punitive.\" (Emphasis added.) Connecticut Criminal Jury Instructions 2.8-3, available at https://www.jud.ct.gov/JI/Criminal/Criminal.pdf (last visited June 21, 2018). Thus, this court's use of the word \"retaliation\" in setting the boundaries of the fighting words exception indicates that the exception is justified by a concern that addressees will respond violently due to anger, and not because of a perceived need for preemptive self-defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   This is not a matter of mere semantics; identifying the purpose behind the fighting words exception clarifies its doctrinal parameters and the types of speech that may fit within the exception. It is the\n   <em>\n    true\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    threats\n   </em>\n   exception that encompasses threatening statements that cause a listener to fear violence;\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Krijger\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20Conn.%20434\">\n    313 Conn. at 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20A.3d%20946\">\n    97 A.3d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; not the fighting words exception. Thus, allowing the fighting words exception to encompass statements that might cause violent, preemptive self-defense would be inconsistent with the underlying theory of how fighting words work. Statements that are not threatening enough to be true threats or offensive enough to be fighting words would be exempt from\n   first amendment protection under a nebulous hybrid exception. This is a dangerous proposition given that the exceptions to first amendment protection are limited. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Entertainment Merchants Assn.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334708,12450503\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/786/\">\n    564 U.S. 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 791,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334708,12450503\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/786/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334708,12450503\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/786/\">\n    180 L.Ed.2d 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) (\"[f]rom 1791 to the present ... the [f]irst [a]mendment has permitted restrictions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas, and has never include[d] a freedom to disregard these traditional limitations\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The present case involves a particularly attenuated chain between the defendant's statement and the application of the fighting words exception, and illustrates the problems inherent in conflating the fighting words and true threats exceptions. The defendant's statement arose out of an exchange with Kyle Lavin and David Lathlean, employees of Aquarion Water Company, who were on the defendant's property to perform fire hydrant maintenance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   defendant confronted Lavin\n   and Lathlean in an animated manner, and claimed that they had no right to be on his property. The defendant either said, \"if you go into my shed, I'm going to go into my house, get my gun and [fucking] kill you,\" or, that if Lavin and Lathlean did not \"get off\" his property,\n   he would \"get a gun or something like that ... to shoot\" them. The defendant was shirtless, wearing a pair of shorts, and holding a can of worms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The defendant's comments were conditional threats: either Lavin and Lathlean would leave his property and keep away from his shed, or the defendant would retrieve a gun from elsewhere on the property, come back, and \"[fucking] kill\" them. An analogous statement to the one made by the defendant, would be, \"if you do not do what I demand, I will get you later.\" Violence in the face of such comments is not the response of a reasonable addressee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   As the majority correctly noted, such threats invite a range of responses in the reasonable person. A reasonable person might have retreated, as Lathlean was trained to do. Alternatively, a reasonable person might have called the police, as Lathlean did in the present case. Given these alternatives, a reasonable person would not have responded violently to the defendant's conditional threat by attacking a shirtless man armed with only a can of worms in order to escape speculative violence. It is unsurprising and telling that neither Lavin nor Lathlean considered responding with violence. Admittedly, it is tempting to ponder whether the fighting words exception would have applied had the threat been more immediate-for example, if the defendant had brandished a gun-but such hypotheticals tend to take the defendant's actions from the category of pure speech that must fit within a first amendment exception, to the realm of conduct in which the first amendment is not implicated.

First, unlike the assistant manager in\n   <em>\n    Baccala\n   </em>\n   , they had little control over the premises, as their work took them on to the property of another.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, as the majority observes, \"the addressees in the present case were not in direct customer service roles ....\" It is intuitive that employees whose primary role is customer service would interact differently with members of the public than those who interact with the public as an auxiliary part of their job. I agree with the majority that water company employees may occasionally encounter \"confrontational property owners,\" as the present case illustrates, but I am skeptical that it would be a matter of routine as it was for the assistant manager in\n   <em>\n    Baccala\n   </em>\n   . It is not a question of whether the job duties of the addressee should be considered as a factor in assessing the application of the fighting words doctrine. Indeed, I have considered them in the present case, but find the job duties of Lavin and Lathlean distinguishable from those of the addressee in\n   <em>\n    Baccala\n   </em>\n   . Equating the job duties in\n   <em>\n    Baccala\n   </em>\n   to those of Lavin and Lathlean focuses too heavily on that factor and invites troubling line drawing issues.

Although the defendant's statement was reprehensible, the fighting words exception is a poor fit for the present case. The state's strongest theory relies on an incorrect hybridization of fighting words and true threats, but, once separated, there is little if anything in the defendant's statement that would qualify it as fighting words under these circumstances. This is not to say that such statements\n   must be protected by the first amendment, however. The state could have pursued a true threats theory as I explain in part III of my concurring opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Although the defendant's statement does not rise to the level of fighting words, it was a true threat. In the present case, the defendant told Lavin and Lathlean that he would shoot them if they did not comply with his demands. With regard to the constitutional parameters of the true threats exception, a reasonable person would foresee that threatening to shoot someone if he refused to follow demands would be interpreted as a serious expression of an intent to harm. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    New York ex rel.

Furthermore, true threats may be conditional, like the threat made by the defendant.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pelella\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491007\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/170/647/#p10\">\n    327 Conn. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 16 n.15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491007\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/170/647/#p10\">\n    170 A.3d 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Thus, the defendant's statement fits within the true threats exception.

It provides that \"[a] person is guilty of disorderly conduct when, with intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, such person ... [e]ngages in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior ....\" (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1). In construing that statutory provision, this court has held that the phrase \"fighting ... violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior\" includes conduct that is physical or that \"portends imminent physical violence.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added; internal quotation\n   marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Indrisano\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1325748\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/228/795/#p811\">\n    228 Conn. at 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=640%20A.2d%20986\">\n    640 A.2d 986\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This statutory language is \"identical\" to that of the breach of the peace provision, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1), which this court has held may encompass pure speech, providing that it fits within an exception to first amendment protection.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Szymkiewicz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1200416\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/237/613/#p618\">\n    237 Conn. 613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 618-20,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=678%20A.2d%20473\">\n    678 A.2d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996). In so holding, this court focused specifically on whether \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1) is consistent with the fighting words exception, but statutory provisions may simultaneously proscribe speech that falls within the true threats or fighting words exceptions. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    DeLoreto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"913264\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/265/145/#p168\">\n    265 Conn. 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 168-69,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=827%20A.2d%20671\">\n    827 A.2d 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003) (concluding that \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (3) not only prohibits speech that constitutes true threats, but also fighting words). It is not the charge that determines which first amendment exception applies to speech, but, rather, the state's theory in responding to the defendant's specific first\n   amendment defense to that charge. Thus, I would conclude that \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1) proscribes speech that falls within the true threats exception, and, if the state had pursued such a theory, the defendant would have been culpable under that statutory provision for making a true threat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The state waived any claim that the defendant's speech constituted a true threat when it chose to argue that it constituted fighting words. As I have explained, the prosecutor, in closing arguments before the jury, conceded that \"if the conduct consists purely of speech ... the speech must contain fighting words that would have a direct tendency to inflict injury or cause acts of violence.\" Similarly, at oral argument before this court, the state confirmed that its theory of the case was one of fighting words. By failing to articulate how the defendant's statement fit within the true threats exception, the state waived that theory of guilt.

Furthermore, its attempt to alchemize the defendant's threatening statement into fighting words through a theory of preemptive self-defense is doctrinally and factually unpersuasive. Although I recognize that there may be instances where a true threat is insulting in a manner that also makes it fighting words, that is not the present case. The state simply failed to\n   raise the claim that the defendant's statement constituted a true threat, rather than fighting words, and, as such, was not protected speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   For these reasons, I respectfully concur in the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    Lavin admitted that, at one point, he exceeded the bounds of the easement, although, at the time, the defendant never precisely raised this issue to him.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    Lathlean's exact testimony was that the defendant said he was going to \" 'f'n kill you,' \" but Lathlean clarified that he was censoring himself because of his presence in the courtroom.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    Also, the defendant was originally charged with second degree threatening in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 2011) \u00a7 53a-62, disorderly conduct, interfering with an officer in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-167a, and first degree criminal mischief in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-115. The state later filed a long form information eliminating the threatening and interfering with an officer charges and, instead, alleging fourth degree criminal mischief, disorderly conduct, and sixth degree larceny by theft of utility service in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-119 (15) (B) and 53a-125b (a). The larceny charge alleged that the defendant had sought to obtain water service from the water company by tampering with equipment without the consent of the supplier in order to avoid payment, but the trial court dismissed that charge on statute of limitations grounds. Thus, the state filed a substitute long form information and proceeded to trial on only the charges of disorderly conduct and fourth degree criminal mischief.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    This court in\n    <em>\n     Baccala\n    </em>\n    addressed the fighting words doctrine within the context of a conviction of breach of the peace in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (5), which prohibits using \"abusive or obscene language ... or ... an obscene gesture\" in a public place in order to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm.

The majority relies on the fact that the defendant appeared to be unarmed, insofar as he was clad only in shorts and carried only what appeared to be a can of worms, and was not heading in the direction of his residence-where he stated that his gun was located-at the time he made the statement. I disagree with this aspect of the majority's analysis. In my view, as soon as the defendant introduced the prospect of firearms into his exchange with the water company employees, he escalated the conflict over the apparent theft of hydrant water far beyond any possible epithets that he could have directed at Lavin and Lathlean. In contrast, the majority also suggests that Lavin and Lathlean were obligated to take the extremely angry defendant at his word-that any gun was stored in the house, well beyond his immediate reach. Indeed, Lavin understood the defendant to be concerned about his shed, which was located far closer to the location of the confrontation, insofar as Lathlean had entered the shed looking for the fire hydrant's cap. Moreover, in contrast to the store manager in\n   <em>\n    Baccala\n   </em>\n   , who exercised control over the situation in her store-a fact deemed significant by the majority in that case; see\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Baccala\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489941\" index=\"331\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/1/#p234\">\n    326 Conn. at 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489941\" index=\"332\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/1/#p234\">\n    163 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; the water company employees lacked similar control insofar as the confrontation occurred on the defendant's secluded, wooded property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   I also disagree with the majority's reliance on the apparent lack of extreme reaction by Lathlean and Lavin to the threat, insofar as both-in the words of the majority-exercised a \"heightened level of professional restraint\" and neither reacted violently, nor even left the defendant's property in accordance with water company policy. The lack of reaction by the addressee is \"probative,\" but not \"dispositive\" of whether the words\n   were fighting in nature. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Baccala\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489941\" index=\"333\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/1/#p234\">\n    326 Conn. at 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489941\" index=\"334\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/1/#p234\">\n    163 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although I agree with the majority that the employees' jobs servicing fire hydrants on land owned by others without prior notice to landowners \"could precipitate encounters with confrontational property owners as part of their work,\" and that they would \" 'reasonably be expected to ... exercise a higher degree of restraint,' \" my agreement on that point ends with the water company employees being on the receiving end of vituperative language and epithets such as those in\n   <em>\n    Baccala\n   </em>\n   . Once the defendant explicitly introduced the specter of a shooting into the already tense situation-and there was no indication that he was joking or facetious-he escalated the confrontation beyond that subject to first amendment protection. Indeed, both Lathlean and Lavin testified that they notified the police because, in Lavin's words, the \"situation was starting to get out of control,\" given the defendant's anger and his threat to get a gun.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   To this end, I find instructive the decision by the Georgia Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"482069\" index=\"335\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/241/32/#p32\">\n    241 Ga.

This conclusion could be interpreted as a suggestion that fighting words can occur in private, because \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1) does not require that the charged conduct occur in public, unlike the otherwise identically worded breach of the peace statute, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1).\n    <extracted-citation index=\"384\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=678%20A.2d%20473\">\n     Id., at 618\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"385\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=678%20A.2d%20473\">\n     678 A.2d 473\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . It is hardly determinative however, because this court did not hold that the fighting words exception can apply in private. In addition,\n    <em>\n     Indrisano\n    </em>\n    was not a fighting words case, as the court concluded that the defendant violated the disorderly conduct statute through his physical conduct.\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Indrisano\n    </em>\n    , supra, at 811-13,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"386\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=640%20A.2d%20986\">\n     640 A.2d 986\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    Few courts have addressed the issue of whether the fighting words exception may be applicable to statements that occur in private, and those courts have reached different conclusions. Compare\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Poe\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9229248\" index=\"387\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/139/885/#p904\">\n     139 Idaho 885\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 904,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9229248\" index=\"388\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/139/885/#p904\">\n     88 P.3d 704\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2004) (\"there is nothing in [United States Supreme Court precedent] that would indicate the [c]ourt believes that the use of 'fighting words' in or around one's own home should be constitutionally protected\"), with\n    <em>\n     B.E.S.\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7572084\" index=\"389\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/629/761/#p765\">\n     629 So.2d 761\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 765 (Ala.

App. 1993) (holding that, \"[c]onsidering the circumstances under which these statements were made, including the fact that the statements were made during a private quarrel in the residence occupied by both the speaker and the addressee, we do not think the appellant's statements rise to the level of 'fighting words,' \" and observing that similar comments in public settings had been \"construed as fighting words\" [emphasis omitted] ), cert. denied, Alabama Supreme Court, Docket No. 1921984 (December 3, 1993).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    It is not obvious that the fighting words exception would apply to comments made in private for two reasons. First, if the private speech occurred in the home, the Supreme Court has held that some otherwise unprotected speech is subject to increased protection. See\n    <em>\n     Stanley\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Georgia\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6176248\" index=\"390\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/394/557/#p565\">\n     394 U.S. 557\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 565,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6176248\" index=\"391\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/394/557/#p565\">\n     89 S.Ct. 1243\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6176248\" index=\"392\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/394/557/#p565\">\n     22 L.Ed.2d 542\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1969) (holding that obscenity exception to first amendment protection is insufficient to warrant invasion of \"the privacy of one's own home\"). Second, the history of the fighting words exception suggests an interest in public order. For example, in\n    <em>\n     Chaplinsky\n    </em>\n    , the Supreme Court looked favorably on the statute's limited application to public places in concluding that Chaplinsky's conviction did not violate his first amendment rights.\n    <em>\n     Chaplinsky\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     New Hampshire\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"374637\" index=\"393\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/315/568/#p572\">\n     315 U.S. at 573\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"374637\" index=\"394\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/315/568/#p572\">\n     62 S.Ct. 766\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (holding that statute at issue did not violate first amendment because it \"is a statute narrowly drawn and limited to define and punish specific conduct lying within the domain of state power, the\n    <em>\n     use in a public place of words likely to cause a breach of the peace\n    </em>\n    \" [emphasis added] ). Admittedly, subsequent Supreme Court cases have not required that speech be made in a public setting to fit within the fighting words exception, but they have rejected the applicability of fighting words theories for other reasons. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Cohen\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     California\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026621\" index=\"395\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/15/#p20\">\n     403 U.S. at 20\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026621\" index=\"396\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/15/#p20\">\n     91 S.Ct. 1780\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (not imposing or considering public requirement with fighting words exception, but rejecting fighting words theory where statements could not have been construed as \"direct personal insult\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    I recognize that the water company had an easement over part of the defendant's land, which Lavin and Lathlean may or may not have exceeded, but any such property interest cannot be fairly equated to the control that a managing employee would have over property owned or leased by her employer.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    It is this inherent difficulty in line drawing that has led to much of the scholarly criticism of the fighting words exception.
