Interpreting the third certified question as a request by the defendant to exercise our supervisory authority to adopt his requested rule, we decline to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Appellate Court set forth the following relevant facts and procedural history. \"On March 23, 2012, the defendant was a student at Torrington High School, and was less than one month from his seventeenth birthday. At about 8:30 p.m. on that date, he and several other teenagers left a high school dodgeball game together in a Jeep Grand Cherokee. The defendant and his friends spotted a group of middle school students leaving a minimart on foot, and they decided to 'jump' the younger boys and steal their money. The older group of teenagers followed the three middle school students, eventually stopping the Jeep in front of them. After exiting the Jeep, the defendant and his friend assaulted the younger boys in an attempt to rob them. The defendant grabbed one of the boys, Liam, and pushed him into a nearby parked vehicle. He held a screwdriver to Liam's abdomen and demanded his money. [When Liam said that he did not have any\n   money on him, the defendant kicked his legs out from under him, causing him to fall to the ground.] When the defendant and his friends\n   discovered that the younger boys had no money, they fled in the Jeep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"Several neighbors witnessed all or part of the incident and gave statements to the police, who had responded to a report of an assault. Those statements included a description of the Jeep that the defendant and his friends were using and a partial license plate number. The police also later interviewed the victims, who, although unable to identify their attackers because they had disguised themselves by partially concealing their faces with their T-shirts, gave partial descriptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"At about the time of the incident in question, other police officers spotted a Jeep traveling at a high rate of speed in the vicinity. They followed the vehicle into an apartment complex at which time they initiated a stop, eventually identifying the passengers, including the defendant. Although the police were aware of the recent assault, they did not believe that they had enough evidence to arrest or otherwise detain the occupants of the Jeep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"A week or so following the incident, the police received information that led them to believe that the occupants of the Jeep that they had stopped at the apartment complex were the same group that had attempted to rob the middle school boys. Police detectives interviewed each of the occupants [whom] they had previously identified during the traffic stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"Detective Todd Fador, the lead investigator, first went to the defendant's apartment at 330 Highland Avenue on April 10, 2012, for the purpose of conducting an interview with the defendant; however, he found the defendant alone at that time. Because of the defendant's age, Fador would not conduct an interview without a parent present. Fador told the defendant that he would return another time and left a business card, which the defendant gave to his mother, Yocasta Monegro,\n   thereby alerting her that the police had stopped by her home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Fador returned to the defendant's home on April 13, 2012, at approximately 5 p.m. Monegro, Monegro's boyfriend, two younger children, and the defendant were home at that time. Fador was accompanied by another detective, Keith Dablaine, and Officer Angel Rios. Fador had brought Rios along because Rios was fluent in Spanish, and, at their initial meeting on April 10, 2012, the defendant had told Fador that Monegro did not speak English.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fador and Dablaine carried sidearms and wore plain clothes with badges around their necks. Rios was dressed in a police uniform and also wore a sidearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Monegro answered the door, at which point Rios explained to her, in Spanish, that the purpose of their visit was to speak with the defendant, who had been identified as a suspect. The interview of the defendant was conducted in the living room. The room had a sofa, a love seat, and a chair. In addition to the main entrance to the room, it had two other doors. The defendant was not immediately present when the police arrived, but Monegro indicated that she would get him. When the defendant entered the room, Fador advised the defendant and Monegro of their juvenile and parental rights, respectively. Rios translated Fador's advisement into Spanish. The defendant was presented with a juvenile waiver form that advised\n   him of his rights, including his right to remain silent, to consult with an attorney, and to stop answering questions at any time. The defendant initialed six separate paragraphs on the form and signed the form. Monegro was given a parental consent form that contained a similar advisement of rights in\n   English, which Rios translated for her prior to her initialing and signing the form. The defendant was calm throughout this procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"As the trial court stated in its memorandum of decision denying the motion to suppress, after the waiver forms were signed, Fador 'verbally advised the defendant that he was free to ask the officers to leave, that he was free to stop speaking to the officers, and that he did not have to speak to the officers at all.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ... [T]he defendant did not ask any questions about his rights, he did not appear to be confused, and he said that he understood his rights.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \" 'The defendant agreed to give a statement, asking Fador to write it out. [Fador] did so, stopping every few sentences to give [Rios] an opportunity to translate the defendant's statements to [Monegro]. The defendant was cooperative and did not appear to be worried, although it was apparent that [Monegro] was growing increasingly upset as her son progressed with his statement.... After the defendant finished making his statement, he reviewed what [Fador] had written and then signed the statement.... The entire visit took between forty-five minutes and one hour. At no time did anyone ask the officers to stop questioning the defendant or to leave the home....'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \" '[N]one of the officers advised the defendant that his involvement in the robbery could ultimately lead to his deportation.... [W]hen [Monegro] asked about the risk of deportation, [Rios] replied that such an action is not within his jurisdiction but is, rather, an issue for the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.' ... Although the defendant confessed, first orally and then in writing, to having participated in the events of March 23, 2012, and having attempted to steal money from one of the middle school students, he denied having used any weapon. The defendant was not arrested at that time, and the detectives and Rios left the apartment.\" (Footnotes added and omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Castillo\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485334\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/301/#p729\">\n    165 Conn.

Because he was charged with committing a class B felony, robbery in the first degree, the case was then automatically transferred to the regular criminal docket pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 2011) \u00a7 46b-127 (a) and then to the part A docket in the Litchfield judicial district. The defendant subsequently entered pro forma pleas of not guilty to certain of the charges underlying\n   the juvenile arrest warrant. Prior to jury selection, the state filed a long form information charging the defendant in two counts with robbery in the first degree and robbery in the second degree. The defendant entered pleas of not guilty on both counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"On August 30, 2013, the defendant filed a motion to suppress his April 13, 2012 oral and written statements to the police, arguing that any waiver of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights was not knowingly, intelligently, or voluntarily given, and, even if the police satisfied\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   , his statements were obtained involuntarily in violation of his due process rights under the state and federal constitutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The state filed an opposition arguing that\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings were not necessary in the present case because the defendant was not 'in custody' when the challenged statements were made and there simply was no evidence of any police coercion or other police activity necessary to support the defendant's due process claim. The court,\n   <em>\n    Danaher, J.\n   </em>\n   , conducted a hearing on the motion to suppress, at which time the court heard testimony from Fador, Rios, and Monegro. Following the hearing, on September 24, 2013, the court issued a written memorandum of decision agreeing with the arguments of the state and denying the motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"Prior to trial, on September 30, 2013, the state filed a substitute long form information, amending the charges against the defendant to one count of attempt to commit first degree robbery in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 and 53a-134 (a) (3), and one count of attempt to commit second degree robbery in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 and 53a-135 (a) (1) (A). The defendant pleaded not guilty to those charges, and the case proceeded to trial, following which the jury found the defendant guilty of both counts. The court sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of five years imprisonment, suspended after eighteen months, with five years of probation.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485334\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/301/#p729\">\n    Id., at 711-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485334\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/301/#p729\">\n    140 A.3d 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, claiming, inter alia, that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress because his statements were obtained in violation of his constitutional rights. Specifically, the defendant claimed that (1) the police subjected him to a custodial interrogation without providing him with adequate\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, (2) the trial court's finding that he was home when the officers arrived was clearly erroneous, and (3) the Appellate Court should exercise its supervisory authority to issue a prophylactic rule requiring that juvenile waiver forms\n   inform a juvenile that his statements may be used against him not only in juvenile proceedings, but also in adult criminal proceedings, should his case be transferred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485334\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/301/#p729\">\n    Id., at 705-706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485334\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/301/#p729\">\n    140 A.3d 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In the present case, it is undisputed that the police were interrogating the defendant. Accordingly, the only question is\n   whether he was in custody.

In determining whether a person is in custody in this sense ... the United States Supreme Court has adopted an objective, reasonable person test ... the initial step [of which] is to ascertain whether, in light of the objective circumstances of the interrogation ... a reasonable person [would] have felt [that] he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and [to] leave.... Determining whether an individual's freedom of movement [has been] curtailed, however, is simply the first step in the analysis, not the last. Not all restraints on freedom of movement amount to custody for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   . [Accordingly, the United States Supreme Court has] decline[d] to accord talismanic power to the freedom-of-movement inquiry ... and [has] instead asked the additional question [of] whether the relevant environment presents the same inherently coercive pressures as the type of station\n   house questioning at issue in\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   .... Of course, the clearest example of custody for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   occurs when a suspect has been formally arrested. As\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   makes clear, however, custodial interrogation includes questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a suspect has been arrested or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way....\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p478\">\n    384 U.S. at 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p478\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, not all restrictions on a suspect's freedom of action rise to the level of custody for\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   purposes; in other words, the freedom-of-movement test identifies only a necessary and not a sufficient condition for\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   custody.... Rather, the ultimate inquiry is whether a reasonable person in the defendant's position would believe that there was a restraint on [his] freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.... Any lesser restriction on a person's freedom of action is not significant enough to implicate the core fifth amendment concerns that\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   sought to address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"With respect to the issue of whether a person in the suspect's position reasonably would have believed that [he] was in police custody to the degree associated with a formal arrest, no definitive list of factors governs [that] determination, which must be based on the circumstances of each case.... Because, however, the [court in]\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   ... expressed concern with protecting defendants against interrogations that take place in a police-dominated atmosphere containing [inherent] pressures [that, by their very nature, tend] to undermine the individual's [ability to make a free and voluntary decision as to whether to speak or remain silent] ... circumstances relating to those kinds of concerns are highly relevant on the custody issue.... In other words, in order to determine how a suspect [reasonably] would have gauge[d] his freedom of movement, courts must examine all of the circumstances\n   surrounding the interrogation....

The court noted that, at the time of the interview, the defendant was sixteen years old, and also observed that it was\n   due to his age that Fador did not want\n   to interview the defendant in the absence of his parents. In fact, in the trial court, it was undisputed that the defendant was five weeks short of his seventeenth birthday at the time of the interrogation. Under the facts of the present case, we conclude that the trial court gave sufficient consideration and weight to the defendant's age. The United States Supreme Court has held that, although courts must consider a juvenile's age as one factor in the custody analysis, a child's age will not necessarily be \"a determinative, or even a significant, factor in every case.\"\n   <em>\n    J.D.B.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    North Carolina\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928609,12450489\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/261/\">\n    564 U.S. at 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450489,5928609\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2394/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   There is no question that the Appellate Court also considered the age of the defendant in assessing all of his claims, including the custody analysis.

The court found significant that the officers prohibited the defendant from leaving or otherwise moving about the apartment. In such circumstances, it was reasonable for the defendant to perceive such an imposing display of authority as a clear indication that the police intended to assume and maintain full control over her and her daughters.... The court considered the relatively large number of officers, many, if not all of whom were present in the living room when the defendant was questioned, to be a third factor supporting a finding of custody, citing several federal Circuit Courts of Appeals for the proposition that the presence of a large number of visibly armed law enforcement officers goes a long way [toward] making the suspect's home a police-dominated atmosphere.... Fourth, the police exercised complete control over the defendant and her surroundings before, during and after her questioning.... As soon as the officers entered the apartment, they ordered the defendant to go to the living room, where she was confined to the couch and placed under guard. The court noted that [t]his exercise of total control over the defendant stands in stark contrast to the far more relaxed environment that is a hallmark of interrogations in a suspect's home that have been found to be noncustodial....

The defendant suggests that the officers should have given him the option of being questioned at the police station if he had preferred. He does not argue that an interview at the station would have been less coercive. Without providing any authority for the proposition, he appears to suggest that, if the police had offered him the\n   <em>\n    choice\n   </em>\n   of a more coercive atmosphere, that may have rendered the interview in the present case less coercive. We reject the defendant's suggestion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The defendant claims that the particular circumstances of the encounter transformed the living room into a \" 'police-dominated atmosphere.' \" He places great emphasis on the presence of three officers in the room. We first observe, however, the stark contrast between the number of police officers in the present case as compared to\n   <em>\n    Mangual\n   </em>\n   , in which there were seven officers, some of whom wore tactical gear, and some of whom entered the room brandishing weapons.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mangual\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=311%20Conn.%20182\">\n    311 Conn. at 186, 199-200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=85%20A.3d%20627\">\n    85 A.3d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the present case, there were fewer than one half of the officers who were involved in\n   <em>\n    Mangual\n   </em>\n   , and none of them wore tactical gear or brandished weapons. It is also significant that the third officer, Rios, was present specifically for the purpose of translating for Monegro. Another fact that the defendant relies on is that the officers were \"within 'arm's length' \" of him during the questioning. As we have observed, however, the officers did not in any way restrict the movement of the defendant or others in the apartment. These circumstances differ sharply from those presented in\n   <em>\n    Mangual\n   </em>\n   , in which the officers \"exercised complete control over the defendant and her surroundings....\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mangual\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 201,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=85%20A.3d%20627\">\n    85 A.3d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Also, as we already have observed, the\n   defendant repeatedly was told that he was free\n   to ask the officers to leave and was free to end the questioning at any time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Second, the defendant argues that the presence of his mother made the atmosphere more coercive and, therefore, weighs in favor of concluding that he was in custody. He relies on testimony at the suppression hearing that Monegro appeared \"angry,\" \"worried,\" \"nervous,\" and \"upset\" over the course of the interview and testimony at trial that, at one point during the interview, she \"yelled\" at the defendant in Spanish. Although we can envision facts under which the presence of a parent would render a police encounter more coercive; see generally H. Farber, \" The Role of the Parent/Guardian in Juvenile Custodial Interrogations: Friend or Foe?,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20Am.%20Crim.%20L.%20Rev.%201277\">\n    41 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 1277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004) ; the presence of a parent is generally considered to provide greater protection to a juvenile. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 46b-137 (c) (conditioning admissibility, in delinquency proceeding, of statement by juvenile on, inter alia, presence of parent). The mere fact that Monegro became upset when she heard the details of the crime of which the defendant was accused, without more, is not sufficient to demonstrate that her presence made the police encounter more coercive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We next address the defendant's claim that the Appellate Court improperly declined to adopt a \"per se rule requiring that whenever police investigating a felony give\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings to a juvenile, those warnings must include notice that any statement by the juvenile may be used against the juvenile in adult criminal court if the case is transferred there from juvenile court.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Castillo\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485334\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/301/#p729\">\n    165 Conn.

That is, the defendant claims it is possible that \"an unknown number of juvenile suspects ... may have been misled or deceived about the potential 'adult' consequences of giving a statement to the police.\" He additionally points to the decisions of the United States Supreme Court and this court recognizing limits on the maximum punishments that can be imposed on juveniles on the basis that \"developments in psychology and brain science continue to show fundamental differences between juvenile and adult minds.\"\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Florida\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    560 U.S. 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 68,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) ; see also\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=315%20Conn.%20637\">\n    315 Conn. 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 644,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20A.3d%201205\">\n    110 A.3d 1205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (noting \"the unique aspects\n   of adolescence\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12595737,12595738\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1361/\">\n    136 S.Ct. 1361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12595737,12595715,12594861,12595743\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/194/376/\">\n    194 L.Ed.2d 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).

Indeed, we observe\n   that at the top of the form that the defendant signed, the heading \"City of Torrington\" appears immediately above what appears to be the city's seal or insignia. On its face, then, the form appears to be unique to the city of Torrington.

When, pursuant to state law, police officers have actually informed the defendant of his rights and obtained a waiver, and the defendant's claim on appeal includes that those warnings misinformed him about the scope of his rights under our state constitution, I believe a court can entertain that claim.

Perhaps because age is not listed among the\n   <em>\n    Mangual\n   </em>\n   factors, the trial court did not manifest its consideration of the defendant's age beyond noting that the defendant was nearing his seventeenth birthday. The court did not explain how this fact might be probative of a suspect, under these particular circumstances, feeling that he was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   dominated by the police. Certainly, a sixteen year old juvenile might be less susceptible to coercion than a younger juvenile, but that comparison says little about how a sixteen year old would feel as compared to an adult in the same situation. In my view, a sixteen year old being questioned in his mother's living room likely would feel less free to leave or command the officers to leave than an adult questioned in his own house.

The defendant in\n   <em>\n    Mangual\n   </em>\n   was not a juvenile, however. Nor, in my view, was the question of custody in\n   <em>\n    Mangual\n   </em>\n   a close case.\n   <em>\n    Mangual\n   </em>\n   involved questioning the suspect in a home after seven police officers had entered pursuant to a search warrant and with weapons drawn.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mangual\n   </em>\n   , supra, 311 Conn. at 187 n.3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=85%20A.3d%20627\">\n    85 A.3d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . I do not read\n   <em>\n    Mangual\n   </em>\n   to establish a minimum for what\n   actions may be considered custodial interrogation in the home, especially for a juvenile suspect. The fact that there were more officers present in\n   <em>\n    Mangual\n   </em>\n   , for a longer period of time and with weapons brandished does little-but only little-to help answer the question of custody in the present case.\n   Although there were only three officers present in this case versus seven in\n   <em>\n    Mangual\n   </em>\n   , is a juvenile likely to know that three officers are not that many or to feel free to ask them all to leave? And although the officers did not threaten or physically restrain the defendant in the present case, does that mean a juvenile would not feel restricted by their presence and their intent to question him after confronting him with evidence against him? And even though the interview in the present case ultimately lasted\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   forty five minutes, the juvenile defendant was not told how long it would last when he began giving his incriminating statements, nor was he told whether he would be formally arrested afterward. In short, even though the circumstances in\n   <em>\n    Mangual\n   </em>\n   add up to a clearer case for concluding that the adult defendant was in custody-or that things could have been worse for this young man-that conclusion does not mean that, under the circumstances of\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   case, a juvenile in the defendant's position would not feel that he was in a \"police-dominated atmosphere.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

For example, the trial court expressly relied on the fact that \"[t]he defendant had prior dealings with police, specifically, an encounter with [the uniformed officer].\" But testimony at the suppression hearing established only that the\n   <em>\n    uniformed officer\n   </em>\n   remembered\n   <em>\n    the defendant\n   </em>\n   ; the uniformed officer acknowledged in his testimony at the suppression hearing that he did not know whether the defendant had recognized\n   <em>\n    him\n   </em>\n   . In fact, the testimony revealed few details about this prior encounter, surely not enough to know whether it was cordial or hostile, or even how a juvenile in the defendant's position might have perceived the encounter. All we know is that previously the uniformed officer, while assisting a school resource officer during a fight at the defendant's school, had escorted the defendant off a school bus, though it is not clear whether the defendant was involved in the fight or whether the officer touched or restrained the defendant when escorting him away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The relevance of the trial court's references to this incident is not clear to me. There was certainly no evidence presented to suggest that this prior encounter would have put someone in the defendant's position at ease in the uniformed officer's presence or in the presence of other law enforcement officers not known to the defendant. And a hostile prior encounter would likely have left a person in the defendant's position intimidated by the uniformed officer's later appearance in his mother's home. For this reason, prior contact with law enforcement is generally too speculative of a factor to consider in a custody analysis, and, therefore, any reliance by the trial court on the vague circumstances of this prior incident was misplaced.

Although the trial court noted that the detective told the defendant he could ask them to leave, one detective testified that, apparently, he did not mention this to the defendant until after the defendant had begun narrating his statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   D\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Judging the totality of the circumstances, I find the question of custody to be a much closer call than the majority, the Appellate Court, or the trial court. The defendant was a sixteen year old juvenile who was at home in his mother's apartment when his mother or her boyfriend summoned him to the living room to speak to police officers. There were three police\n   officers waiting for him-two plain clothed detectives with badges displayed, and one officer in uniform. The detectives and the uniformed officer carried firearms. The defendant had seen the two detectives a few days earlier when they originally had come by the home to question him but then left when they learned his mother was not at home. They were back, and this time with a third member of the Torrington Police Department, the uniformed officer, to translate for the defendant's Spanish-speaking mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The police officers spoke to the defendant in the living room. The defendant and one of the detectives were seated, and the other detective was standing in\n   the living room, closer to the front door of the apartment. The detective seated near the defendant told him about his right to refuse questioning, with the uniformed officer translating the conversation for the defendant's mother. The detective presented the defendant with a form, entitled \"Juvenile Waiver,\" and explained the form to him. The defendant did not ask any questions, indicated that he understood, and initialed and signed the form. Although the form explained that the defendant could refuse to answer questions, it did not explain whether he was, at that time, under arrest. None of the police officers present told him, at that time, that he was not under arrest, that he was free to leave the room or the home, or that he could ask the officers to leave. Nor did they tell the defendant how long the interview would likely last or what would happen to him at its conclusion. The uniformed officer presented the defendant's mother with a parental consent form, which the officer translated into Spanish for her. She initialed and signed it, allowing the officers to interrogate the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Once the waivers were signed, the detective seated with the defendant then told him that they were there to discuss his involvement in a robbery, that others involved had given statements to police, and it was \"probably in his best interest not to lie about it because [they] had ... evidence that he was there.\" The defendant then asked, \"[w]hat do you want me to do?\" The detective replied that he wanted \"a statement of his involvement\" because the police had other statements \"saying what [his] involvement [was] but it's better to come from [the defendant].\" The defendant then gave a statement implicating himself in the robbery, with the detective writing down the defendant's statement for him as he narrated it. While the detective was writing the statement, he informed the defendant that he was free to ask the officers to leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   At the point when he began giving the statement, would a sixteen year old juvenile-surrounded by three armed police officers who initiated contact with him, and having been read his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and confronted with the evidence against him-know that he was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   under arrest? Would this juvenile feel free to go-to get up and leave the room after being summoned there at the request of the police officers? Or would he feel free to ask the officers to leave the apartment after his mother let them in to question him? Or would he believe that the police officers were detaining him, given his involvement in a crime? Because I am persuaded that a reasonable sixteen year old in this situation would feel that he was in police custody, I respectfully dissent from the majority's conclusion to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   E\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The majority makes a somewhat different case-and candidly, in my view, a better case-for custody than the Appellate\n   Court or the trial court, as the majority neither relies on any previous encounter between the defendant and an officer nor relies on the defendant's demeanor or his mother's invitation to the officers to enter her home. Rather, the majority relies principally on the facts that the defendant was questioned at home with his mother present. Although it is not inappropriate for an appellate court undertaking plenary review to reassess and reweigh the totality of the circumstances, such an alternative analysis by a reviewing court does not leave me any more confident that the principal factfinder appropriately sought to view the encounter from the position of a reasonable sixteen year old, as\n   <em>\n    J.D.B.\n   </em>\n   demands. See\n   <em>\n    J.D.B.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    North Carolina\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928609,12450489\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/261/\">\n    564 U.S. at 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450489,5928609\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2394/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (not resolving whether juvenile was \"in custody when police interrogated him\" but remanding case to state court for resolution of that question \"this time taking account of all of the relevant circumstances\n   of the interrogation, including\n   <em>\n    J.D.B.\n   </em>\n   's age at the time\"). Moreover, the facts of the present case cast doubt on the ability of the defendant's mother to play the role that the majority envisions-and that state law contemplates-in maintaining a noncustodial atmosphere. Specifically, she was not properly informed about the defendant's rights and the consequences of his providing a statement to officers, and, therefore, in my view, her presence was not sufficient to overcome the police dominated atmosphere the defendant experienced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   To be sure, interrogations inside a suspect's home are significantly less likely to present the pressures of a custodial interrogation. See\n   <em>\n    In re Kevin K.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345201\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/299/107/#p128\">\n    299 Conn. 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 128,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20A.3d%20898\">\n    7 A.3d 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). But in the present case, even though the defendant was questioned while sitting in the familiar surroundings of the family living room, he was more or less surrounded by three police officers whom he had not invited into the home. He instead had been summoned to the living room to be questioned by them after they were allowed into the home by his mother. He was then questioned after they told him they had evidence he was involved in a crime and after having been given\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings-likely an intimidating experience for anyone, let alone a sixteen year old. And even though the officers eventually told him that he could leave or ask them to leave, they did not tell him so until after he had begun his statement. I doubt a juvenile in those circumstances would feel free to depart or ask the officers to leave his mother's home after she had allowed them inside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Besides relying on the fact that the home was the setting for this interrogation, the majority also reasons that the \"presence of a parent is generally considered to provide greater protection to a juvenile\" who is being interrogated. In support of this proposition, the majority cites General Statutes \u00a7 46b-137, which governs the\n   admissibility, in juvenile proceedings, of confessions made outside the presence of a juvenile's parent or guardian. I agree with the majority that \u00a7 46b-137\"recognizes the unique role that parents play in protecting their children's rights.\" Footnote 9 of the majority opinion. The parent's company may help a juvenile feel less dominated by a police presence. In large part, this is because \u00a7 46b-137, including its mandatory advisement of rights, is \"designed to ensure that the child and the parent or guardian have made a valid decision to make a voluntary admission.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Kevin K.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4056570\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/109/206/#p220\">\n    109 Conn.

First, the presence of a parent often can do as much harm in this regard as good, requiring a closer look at the objective circumstances of the parent's involvement. As the majority acknowledges, sometimes a parent's presence enhances the coerciveness of the situation. See, e.g., H. B. Farber, \" The Role of the Parent/Guardian in Juvenile Custodial Interrogations: Friend or Foe?,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20Am.%20Crim.%20L.%20Rev.%201277\">\n    41 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 1277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1289 (2004). Moreover, when the parent is misinformed or not fully informed of the child's rights, or the consequences of waiving those rights, reliance on the parent's presence to protect the child and keep him from feeling dominated by the police can be misplaced. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20Am.%20Crim.%20L.%20Rev.%201277\">\n    id., 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In the present case, the defendant's mother spoke \"[v]ery little\" English and, therefore, the forms that the police gave her and the defendant to explain the defendant's rights were translated for her line by line. The forms did not mention whether the defendant was in custody at the time or whether the defendant or his mother was free to ask the officers to leave. In addition, as the state conceded during oral argument before this\n   court, the form provided to the mother contained errors that gave flawed advice about whether and how any statements the defendant gave could be used against him. See footnote 12 of the majority opinion. The form initially explained that anything the juvenile said \"can and will be used against him/her\n   <em>\n    during any questioning\n   </em>\n   ,\" suggesting that anything the defendant said would not be used against him outside of the interrogation. (Emphasis added.) Later in the form it explained that \"any statement given can be used\n   <em>\n    for\n   </em>\n   or against him/ her in a court of law,\" suggesting that an incriminating statement might actually be used to help the defendant in a court proceeding. (Emphasis added.) The mother's ability to assist the defendant would have been influenced by the information she received from the police, through an interpreter, about the scope of the defendant's rights and the consequences of him giving a statement. As one of the detectives later testified, the parent's and the child's forms \"go hand in hand. You give the parental consent [form] prior to doing the juvenile waiver, so it's-it's the parents allowing us to interview the child.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   More fundamentally, the defendant has challenged the constitutional adequacy of the warnings provided to him, including those contained in the form captioned \"Juvenile Waiver,\" which was presented to him and read to his mother by the detectives through the uniformed officer as the translator. Specifically, he argued to the Appellate Court, on federal and state constitutional grounds, that the warnings he received \"were deficient because they failed to inform [him] that any statement or confession could be used against him in an adult criminal prosecution.\" If the defendant is right about his claim, specifically, that he and his mother should have been informed that any of his statements could be used not just in a juvenile delinquency proceeding but also in an prosecution on the regular criminal\n   docket-an issue the Appellate Court did not reach and I do not pass upon-then does not the failure to provide this clarity undercut the parent's ability to provide, as described by the majority, \"greater protection\" to the child and serve the \"unique role\" that our law, including \u00a7 46b-137, contemplates? And does it not also undercut the heavy reliance the state places upon the parent's presence as a factor to maintaining a noncustodial setting?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In light of the defendant's challenge to the adequacy of these forms, and the impact that their alleged inadequacies might have had on the mother's understanding of the defendant's rights or the consequences\n   of him waiving those rights, I have serious reservations about relying on his mother's presence to establish that the defendant would feel free to ask the officers to leave the home, especially when his mother ultimately permitted them to interrogate the defendant after receiving potentially flawed advice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   F\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   I emphasize that, in reaching my conclusion that the defendant was in custody, I do not mean to suggest that the police officers in the present case did anything untoward. Their conduct in this encounter might well be described as exemplary. Although their forms were flawed, which was likely not of their own doing, they followed state law and the conventions of their department, seeking to interview the defendant only after contacting his mother and permitting her presence. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-137 (b). There is no evidence that they were impolite or used improper force. The presence of the two detectives resulted from department protocol that they work in pairs and, in this situation, they required the uniformed officer as an interpreter for the defendant's mother. Their appearance at the house, presumably in their usual work attire\n   and with their usual weaponry, was in no way inappropriate. It is not inconsistent to conclude, however, that the encounter might nevertheless seem custodial from the perspective of a sixteen year old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   A conclusion that the defendant was in custody under these particular circumstances merely requires that the officers-in compliance with state law-ensure that a juvenile suspect understands his rights and the officers seek a waiver of those rights before obtaining a statement from him. That is exactly what the officers set out to do. The defendant's challenge to the warnings contained in the forms may well go nowhere, but if a court were to rule that a juvenile is entitled to a warning that his statements can be used should he be prosecuted on the regular criminal docket, and not just in juvenile court, I have no doubt that the officers would comply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   On the state of this record and the law, the trial court had \"no hesitation\" in concluding under the circumstances that the defendant's waiver was \"knowing, voluntary, and intelligent.\" I would not rely on the issue of custody to avoid review of the important question of whether the warnings were sufficient and whether the defendant's waiver was therefore valid. Accordingly, I would reverse and remand the case to the Appellate Court to consider this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In part I of this opinion, I conclude that, because the defendant was in custody for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   , we should remand this case to the Appellate Court to address his claim that the warnings given to him were inadequate under the federal and state constitutions. In this part of the opinion, I suggest that, even if the defendant was not in custody, this should not prevent consideration of at least his state constitutional claim that the police should be required to warn juveniles that their statements can be used against them if they\n   are tried on the regular criminal docket instead of in juvenile court. Rather, largely because of state statute and caselaw, I believe the state constitutional claim the defendant advanced in the Appellate Court arises regardless of his custodial status and should be addressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Ordinarily, the need to determine whether the defendant was in custody arises when the defendant was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   informed of his rights pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   because analyzing whether the defendant was in custody dictates whether he was\n   entitled to those warnings in the first place.

In the present case, however, the police\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   provide the defendant with warnings before questioning him, irrespective of whether they believed he was in custody or not. The need for these warnings came about because the defendant was sixteen years old when interviewed. Section 46b-137\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   generally provides that admissions, confessions,\n   or statements by children under the age of sixteen to a police officer or juvenile court official are inadmissible in a delinquency proceeding unless the child's parent, parents or guardian are present and all have been advised (1) of the child's right to counsel, including appointed counsel, (2) the child's right to refuse to make any statements, and (3)\n   <em>\n    \"that any statements the child makes may be introduced\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    into evidence against the child.\"\n   </em>\n   (Emphasis added.)

A similar protocol applies to sixteen and seventeen year old juveniles, except that the juvenile's parents or guardians do not need to be present during any interview but, rather, the police officer or Juvenile\n   Court official who is questioning the juvenile must make \"reasonable efforts to contact a parent or guardian of the child\" and advise the child that he \"has the right to contact a parent or guardian and to have a parent or guardian present during any interview....\" General Statutes \u00a7 46b-137 (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The advisement of the child's rights is \"not simply a pro forma requirement of the statute but an integral component also designed to ensure that the child and the parent or guardian have made a valid decision to make a voluntary admission.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Kevin K.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4056570\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/109/206/#p220\">\n    109 Conn.

Irrespective of these contingencies, however, the juvenile receives the warnings if officers are following the state statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   If, however, the juvenile's statement results in a qualifying charge-essentially a serious felony charge-as in the present case, \"[t]he court shall automatically transfer\" the case to the \"regular criminal docket....\" General Statutes \u00a7 46b-127 (a).

When the defendant argues alternatively under the state constitution that he had a right to be advised that his statement would be admissible in a case on the regular criminal docket, as the defendant in the present case argued before the Appellate Court, he may be met with the argument that he was not in custody, perhaps largely\n   because of his parent's presence, and, so, he was not entitled to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   warnings, even the warnings under \u00a7 46b-137 (a) the officers were compelled to give and that the defendant challenges as insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Included among the claims the defendant made in the Appellate Court was that, under article first, \u00a7 8, of the state constitution,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   a juvenile must be informed of the possibility of adult prosecution before he can make a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of his privilege against self-incrimination.

Rather, the defendant claims that the warning he did receive-which was compelled by state law-was incomplete or misleading under the state constitution. 2 W. LaFave et. al., Criminal Procedure (4th Ed. 2015) \u00a7 6.9 (c), p. 925 (\"there is an absolute prohibition upon any trickery which misleads the suspect as to the existence or dimensions of any of the applicable rights\"). If the defendant is correct that under our state constitution this warning must specifically include an advisement that the statements he makes may be admitted in a case on the regular criminal docket, and not just in juvenile court, it is not clear to me why only juveniles who received a nonspecific warning while in custody would be entitled to that further caution. Statements provided after the giving of this warning may result in charges transferred to the regular criminal docket whether he was in custody or not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In opposing the defendant's request that we exercise supervisory authority to reach his state constitutional claim, the Appellate Court framed the issue in justiciability terms: \"Because we have determined in the present case that\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings were not required because the defendant was not subjected to a custodial interrogation, any further discussion about the content of such warnings would be untethered to any actual controversy and, thus, premature.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Castillo\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485334\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/301/#p729\">\n    165 Conn.

In the Appellate Court's view, the defendant lacked standing because this claim can, apparently, be brought only by those under the age of eighteen who are interrogated under custodial circumstances. As I argue in part I of this opinion, I\n   believe this case qualifies because the defendant was in custody for\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   However, even if I am wrong about that, I do not believe we are required to exercise our supervisory authority to reach this issue in the present case.

See\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Castillo\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485334\" index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/301/#p729\">\n     165 Conn.

Following this court's grant of certification to appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Court, the defendant filed a motion for rectification with the trial court, requesting that court to allow additional testimony on the issue of the defendant's location when the police first arrived at his home. The trial court denied the motion for rectification because it concluded that the defendant had not demonstrated that rectification of the record was appropriate.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    In response to the motion for rectification, however, the court issued an articulation of the basis for its factual finding that the defendant was in the apartment when the police arrived. The court reviewed the testimony offered at the suppression hearing and clarified that, although the testimony of the two officers suggested that the defendant was not initially present\n    <em>\n     in the living room\n    </em>\n    , neither officer was clear regarding the defendant's precise whereabouts. The defendant's mother, by contrast, testified clearly and unequivocally that the defendant was at home at the time that the officers arrived. Put another way, the officers only testified clearly and unequivocally regarding where the defendant was\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    located-in the living room. That testimony, the trial court explained, did not conflict with the mother's testimony regarding where the defendant\n    <em>\n     was\n    </em>\n    located-in the apartment. The trial court explained: \"In view of the fact that the officers were not unequivocal and specific about the defendant's whereabouts when they arrived at the apartment, the court elected to credit the one witness who was unequivocal and specific about this issue: the defendant's mother.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Fador testified at the suppression hearing that, when the defendant told him that his mother spoke no English, Fador informed the defendant that he would bring a Spanish speaking officer with him when he returned.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    The defendant emphasizes that the officers expressly informed him that he could ask them to leave the apartment only after he and his mother already had signed the waiver forms. Therefore, the defendant argues, the officers' statement that he was free to ask them to leave does not support a finding that he was not in custody. We are not persuaded. Even if we were to conclude that the officers were required to inform the defendant that he was free to ask them to leave before he signed the waiver forms, the defendant's argument fails for two reasons. First, the juvenile waiver form expressly informed the defendant that he had the right to stop answering questions at any time. Second, Fador testified that when the defendant arrived, the officers explained to the defendant and his mother that, if he chose not to sign the waiver forms, \"the interview would be stopped.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    The defendant also claimed that his statements to the police were not voluntary and that they were inadmissible at trial pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 2011) \u00a7 46b-137 (c).

In particular, his status as a juvenile and the fact that it was his mother who invited the police into the home are relevant to our assignment of minor significance to Monegro's consent to the entry. On the one hand, our law recognizes the unique role that parents play in protecting their children's rights. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 46b-137 (c) (conditioning admissibility, in delinquency proceeding, of statement by juvenile on, inter alia, presence of parent). In light of the role that parents play in safeguarding their children's rights, police entry with a parent's consent at least generally renders an encounter less coercive than police entry that is authorized by a warrant. On the other hand, a child's parent is most frequently the person who is the head of the household and is in a position to exercise authority over the child. When the head of the household has consented to the officers' entry, it is reasonable to assign only minimal significance to that fact when determining whether a juvenile would feel free, subsequently, to ask the officers to leave.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    As we already have observed, on April 10, 2012, Fador had notified the defendant that when he returned, he would be bringing an officer with him to serve as a translator.
