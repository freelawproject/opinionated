Mazur alleged in her amended complaint that Cuthbert unlawfully caused her injuries and damages due to publication of harmful defamatory statements that Cuthbert knew to be false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mazur and Cuthbert are both employed by the Commonwealth's Department of Military and Veterans Affairs (Department). (Trial court op. at 1.) Both Mazur and Cuthbert worked at the Department's Southwestern Veterans Center (Center). (Complaint at 1-2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mazur had been employed for four years as an accounting assistant and Cuthbert was employed as a human resources analyst 2.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On May 16, 2016, Mazur went to the bank and withdrew $4,700.00 in cash for use by the Center's residents. (Amended Complaint, Attachment 1.B.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mazur had performed this duty on past occasions, as it was part of her normal work duties. After placing the cash in a bank bag, Mazur drove back to the Center without making any stops.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She placed the bag on the desk chair of her co-worker, accounting assistant Sharon Warden (Warden).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When Warden returned to her desk, she and Mazur counted the money in the bank bag and discovered that the bag only contained $4,200.00; after an exhaustive search, neither Warden nor Mazur could locate the missing $500.00.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Center initiated an investigation, which included a pre-disciplinary conference with Mazur on May 26, 2016, to determine if the missing money had been stolen or lost because of any carelessness, neglect, or indifference on Mazur's part. (Statement of Facts, Attachment 2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kim Kreiser (Kreiser), the Center's Chief of Employee Relations, was present at this conference. Mazur admitted at this conference that she left the bank bag unattended on Warden's chair but insisted that the door to the accounting office was closed at all times. She indicated her belief that the money had been stolen by either the bank manager or Warden. Nevertheless, the issue remained unresolved after the conference and Mazur was suspended without pay pending the outcome of a more thorough investigation. (Amended Complaint, Attachment 1.D.) The Center never recovered the missing funds, nor did it determine who took the funds or how the funds were taken. (Amended Complaint, Attachment 1.B.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mazur filed a grievance with respect to her unpaid suspension, and pursuant to a settlement agreement (Agreement) reached between Jennifer McClain-Miller (McClain-Miller), a Labor Relations Analyst for the Center, and Mazur's bargaining\n   representative, the American Federation of State, County &amp; Municipal Employees, Local 2207, Mazur received a time-served, eight-day suspension from May 27, 2016, through June 7, 2016, with a final warning that any further infractions/offenses would result in her termination. (Amended Complaint, Attachments 1.I and 1.K.) Mazur returned to work on June 13, 2016, at which time Cuthbert presented her with a written copy of the Agreement and asked her to sign a form acknowledging her receipt of the same. (Amended Complaint, Attachment 1.C.) However, Mazur refused to sign the acknowledgement because of the final warning language.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Cuthbert then called McClain-Miller and informed her of Mazur's refusal to sign, at which time McClain-Miller advised Mazur that the final warning was part of the Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Unemployment Compensation Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the meantime, Mazur had filed a claim for unemployment compensation benefits in an attempt to recover the income she had lost because of her unpaid suspension. (Amended Complaint, Attachment 1.E.) Mazur's claim was denied by notice of determination mailed June 17, 2016,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , but it erroneously stated that Mazur had last worked for the Center on May 25, 2016, and had been discharged for dishonesty related to theft of money from her department.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mazur's original complaint against Cuthbert alleging defamation attributed these same erroneous statements to Cuthbert.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Original Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   More specifically, in this original complaint, which was incorporated into Mazur's amended complaint in its entirety, Mazur alleged that Cuthbert made knowingly false and defamatory statements regarding her purported theft and dishonesty to her superiors, including Kreiser and McClain-Miller, and to an unemployment compensation representative. Mazur noted that Cuthbert was aware of both a police and internal investigation, neither of which made such findings. In so doing, Mazur alleged that Cuthbert was acting outside the scope of her duties as a human resources analyst for the Center. (Complaint at 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mazur's original complaint placed heavy emphasis on the findings set forth by the unemployment compensation representative in the notice of determination denying her claim. Mazur alleged that the erroneous findings of fact contained therein were based upon statements relayed by Cuthbert to the unemployment compensation representative. Mazur described these statements as libelous on their face and stated that the same resulted in a loss of income, a loss of her reputation, shame, mortification, and hurt feelings. Additionally, Mazur alleged that these false statements resulted in an unjust final warning letter which placed her job and future employment in jeopardy. Mazur further alleged that the statements were not privileged because they were published by Cuthbert with malice and ill will toward her, with an intent to injure, but without any proof to substantiate the same. Mazur sought compensatory and punitive damages, as well as interest and the costs of filing this suit. (Complaint at 4-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Preliminary Objections and Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Cuthbert filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer and to dismiss\n   Mazur's suit on the basis that Cuthbert, as an employee of the Commonwealth acting within her official duties, was immune from suit under 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2310.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cuthbert noted that no waiver of immunity is applicable to her in this instance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cuthbert also filed a demurrer and sought to dismiss Mazur's suit on the basis that she enjoyed an absolute privilege for the statements allegedly made. More specifically, Cuthbert noted that a witness who presents testimony or other information in the course of a proceeding is entitled to an absolute privilege and that such privilege has been extended to cover pertinent and material statements made during the regular course of state agency proceedings, citing\n   <em>\n    Milliner v. Enck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11831247\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/709/417/#p420\">\n    709 A.2d 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 420-21 (Pa. Super. 1998) (holding that statements made to unemployment compensation representative were absolutely privileged from liability for defamation). (Preliminary Objections, February 15, 2017.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   By order dated March 3, 2017, the trial court sustained Cuthbert's preliminary objections and dismissed Mazur's complaint, without prejudice to file an amended complaint within 30 days properly alleging facts supporting her contention that the defamatory statements were made outside the scope of Cuthbert's employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On March 9, 2017, Mazur filed an amended complaint with numerous attachments, including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , copies of a police report indicating no arrests were made, a statement from McClain-Miller, her suspension letter, the notice of determination regarding her claim for unemployment compensation benefits, a statement from Mazur's representative at the unemployment compensation referee's hearing, the Center's Funds Management Policy, and Cuthbert's formal job description. Mazur alleged that these attachments provided \"clear and convincing evidence and proof that [Cuthbert] was acting in her personal capacity with willful and intentional motives to harm [Mazur] and was not acting within the scope of her employment or furthering [the Center's] interests\" when she made the statements. (Amended Complaint at 4.) More specifically, Mazur alleged that Commonwealth employees had a duty under the Public Official and Employee Ethics Act, 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1101 - 1113, to \"display honesty and integrity in the performance of their duties.\" (Amended Complaint at 7.) Mazur also cited to the values and standards required of Commonwealth employees under the Governor's Code of Conduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11831247\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/709/417/#p420\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Cuthbert thereafter renewed her preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer and sought dismissal of Mazur's suit on the basis of immunity and absolute privilege. By order dated April 10, 2017, the trial court sustained Cuthbert's preliminary objections and dismissed Mazur's amended complaint with prejudice. Mazur\n   then filed a notice of appeal with the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Trial Court Opinion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On May 12, 2017, the trial court issued an opinion in support of its order. In this opinion, the trial court explained that even accepting the allegations of Mazur's amended complaint as true, Mazur fails to set forth a claim against Cuthbert because Cuthbert is protected by sovereign immunity.

(Amended Complaint, Attachment 1.G.) This latter duty included investigating and preparing the case by gathering witness statements and termination packages, testifying, presenting materials and witnesses, and conducting cross-examination of witnesses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12325996,12325965,12325982,12325951\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/169/569/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In light of these duties, the trial court concluded that any statements made by Cuthbert to her superiors or to an unemployment compensation representative in conjunction with a hearing regarding Mazur's unemployment compensation claim \"were clearly made within the scope of Cuthbert's employment with [the Center].\" (Trial court op. at 3.) \"As an employee of a Commonwealth agency acting within the scope of her employment,\" the trial court held that Cuthbert was \"protected by sovereign immunity from the imposition of liability for defamation in the present matter.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12325996,12325965,12325982,12325951\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/169/569/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On appeal to this Cout,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mazur argues that the trial court erred in sustaining Cuthbert's preliminary objections because (1) Cuthbert's claim of immunity should have been raised as an affirmative defense under the heading of new matter in an answer to the amended complaint; (2) Cuthbert was not acting within the scope of her employment duties when she relayed false information to an unemployment compensation representative; and (3) Cuthbert was not eligible for any immunity\n   as the false statements were made outside of the context of an unemployment compensation hearing and were in violation of the Center's own rules/policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    Affirmative Defense\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Mazur first argues that the trial court erred in sustaining Cuthbert's preliminary objections because, under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1030, Cuthbert's claim of immunity should have been raised as an affirmative defense under the heading of new matter in an answer to her amended complaint. In the course of this argument, Mazur also alleges that the trial court erred in failing to find Cuthbert in default status as she did not respond to the original complaint within the 20-day timeframe required by Pa.R.C.P. No. 1026.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Pa.R.C.P. No. 1026(a) provides that \"every pleading subsequent to the complaint shall be filed within twenty days after service of the preceding pleading....\" The record herein indicates that Cuthbert was served with the original complaint on January 20, 2017. On February 13, 2017, Mazur served Cuthbert with a 10-day notice of her intent to seek entry of a default judgment under Pa.R.C.P. No. 237.5. Cuthbert immediately responded on February 15, 2017, with the filing of preliminary objections to the original complaint. Here, a period of 25 days had passed between the service of the original complaint and the filing of the preliminary objections. Generally, a party has 20 days to file a responsive pleading such as preliminary objections.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pa.R.C.P. No. 1026 (stating that \"every pleading subsequent to the complaint shall be filed within twenty days after service of the preceding pleading\"). As such, the passage of more than 20 days could have resulted in the entry of a default judgment against Cuthbert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Nevertheless, the trial court did not err in considering Cuthbert's preliminary objections since Mazur did not serve her original complaint on the Office of Attorney General, an absolute prerequisite to the entry of a default judgment against a Commonwealth party,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kreidie v.

No. 237.1(a)(2)(ii).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Preliminary objections clearly qualify as a \"pleading.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pa.R.C.P.

Moreover, this Court has previously noted that the 20-day pleading requirement has not been strictly enforced, that said rule is not mandatory but permissive, and that common pleas courts are afforded discretion in accepting late pleadings in the absence of prejudice and where justice so requires.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ramins v.

Here, Mazur had filed a complaint against a co-employee at the Center, clearly a Commonwealth employee, and the attachments to the amended complaint reflect that Cuthbert's job duties involved handling unemployment compensation claims on behalf of the Center, which included representing the Center at unemployment compensation hearings, investigating and preparing the Center's case by gathering witness statements and termination packages, testifying, presenting materials and witnesses, and cross-examining witnesses. Hence, the defense of sovereign immunity was apparent on the face of the amended complaint.

Hence, a Commonwealth employee may be held liable for conduct performed within the scope of his/her employment only in the narrow categories of cases for which the General Assembly has waived sovereign immunity under section 8522(b) of the Sovereign Immunity Act. As noted above, these categories relate to vehicle liability, medical-professional liability, personal property, real estate, potholes, animals, liquor store sales, National Guard activities, and toxoids and vaccines. Additionally, section 8522(a) of the Sovereign Immunity Act provides that said waiver of sovereign immunity is only applicable to \"damages arising out of a negligent act where the damages would be recoverable under the common law or a statute creating a cause of action if the injury were caused by a person not having available the defense of sovereign immunity.\" 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8522(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Mazur alleges that Cuthbert's actions fall under the personal property exception in section 8522(b)(3) of the Sovereign Immunity Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8522(b)(3), based upon Cuthbert's purported possession and control of her personnel files. We do not agree.

Thus, the personal property exception is not applicable herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As the trial court aptly noted, defamation is an intentional tort, which does not fall within the General Assembly's limited waiver of sovereign immunity.\n   <em>\n    Ioven\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Ioven\n   </em>\n   , Douglas Ioven, a former employee of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), filed a complaint against SEPTA and its police chief, Thomas Nestel, alleging that Nestel had published and distributed an officer safety bulletin to various law enforcement agencies that contained false statements about Ioven.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ioven alleged that Nestel knew or should have known that these statements were false, but admitted that they were made in the course and scope of Nestel's employment with SEPTA.

The common pleas court ultimately sustained a motion from Nestel and SEPTA for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed Ioven's complaint with prejudice on the basis of sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On appeal, this court affirmed. We noted that slander, defamation, and libel were not listed as exceptions to sovereign immunity under section 8522(b) of the Sovereign Immunity Act. Additionally, we rejected Ioven's arguments regarding an exception to immunity under section 8550 of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8550, for acts constituting actual malice of willful misconduct. We noted that such an exception only applies to the immunity granted to local agency employees, not Commonwealth employees, and that the latter \"do not lose their sovereign immunity protection for alleged claims of willful misconduct ... provided they are acting within the scope of their employment.\"\n   <em>\n    Ioven\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190537\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/571/#p574\">\n    150 A.3d at 573-74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Trooper Lombardo filed preliminary objections, and later a motion for summary judgment, asserting sovereign immunity, but the same were overruled and denied, respectively.

Cuthbert's formal job description, which Mazur attached to her amended complaint, reflects that Cuthbert was required to gather witness statements in connection with pre-disciplinary conferences and to make recommendations to the central office concerning the appropriate level of discipline to be applied in each particular case. (Amended Complaint, Attachment 1.G.) Additionally, this job description also stated that Cuthbert's official duties included representation of the Center during the course of unemployment compensation proceedings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=725%20A.2d%20183\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We agree with the trial court that Cuthbert's job description could support a conclusion that Cuthbert was acting within the scope of her employment when she made the alleged defamatory statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   This Court reached a similar conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Cimino v.

In that case, a county constable sued a district justice for defamation, alleging that the district justice had falsely told law enforcement authorities\n   that he was improperly overcharging Erie County for his services. Defining the \"adjudicative responsibilities\" of the district justice broadly enough to include \"being faithful to the law,\" we affirmed a common pleas court's decision sustaining preliminary objections filed by the district justice on the ground that the constable's defamation claims were barred by the Sovereign Immunity Act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9454535\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/786/309/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9454535\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/786/309/\">\n    at 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the course of explaining why the district justice had been acting within the scope of his employment, we emphasized the fact that the district justice had communicated his suspicions only to law enforcement officials exercising \"the authority to investigate such matters.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9454535\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/786/309/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Similarly, here, Cuthbert only made these alleged defamatory statements to other employees overseeing the internal investigation by the Center and to an unemployment compensation representative in conjunction with an ongoing unemployment compensation claim filed by Mazur, in the course of performing her required work duties. Further, because these work duties included conducting and assisting in pre-disciplinary conferences, collecting disciplinary investigation witness statements, recommending discipline to the central office, and representing the agency at unemployment compensation hearings, Cuthbert's conduct in making statements to her superiors and the unemployment compensation representative was specifically authorized by the Center. Hence, like the Pennsylvania State Police trooper in\n   <em>\n    Justice v. Lombardo\n   </em>\n   , Cuthbert appears to have been acting within the scope of her employment duties, which would generally entitle her to immunity against Mazur's defamation claim. However, our inquiry does not end here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    Eligibility for Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Finally, Mazur argues that the trial court erred in sustaining Cuthbert's preliminary objections because Cuthbert was not eligible for any immunity as the false statements were made outside of the context of an unemployment compensation hearing and were in violation of the Center's own rules/policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   While Mazur is correct that the statements upon which her defamation claim is premised were not made within the course of a hearing before an unemployment compensation referee, the fact remains that Cuthbert made the statements in the course of performing her official work duties in preparation for the hearing, thereby shielding the same under sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   We now turn to Mazur's allegation that official policies prohibiting Commonwealth employees from making false statements necessarily places Cuthbert's statements outside the scope of her employment. This case presents a unique question of whether an employee takes herself out of the scope of her employment by knowingly making false statements to third parties, which directly conflict with an employer's written policy against making false statements. There is no question that Cuthbert, in her position as a human resources analyst 2 with the Center, participated in the initial internal investigation regarding the missing $500.00 and was, or at least should have been, aware of the subsequent police investigation. Moreover, accepting the allegations of Mazur's amended complaint as true, which a court must do when ruling on preliminary objections, the internal investigation failed to reveal what happened to the missing money and the subsequent police investigation did not result in any criminal charges against Mazur. Indeed, these allegations are confirmed in the attachments to Mazur's amended complaint, namely a police incident report dated May 20, 2016, a November 17, 2016 letter from counsel for the Center to an intake supervisor\n   at the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and a November 3, 2016 written statement authored by McClain-Miller.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Nevertheless, the findings set forth by the unemployment compensation representative run directly contrary to the same, stating that Mazur was discharged for alleged dishonesty involving theft of money from her department.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   If Mazur can establish that Cuthbert made knowingly false statements to her superiors and/or the unemployment compensation representative, a fact which is not entirely clear by examining the limited pleadings herein, this could be in direct violation of the Center's policy, thereby taking Cuthbert out of the scope of her employment. Indeed, section 228 of the RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF AGENCY provides, \"Conduct of a servant is within the scope of employment if, but only if: (a) it is of the kind he is employed to perform\" and \"(c) it is actuated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the master.\" \u00a7 228(1)(a), (c). This section further provides, \"Conduct of a servant is not within the scope of employment if it is different in kind from that authorized, far beyond the authorized time or space limits, or too little actuated by a purpose to serve the master.\" \u00a7 228(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Certainly, an employee cannot be considered to be furthering an employer's interest in such a situation, nor can such conduct be considered merely incidental to authorized conduct. Moreover, a serious question arises as to whether such conduct constitutes a violation of the Public Official and Employee Ethics Act and/or the Governor's Code of Conduct,\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   which would further buttress Mazur's claim that the alleged statements made by Cuthbert were outside the scope of her employment with the Center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   While Mazur's amended complaint does not definitely establish that Cuthbert made knowingly false statements to her superiors or to the unemployment compensation representative, the exact nature of her statements, and/or whether her statements were simply misunderstood, the allegations contained within the amended complaint, which must be accepted as true, are sufficient to overcome Cuthbert's preliminary objections. If Cuthbert knowingly made false statements to third parties, she would not have been acting within the scope of her employment with the Center and, hence, would not be entitled to immunity.

This denial was premised upon the recommended denial of tenure by the chair of the department where the former assistant professor worked and that department's promotion, evaluation, and tenure committee, which consisted of the faculty members that were defendants in the suit. The former assistant professor raised claims of defamation, invasion of privacy/false light, and intentional interference with contractual relations in his amended complaint, alleging that the committee members exceeded their scope of employment by failing to adhere to evaluation and tenure procedures set forth by the governing collective bargaining agreement. The amended complaint also alleged that the committee members failed to consider his work outside the department, did not return his peer evaluations in a timely manner, did not allow him an opportunity to discuss these evaluations before they were recorded, did not have an expert evaluate him, and included evaluation factors not specifically referenced in the collective bargaining agreements. The faculty members filed preliminary objections asserting sovereign immunity. The common pleas court sustained the same and this Court affirmed on appeal. We concluded that the trial court properly found the committee members acted within the course of their employment, and, hence, were entitled to immunity, as they were part of a committee whose primary duty was to evaluate professors for tenure, which included compiling evaluation information and making recommendations. Further, we noted that even if the assistant professor had alleged that the committee members acted with personal animosity against him, the result would not change because their actions were made to advance the university's interests.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Sections 8542(d) and 8550 of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 8542(d), 8550 (relating to the willful misconduct exception to\n    <strong>\n     governmental\n    </strong>\n    immunity).
