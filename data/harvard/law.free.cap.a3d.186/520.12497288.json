Kerr (Kerr) filed exceptions pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure (Rule) 1571(i)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to this Court's July 6, 2017 order affirming the Board of Finance and Revenue's (Board) January 25, 2012 order sustaining the Board of Appeals' (Appeals Board) dismissal of Kerr's Petition for Reassessment (Petition) (Exceptions). The sole issue before the Court is whether the Court erred by concluding that Kerr's Petition was untimely filed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After review, we overrule Kerr's Exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The procedural posture of this case is undisputed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stipulation of Facts (Stipulation).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   By April 7, 2009 notice, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Revenue (Department) assessed taxes, penalties and interest on income Kerr, a Georgia resident, derived from his investment in PSMK Associates, a Pennsylvania limited partnership (Assessment Notice).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stip. \u00b6 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Stip.

H.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A bar code and certified mailing number 7179 0771 4430 9024 3503 appear at the top of the Assessment Notice and next to the number are the words \"Certified Mail Number.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stip. Ex. H. The Assessment Notice contained the following instructions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO APPEAL FOR A REASSESSMENT OR REFUND.\n   <strong>\n    DETAILS OF YOUR APPEAL RIGHTS ARE ENCLOSED\n   </strong>\n   (SEE REV-554)....

APPEALS ARE CONSIDERED TIMELY IF POSTMARKED BY THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE ON OR BEFORE THE LAST DAY FOR PETITIONING FOR REASSESSMENT OR REFUND OR IF RECEIVED AT THE ADDRESS BELOW ON OR BEFORE THE LAST DAY FOR PETITIONING FOR REASSESSMENT OR REFUND.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Stip. Ex. H. at 3 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Kerr filed the Petition with the Appeals Board on March 25, 2011.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stip. \u00b6 6. The Appeals Board dismissed the Petition because it was not timely filed. Kerr appealed from that decision to the Board. By January 25, 2012 order, the Board sustained the Appeals Board's decision. Kerr appealed to this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 6, 2017, this Court affirmed the Board's order. Kerr timely filed the Exceptions which are now before this Court en banc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Kerr argues in his brief in support of his Exceptions (Exceptions Brief) that Section 338(a) of the Tax Reform Code of 1971 (Code),\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   requires that the Assessment Notice be sent by certified mail and, since the Assessment Notice was not stamped with a certified mail tracking number, \"[i]f the Commonwealth cannot produce this number, then the [Assessment Notice] is void and ... should be set aside\" because it \"may never have been mailed.\" Exceptions \u00b6 11(j);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Kerr Exceptions Br. at 10, 13; Kerr Original Br. at 10, 13. In support of his position, Kerr stated that \"he never received the [A]ssessment [Notice],\" and \"he did not learn of [it] until liens were filed.\" Stip. \u00b6 4. This position is\n   the identical argument Kerr made in his original appeal to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In concluding that Kerr's Petition was late-filed, this Court observed that the Assessment Notice was sent to Kerr's record address in Georgia and, despite that the Commonwealth did not produce a stamped post office receipt, the Assessment Notice clearly contains a certified mailing number.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stip. Ex. H. Moreover, shortly after the Assessment Notice was mailed, the Department received an April 30, 2009 letter from certified public accountant, Paul Frederick Kelly (Kelly), wherein Kelly stated: \"[Kerr] is not aware of any taxable issues that would create [the Assessment Notice] and believes this [Assessment Notice] is in error. Please provide [Kerr] a copy of the document you used to prepare [the Assessment Notice].\" Stip. Ex. I;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Stip. \u00b6 5. Kelly's letter reflects that it was copied to Kerr.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stip. Ex. I. By June 10, 2009 letter, sent by certified mail to Kerr at 1126 Shoreline Drive, Jefferson, Georgia, the Department's Pass Through Business Office explained its assessment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stip. Ex. J;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Stip. \u00b6 5. The Department's June 10, 2009 letter further specified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    If you should disagree with the adjusted tax liability, you must file a petition for reassessment or refund. The specific filing deadlines are printed on the assessment.\n   </strong>\n   Please review the attached Preservation of Appeal Rights\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   that explains that\n   <strong>\n    even if you contact the\n   </strong>\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Department\n   </strong>\n   ]\n   <strong>\n    after you receive the assessment your time to appeal to the\n   </strong>\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Appeals Board\n   </strong>\n   ]\n   <strong>\n    is still running\n   </strong>\n   .

The return receipt reflects that Kerr received the Department's June 10, 2009 letter on June 12, 2009, at the same address where the Department's April 2009 Assessment Notice was mailed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stip. Ex. J at 4. Kerr filed the Petition on March 25, 2011.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stip. \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Board made the following findings in its Statement of the Case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [Kerr] contacted the Department on August 19, 2009 and October 21, 2009 regarding the assessment of 2006 tax due. Department records show that a member of the Pass-Through Business Office spoke to [Kerr] on October 22, 2009, during which [Kerr] indicated that he did not receive the Department's [A]ssessment [N]otice. The Department then informed [Kerr] of his right[ ] to appeal the assessment to the [Appeals Board] and resent [sic] the June 2009 letter explaining the assessment appeal process to an email address provided by [Kerr].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Board Dec. at 2. In addition, the Board found: \"[Kerr] was notified of the jurisdictional issue by letter dated October 18, 2011. [Kerr] has not responded to date.\" Board Dec. at 1. Notably, Kerr did not take issue, either in the Stipulation or his briefs to this Court, with the Board's findings. Rather, he claimed only that he did not receive the Assessment Notice and the Department could not prove otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Notwithstanding, this Court explained in its July 6, 2017 memorandum opinion (Opinion), that Section 338(c) of the Code\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   states, in pertinent part: \"A notice of assessment in the estimated amount shall be sent to the taxpayer.\" 72 P.S. \u00a7 7338(c). Section 338(d) of the\n   Code\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   declares that an assessment notice \"shall be mailed to the taxpayer.\" 72 P.S. \u00a7 7338(d).\n   <strong>\n    Neither provision requires that the Assessment Notice be sent by certified mailing\n   </strong>\n   . Where the General Assembly has mandated certified mailing, it has specified that requirement in the pertinent tax statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section 602(e)(1) of the Real Estate Tax Sale Law,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.602(e)(1) (a tax sale notice shall be given \"by United States certified mail, restricted delivery, return receipt requested, postage prepaid[.]\"). Further, \" '[t]he mailbox rule creates a rebuttable presumption that an item which is properly mailed will be received; the presumption cannot be nullified by only an assertion that the item was not received.'\n   <em>\n    C.E. v. Dep't of Pub. Welfare,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6926447\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/97/828/#p832\">\n    97 A.3d 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 832 (Pa.

Bd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12352037\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/177/1020/\">\n    177 A.3d 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1024 n.5 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In addition, Section 338(c) of the Code mandates that \"[\n   <strong>\n    t\n   </strong>\n   ]\n   <strong>\n    he tax shall be paid within ninety days\n   </strong>\n   after a notice of such estimated assessment has been mailed to the taxpayer,\n   <strong>\n    unless within such period the taxpayer has filed a petition for reassessment\n   </strong>\n   ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   72 P.S. \u00a7 7338(c) (emphasis added). At the time the Department's Assessment Notice was issued, Section 2702(a) of the Code provided:\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"A taxpayer\n   <strong>\n    may file a petition\n   </strong>\n   for reassessment with the [D]epartment\n   <strong>\n    within 90 days after the mailing date of the\n   </strong>\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Assessment Notice\n   </strong>\n   ].\" 72 P.S. \u00a7 9702(a) (emphasis added). Accordingly,\n   <strong>\n    Kerr was required either to pay the assessed taxes or file the Petition within 90 days of the Assessment Notice's date\n   </strong>\n   -\n   <strong>\n    by July 6, 2009\n   </strong>\n   -which the Assessment Notice clearly specified.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stip. Ex. H. at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Kerr did not file the Petition until March 25, 2011-nearly two years (23 months and 19 days) later\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stip. \u00b6 6. Although there is no certified mailing receipt in this record to prove when Kerr received the Assessment Notice, since Section 338 of the Code does not expressly require certified mailing, its absence in this case is not a Code violation. In addition, notwithstanding Kerr's claim that he did not receive the Assessment Notice, it is clear from the unchallenged facts that\n   <strong>\n    Kelly made inquiries about the assessment on Kerr's behalf, and purportedly with Kerr's knowledge, only three weeks after the Assessment Notice was issued\n   </strong>\n   . The Department's June 10, 2009 response to Kelly's letter again instructed Kerr about his appeal rights while he still had\n   <strong>\n    one month in which to timely challenge the Assessment Notice\n   </strong>\n   , but he failed to do so. Moreover, although Kerr contacted the Department on August 19 and October 21, 2009 to discuss the Assessment Notice, it was not until\n   <strong>\n    October 22, 2009 that he first claimed to the Department that he had not received the Assessment Notice\n   </strong>\n   . Despite having, once again, been advised of his appeal rights on October 22, 2009,\n   <strong>\n    Kerr waited nearly another 1\u00bd years\n   </strong>\n   before filing the Petition. Kerr provides no record explanation for the extensive delay, other than that he did not receive the Assessment Notice, which claim is belied by the undisputed facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This Court observed in its Opinion, that the law is well-settled that the Code's time limitations are to be strictly enforced.\n   <em>\n    Quest Diagnostics Venture, LLC v.
