The court, sitting en banc, is asked to decide whether the Sixth Amendment guarantees a right to a jury trial to an accused who faces the penalty of removal/deportation\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   as a result of a criminal conviction for an offense that is punishable by incarceration for up to 180 days. By itself, that period of incarceration does not puncture the six-month line past which an offense is deemed \"serious\" and jury-demandable. We hold that the penalty of\n   deportation, when viewed together with a maximum period of incarceration that does not exceed six months, overcomes the presumption that the offense is petty and triggers the Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury. The conviction is reversed and the case remanded for a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Appellant Jean-Baptiste Bado came to the United States on February 8, 2005, from Burkina Faso, where he was a pastor, fleeing at the time from \"systematic[ ] prosecut[ion] and torture[ ]for his political and religious beliefs.\" Once in this country, he filed an application for asylum. His asylum proceeding continued for several years. It was halted in 2011, however, when he was charged by information with three counts of misdemeanor sexual abuse of a minor\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   because, if convicted, under U.S. immigration law he would be barred from receiving political asylum\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and removed from the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant pleaded not guilty and demanded a jury trial, which was denied. At the bench trial, appellant took the stand and contradicted the charges, calling into question the complainant's credibility. He was acquitted of two of the charges but convicted of one count. He was sentenced to 180 days and ordered to pay $50 to the Crime Victims Compensation Program Fund and register as a sex offender for ten years. The United States commenced deportation proceedings on the basis of the conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On appeal, a divided panel of the court reversed the conviction after concluding that appellant's right to a jury trial had been violated.\n   <em>\n    Bado v.

In light of the 180-day maximum exposure to incarceration for misdemeanor sexual abuse of a minor, we begin with the presumption that the offense is \"petty\" for Sixth Amendment purposes. The question before us is whether the possibility of deportation refutes that presumption. We note the obvious: there is no comparison between the penalty of deportation and the statutory penalties considered in\n   <em>\n    Blanton\n   </em>\n   (temporary license suspension, embarrassing clothing to be worn during two days of community service, and alcohol abuse education course) that were deemed not significant enough to render the DUI offense serious under the Sixth Amendment. Like incarceration, deportation separates a person from established ties to family, work, study, and community. In this forced physical separation, it is similar \"in severity [to] the loss of liberty that a prison term entails.\"\n   <em>\n    Blanton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032611\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/538/#p541\">\n    489 U.S. at 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032611\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/538/#p541\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (distinguishing probation and fines which, although they \"may engender 'a significant infringement of personal freedom,' ... cannot approximate in severity the loss of liberty that a prison term entails\") (internal citation omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Frank v.

Removal, however, can be more severe than the possibility of a six-month sentence of incarceration. Once the actual sentence is served (which could be for a term less than the six-month maximum, or even only probation), a U.S. citizen can return home to family and community and take steps to resume and, possibly, redirect his life. But when a person faces deportation, serving the sentence is only the first step following conviction; once the sentence is completed, the person faces the burdens and anxiety that attend detention pending removal proceedings. Upon removal,\n   the physical separation from family and community lasts at least ten years and, for some, including Mr. Bado, exclusion from the country becomes permanent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   This disruption causes harm and suffering to those who are forced to leave and those who remain. Wrenching decisions might have to be made within the family, which could be left without an important source of emotional and financial support.

The government does not dispute that deportation is a severe penalty. The government's arguments boil down to one contention, that deportation is not the type of penalty that\n   <em>\n    Blanton\n   </em>\n   contemplated should be taken into account in determining whether an offense is deemed serious under the Sixth Amendment. Specifically, the government contends that: (1) removal is not a penalty for a criminal offense; (2) removal should not be considered because it is imposed by Congress, not the Council of the District of Columbia, which created the offense; (3) longstanding precedent establishes that deportation is not \"punishment\"; and (4) the courts of the District of Columbia are not competent to determine the deportation consequence of criminal conviction.

That is not the issue here. In this case, we are concerned with the constitutional rights guaranteed to the accused under the Sixth Amendment in a criminal prosecution that could result in deportation. The government's argument that deportation, as a civil penalty, is not relevant to our inquiry is refuted by\n   <em>\n    Blanton\n   </em>\n   , where the Court considered the possible penalty of license suspension following conviction for DUI relevant in deciding whether the Sixth Amendment guarantees that apply to criminal prosecutions required a jury trial. A license can be suspended, even in the absence of conviction, for purely regulatory reasons such as failure to renew or driving without prescribed vision correction, just as a person may be subject to removal for violating the terms of admission absent a criminal conviction. Yet, in\n   <em>\n    Blanton\n   </em>\n   , the Court took into account the possibility of a license suspension as part of its Sixth Amendment analysis because the statute provided that suspension of licensing privileges was a penalty for a DUI conviction. Similarly here, a statutory provision imposes deportation as a penalty for conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Moreover, the argument that characterizes deportation as a \"non-criminal\" sanction is at odds with (and relies on cases that precede) current law and practice under the 1996 amendments to the Immigration and Naturalization Act (\"INA\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   which provide that removal proceedings are triggered by conviction of a number of state and federal offenses. Cognizant of\n   these changes in the law, the Court has soundly rejected the notion that removal is merely a collateral consequence of criminal conviction, distinct from a criminal penalty, and has instead recognized that \"as a matter of federal law, deportation is an integral part-indeed, sometimes the most important part-of the penalty that may be imposed on noncitizen defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   , 559 U.S. at 364,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1473/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Exercise of these \"limited remnants\" of executive discretion is rare as the government's enforcement policies have prioritized the removal of persons who have been convicted of crimes, ensuring that they are much more likely to be deported than others who could be removed as part of the regulatory process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The government argues that removal should not be considered a penalty in a\n   <em>\n    Blanton\n   </em>\n   analysis because (1) the sentencing court does not have authority to order deportation upon conviction for a deportable offense\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) there would\n   be an \"anomaly\" if a noncitizen would be entitled to a jury trial but a citizen would not. Neither of these is a factor whose relevance can be gleaned from\n   <em>\n    Blanton\n   </em>\n   , which focused on the possible penalties faced by the accused claiming the right to demand a jury trial, without regard to the mechanics by which the penalty is imposed.

The threshold question of whether either of these Clauses applies in a particular case therefore depends on whether the law or government action under judicial review involves a criminal offense or punishment for a crime.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no similar threshold question here, however, because the Sixth Amendment by its terms applies to \"all criminal prosecutions,\" U.S. CONST. amend. VI, and this case involves a criminal prosecution. The question before us is different, whether the penalties that attach if the criminal prosecution results in a conviction for misdemeanor sexual abuse of a minor meet the Court's definition of what constitutes a \"serious\" offense that would entitle the accused to demand that the criminal prosecution be presented to, and decided by, a jury. This explains why\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   , which also dealt with the scope of another of the Sixth Amendment rights of the accused in a criminal prosecution-the right to effective assistance of counsel-did not need to overrule any of the cases cited by the government, which arose under other constitutional provisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   recognizes that deportation, even though \"it is not, in a strict sense, a criminal sanction,\" because of its \"unique nature,\" is nonetheless a \"penalty\" that is so \"enmeshed\" in the criminal consequences of a conviction that it triggers the right to the assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment. 559 U.S. at 365-66,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1473/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, even though it did not decide the question presented in this case,\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   supports (and the cases on which the government relies do not undermine) that removal is a penalty to be factored in when applying the Court's penalty-oriented\n   <em>\n    Blanton\n   </em>\n   analysis to determine whether the accused has a Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial in a criminal prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Practicality of Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally, the government asserts that there are \"practicalities and uncertainties\" as to whether conviction of an offense renders a defendant removable which could make application of a\n   <em>\n    Blanton\n   </em>\n   analysis difficult in some cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   The government does not argue that any such difficulties are presented in this case, as it agrees that appellant's conviction makes him deportable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our holding today is clear: the Sixth Amendment entitles a defendant to a jury trial if he is charged with a deportable offense, even if the maximum period of incarceration does not exceed six months. The statutory basis for the deportation penalty is readily ascertainable, as the INA identifies categories of offenses that render a convicted noncitizen defendant deportable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) (2012).\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no dearth of law on the\n   subject: decisions of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   cases from other jurisdictions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   and guidance provided by federal agencies charged with administration of admission and exclusion of persons to the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Even if they were not purely hypothetical here, the difficulties that the government fears may come to pass in some other case are too remote and of insufficient import to outweigh the loss of the constitutional right to a jury trial.\n   <em>\n    Blanton's\n   </em>\n   penalty-oriented analysis was intended to safeguard this important right where the severity of the potential penalties raises the stakes in a criminal prosecution. In a case where the prosecution and defense are in disagreement on the question of whether an accused will face the serious penalty of deportation if convicted, the trial court is not without resources to come to a sound resolution of the constitutional issue presented. Government counsel are part of the Department of Justice, which has deep expertise in immigration matters and is part of the same executive branch as the Departments of State and Homeland Security, which have responsibility for enforcing the immigration laws. Defense counsel have an obligation to advise their clients competently on the question of immigration consequences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   , 559 U.S. at 369,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1473/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If necessary, the court presiding over a criminal prosecution can appoint its own expert advisor on immigration law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We do not expect this to be a common occurrence in Superior Court. Although genuine disputes about deportability might arise in an immigration proceeding, we think they will seldom occur in the context of a pretrial demand for a jury trial. It is not very likely that a defendant would challenge the government's representation in court that an offense is not deportable, or that the government would make such a representation without being confident that its position is legally correct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   The opposite situation, where the\n   government were to assert (contrary to the defendant's view) that a charged offense is deportable, and thus, jury demandable, presents no issue as the defendant may always waive the right to a jury trial. If the trial court nonetheless must decide a jury demand based on a difficult and unsettled question of deportability, it has the obligation-as in so many other areas\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   -to decide the constitutional issue to the best of its ability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2016-705\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 16-705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (mandating that where the Constitution so requires, trial \"shall be by jury\" unless waived by defendant). Where a jury trial demand is made in a case with a truly vexing issue of deportability, the trial court can decide to default to recognition of the Sixth Amendment right, and avoid the risk of imperiling a conviction that may be obtained after a bench trial, should it eventually be determined that denial of the jury trial demand was based on a flawed judgment on the deportation question. The additional time required for a jury trial may well be offset by the time saved in pretrial argument. Even if some judicial efficiency might be lost, in the weighing of harms and benefits on a constitutional scale, this remote possibility is not a determinative factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   ***\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We conclude that the penalty of deportation, when viewed together with the 180-day maximum period of incarceration for misdemeanor sexual abuse of a minor, overcomes the presumption that appellant was charged with a petty offense and triggers the Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury. As appellant was denied his rightful demand for a jury trial, the conviction is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Opinion for the court by Senior Judge Ruiz, with whom Chief Judge Blackburne-Rigsby, and Associate Judges Beckwith and Easterly, and Senior Judge Washington, join.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    \"The changes to our immigration law have also involved a change in nomenclature; the statutory text now uses the term 'removal' rather than 'deportation.' \"\n    <em>\n     Padilla v.

As the majority opinion points out, the Supreme Court did not parse whether \"the other penalties\" were \"penal\" or \"civil\" in nature and referenced several penalties that were \"civil\" in nature when assessing the relative burdens faced by defendants in criminal cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Misdemeanor Streamlining Act (Act), passed in 1994, was designed to \"relieve pressure on the court's misdemeanor calendars, allow for more cases to be heard by hearing commissioners, and allow for more felony trials to be scheduled at an earlier date.\" Council for the District of Columbia, Committee on the Judiciary, Report on Bill 10-98, at 3-4 (Jan. 26, 1994). The Act sought to accomplish these goals by reducing the maximum sentence that could be imposed for the commission of most misdemeanor crimes in the District of Columbia from six months or more to 180 days or less. By reducing the maximum possible sentence for the majority of misdemeanor offenses, the crimes no longer met the\n   <em>\n    Baldwin\n   </em>\n   threshold for serious crimes, and thus, the vast majority of defendants in the District of Columbia charged with misdemeanor crimes were no longer constitutionally entitled to a jury trial. Before today, we rarely, if ever, looked past the legislative intent expressed in the relevant criminal statutes to determine whether the Council and/or Congress intended for the crime to be considered a serious one. However, because we have interpreted\n   <em>\n    Blanton\n   </em>\n   as authorizing a broader view of the applicable statutory penalties for determining whether the crime is considered serious, we are in the unenviable position of trying to ascertain legislative intent without the benefit of a well-developed legislative record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As Justice Gorsuch recently noted in his concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Sessions v.

The majority opinion sees this as a relatively inconsequential matter as they believe that it will be the rare case where another civil statutory penalty will be considered severe enough to entitle a defendant to a jury trial in a misdemeanor case, while the dissent acknowledges the disparity, but argues that the anomaly supports their position that those of us in the majority are interpreting the Supreme Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Blanton v. City of N. Las Vegas\n   </em>\n   too expansively. Regardless, I agree with Justice Gorsuch's comment above that there are many other severe civil statutory penalties that have been attached to criminal convictions, in addition to deportation and, because it is the legislature's intent that must guide our analysis, the Council should speak clearly to the issue of whether the civil penalties that attach to certain misdemeanor crimes reflects a legislative judgment that the commission of those crimes is more serious than the potential criminal sentence might suggest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blanton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032611\" index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/538/#p541\">\n    489 U.S. at 541-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032611\" index=\"283\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/538/#p541\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The judiciary should not substitute its judgment as to seriousness for that of a legislature, which is 'far better equipped to perform the task, and is likewise more responsive to changes in attitude and more amenable to the recognition and correction of their misperceptions in this respect.' \") (brackets and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Alternatively, the Council could reconsider its decision to value judicial economy above the right to a jury trial. Restoring the right to a jury trial in misdemeanor cases could have the salutary effect of elevating the public's trust and confidence that the government is more concerned with courts protecting individual rights and freedoms than in ensuring that courts are as efficient as possible in bringing defendants to trial. This may be an important message to send at this time because many communities, especially communities of color, are openly questioning whether courts are truly independent or are merely the end game in the exercise of police powers by the state. Those perceptions are fueled not only by reports that police officers are not being held responsible in the courts for police involved shootings of unarmed suspects but is likely also promoted by unwise decisions, like the one that authorized the placement of two large monuments to law enforcement on the plaza adjacent to the entrance to the highest court of the District of Columbia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   One of the ways that the founders sought to ensure that citizens were protected from overreaching by the government was to guarantee a right to a jury trial to anyone charged with a crime. John Adams is famously quoted as saying, \"Representative government and trial by jury are at the heart and lungs of liberty,\"\n   <em>\n    Rauf v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775625,6775562,6775731,6775591\" index=\"284\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/145/430/\">\n    145 A.3d 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 465 n.216 (Del. 2016) (quoting Statement of John Adams (1774) ), and Thomas Jefferson \"consider[ed] a trial by jury as the only anchor ... imagined by man by which a government can be held to the principles of its constitution.\" Letter from Thomas Jefferson to Thomas Paine (July 11, 1789),\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   15 The Papers of Thomas Jefferson, 27 March 1789-30 November 1789, 266 (Julian P. Boyd ed., 1958), http://founders.archives.gov/documents/ Jefferson/01-\n   1502-0259. It is why the right to a jury trial is enshrined in the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution. And, while the D.C. Council complied with the letter of the law when it reduced the potential sentences for misdemeanor crimes to a level that made them non-jury demandable, that decision made us one of the few state court jurisdictions in the country that does not guarantee a right to a jury trial for those charged with criminal misdemeanors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Most states recognize that a jury trial in criminal cases is critically important because of the stigma that accompanies a criminal conviction and many of those states accept the fact that any period of incarceration, no matter how short, can have a devastating impact on one's life and livelihood.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

If the Council chooses this latter\n   path, it will not only address the disparity created by our attempt to faithfully apply\n   <em>\n    Blanton\n   </em>\n   in this case, but the District would also be rejoining the majority of other states where a jury trial in a criminal case is the norm, and not the exception.

Congress's harsh treatment of non-citizens convicted of aggravated felonies, admitting of no exceptions, leaves no room for doubt that Congress views these as serious offenses, no matter the status of the offender. In light of the bars to relief from removal for non-citizens who have been convicted of aggravated felonies, I am satisfied that the crimes Congress has designated as falling within this category are offenses for which Congress has mandated statutory penalties that \"clearly reflect a legislative determination that the offense[s] ... [are] 'serious' one[s].\"\n   <em>\n    Blanton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032611\" index=\"328\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/538/#p541\">\n    489 U.S. at 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032611\" index=\"329\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/538/#p541\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The parties agree that appellant Bado, a non-citizen, was convicted of an aggravated felony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"330\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(A) (defining \"aggravated felony\" to include \"sexual abuse of a minor\"). At the time he made his jury demand, it was known that conviction of the crimes with which he was charged (three counts of misdemeanor sexual abuse of a child, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"331\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022-3010.01\">\n    D.C.

Thus, he was charged with offenses that exposed him to inevitable statutory penalties, an inevitability by which Congress has clearly signaled that it regards the offenses as serious. For that reason, applying the teaching of\n   <em>\n    Blanton\n   </em>\n   , I conclude that Mr. Bado was entitled to a jury trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   One final observation: The rationale I have set out above would afford noncitizens a jury trial when they are threatened almost inevitably with removal from this country (a fate that may be of greater concern to a convicted non-citizen than any jail sentence). It does so, however, without expanding the right to a jury trial to non-citizens in circumstances that (as Senior Judge Washington notes in his concurrence) may be impossible to distinguish from those of our fellow citizens who likely will face severe collateral consequences from misdemeanor convictions, but who, under our statutory and case law, have no right to a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   For this reason, too, I believe the rationale and result set out above are the most\n   appropriate resolution of the issue presented in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Glickman, Associate Judge, with whom Fisher, Associate Judge, joins, dissenting:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   I join Judge Fisher's dissent and wish only to elaborate on one point. In\n   <em>\n    Blanton v. City of N. Las Vegas\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court instructed that the Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury turns on the seriousness of the charged offense in the eyes of the legislature that enacted it, as indicated by the severity of the penalties\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   legislature chose to attach to the offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"A defendant is entitled to a jury trial ...\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   if he can demonstrate\" that those penalties-which consist of \"the maximum authorized period of incarceration\" together with \"any additional statutory penalties\"-\"are so severe that they clearly reflect\n   <em>\n    a legislative determination\n   </em>\n   that the offense in question is a 'serious' one.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The views of other legislatures about the seriousness of the offense, and any additional penalties other legislatures impose upon persons convicted of that offense, are irrelevant to whether a particular defendant is entitled to a jury trial in a prosecution for that offense by the jurisdiction that enacted it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The legislature that enacted the offense in the present case-misdemeanor sexual abuse of a minor-was the Council of the District of Columbia. A noncitizen defendant's conviction of that offense exposes him to the revocation of his or her privilege to remain in this country only under federal immigration law-law enacted by Congress. Deportation is a very severe penalty, but it is not a seriousness-defining penalty attached to misdemeanor sexual abuse of a minor by the legislature that enacted the offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   It therefore has no bearing on whether the defendant is entitled to a jury trial in a prosecution for the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Under District of Columbia law, the gravity of misdemeanor sexual abuse of a minor is the same regardless of whether the crime is committed by a citizen or by an alien subject to removal. The maximum penalties that the District of Columbia Council has chosen to impose for commission of this offense by either a citizen or an alien are the same-180 days in prison and a $1,000 fine\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   -and they clearly are not onerous enough by themselves to trigger a right to a jury trial. A defendant convicted of misdemeanor sexual abuse of a minor also is required to register as a sex offender for ten years under the District of Columbia Sex Offender Registration Act (\"SORA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The SORA is \"not punitive and does not inflict punishment,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   however, and this court previously has held that addition of the registration requirement does not render misdemeanor child sexual abuse a jury-demandable offense under the Sixth Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   I conclude that appellant did not have a constitutional right to a jury trial in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Accordingly, for the above reasons (and for the reasons set forth in Judge Fisher's dissent), I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Fisher, Associate Judge, with whom GLICKMAN, Associate Judge, joins, dissenting:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   According to the majority, a citizen charged with misdemeanor sexual abuse of a child does not have a right to a jury trial, but a noncitizen charged with the very same offense does.
