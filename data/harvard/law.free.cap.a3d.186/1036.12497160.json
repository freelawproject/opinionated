C.S. \u00a7 3804(e)(2)(i) (relating to suspension based upon a conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) ). We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts in this case are not in dispute. On December 28, 2010, Becker was charged with DUI in violation of Section 3802(a)(1) of the Vehicle Code,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and he was convicted of this offense on October 15, 2012 (prior offense). The Department, in accordance with Section 3804(e)(2)(i) of the Vehicle Code, imposed a one-year suspension of Becker's operating privilege, effective December 11, 2012. Becker did not appeal his suspension for the prior offense, and his operating privilege was restored on December 17, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 6, 2011, Becker was again charged with DUI in violation of Section 3802(a)(1) of the Vehicle Code (underlying offense). For reasons not contained within the record, he was not convicted of this underlying offense until August 28, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The issue in this case is whether Becker falls within the exception to suspension set forth in Section 3804(e)(2)(iii) of the Vehicle Code that provides, \"[t]here shall be no suspension for an ungraded misdemeanor under section 3802(a) where the person is subject to the penalties provided in subsection (a) [ 75 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 3804(a) ] and the person has no prior offense.\" 75 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 3804(e)(2)(iii). To fall within this exception to suspension, three conditions must be satisfied. First, the licensee must be convicted of violating 75 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 3802(a)(1) as an ungraded misdemeanor. Second, the licensee must be subject to the penalties contained in 75 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 3804(a). Third, the licensee must not\n   have a \"prior offense\" as defined in Section 3806 of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 3806. Because the Department does not dispute that Becker satisfies the first two conditions, the only question is whether Becker had \"no prior offense\" when he was convicted on August 28, 2015, of DUI. Whether a person has a \"prior offense\" for suspension purposes is determined under Section 3806(b) of the Vehicle Code. The question here is what version of that provision applies to this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When Becker was criminally charged with both the prior and underlying DUI offenses, Section 3806(b) of the Vehicle Code pertaining to prior offenses stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (b) Repeat offenses within ten years.-\n   <strong>\n    The calculation of prior offenses for purposes of sections ... 3804 (relating to penalties) shall include any conviction\n   </strong>\n   , adjudication of delinquency, juvenile consent decree, acceptance of Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition or other form of preliminary disposition\n   <strong>\n    within the ten years before the present violation occurred\n   </strong>\n   for any of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (1) an offense under section 3802...[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Former\n   </em>\n   Section 3806(b) of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 3806(b) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   However, prior to his conviction on the underlying offense, the General Assembly enacted the Act of October 27, 2014, P.L. 2905, No. 189 (Act 2014-189), which amended Section 3806(b) to read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (b) Repeat offenses within ten years.-\n   <strong>\n    The calculation of prior offenses for purposes of sections ... 3804 (relating to penalties) shall include any conviction\n   </strong>\n   , whether or not judgment of sentence has been imposed for the violation, adjudication of delinquency, juvenile consent decree, acceptance of Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition or other form of preliminary disposition\n   <strong>\n    within the ten years before sentencing on the present violation\n   </strong>\n   for any of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (1) an offense under section 3802... [.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   75 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 3806(b) (emphasis added) (\n   <em>\n    New\n   </em>\n   Section 3806(b) of the Vehicle Code.).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This amendment changed the \"look back\" date used to establish whether a separate incident can be considered a \"prior offense\" when assessing penalties under Section 3804 of the Vehicle Code. While the former statutory version included any conviction within ten years before the present violation, the amended provision includes any conviction\n   <strong>\n    within ten years before sentencing on the present violation\n   </strong>\n   . Moreover, Section 2 of Act 2014-189 provides that\n   <em>\n    New\n   </em>\n   Section 3806(b)\"shall apply to persons sentenced on or after [December 26, 2014,] the effective date of this section.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Given this intervening change in the law, by notice dated October 8, 2015, the Department informed Becker that his November 6, 2011 DUI was a \"prior offense\" under the\n   <em>\n    New\n   </em>\n   Section 3806(b), requiring that his operating privilege be suspended for one year pursuant to Section 3804(e)(2)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Becker appealed his suspension to the trial court contending that\n   <em>\n    New\n   </em>\n   Section 3806(b) should not be applied retroactively because\n   <em>\n    Former\n   </em>\n   Section 3806(b) was in effect when he committed both of his DUI violations. He contends that since\n   <em>\n    Former\n   </em>\n   Section 3806(b) applies, he falls within the\n   exception to the suspension because he did not have a \"prior offense\" as he was not convicted of his first offense when his second DUI occurred. He also argues that to apply\n   <em>\n    New\n   </em>\n   Section 3806(b) would impose unconstitutional\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The trial court denied Becker's appeal. It held that the language of\n   <em>\n    New\n   </em>\n   Section 3806(b) unambiguously provides that it is to be applied to all future offenses in determining whether a person had a \"prior offense\" for the purpose of the exception to suspension set forth in 75 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 3804(e)(2)(iii). Because Becker's conviction occurred on August 28, 2015, well after the effective date for\n   <em>\n    New\n   </em>\n   Section 3806(b), and Becker's prior offense occurred within ten years of his sentencing on the underlying offense, he did not fall within the exception to suspension. The trial court further rejected Becker's claim that his suspension violates the\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   clauses of the Pennsylvania and United States Constitutions because suspension of his operating privilege is a civil consequence of a conviction, not a criminal penalty. This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Becker first argues that the trial court erred in retroactively applying\n   <em>\n    New\n   </em>\n   Section 3806(b) rather than the\n   <em>\n    Former\n   </em>\n   version that was in effect at the time he committed both the prior and underlying offenses because he committed the underlying offense on November 6, 2011, long before\n   <em>\n    New\n   </em>\n   Section 3806(b) became effective on December 26, 2014. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In rejecting a similar retroactivity argument of a DUI offender with respect to the ignition interlock law in\n   <em>\n    Alexander v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"a statute does not operate retrospectively merely because some of the facts or conditions upon which its application depends came into existence prior to its enactment.\"\n   <em>\n    Gehris v. Commonwealth, Department of Transportation\n   </em>\n   , [\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1725146\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/471/210/\">\n    471 Pa. 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ]\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1725146\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/471/210/\">\n    369 A.2d 1271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1273 ( [Pa.] 1977). Thus, under this Court's precedent, \"Retroactive laws have been defined as those which take away or impair vested rights acquired under existing laws, create new obligations, impose a new duty, or attach a new disability in respect to the transaction or consideration already past.\"\n   <em>\n    Nicholson v. Combs\n   </em>\n   , [\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"281223\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/550/23/\">\n    550 Pa. 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ]\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11880986,281223\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/703/407/\">\n    703 A.2d 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 411 ( [Pa.] 1997) (citing Black's Law Dictionary, 1184 (6th ed. 1990) ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"687742\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/583/592/\">\n    583 Pa. 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"687742,8937046\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/880/552/\">\n    880 A.2d 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 559 (2005). In that case, the licensee had three DUI convictions, only one of which arose after enactment of the ignition interlock law. The Supreme Court held that the statute did not violate any restriction on retroactive applications because it did not look back and enhance the punishment offenders received for their prior DUI convictions; rather, it only applied to those DUI convictions occurring after the effective date of the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Similarly, here, the language of Act 2014-189 unambiguously states that\n   <em>\n    New\n   </em>\n   Section 3806(b) shall apply to persons\n   <strong>\n    sentenced\n   </strong>\n   on or after December 26, 2014, the effective date of the Act. The triggering date for the suspension is the date Becker was sentenced, not the date he committed the underlying offense. Because Becker was not sentenced for the underlying offense\n   until August 28, 2015, after the effective date of the Act, he falls squarely within the language of\n   <em>\n    New\n   </em>\n   Section 3806(b) and the Department did not improperly apply the statute retroactively.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kocis v.

Thus, the issue becomes whether the civil disability imposed on [licensee] ... constitutes punishment.\"\n   <em>\n    Lehman v. Pennsylvania State Police\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"16718\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/576/365/\">\n    576 Pa. 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9057069,16718\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/839/265/\">\n    839 A.2d 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 270 (2003). Our courts have repeatedly held that license suspension appeals are civil in nature, and that a DUI offender's loss of his or her operating privilege is not a criminal penalty and does not constitute punishment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Boseman v. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12316290\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/10/#p20\">\n    157 A.3d 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 20-21 (Pa.

Because it is well settled that suspension of a DUI offender's operating privilege is not a criminal penalty, Becker's\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   claims fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Accordingly, we affirm the order of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   AND NOW, this\n   <em>\n    14\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n   </em>\n   day of\n   <em>\n    May\n   </em>\n   , 2018, the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County in the above-captioned matter is hereby affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Section 3802(a)(1) states that \"[a]n individual may not drive, operate or be in actual physical control of the movement of a vehicle after imbibing a sufficient amount of alcohol such that the individual is rendered incapable of safely driving, operating or being in actual physical control of the movement of the vehicle.\" 75 Pa.
