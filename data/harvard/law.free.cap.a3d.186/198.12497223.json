Frosh, Attorney General on the brief) all of Baltimore, MD, for Appellee.\n </attorneys>\n <judges id=\"p-7\">\n  Panel: Eyler, Deborah S., Fader, Alan M. Wilner (Senior Judge, Specially Assigned), JJ.\n </judges>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-8\">\n   Wilner, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   After trial on an agreed statement of facts, appellant was convicted in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City of unlawful possession of a regulated firearm, for which he was sentenced to imprisonment for five years without the possibility of parole. His sole complaint in this appeal is that the trial court\n   erred in denying his motion to suppress the handgun-the regulated firearm-recovered by the police in the course of what he contends was an unlawful search of his vehicle. We find merit in his complaint and shall reverse the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The underlying facts, as presented at the hearing on appellant's motion to suppress, are largely undisputed. The evidence came from the testimony of two Baltimore City police officers-Charles Faulkner and Horace McGriff-and video recordings taken from the body cameras that Officer Faulkner and another City police officer, whom we know only as Officer White, were wearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Officers Faulkner and White responded to a report from the police dispatch unit that two African-American men, one wearing a blue jacket or coat and the other a gray jacket, were selling drugs from a silver Honda Accord in the 5500 block of Ready Avenue. Faulkner was aware that (1) that block of Ready Avenue, a narrow one-way street, was a \"high drug, crime area\" to which he had responded to calls numerous times, and (2) the dispatch report emanated from a 911 call that the dispatch unit said was anonymous-that the caller did not give his/her name or any identifying information. Faukner and White, in separate cars, arrived at the 5500 block simultaneously and saw a silver Honda, with two African-American men sitting in it. The Honda's motor was running. Knowing from experience that \"usually when we have calls like that, most people will try to drive off\" and that, in that area, \"most people who are known for selling drugs do carry weapons,\" Faulkner parked his vehicle directly in front of the Honda and White parked his vehicle directly behind it, intending to block and effectively blocking the Honda from being moved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Officer Faulkner, who initially was near the driver's side of the Honda, walked in front of the car to the passenger side. As he did, he observed through the front windshield that (1) appellant was wearing a gray jacket, and (2) both men were dipping their shoulders down to the lower part of the seat. From his ten years of training and experience as a police\n   officer, Faulkner was aware that \"an armed person would usually dip their hands down to the lower part of the seat, underneath the seat, to either grab a weapon or put one away.\" He felt that the men's actions were consistent with that and, as a result, he\n   believed that they may be armed. After speaking with the occupants and receiving appellant's driver's license, Faulkner ordered the passenger out of the car and began to frisk him for weapons. Officer White removed appellant and began a frisk of him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At that point, Sergeant McGriff arrived. With 24 years of experience as a police officer, McGriff also was aware that the 5500 block of Ready Avenue was a \"highly narcotic infested area.\" He was aware as well that the call that brought him there was \"a very specific call\" regarding the individuals in the Honda and what they were doing. Also of significance to him was that appellant was wearing a \"puff coat\" despite the fact that the outside temperature that day was above fifty degrees, that when it was that warm police officers are allowed to wear short sleeve shirts, and that he was wearing one. Based on his training and experience, he testified that \"[d]uring warm weather, usually puff coats are worn to secure detection of firearms, drugs, give an additional coverage in their personal lives.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As Officer White was frisking appellant, Sergeant McGriff noticed a small piece of plastic hanging outside appellant's underwear which, from McGriff's experience, he believed was part of \"a sandwich bag which most likely had narcotics in it.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He alerted Officer White and, as McGriff suspected, a ziplock bag of suspected drugs was found. Upon that discovery, another officer who had arrived on the scene searched the car and found the handgun that appellant sought to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As he does here, appellant contended that the mere blocking of his car by Officers Faulkner and White constituted an unlawful seizure under\n   <em>\n    Terry v. Ohio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    392 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    20 L.Ed.2d 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968). The unlawfulness, he argued, arose from the fact that the only basis for the stop was the anonymous tip that was relayed through the police dispatch unit and that the U.S. Supreme Court had declared in\n   <em>\n    Florida v. J.L.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508406\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/266/\">\n    529 U.S. 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508406\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/266/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508406\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/266/\">\n    146 L.Ed.2d 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000), and this Court and the Court of Appeals had confirmed in subsequent cases, that an anonymous tip, without more, is insufficient to justify even a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   seizure, much less a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk or a full-blown search. The hearing judge found those cases distinguishable and, in part for that reason, denied the motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As noted, there is no genuine dispute as to the facts as stated above. The only issue before us is one of law, which we resolve\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   . The issue raised is in two parts-whether the effective immobilization of appellant's car, from which all else flowed, constituted an unlawful seizure mandating suppression of the gun, and if not, whether the tip, coupled with what the officers learned after they reached the Honda and its two occupants, sufficed to allow the car to be searched. Because we find that the immobilization of the car constituted an unlawful seizure of appellant, we need not address the second part of the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Encounters between the police and members of the public whom they may suspect of criminal wrongdoing run a gamut with innumerable variations, but, as explained\n   in\n   <em>\n    Pyon v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183320\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/222/412/\">\n    222 Md.

First, there is the arrest, which is the most significant form of seizure of the person and requires, for its validity, probable cause to believe that the person is committing or has committed an offense for which an arrest is permissible.\n   The intermediate category is the\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop, sometimes referred to as an investigatory stop. As Judge Moylan pointed out in\n   <em>\n    Pyon,\n   </em>\n   it constitutes \"a Fourth Amendment intrusion upon a citizen's otherwise unfettered freedom,\" but it is of lesser duration than an arrest and for a different purpose. It does not require probable cause but only a \"reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity\" and \"may only last as long as it takes a police officer to confirm or dispel his [or her] suspicions.\"\n   <em>\n    Pyon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183320\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/222/412/\">\n    222 Md.

Fourth Amendment guarantees are not implicated in such an encounter, said the\n   <em>\n    Pyon\n   </em>\n   Court, \"unless the police officer has by either physical force or show of authority restrained the person's liberty\n   <em>\n    so that a reasonable person would not feel free to decline the officer's requests or otherwise terminate the encounter.\"\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183320\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/222/412/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183320\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/222/412/\">\n    at 421-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183320\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/222/412/\">\n    112 A.3d 1130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting from\n   <em>\n    Swift v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657775\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/393/139/#p151\">\n    393 Md. 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 151,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657775\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/393/139/#p151\">\n    899 A.2d 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006), but emphasis in\n   <em>\n    Pyon\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Though acknowledging that appellant's vehicle \"could not move because it was blocked,\" the trial court regarded that immobilization as simply initiating what it referred to as \"a field investigation based on the anonymous tip\" and focused on what the police observed when approaching the Honda on foot and engaging with the passengers. It did not pay sufficient attention, however, to the consequence of the immobilization itself, which was the threshold issue before it and that is now before us-the undisputed fact that, due to the blocking of his car, appellant was not free to leave and terminate the encounter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On the undisputed facts presented at the suppression hearing, the immobilization of the Honda fell squarely within the circumference of a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop-a temporary seizure that required reasonable articulable suspicion of possible criminal\n   activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The immediate issue is whether the record suffices to establish that level of suspicion, and the resolution of that issue hangs on the weight that may be given to the information relayed in the 911 call, to the extent confirmed by the officers' observations at the moment they immobilized appellant's car. That, in turn, is guided principally by two Supreme Court cases-\n   <em>\n    Florida v. J.L.,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508406\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/266/\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Navarette v.

J.L.\n   </em>\n   , an anonymous caller reported to the Miami-Dade police department that a young black male standing at a particular bus stop and wearing a plaid\n   shirt was carrying a gun. No audio recording of the call was placed in evidence, and the record revealed no information regarding the informant. At some point, two officers arrived at the scene, observed three black males \"just hanging out,\" one of whom, J.L., was wearing a plaid shirt. Apart from the anonymous call, the officers had no reason to suspect any of the three of illegal conduct. One of the officers approached J.L., frisked him, and recovered a gun from his pocket. J.L. was charged with unlawfully carrying a concealed weapon and moved to suppress the gun as the fruit of an unlawful search. The Florida Supreme Court agreed with the trial court that the search was invalid, and the Supreme Court affirmed that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Supreme Court began its discussion by observing that the officers' suspicion that J.L. was carrying a gun arose \"solely from a call from an unknown location by an unknown caller\" and not from any observations of their own. It noted then that \"[u]nlike a tip from a known informant whose reputation can be assessed and who can be held responsible if\n   her [or his] allegations turn out to be fabricated ... 'an anonymous tip alone seldom demonstrates the informant's basis of knowledge or veracity.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 270,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508406\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/266/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting in part from\n   <em>\n    Alabama v.

White\n   </em>\n   , where an anonymous caller reported that a woman was carrying cocaine and would be leaving an apartment building at a specified time, would get into a car matching a particular description, and would drive to a named motel. Standing alone, the\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   Court said, that tip would not have justified a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop, but after police observation confirmed what the caller had said would occur-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the \"predictive\" information-the Court held that the suspicion became reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    J.L.\n   </em>\n   Court contrasted that situation from the one before it, where there was no predictive information that the police could confirm. The Court accepted that an accurate description of a subject's observable location and appearance may be taken as reliable, but the fact that the allegation about the gun turned out to be correct \"does not suggest that the officers, prior to the frisks, had a reasonable basis for suspecting J.L. of engaging in unlawful conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Florida v.

The Mendocino dispatcher broadcast that information to its CHP officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   About eighteen minutes after the call, a CHP officer observed the truck on Highway 1 near mile marker 69-nineteen miles south of the location reported by the caller-and stopped it. A second officer also responded. As the two officers approached the vehicle, they smelled marijuana, whereupon they searched the truck, discovered 30 pounds of the substance, and arrested the driver, Navarette, and a passenger. The defendants moved to suppress the evidence on the ground that the officers lacked reasonable suspicion of criminal activity to justify the stop. The motion was denied, and the resulting conviction was affirmed by a California Court of Appeals and ultimately by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Supreme Court began by confirming the principles that the Fourth Amendment permits brief investigative stops \"when a law enforcement officer has 'a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity,' \" that the reasonable suspicion necessary to justify such a stop \"is dependent upon both the content of information possessed by police and its degree of reliability,\" and that those principles apply \"with full force to investigative stops based on information from anonymous tips.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1687-88. The Court confirmed that an anonymous tip alone seldom demonstrates the informant's basis of knowledge or veracity but that, under appropriate circumstances, \"an anonymous tip can demonstrate 'sufficient indicia of\n   reliability to provide reasonable suspicion to make [an] investigatory stop.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1688.\n   After discussing both the\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    J.L.\n   </em>\n   cases, the\n   <em>\n    Navarette\n   </em>\n   Court concluded that \"[e]ven assuming for present purposes that the 911 call was anonymous ... the call bore adequate indicia of reliability for the officer to credit the caller's account\" and \"the officer was therefore justified in proceeding from the premise that the truck had, in fact, caused the caller's car to be dangerously diverted from the highway.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12579832,12706993\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1683/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 1688-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reaching that conclusion, the Court noted (1) that, in contrast to\n   <em>\n    J.L.,\n   </em>\n   where the tip provided no basis for concluding that the tipster had actually seen the gun, the caller in\n   <em>\n    Navarette\n   </em>\n   necessarily claimed eyewitness knowledge of the alleged dangerous driving,\" (2) the officer's observation of the truck at a location where it logically might be based on a timeline of events gave reason to believe that the 911 caller was telling the truth, and (3) \"[a] 911 call has some features that allow for identifying and tracing callers, and thus provide some safeguards against making false reports with immunity.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12579832,12706993\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1683/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12579832,12706993\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1683/\">\n    at 1689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Important in the context of this case, the Court treated the caller's use of 911 to report the incident as \"[a]nother indicator of veracity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12579832,12706993\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1683/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12579832,12706993\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1683/\">\n    at 1689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It determined, however, that \"a reasonable officer could conclude that a false tipster would think twice before using such a system\" and that \"[t]he caller's use of the 911 system is therefore one of the relevant circumstances that, taken together, justified the officer's reliance on\n   information reported in the 911 call.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12579832,12706993\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1683/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Pointing out that even a reliable tip will justify an investigative stop \"only if it creates a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity may be afoot,\" the Court then considered whether the call in question created that suspicion and concluded that it did.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12579832,12706993\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1683/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   There have been at least two dozen cases in the Federal and State courts discussing and applying a\n   <em>\n    Navarette\n   </em>\n   analysis when a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   -type stop was triggered by information that originated with a 911 call.

When the State is forced to rely solely or predominately on an anonymous tip, it must provide persuasive evidence\n   that the tip was reliable. No such evidence was forthcoming in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We can take judicial notice of Md. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1-301(h) and 1-304 of the Public Safety Article (PS), which are part of the subtitle dealing with the 911 emergency telephone system, and of implementing regulations promulgated by the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services. PS \u00a7 1-304 requires that each county (which includes Baltimore City) have in operation an \"enhanced 9-1-1 system.\" PS \u00a7 1-301(h) defines that term as a system that provides \"automatic number identification\" and \"automatic location identification.\" COMAR \u00a7 12.11.03.06 requires at a minimum, that an enhanced 911 system implemented in Maryland include, among other things:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   E. Electronic recording of all 9-1-1 calls;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   F. Playback capability of all 9-1-1 calls;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   L. Automatic location identification (ALI), which displays, at the public safety answering point, the address or location of the calling instrument; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   M. Automatic number identification (ANI), which displays, at the public safety answering point, the calling telephone number.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Apart from these automatic tracing devices,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   standard operating procedure for 911 calls includes asking the caller's name, location, and telephone number, which the caller may decline to give. The answers given to these questions and others that may elicit the extent of the caller's knowledge regarding what he or she is reporting, coupled with whatever information is recorded automatically, can provide a much better basis for determining the caller's knowledge and reliability than broad assumptions or inferences drawn merely from whether the call is an anonymous one. Given the real and ever-present public concern about retaliation, legitimate callers with accurate information\n   of criminal activity and with no improper motive may have good reason to refrain from offering recordable identifying information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In light of\n   <em>\n    J.L.\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, it would behoove the State, when relying on an anonymous 911 tip, to produce the recording (or explain its absence) and give the suppression court the ability to listen to the conversation-\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   the information supplied by the caller and not just what the police dispatcher relayed to the patrol officers-in order to make a more informed judgment regarding its reliability. That was not done here. The suppression judge had nothing but a double-level hearsay statement of what the officers heard from the police dispatcher, which may have been\n   merely an incomplete summary of what the anonymous caller actually told 911. As in\n   <em>\n    J.L.\n   </em>\n   , the subjects of the call were found where the caller said they were, but what was lacking was any way of concluding that the caller knew they were or would be selling drugs at that location, and there was no corroboration of that prior to immobilizing the car. The seizure therefore was not based on a reasonable articulable suspicion of criminal activity on the part of appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT REVERSED; MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE TO PAY THE COSTS.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Sergeant McGriff explained that \"people who are distributing narcotics have a tendency to conceal it in what we call break bags, plastic sandwich bags of which they hold the narcotics inside.
