CASE HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b6 2] In July 2016, the mother of the child relocated from New York to Maine, bringing the child with her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After being notified by New York child protective authorities of an open case in New York and after another child in the mother's home made a plea for help, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services began an investigation. On August 5, 2016, the Department and law enforcement officials\n   placed the child in a six-hour hold,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   15 M.R.S. \u00a7 3501(1)-(2) (2017), due to safety concerns for the child and the mother's unwillingness to cooperate. The Department then initiated this child protection proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4032 (2017). The court (\n   <em>\n    Dow, J.\n   </em>\n   ) entered a preliminary protection order, placing the child in Department custody.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 4034, 4036 (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b6 3] On August 22, 2016, a summary preliminary hearing was held. The court (\n   <em>\n    E. Walker, J.\n   </em>\n   ) determined that the father, who did not appear but was represented by counsel, had not been provided with sufficient notice. The father did participate telephonically in a case management conference held that same day.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. Civ. P. 43(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 4] The court (\n   <em>\n    Mathews, J.\n   </em>\n   ) held a contested jeopardy hearing in December 2016 at which the father participated telephonically. By order dated January 19, 2017, the court found jeopardy to the child based on the following facts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   This family came to the Department's attention when the State of New York notified the Maine Department of Health and Human Services ... of an open case it had with [the mother]. [The mother] had left New York with [her children] to reside in Maine. [The mother] left New York, in large part to escape from [the father] who had subjected her to domestic violence for several years....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [The father] has subjected [the mother] to physical and emotional abuse. The Court finds [the mother's] testimony on the domestic violence very credible. The physical abuse included scratching, biting, cutting, kicking and punching [the mother]. In 2013, [the mother] was hospitalized with four broken ribs, a fat lip and two black eyes from a beating administered by [the father]. In late July 2016 [the father] broke into [the mother's] residence and sexually assaulted her. During this event, both of [the mother's children] were sleeping in her bed. In the middle of the assault [the child] awoke and asked his father ... why he was hurting his mother. Shortly after this event [the mother] fled New York to Maine with the assistance of a police officer and a domestic violence agency.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [The father] denies that he abused [the mother] despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. The Court does not find him believable. In his estimation, the only reason [the mother] was able to keep [the children] from going into state custody in New York was because he lived with them. Irrespective of this position, [the father] voluntarily left the home in March 2016. He abandoned [the child] in circumstances he felt were unsafe because he \"knew DHHS would catch up with [the mother].\" [The father] takes no responsibility for the abuse he perpetrated, the trauma he inflicted on his child and his abdication of his parental role. The Court finds that [the father] has subjected [the child] to treatment heinous and abhorrent to society as contemplated by 22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4002(1-B)(A)(1) and has abandoned [the child] as contemplated by 22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4002 (1-A)(F).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b6 5] Based on its finding of two aggravating factors-that the father had abandoned the child and that the father had subjected the child to treatment heinous and abhorrent to society-the court relieved the Department of its obligation to pursue reunification efforts with the father.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 4002(1-A)(F), (1-B)(A)(1), 4041(2)(A-2)(1) (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b6 6] The Department filed a petition to terminate the father's parental rights on July 24, 2017. The father was served the petition in hand, in New York, on July 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b6 7] On September 1, 2017, the court (\n   <em>\n    E. Walker, J.\n   </em>\n   ) held a case management conference at which the father did not appear. The father's counsel notified the court that his contact with the father had been \"minimal at best,\" that the father had not given him any direction other than a general request to contest the petition, and that the father had not responded to counsel's email sent almost a month earlier regarding the case management conference. Counsel notified the court that he was considering filing a motion to withdraw. Six days later, counsel filed a motion to withdraw, which was granted by the court (\n   <em>\n    Mathews, J.\n   </em>\n   ) on September 14.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court's order provided that the father could apply for the assignment of new counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b6 8] On November 8, 2017-one week prior to the hearing on the petition to terminate parental rights-the father filed a letter, which included several attachments, expressing his dissatisfaction with the Department and his former counsel and defending against some of the allegations made against him. In the letter, the father did not include an application for reappointment of counsel, move for a continuance, request that he be permitted to participate telephonically in the forthcoming termination hearing, or make any other arrangements related to the termination hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b6 9] On November 15, 2017, the court held a one-day evidentiary hearing on the Department's petition to terminate the father's parental rights. Because the father failed to appear after having been given proper notice of the termination hearing, the hearing was held in his absence. That same day, the court entered a judgment terminating the father's parental rights. The court based its unfitness and best interest determination on the following findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [The father] last had contact with [the child] on 1/5/17 through a phone conversation facilitated by the [Department]. [The father] has not attended court in person.... He has not appeared in any capacity since the jeopardy hearing .... He has not [had] contact with the Department since 1/9/2017, when he had a phone call [with] the Department and his focus was on [the mother's] ex-boyfriend.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [The father] has taken no steps to alleviate jeopardy issues identified in the jeopardy order dated 12/21/16.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The child is in need of protection and permanency. Since the parents have failed to make meaningful progress towards\n   reunification in a time reasonably calculated to meet the child's needs and have abandoned the child, the Court finds that evidence supports a finding that termination of parental rights is in [the child's] best interest. The child has resided in a therapeutic foster care home since February 14, 2017. The child has made wonderful gains adjusting to school and the home since the initial placement. He shares a significant bond with his foster care mom, who spends substantial one on one time with the child and works in his school. The child has also formed bonds with the other child in the home and the foster care father. The child needs a permanency plan which is achievable in a time reasonably calculated to meet his needs. The permanency plan is Adoption ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b6 10] Based on these findings, the court found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the father (1) has abandoned the child, (2) is unwilling or unable to protect the child from jeopardy and that these circumstances are unlikely to change within a time reasonably calculated to meet his needs, (3) is unwilling or unable to take responsibility for the child within a time reasonably calculated to meet the child's needs, and (4) has failed to make a good faith effort to rehabilitate and reunify with the child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4055(1)(B)(2)(b)(i)-(iv). The court also found that termination of the father's parental rights is in the best interest of the child.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4055(1)(B)(2)(a). The father filed a timely notice of appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4006 (2017) ; M.R. App. P. 2A(a), (b)(1), 2B(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   II. LEGAL ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b6 11] In his appeal, the father asserts a claim that his counsel's withdrawal two months before the termination hearing amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel because the father was left without representation at the termination hearing and no case was presented on his behalf.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b6 12] There are two ways in which a parent can raise a claim of ineffective representation in a termination case.\n   <em>\n    In re Tyrel L.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12326955\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/172/916/\">\n    2017 ME 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12326955\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/172/916/\">\n    172 A.3d 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    In re M.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20ME%20138\">\n    2015 ME 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 27,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=126%20A.3d%20718\">\n    126 A.3d 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"First, if there are no new facts that the parent seeks to offer in support of the claim, the parent may make an ineffectiveness claim in a direct appeal from a termination order.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Aliyah M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6774790\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/144/50/\">\n    2016 ME 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6774790\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/144/50/\">\n    144 A.3d 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Second, if the basis for the parent's ineffectiveness challenge is not clear from the existing record and would require a court to consider extrinsic evidence, the parent must\n   <em>\n    promptly\n   </em>\n   move for relief from a judgment terminating his or her parental rights pursuant to M.R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6774790\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/144/50/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Regardless of how the parent presents the claim, the parent \"must execute and file an affidavit stating, with specificity, the basis for the claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. Here, the father asserts his claim by taking a direct appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [\u00b6 13] On a direct appeal, \"we will review the existing record to determine\n   whether the evidence in that record creates a prima facie showing of ineffectiveness.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. The father bears the burden to demonstrate that \"(1) counsel's performance was deficient, i.e., that there has been serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel amounting to performance ... below what might be expected from an ordinary fallible attorney, and (2) the parent was prejudiced by the attorney's deficient performance in that counsel's conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.\"\n   <em>\n    In re M.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20ME%20138\">\n    2015 ME 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 27,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=126%20A.3d%20718\">\n    126 A.3d 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). The father's contention is deficient in several respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b6 14] First, the father asserts that it was improper for counsel to withdraw from his representation by citing numerous rules of professional conduct. To the extent that the father challenges the trial court's original grant of the motion to withdraw and removal of counsel, his argument is not properly presented, and, in any event, is not persuasive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 4005(2), 4006 (2017) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Ryan G.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12347114\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/142/\">\n    2017 ME 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 1 n.1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12347114\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/142/\">\n    173 A.3d 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    In re L.R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6925603\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/97/602/\">\n    2014 ME 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6925603\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/97/602/\">\n    97 A.3d 602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" Section 4006 unequivocally provides that in child-protective cases orders other than termination orders, jeopardy orders, or orders authorizing medical treatment 'are not appealable.' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b6 15] Second, the father has not demonstrated that counsel's\n   <em>\n    performance\n   </em>\n   at the termination hearing was\n   <em>\n    deficient\n   </em>\n   where counsel had withdrawn months earlier with leave of the court. Indeed, the father's brief asserts that \"[i]t is impossible to know what would have occurred, had trial counsel not withdrawn from representation.\" A prerequisite to establishing that counsel's performance was \"below what might be expected from an ordinary fallible attorney\" is that counsel was a participant in the proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [\u00b6 16] To the extent that the father argues that counsel's act of withdrawing from the representation of a client who had abandoned communication and contact with counsel well in advance of trial constitutes a deficient performance, his argument, without more, is not persuasive.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Frederick P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9494916\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/779/957/\">\n    2001 ME 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 9-11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9494916\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/779/957/\">\n    779 A.2d 957\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

The father had previously participated telephonically in a case management conference and at the jeopardy hearing, and therefore was aware that he could remotely take part in the termination proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   [\u00b6 18] Furthermore, counsel withdrew from the case two months before the termination hearing, leaving the father adequate\n   time to apply for replacement counsel who could have presented a defense on his behalf. The father never requested substitute counsel, however, despite the court's invitation to do so.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-19. The result of the termination hearing not being to his liking, the father claims on appeal that he was aggrieved by his counsel's withdrawal-yet he failed to maintain contact with counsel, failed to cooperate with counsel, failed to request substitute counsel, failed to request a continuance, failed to respond to court notices, failed to appear in any capacity after the jeopardy hearing, and does not challenge the merits of the court's judgment terminating his parental rights. The father's claim of ineffective assistance is not persuasive when, like the reunification process, he was a nonparticipant in the judicial process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   [\u00b6 19] Because the father, although notified of the termination hearing, failed to appear at the hearing and failed to seek any relief from the court in his November 8 letter or at any other time after counsel withdrew, the father has not demonstrated prejudice that \"so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re M.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20ME%20138\">\n    2015 ME 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 27,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=126%20A.3d%20718\">\n    126 A.3d 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The entry is:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    The District Court (Waterville,\n    <em>\n     Mathews, J.\n    </em>\n    ) also entered a judgment terminating the mother's parental rights.
