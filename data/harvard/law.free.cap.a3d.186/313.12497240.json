The statute provides for an educator's suspension without pay for 120 days or until the issuance of a final determination of the disputed tenure charges, whichever is sooner. If the matter is not resolved\n   within 120 days, compensation must resume until a determination is reached. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the entitlement to compensation continues under the statute despite the fact there has been an initial award terminating employment that was vacated and remanded, without a dismissal of the tenure charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   These are the facts that give rise to these appeals. In 2012, Pugliese and Chavez were tenured teachers, employed by respondent State Operated School District of the City of Newark (District), and were the subject of tenure charges filed by their schools' principals. The District certified the tenure charges and suspended both without pay, effective September 12, 2012. Arbitration hearings ensued and on February 6, 2013, an arbitrator issued a decision sustaining the tenure charges as to Chavez, which was followed by another arbitrator's decision sustaining the charges as to Pugliese on February 15, 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The arbitrators terminated both teachers' employment with the District. On September 16, 2013, the Chancery Division confirmed the arbitration awards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We reversed, vacating the arbitrators' awards and remanding both matters to the Commissioner to either decide certain legal defenses or delegate their determination to the arbitrators with instructions as to the proper \"legal standards to [be] utilize[d], after which the arbitrators [were to] review the facts anew within this legal framework.\"\n   <em>\n    Pugliese\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4187219\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/440/501/\">\n    440 N.J.

On remand, the Commissioner re-assigned the matters for arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   While their arbitrations were pending in July 2015, both educators filed petitions with the Commissioner, arguing they were entitled to back pay from the 121st day of their suspension up until the date when the arbitrators' decisions were rendered on\n   remand. The District filed its answers to the petitions and the Commissioner transferred the disputes to the Office of Administrative Law for a determination by an administrative law judge (ALJ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In Pugliese's matter, the ALJ issued a decision recommending that she be paid her back pay starting from the 121st day of her suspension until the arbitrator's decision on remand was issued. According to the ALJ, our remand wiped clean the arbitration award sustaining the tenure charges, which now had to be \"tried 'anew' under legal standards that had not yet been articulated\" until our remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the Chavez matter, a different ALJ reached a contrary conclusion. In that action, Chavez and the District cross-moved for summary decision by the ALJ.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On\n   May 25, 2016, the ALJ issued a decision denying Chavez's request for back pay. The judge concluded that Chavez was not entitled to compensation beyond the date of the arbitrator's initial decision because we did not reverse or dismiss the tenure charges against Chavez and, in accordance with our instructions, the arbitrator reconsidered the matter applying \"the guidance\" we required from the Commissioner and again sustained the charges against him. The ALJ stated by reversing and remanding the matter, our decision could not \"reasonably be characterized as a reversal within the meaning of N.J.S.A. 18A:6-14.... As there has never been a dismissal of the charge before or after the Appellate Division['s] [d]ecision regarding Chavez, he is not entitled to the restoration of his pay under N.J.S.A. 18A:6-14.\" The District and Chavez filed exceptions to their respective adverse ALJ's decisions. In both matters, the\n   Commissioner issued final decisions concluding that neither Pugliese nor Chavez was entitled to back pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Specifically, on April 12, 2016, the Commissioner issued a decision finding that the ALJ in Pugliese's case \"erroneously interpreted N.J.S.A. 18A:6-14.\" He found that because our decision remanded, but did not dismiss, the tenure charges as part of the appeal process, Pugliese was not entitled to back pay under N.J.S.A. 18A:6-14. He noted that our \"reversal and remand of these proceedings did not re-trigger the 120-day rule because there is no mechanism for such contained within N.J.S.A. 18A:6-14.\" He further found that the February 15, 2013 arbitration award constituted a final decision terminating Pugliese's right to back pay under the statute because \"there [was] a determination by an arbitrator sustaining the tenure charges on the original hearing[. Therefore,] the tenured employee is no longer entitled to full pay under the 120-day provision in N.J.S.A. 18A:6-14, which is consistent with the result of final Commissioner decisions and the [statute's] Legislative intent....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 11, 2016, the Commissioner issued a final decision, adopting the ALJ's decision in Chavez's case and dismissing his appeal. The Commissioner again relied upon the fact that, in our opinion, we did not dismiss the charges. According to the Commissioner, our decision\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   did not trigger the reinstatement of ... [Chavez] with full pay as of the time of [his] suspension pursuant to N.J.S.A. 18A:6-14 ; rather the matter was remanded as a part of ... [Chavez's] appeal process.... As a result, ... [Chavez] is not entitled to the restoration of his pay under N.J.S.A. 18A:6-14 for the period from the 121st day of his suspension until [the a]rbitrator ... issued his second decision on March 17, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On appeal from the Commissioner's final decisions denying their requests for back pay until the arbitration decision on remand, Pugliese and Chavez argue that the legislative history of N.J.S.A. 18A:6-14 and the statute's purpose support their claims for back pay. We find merit to this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Our role in reviewing an administrative agency's final decision is limited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    In re Stallworth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151881\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/208/182/#p194\">\n    208 N.J. 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 194,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151881\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/208/182/#p194\">\n    26 A.3d 1059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011).

Pugliese's right to compensation will continue to the same date if we affirm the arbitrator's last determination. If we vacate and reverse that determination, under the statute, Pugliese will be entitled to full pay from the date of her suspension to date.
