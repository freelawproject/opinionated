This appeal presents us with a profusion of such nuances. The appellant, Davon Wallace, was convicted by a jury, presided over by Judge Lawrence V. Hill, Jr., of second-degree depraved heart murder and two related firearm counts. On this appeal, he contends:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   1. The lower court erred by denying the motion to suppress an incriminating statement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   2. The lower court erred by ruling that Mr. Wallace had no meritorious reason for discharging counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   3. The State failed to present sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction for second degree murder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   4. The lower court erred by allowing the jury to consider the charge of second degree felony murder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   5. The commitment record improperly reflects that Mr. Wallace was convicted of first degree murder, a crime of which Mr. Wallace was acquitted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    The Attachment Of The Sixth Amendment Right To Counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The killing of three-year-old Knijah Bibb, which the appellant does not contest, took place on August 10, 2014. On that day, the appellant immediately arranged for John McKenna, Esq. to represent him as his privately retained defense counsel. Mr. McKenna informed Prince George's County prosecutors that the appellant would turn himself in on August 12, 2014. On that date, however, the appellant failed to appear. A manhunt ensued. The appellant was located in the District of Columbia on September 16, 2014. He was transported to the Metropolitan Police Department and was there interrogated by detectives from Prince George's County. The appellant, on a taped audio/video recording, provided information linking him to the shooting of Knijah Bibb.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The appellant's first contention is that because that police interview was conducted without the appellant's attorney having been present, it violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel and should, therefore, have been suppressed. We are going to respond to the contention expressly in the terms in which the appellant has framed it. There is no challenge to the statement based on common law voluntariness. There is no challenge to the statement based on\n   <em>\n    Miranda v. Arizona\n   </em>\n   or on the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. There is no challenge pursuant to Maryland constitutional law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This contention is based exclusively on the Sixth Amendment and on nothing else.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Under those circumstances, it is 'passing strange that nowhere in the appellant's brief are we told that he was indicted by the Grand Jury for Prince George's County on November 18, 2014. That, of course, was the red letter day on which the appellant was graduated from the ranks of the\n   <em>\n    hoi polloi\n   </em>\n   of ordinary personhood and assumed the honorific title of \"the accused\" for special Sixth Amendment status.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   An indictment\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   , of course, might not have been indispensable for such status. It could, alternatively, have been conferred by the filing of a criminal information by the State's Attorney, but it was not. This Court went to great lengths to explain this Sixth Amendment investiture ceremony in\n   <em>\n    In re Darryl P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674025\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/211/112/#p176\">\n    211 Md.

On August 10, 2014, to be sure, the police filed a Statement of Charges with a District Court Commissioner, charging the appellant with murder and asking for an arrest warrant. The Commissioner signed the Statement of Charges and issued the arrest warrant. That, however, was a preliminary investigative function and not a formal commitment to prosecution. The appellant was not yet in custody and would not be in custody for more than another month. A formal commitment to prosecute can only be made 1) by the Grand Jury, by filing an indictment; 2) by the State's Attorney, by filing a criminal information; or 3) in rarer cases, by the filing\n   of the ultimate pleading, the official document on which a defendant could be tried in a lower court proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As the Supreme Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Kirby v.

He did not become an \"accused\" until he was indicted on November 18, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    The Distinction Between Being An \"Accused\" And Being At A \"Critical Stage\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The appellant here is nonetheless obsessed with the issue of whether the police's taking of a statement from him on September 26, 2014, was a \"critical stage.\" It may have been, but that alone, to the appellant's chagrin, would not confer on him a Sixth Amendment right to counsel. In focusing as he does, the appellant is looking only at the second step of a two-step attachment process. He completely ignores the indispensable and antecedent first step. Even an \"accused\" does not enjoy the cloak of the Sixth Amendment at every stage of his post-indictment life. He\n   must be ensnared in a \"critical stage\" of the prosecution for his Sixth Amendment right to counsel to click in. Being \"accused\" is not enough. You must be an \"accused\" who is also at a \"critical stage.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Conversely, being at a \"critical stage\" is not enough, unless you also qualify as \"the accused.\" Those who do not yet qualify for Sixth Amendment coverage do not acquire such coverage simply by being at a \"critical stage.\" The Supreme Court created this difference but we explained the difference in\n   <em>\n    Wood v.

The flaw in the appellant's argument is that the police could not have violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel on September 26, 2014, because the appellant had no Sixth Amendment right to counsel on that date. He would not acquire such a right until seven and one-half weeks later, when he was indicted by the Prince George's County Grand Jury.

When on the morning of the scheduled trial, November 14, 2016, the appellant asked permission to discharge his lawyer, the appellant had been represented by that lawyer for essentially two years. The appellant's complaints about the infrequency of their communications were not new. As Judge Hill probed insistently for some explanation as to why the appellant had waited until the morning of the trial to bring his complaint before the court, the appellant could offer no cogent explanation.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   THE COURT: What I'm saying is his appearance has been in the case since November of 2014, October, November, 2014, almost two years to the date. He has been representing you for two years. During the course of that time there have been several trial dates.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Why are you waiting until two years later, why are you waiting until your third or fourth trial date before you are asking that he not represent you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: They have been continued, and me and my family we were working on getting me a lawyer, and things of that nature. We were working on getting me a private attorney, and things of that nature. Plus it is like I can't get in contact with him to, you know, to tell him how I feel. Friday he came to see me and I told him Friday, but he said I would have to see you and here I am.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   THE COURT: But you are not really answering my question. My question, again, is he has been representing you for two years, 24 months.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   THE COURT: Why are you waiting until the 24th month to want to fire him, essentially? Why didn't you fire him after six months? Eight months? 12 months? Why are you waiting until, again, your third or fourth scheduled trial date?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The appellant's primary reason for not having brought the matter to the attention of the court seemed to have been wrapped up in his unrealistic hopes of obtaining a private attorney.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: I really didn't think I would have him this long. I thought I would have my private attorney by now.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   THE COURT: You have had two years to hire a private attorney and you haven't.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: I have been working on it, too.

The \"large argument over the\n   jury instruction\" to which the appellant refers spanned almost 50 pages in the transcript.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   One might as readily move for a judgment of acquittal on the basis of \"all of the arguments that have been made in the course of this long and hotly contested trial.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rule 4-324(a) is more earthbound\n   than that. The objection that the State's evidence was not legally sufficient to support a verdict of second-degree murder has not been preserved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    The Essential Pluralism Of Criminal Homicide\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Under the appellant's more ethereal and open-ended notion of issue preservation, some interesting, if vexing, questions might have been before us. The appellant's present argument would not have prevailed, however, even if it had been preserved. For the appellant to contend, as he now does, that the evidence was not legally sufficient to support a conviction for second-degree depraved heart murder is by no means to contend that the evidence was not legally sufficient to support a conviction for second-degree murder generally. The appellant obviously thinks about murder much too narrowly and too parochially.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Many crimes are widely embracing enough to be perpetrated by different modalities just as they may be explained by alternative and different theories of guilt. Such breadth of the core crime, however, does not fragment each different modality or each different theory of guilt into a different crime requiring distinct pleadings and yielding distinct verdicts. In a case of theft, for instance, the unlawful conversion of the victim's property may be effectuated by force or by stealth or by deceit or even by the receiving of stolen goods. That diversity, however, does not create separate crimes. It simply represents different ways of being guilty of the same indivisible crime of theft.\n   <em>\n    Rice v.

The appellant retreated from the scene, commandeered a loaded handgun from the car of a close friend, and returned immediately to 6915 Forest Terrace, hell-bent on retaliation and waving the gun as he approached. Once at the house, he fired six shots at the second story room that was Rashad's bedroom and in which the appellant then believed Rashad and his friend would still be found. Five of the bullets pierced the wall and ended up in the bedroom. A sixth bullet ricocheted off. One of the bullets killed the victim. The appellant's homicidal agency was undisputed.

The Fifth Amendment, for instance, is a long compound sentence embracing no fewer than five constitutional rights. At the top of the sentence, however, is a single word that is the subject of the entire sentence-\"person.\" One becomes a person no later than the moment of one's birth. One remains a person until the moment of one's death. As long as one is a card-carrying member of\n    <em>\n     homo sapiens\n    </em>\n    , one enjoys the entire package of Fifth Amendment constitutional rights.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    The Sixth Amendment, by contrast, is an even longer sentence, embracing seven separate constitutional rights. At the top of the sentence is the subject of the entire Amendment right. One must qualify for the honorific \"accused\" by a meticulously prescribed rite of passage.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    The best insight into the Sixth Amendment is gleaned by contrasting it with the Fifth Amendment. A Sixth Amendment right has a much shorter shelf life than has a Fifth Amendment right. The Fifth Amendment is a package of life-long rights. The Sixth Amendment is a package of trial rights.
