We do not prejudge future cases nor make any broad pronouncement about the trend.

He pleaded not guilty and was tried upon an agreed statement of facts in the Circuit Court for Worcester County. In this Court, as below, Thomas challenges the legal sufficiency of the facts to support a manslaughter conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Thomas is a user and seller of heroin. When arrested at his home, Thomas was in possession of 60 white wax paper bags containing heroin. Each bag was stamped \"Banshee\" in blue with a blue emblem. Thomas volunteered to police that he used about 12 of these bags of heroin per day or about three shots a day of four bags each. Thomas admitted that out of the 60 bags he had recently obtained from his supplier, he would sell about 30, for $10-15 each, and keep the rest for personal use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On the night and early morning hours of June 25-26, 2015, Thomas received 28 phone calls-only one call was answered-and\n   several text messages from Colton Lee Maltrey, a user of heroin to whom he had previously sold. Maltrey sought to purchase $30 worth of heroin and Thomas sold him four bags.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Later that morning, Maltry was found dead of an apparent heroin overdose in the bathroom of his mother's house. With his body, police discovered four empty, white\n   wax paper bags stamped \"Banshee\" in blue with a blue emblem. Police also found a prescription pill bottle with the label torn off that contained six 50-milligram tramadol pills,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   which police theorized that Maltrey had stolen from his mother. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner opined that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Colton Lee Maltrey died of alcohol and narcotic (free morphine ) intoxication. The manner of death could not be determined. Autopsy detected increased levels of alcohol and a drug (free morphine ) in the heart blood of the deceased.... The deceased had been consuming alcoholic beverages and heroin (a drug) prior to death. Postmortem testing for additional drugs was negative.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Thomas was convicted of heroin distribution, manslaughter, and reckless endangerment. He was sentenced to a twenty-year term for distribution and a concurrent 10-year term for manslaughter. As noted above, in this timely appeal, Thomas\n   challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his manslaughter conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, \"the duty of the appellate court is only to determine 'whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.' \"\n   <em>\n    Chisum v.

On the one hand, one would have to live under a rock-and we do not-to miss the evils that the distribution of drugs causes for our State and Nation. On the other hand, the test isn't whether the unlawful act-here drug distribution-has bad or even deadly effects. Rather the question is whether drug distribution is prohibited by all civilized societies. We know that it is not. We know, for example, that other drugs, with similar effects and similar risks to those caused by heroin, are routinely prescribed by doctors and sold by pharmacists.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md. Code, Criminal Law \u00a7 5-501 (\"Dispensing of certain substances listed in Schedule II\"); Corey S. Davis &amp; Derek H.

We know that alcohol has different properties, but is, in all respects, another drug with its own deleterious and addictive consequences\n   if abused, but which the State chooses to regulate but not prohibit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md. Code, Alcoholic Beverages \u00a7\u00a7 1-201\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . Moreover, we know that the lines between lawful and unlawful conduct are changing: recent changes in drug laws have transformed marijuana sales from a serious crime to a growth industry, licensed by states and required to pay taxes.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , COLO. CONST. ART. 18, \u00a7 16 (\"Personal use and regulation of marijuana\"). There are places in our world where drug use is treated as a public health problem rather than a criminal problem and, as a result, the distribution of even heroin in those places is highly regulated but not absolutely prohibited.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   We need not reach this question in Thomas's case.\n   Instead, our decision here rests on the requirement of legal causation.

Later, at another time, in another place, Maltrey injected himself with an amount of heroin that he chose. He used it in conjunction with alcohol, which may have intensified the effect. In such a circumstance, we hold that the State failed to establish a\n   causal connection between Thomas's sale of heroin and Maltrey's death. It is not impossible to imagine scenarios in which there will be a sufficient causal connection between the sale of heroin and the victim's death to satisfy this element of the unlawful act variant of involuntary manslaughter. There are cases in other jurisdictions, for example, where the defendant determined the dose and\n   personally injected the victim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Powell v.

Such facts might well satisfy the causal connection requirement.

There is no reason to infer the necessary state of\n   mind from the ordinary transaction. Rather, we can infer the opposite-that a drug dealer wishes for his customers to remain alive so that he may sell them more heroin. Moreover, because low-level dealers are often themselves users and addicts, as Thomas is, they have no rational interest in making the conduct more dangerous. It is also worth noting that, if we were to consider every sale of heroin to be gross negligence, it reduces criminal liability down to a matter of mere fortuity. We do not apportion criminal liability for manslaughter merely because of bad luck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The State's brief, however, identifies five facts, which together it says support the conclusion that Thomas acted in a grossly negligent manner toward Maltrey: (1) that the amount of heroin contained in the four bags constituted a lethal dose;\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) that Thomas knew Maltrey was an addict; (3) that Maltrey was young and less experienced than Thomas; (4) that Thomas was aware of the dangers of heroin use; and (5) that the circumstances of the sale-in the middle of the night, after Maltrey's multiple, frantic attempts to contact Thomas-were \"weird.\" We hold as a matter of law that these facts, if believed, are evidence of simple negligence, not the sort of gross negligence necessary to sustain a conviction for involuntary manslaughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Moreover, as we described above, there must be a direct causal connection between the grossly negligent act and the victim's death. Here, the facts do not support the necessary causal link.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We do not wish for this Opinion to be misunderstood. Thomas committed a serious crime and for it received a long sentence of incarceration. That was not challenged and we do not doubt its correctness. Nor do we say necessarily that drug dealers categorically cannot be liable for involuntary manslaughter\n   when their customers die. We say only that the facts of this case do not legally support the conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WORCESTER COUNTY REVERSED AS TO MANSLAUGHTER ONLY.

Murphy's classic discussion of involuntary manslaughter, he described three categories:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n    Involuntary manslaughter at common law has been generally defined as the killing of another unintentionally and without malice (1) in doing some unlawful act not amounting to a felony, or (2) in negligently doing some act lawful in itself, or (3) by the negligent omission to perform a legal duty. To this basic definition other authorities add the qualification, as to the first class of involuntary manslaughter, that the unlawful act be\n    <em>\n     malum in se\n    </em>\n    , and not merely\n    <em>\n     malum prohibitum\n    </em>\n    , and as to the second and third classes of the offense, that the negligence be criminally culpable,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , that it be gross.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    <em>\n     State v. Gibson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2331302\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/4/236/#p242\">\n     4 Md. App. 236\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 242,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=242%20A.2d%20575\">\n     242 A.2d 575\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1968) (internal citations omitted). Modern sources frequently combine the second and third categories into a single category regarding grossly negligent acts.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions , 4:17.9\n    <em>\n     Homicide-Involuntary Manslaughter (Grossly Negligent Act and Unlawful Act)\n    </em>\n    (2017) (\"MPJI-Cr\"). Thomas also argues that there is space between these two categories and that he cannot be criminally liable for the grossly negligent conduct of an unlawful act. This makes no sense as a matter of logic but also as a matter of policy. Why should a really bad or sloppy miscreant avoid liability when a good one doesn't? Instead, we think this is another example of what Judge Moylan calls the \"semantic fallacy of the false affirmative,\" Moylan's Criminal Homicide 232, wherein which the phrase \"lawful act,\" intended only to distinguish from \"unlawful act\" is attempted to be transformed into a new element of the crime.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    This Court recently reaffirmed\n    <em>\n     Schlossman\n    </em>\n    and held that unlawful act manslaughter need not be dangerous to life, but merely\n    <em>\n     malum in se\n    </em>\n    , to support a conviction for the unlawful act variant of involuntary manslaughter.\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4260235\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/223/128/#p153\">\n     223 Md.
