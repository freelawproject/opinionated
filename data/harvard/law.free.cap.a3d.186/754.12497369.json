On appeal, the defendant claims that the court abused its discretion in so doing. We agree and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The plaintiff commenced this summary process action against the defendant on October 22, 2014. In its complaint, the plaintiff alleged that the parties entered into an oral lease agreement in February, 2011, regarding real property located at 560 North Washington Avenue in Bridgeport (property) owned by the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleged that the agreement was for the term of one year and obligated the defendant to pay it \"$70,000 in a lump sum and $20,000 in a lump sum in August, 2012.\" The complaint further alleged that the defendant had failed to make those payments in accordance with the oral\n   agreement. On November 6, 2014, the defendant filed an answer, in which it denied the substance of the plaintiff's allegations. More specifically, the defendant alleged that the parties had entered\n   into a written lease agreement on August 18, 2010, for a term of ninety-eight years. The defendant further claimed that the payment schedule alleged in the plaintiff's complaint \"does not conform to the terms of the written lease agreement.\" The defendant also raised three special defenses, all of which pertained to remediation of the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On November 20, 2014, the defendant filed an amended answer and special defenses, wherein it pleaded, in addition to the aforementioned allegations, that \"[d]eductions in rent have not been credited contrary to prior agreement\" of the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 5, 2015, the defendant filed a motion to transfer the matter from the Housing Session to the regular docket of the Superior Court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 24-21, asserting that \"good defenses exist in this matter,\" including estoppel, unconscionability, and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. That motion further stated that the defendant \"wishes to utilize the discovery process. The defendant wishes to be able to exercise [its] right to a trial by jury. And the defendant wishes to preserve [its] right to the appellate process, all of which may be had by the granting of this motion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   While the motion to transfer was pending, the court scheduled a trial for February 13, 2015. On January 29, 2015, the defendant filed a motion for a continuance\n   with the consent of the plaintiff due to ongoing discussions between the parties about a possible resolution to the dispute. That motion was granted, and a new trial date was set for March 13, 2015. On February 11, 2015, the defendant filed a second motion for a continuance with the consent of the plaintiff because the parties were \"negotiating a settlement.\" That motion was granted, and a new trial date was set for March 27, 2015. On March 10, 2015, the defendant filed a third motion for a continuance with the consent of the plaintiff because the parties were \"discussing resolution\" of their dispute. That motion was granted, and a new trial date was set for May 1, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 30, 2015, the plaintiff filed an objection to the defendant's motion to transfer. In its objection, the plaintiff argued that transfer was unnecessary because \"the Housing Session is a full service branch of the Superior Court and is completely and fully equipped and competent to handle such a matter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The court held a hearing on the defendant's motion to transfer on May 1, 2015. At that hearing, the defendant argued that this case involved a lengthy \"lease option agreement [whose] purpose ... was to ... allow [the defendant] to purchase the property while not assuming liability for ground contamination to the property ....\" The defendant emphasized that \"there are a lot of complicated issues in\n   which [the defendant had] a lot of back and forth with the [plaintiff]. A lot of problems concerning the property in which [the defendant] relied on or understood that certain amounts of [its] investment in the property would be credited toward [its] back rent. [The defendant has] invested in excess of a million dollars into the property.... [G]iven the issues involved here, we feel this would be more properly transferred to the regular civil docket.\" In response, the plaintiff again argued that \"this Housing Session is capable of resolving all issues that we have\n   ....\" Significantly, the plaintiff at that time stated that \"if [the defendant] wants depositions, notice them, we'll be there. If [the defendant] wants discovery, file them, we'll answer the questions.... If [the defendant] needs time to do certain things, I'll give [it] the time [it] needs.... If [it] wants to do depositions, I'll give [it] whatever time [it] needs. If [it] wants to file interrogatories ... file them. We'll answer them. Not a problem.\" The court then denied the defendant's motion to transfer and the proceeding adjourned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   That afternoon, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint in which it acknowledged the existence of a written agreement, as first alleged by the defendant in its original answer filed almost six months earlier. That amended complaint alleged that the defendant, on August 18, 2010, entered into a written lease agreement (agreement) regarding the property. Appended to that pleading was a copy of the agreement signed by both parties. Pursuant thereto, the defendant agreed to pay the sum of $300,000 in four installments in exchange for a lease of ninety-eight years, as well as an option to purchase. An initial payment of $20,000 was due \"[a]t the [c]losing\"; a second payment of $10,000 was due two months after the date of the closing; $70,000 was due six months after the date of closing; and $200,000 was due twelve months after the date of closing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint further alleged that although the defendant \"uses and occupies the [property] as agreed in the [agreement],\" it had failed to make the payments specified therein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 4, 2015, the defendant filed an answer to the plaintiff's amended complaint, in which it denied that it had failed to make the required payments. Rather,\n   the defendant alleged that \"[r]ent was paid in the form of\n   <em>\n    agreed upon\n   </em>\n   repairs, cleanup, and/or improvements to the property.\" (Emphasis added.) The defendant at that time also raised eight special defenses that primarily concerned the defendant's allegations of \"ground contamination\" on the property that necessitated remediation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court thereafter scheduled a trial for May 15, 2015. On May 11, 2015, the defendant filed a motion for a continuance with the consent of the plaintiff because \"the parties have agreed to a sixty day continuance for completion of discovery.\" That motion was granted, and a new trial date was set for June 19, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 15, 2015, the defendant filed a motion for a continuance with the consent of the plaintiff. In that motion, the defendant's counsel, Attorney Robin H. Lasky, indicated that the reason for the request was that discovery was not complete. As Lasky stated: \"My client has been unavailable traveling out of state for\n   the last two weeks. I have not yet received a response to my request for production which the [plaintiff's] attorney has asked me to anticipate receiving this week. The plaintiff has agreed to a continuance until July 17, 2015, and I humbly request the court grant this motion so that I may have sufficient time to review requested [materials] and confer further with my client.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court denied that request on June 15, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 17, 2015, Lasky filed a motion to withdraw his appearance due to \"a breakdown in communication\" with his client and an \"[i]rreconcilable disagreement as to the best legal strategy ....\" The court held a hearing on June 19, 2015, at which it heard from Lasky and Femi Olowosoyo, the owner and principal of the defendant. At that time, Olowosoyo communicated his displeasure with Lasky and requested a continuance of eight weeks to enable him to secure new counsel. In response, the plaintiff's attorney stated that he \"would like the case to be set down for July 17. I think that's more than enough time for this gentleman to get a lawyer. You can go out the door and knock a tree and knock six lawyers out of the tree with a stick for a case.\" When the plaintiff's counsel then remarked that \"the case has been pending since October of 2014,\" Olowosoyo stated: \"I've never asked for any time to find an attorney, Your Honor. This is the first time I'm asking, and I'm hoping that the court will find it reasonable enough to grant [the request] ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The court granted a continuance, albeit one four weeks less than Olowosoyo had requested. As it stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"I'm going to grant the continuance request. I'm going to grant the motion of [Lasky] to withdraw and give you the opportunity to hire a new lawyer. But let me be very clear about this ... you need to have an attorney because you can't represent your [limited liability company]. On July 17, [2015], which is ... when this case is scheduled next, if you're not here with an attorney, then a default can enter against you, and [y]our company will lose the case because you cannot represent [the defendant] ....\" Olowosoyo confirmed that he understood the court's directive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The court then scheduled the case for trial on July 17, 2015. On that date, Olowosoyo appeared before the court without counsel. The plaintiff's attorney at that time informed the court that Olowosoyo \"did have a lawyer here today but he would not enter an appearance on [the defendant's] behalf.\" Accordingly, the plaintiff asked the court to render a default judgment. The court then addressed Olowosoyo, stating: \"Sir, I've had a conversation with you in the past. I'm really not even permitted to allow you to address the court because you're not an attorney and you're not a defendant or a litigant in this case. And today's date was a final date, so a default will enter with regard to the [defendant].\" With that, the proceeding adjourned. Later that day, the court issued a notice that the defendant had been defaulted for failure to appear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Six days later, Attorney David E. Dobin of the law firm of Cohen and Wolf, P.C., filed an appearance on behalf of the defendant. At that time, the defendant commenced an appeal from the default judgment with this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On August 7, 2015, the defendant filed with the trial court a motion to open the default judgment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   which\n   alleged that reasonable cause and good defenses to the plaintiff's action existed, as specified in the defendant's May 4, 2015 answer and special defenses. The defendant further alleged that \"between June 19, 2015, the date [Lasky] withdrew his appearance, and July 17, 2015, the date of [the default judgment], defendant was diligent in searching for replacement counsel. Indeed, by June 22, 2015, defendant had dropped off the file related to this case with Attorney Brendan O'Rourke, who held onto the file for several weeks before telling defendant,\n   <em>\n    for the first time\n   </em>\n   , on July 16, 2015-one day before the scheduled trial date-that he would attend court with defendant but\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   file an appearance, severely prejudicing the defendant.\" (Emphasis in original.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A sworn affidavit from Olowosoyo accompanied the defendant's motion to open the default judgment, in which Olowosoyo affirmed that he was the owner and president of the defendant. Olowosoyo stated in relevant part that the property \"was in a dilapidated condition and the [p]laintiff was interested in the [d]efendant's rehabilitation of the [property].... [B]oth before and after the execution of the [agreement], representatives of the [p]laintiff, including Bill Finch, Bill Coleman, and Max Perez represented to me that expenditures made to improve the [property] including cleaning up the [property] prior to execution of the [agreement] and fixing damage to the [property] caused by a tornado, would be credited towards the rent due under the [agreement], that real property taxes would be abated for [eight] years and that additional amounts spent by [d]efendant to repair the tornado damage would be credited towards future transactions between [the parties]. In reliance on those representations, [d]efendant did not pay the rent that that [agreement] states was due .... In further reliance on the [p]laintiff's representations, since 2010, [d]efendant has incurred approximately $2 million in expenses in improving the [property].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   With respect to his efforts to secure legal counsel, Olowosoyo stated in the affidavit that he first spoke with O'Rourke on June 19, 2015, and \"dropped off the file at [his] office\" on June 22, 2015. The affidavit states that Olowosoyo thereafter spoke with O'Rourke on several occasions about the case, and that O'Rourke informed him\n   that O'Rourke had \"reached out\" to the plaintiff's counsel on the defendant's behalf and \"was waiting to hear back.\" Olowosoyo then stated that \"[o]n July 16, I spoke with [O'Rourke]. The [p]laintiff's counsel called him while he was on the phone with me to discuss the case. [O'Rourke] called me back to let me know that the case was going to go forward the next day and for the first time, told me that he would only be able to go with me to court as an advisor, that he wouldn't be able to enter an appearance because that would hurt my case as he was not prepared and he was afraid the judge might not grant [a] continuance.... On July 17, [O'Rourke] attended court with me. However, he did not file an appearance on that date and the court that day entered a default judgment for failure to appear.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The court heard argument on the motion to open on August 10, 2015. At that time, the plaintiff's counsel, Attorney Russell D. Liskov, confirmed that O'Rourke had in fact appeared at the courthouse with Olowosoyo on July 17, 2015. As Liskov stated: \"He came and spoke to me to try and negotiate with me, but I wasn't negotiating with him without an appearance in the file.\" When his negotiation attempts proved unsuccessful, Liskov stated, O'Rourke \"left before you opened court ....\" Those representations are consistent with Liskov's statement at the outset of the July 17, 2015 proceeding that Olowosoyo \"did have a lawyer here today but he would not enter an appearance on [the defendant's] behalf.\" In support of the motion to open the default judgment, the defendant's counsel reiterated the efforts\n   made by Olowosoyo to secure legal counsel for the July 17, 2015 proceeding, as well as the defendant's position that reasonable cause existed for the nonappearance of counsel and that good defenses existed to the plaintiff's claims. When that hearing concluded, the court summarily denied the motion to open. The relevant portion of the August 10, 2015 judgment file states only that \"[t]he court, having heard the parties, finds the issues for the plaintiff.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On September 21, 2015, the defendant filed a notice requesting a statement of decision by the trial court. The record before us does not contain any response to that request. The defendant thereafter filed a motion for articulation with the trial court, in which it asked the court to articulate \"the factual and/or legal basis for its August 10, 2015 [judgment] ... denying the defendant's motion to open default. Without said articulation, an adequate record for appellate review cannot be provided by the [defendant] ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   By order dated December 14, 2016, the trial court summarily denied that request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In response, the defendant filed a motion for review with this court, in which it sought an articulation of the court's August 10, 2015 oral decision denying the motion to open. On March 27, 2017, this court granted that motion and ordered the trial court to \"articulate the factual and legal bases for its August 10, 2015 order denying the defendant's motion to open the judgment upon default.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On April 24, 2017, the trial court issued its articulation. It stated: \"This is a summary process matter that\n   commenced\n   [on] October 22, 2014. The matter was assigned an unusually high number of seven trial dates. On the sixth date, Mr. Olowosoyo relieved his attorney of his representation and the defendant was given approximately four weeks to July 17, 2015, to obtain new counsel. The defendant was admonished that a default would enter if attorney representation wasn't achieved by July 17. On July 17, 2015, the defendant appeared sans counsel. This is a commercial eviction with a corporate defendant, and Mr. Olowosoyo could not represent the commercial tenant. A default and judgment of possession entered. On July 23 an appeal was filed. On August 7, 2015, a motion to open was filed, and the motion was denied after a hearing on August 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"The motion for articulation requests an articulation regarding the denial of the motion to open based on factual and legal basis. The trial court is vested with discretion to 'determine whether there is a good and compelling reason for its modification or vacation.' ...\n   <em>\n    Mazziotti\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Allstate Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1613364\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/240/799/#p809\">\n    240 Conn. 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 809,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=695%20A.2d%201010\">\n    695 A.2d 1010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997). Practice Book \u00a7 17-43 states that a motion to open must allege [that] a good defense exists and that the defendant was prevented by mistake, accident or other reasonable cause from appearing. The court finds that that situation did not exist here. The court finds that the motion to open was denied due to the dilatory delays of the defendant. This is a summary process action for nonpayment of rent that commenced on October 22, 2014. An amended answer with special defenses was filed on May 4, 2015. This matter has had numerous continuances and delays. The defendant was notified on June 19, 2015, that the July 17, 2015 trial date was a final date and of the consequences that would follow if he did not obtain attorney representation. The assertion that Mr. Olowosoyo had an attorney on July 17 who did not enter an appearance does not\n   comply with the court's June 19, 2015 order. Nor does the assertion create a situation where he is prevented by mistake, accident or other reasonable cause from appearing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As a preliminary matter, we address the plaintiff's assertion at oral argument before this court that the present appeal is moot. The following undisputed facts are relevant to that contention. Following the commencement of this appeal, the plaintiff filed a motion to terminate the automatic appellate stay, claiming that the appeal was frivolous and taken only for the purpose of delay. The trial court granted that motion over the defendant's objection, and the defendant did not file a motion for review of that order pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 66-6. The plaintiff then filed an application for an execution for possession, which the trial court clerk issued on November 2, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This court subsequently ordered the parties to submit simultaneous memoranda of law addressing \"whether the defendant is still in possession of the property and, if not, whether the appeal has become moot as a result of the defendant vacating the property.\" The parties complied with that order and, in their respective memoranda, acknowledged that the defendant had been evicted from the property and no longer was in possession thereof.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties nevertheless disagreed as to whether that\n   development rendered the present appeal moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On March 27, 2017, this court declined to dismiss the defendant's appeal on the ground of mootness. Rather, we marked the matter \"off without prejudice to the\n   parties briefing the mootness issue in their briefs on the merits.\" In their subsequent appellate briefs, neither the plaintiff nor the defendant addressed the issue of mootness. Nevertheless, at oral argument before this court on January 16, 2018, the plaintiff's counsel remarked, at the very end of his argument, that the present appeal was moot. In response, the defendant's counsel began his rebuttal by noting that the plaintiff's mootness argument was a \"surprise\" to him since that issue had not been briefed by the parties. The defendant's counsel then reiterated his position, originally set forth in the defendant's March 17, 2017 memorandum of law to this court, that the general rule of mootness does not apply because adverse collateral consequences result from the judgment of possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We normally decline to review claims asserted for the first time at oral argument, as it is well established that \"claims on appeal must be adequately briefed, and cannot be raised for the first time at oral argument before the reviewing court.\"\n   <em>\n    Grimm\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Grimm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3991217\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/276/377/#p393\">\n    276 Conn. 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 393,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=886%20A.2d%20391\">\n    886 A.2d 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=547%20U.S.%201148\">\n    547 U.S. 1148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=126%20S.%20Ct.%202296\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=164%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20815\">\n    164 L.Ed. 2d 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006) ;\n   <em>\n    Fairfield Merrittview Ltd.

For example, the original complaint claimed that the parties had entered into an \"oral\" agreement for the lease of the property in \"February, 2011.\" As the defendant pointed out in its November 6, 2014 answer and as confirmed in the agreement appended to the plaintiff's May 1, 2015 amended complaint, the parties actually entered into a written agreement on August 18,\n   2010. Moreover, the payment schedule alleged in the original complaint does not accurately reflect that contained in the parties' written agreement. Although the defendant immediately apprised the plaintiff of those fundamental defects in its complaint, the plaintiff did not amend its pleading until six months later on May 1, 2015. By contrast, the defendant filed its answer to the plaintiff's original complaint fifteen days after that complaint was filed, and filed its answer to the amended complaint three days after it was filed by the plaintiff. Unlike the plaintiff, therefore, the defendant cannot \"be accused of delinquency in [its] pleadings.\"\n   <em>\n    Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Connecticut, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gurski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1066802\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/49/731/#p737\">\n    49 Conn.

Moreover, at no time in these proceedings has the plaintiff offered any \"justification for [its] delay ... in moving to amend the complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Ruggiero\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pellicci\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5768841\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/294/473/#p478\">\n    294 Conn. 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 478,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=987%20A.2d%20339\">\n    987 A.2d 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). The record demonstrates, in unequivocal fashion, that a one-half year delay was occasioned by the plaintiff's failure to amend its complaint in a prompt manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In addition, we note that, on January 5, 2015, the defendant filed a motion to transfer the case to the regular docket of the Superior Court, claiming that \"good defenses exist in this matter\" and that the defendant wished to \"utilize the discovery process\" and \"exercise [its] right to a trial by jury.\" The plaintiff did not file an objection to that request until almost four months later on April 30, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Once again, the plaintiff offered no justification\n   or explanation for its delay in responding to the defendant's motion to transfer. The court ultimately denied the defendant's motion to transfer on May 1, 2015-only seventy-eight days prior to entry of the default judgment in this case.\n   Perhaps most astounding is the fact that, during that seventy-eight day period, the plaintiff agreed to afford the defendant a sixty day window to conduct discovery. At the May 1, 2015 hearing on the motion to transfer, the defendant had emphasized \"the complexities of the case\" and claimed that the present dispute was not \"a traditional eviction matter\" because \"[g]ood defenses exist.\" In response, the plaintiff submitted that \"[t]his Housing Session is capable of resolving all issues that we have .... You are a full service court and you're a Superior Court judge.\" The plaintiff then invited the defendant to conduct discovery and expressly indicated its acquiescence thereto. As Liskov stated, \"[i]f [the defendant] wants discovery, file them, we'll answer the questions. ... If [the defendant] needs time to do certain things,\n   <em>\n    I'll give\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    it\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    the time\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    it\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    needs\n   </em>\n   .... If [\n   <em>\n    it\n   </em>\n   ] wants to do depositions,\n   <em>\n    I'll give\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    it\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    whatever time\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    it\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    needs\n   </em>\n   . If [\n   <em>\n    it\n   </em>\n   ] wants to file interrogatories ... file them. We'll answer them. Not a problem.\" (Emphasis added.) As reflected in the May 14, 2015 continuance request, the plaintiff thereafter \"agreed to a sixty day continuance for completion of discovery.\" Although the court granted that continuance on May 14, 2015, the record contains no explanation as to why a trial was scheduled only thirty-six days later on June 19, 2015. In any event, the record indicates that, in May, 2015, the plaintiff agreed to postpone proceedings in this case to permit the defendant to conduct discovery until the middle of July, 2015. It bears repeating that the default judgment at issue in this appeal was rendered on July 17, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The record further indicates that the defendant did, in fact, conduct discovery during that period. The defendant served a request for admissions on the plaintiff; the plaintiff's answers thereto were filed with the court on June 15, 2015. On May 28, 2015, the defendant served a request for production of documents on the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The plaintiff filed its \"responses/objections\" to that request with the court on June 16, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Furthermore, the record reflects that\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   motion for a continuance in this case was filed by the defendant with the consent of the plaintiff. As the judgment file that was filed with this court on August 21, 2015, notes, \"[s]cheduled trials for the case on February 13, March 13, March 27, May 1 and May 15 were continued with the consent of all parties.\" Counsel for the defendant likewise stated at the hearing on the motion to open that those continuances all \"were consented to continuances\" and \"were agreed to because there [were] continuing negotiations between the parties.\" The present case thus resembles\n   <em>\n    Stevenson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Peerless Industries, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2219110\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/72/601/#p610\">\n    72 Conn.

It nevertheless contends that the record does not support the court's finding that the defendant's failure to do so was for dilatory purposes. On the particular circumstances of this case, we agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   At the June 19, 2015 proceeding, the court granted a continuance to afford the defendant the opportunity to\n   secure new legal counsel. In the affidavit submitted with the defendant's motion to open, Olowosoyo averred that later on the day of June 19, 2015, he spoke with two attorneys, O'Rourke and Kevin Ahern, regarding legal representation for the defendant, and left a message for another, Attorney Edwin Farrow. Olowosoyo stated that he \"dropped off the case file at [O'Rourke's] office\" three days later and thereafter spoke with O'Rourke on multiple occasions about the case, with O'Rourke informing him that he had \"reached out\" to the plaintiff's counsel on the defendant's behalf and \"was waiting to hear back.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Olowosoyo then stated \"[o]n July 16, I spoke with [O'Rourke]. The [p]laintiff's counsel called him while he was on the phone with me to discuss the case. [O'Rourke] called me back to let me know that the case was going to go forward the next day and for the first time, told me that he would only be able to go with me to court as an advisor, that he wouldn't be able to enter an appearance because that would hurt my case as he was not prepared and he was afraid the judge might not grant [a] continuance. On July 17, [O'Rourke] attended court with me. However, he did not file an appearance on that date and the court that day entered a default judgment for failure to appear.\" (Footnote added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   At the hearing on the motion to open, the plaintiff's counsel confirmed the accuracy of those latter affirmations. Liskov informed the court that O'Rourke had in fact appeared at the courthouse with Olowosoyo on July 17, 2015. As Liskov stated: \"He came and spoke to me to try and negotiate with me, but I wasn't negotiating with him without an appearance in the file.\" When his negotiation attempts proved unsuccessful, Liskov stated, O'Rourke \"left before you opened court ....\" Those representations are consistent with Liskov's\n   statement at the outset of the July 17, 2015 proceeding that Olowosoyo \"did have a lawyer here today but he would not enter an appearance on his behalf.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Although it is undisputed that the defendant did not appear with legal counsel at the July 17, 2015 proceeding, it is equally undisputed that Olowosoyo took steps to secure legal counsel for the defendant and that counsel did in fact appear at the courthouse on July 17, 2015, at which time counsel attempted to negotiate with the plaintiff on the defendant's behalf. Under those particular circumstances, and in light of the entire procedural history of this case as documented in the record before us, we conclude that the court's finding that the defendant had engaged in purely dilatory delays is clearly erroneous. A six month delay at the outset of this litigation was occasioned by\n   <em>\n    the plaintiff's\n   </em>\n   failure to promptly amend its patently defective complaint, and the plaintiff did not file its objection to the defendant's January 5, 2015 motion to transfer until nearly four months later. A mere seventy-eight days passed between the filing of the plaintiff's amended complaint on May 1, 2015, and the entry of the default judgment. Moreover, the plaintiff, on May 14, 2015, agreed to a sixty day period of discovery, and discovery thereafter was conducted between\n   the parties. In such circumstances, the defendant's conduct cannot be described as dilatory in nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In its articulation, the court also found that no reasonable cause existed for the defendant's failure to appear with counsel at the July 17, 2015 proceeding. The defendant claims, and we agree, that the court's finding is clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Significantly, this is not a case in which the defendant was notified of the withdrawal of its legal counsel and \"the necessity of procuring substitute counsel\" but thereafter \"did nothing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    Testa\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Carrolls Hamburger System, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1578021\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/154/294/#p300\">\n    154 Conn. 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 300,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=224%20A.2d%20739\">\n    224 A.2d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966).

Approximately one month earlier, this court granted Dobin's motion to withdraw the appearance of Cohen and Wolf, P.C.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Appended to the plaintiff's memorandum of law was an affidavit from Liskov, in which he indicated that the plaintiff enforced that execution of ejectment through service of process by a city sheriff in November, 2015, at which time the plaintiff \"took possession of the premises in question.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    In that regard, we note the defendant's ancillary contention that, as a collateral consequence of the trial court decision, it will be deprived of any recourse for the \"substantial monetary investment\" it allegedly has made in the property if this appeal is dismissed as moot. In its March 16, 2017 memorandum of law to this court, the plaintiff noted that \"the only relief that [the plaintiff] sought and received was possession of the property.\" In response, the defendant argues that \"what is obviously at stake in this case is considerably more than just the adverse effect ordinarily suffered by a tenant in an eviction action where the tenant is merely deprived solely of the right to occupy the leased property. Here, the substantial sums advanced by [the defendant] in improving the [property] created legitimate, investment-backed, business expectations on the part of the defendant ... of which the defendant stands to be deprived, without any fair opportunity to be heard, should this appeal be dismissed as moot.\" Should this court reverse the judgment of the trial court denying its motion to open, the defendant argues, it then would have the opportunity to have those allegations decided on their merits. Such allegations were pleaded in the defendant's answers and special defenses to the plaintiff's original and amended complaints. See footnotes 2 and 4 of this opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    In its answer to the amended complaint, the defendant alleged that payments required under the agreement were made \"in the form of agreed upon repairs, cleanup, and/or improvements to the property.\" In both its special defenses and its motion to open, the defendant further alleged that it had made substantial investments in accordance therewith. In his affidavit appended to the defendant's motion to open, Olowosoyo stated that \"[i]n further reliance on the [p]laintiff's representations, since 2010, [d]efendant has incurred approximately $2 million in expenses in improving the [property] ....\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    The record before us also indicates that although payments of $70,000 and $200,000 were due under \u00a7 4.1 (c) and (d) of the agreement in February and August, 2011, respectively, the plaintiff made no demand for payment until 2014. For that reason, Olowosoyo stated in his affidavit appended to the motion to open that \"[a]lthough the [agreement] states that rent was due ... in February 2011 and August 2011, the plaintiff, consistent with [its assurances to the defendant], did not attempt to enforce the rent and tax terms of the [agreement] until a [n]otice of [d]efault was sent in January 2014 ....\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    \"Dilatory\" is defined as \"tending or intended to cause delay\" and \"characterized by procrastination.\" Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th Ed. 2003) p. 350. It frequently is utilized to describe deliberate conduct on the part of a litigant to delay or obstruct a court proceeding.
