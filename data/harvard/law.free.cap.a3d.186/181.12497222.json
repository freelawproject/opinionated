The Circuit Court for Charles County, sitting as a juvenile court, found S.K. involved in the offenses of distribution of child pornography and displaying an obscene item to a minor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm the\n   juvenile court's finding on distribution of child pornography because we conclude that: (1) S.K. was a \"subject\" of the video; (2) the law contains no exception applicable when the juvenile is both the subject and distributor of the pornographic material; and (3) S.K.'s conduct is not protected by the First Amendment. We vacate the finding that S.K. was involved in displaying an obscene item to a minor because the statute, which expressly delineates the forms of media it covers, does not cover an electronically-transmitted digital video file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   S.K. sent the digital file at issue to A.T., another 16-year-old girl, and K.S., a 17-year-old boy. A.T. and K.S. each received the video and viewed at least part of it. The three then-friends, who regularly exchanged \"silly\" videos and attempted to \"outdo\" one another, trusted each other to keep\n   these group messages private. Two months later, after the three had a falling out, K.S. and A.T. reported the incident to, and shared a copy of the video with, Officer Eugene Caballero of the Charles County Sheriff's Office, their school resource officer. Officer Caballero met with S.K., who acknowledged having sent the video to K.S. and A.T. S.K. expressed concern to Officer Caballero that other people had seen the video because, according to both S.K. and A.T., K.S. had by that time shared the video with other students.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The State charged S.K. with (1) filming a minor engaging in sexual conduct in violation of \u00a7 11-207(a)(2) of the Criminal Law Article (2012 Repl.), (2) distributing child pornography in violation of \u00a7 11-207(a)(4) of the Criminal Law Article, and (3) displaying an obscene item to a minor in violation of \u00a7 11-203(b)(1)(ii) of the Criminal Law Article.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the adjudicatory hearing, after taking testimony from A.T., K.S., and Officer Caballero and viewing the video, the juvenile court granted S.K.'s motion for acquittal as to the offense of filming a minor engaged in sexual conduct, but found S.K. involved in distributing child pornography and displaying an obscene item to a minor. In a subsequent disposition hearing, the court found S.K. to be delinquent and placed her on probation with several conditions, including that she undergo a psychiatric evaluation. S.K. appeals those findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We apply the same evidentiary standard in juvenile delinquency cases that we apply in criminal cases.\n   <em>\n    In re Elrich S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695397\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/416/15/#p30\">\n    416 Md. 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 30,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695397\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/416/15/#p30\">\n    5 A.3d 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). \"[T]he judgment of the [trial court] will not be set aside on the evidence unless clearly erroneous and due regard will be given to the opportunity of\n   the [trial] court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\"\n   <em>\n    Brownv.

THE JUVENILE COURT DID NOT ERR IN FINDING S.K. INVOLVED IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF CHILD PORNOGRAPHY .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As relevant here, \u00a7 11-207(a)(4)(i) prohibits a \"person\" from knowingly distributing \"any matter, visual representation, or performance ... that depicts a minor engaged as a subject in ... sexual conduct.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   S.K. argues that her conduct does not fall within the prohibition of this statute both because she was not a \"subject\" of the video and because the provision's legislative history suggests that it was not intended to cover the distribution by a minor of material depicting his or her own consensual sexual conduct. Based on the plain language of the statute, neither of these arguments has merit. We also reject S.K.'s contention that her conduct is protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

According to S.K., \"subject,\" in the context of this statute, means \"a minor who is unable to lawfully consent to sexual relations or who is forced to engage in sexual conduct\n   against his or her will.\" Because she consented to the sexual conduct depicted, she argues, the statute is not implicated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State contends that \"subject\" instead means a person or thing of concern, and that S.K. was a \"subject\" of the video because she was featured in it.

The full definition (1) of \"subject\" is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   1: one that is placed under authority or control: such as\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   a : VASSAL\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   b (1) : one subject to a monarch and governed by the monarch's law (2) : one who lives in the territory of, enjoys the protection of, and owes allegiance to a sovereign power or state\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Merriam-Webster (online)\n   </em>\n   , \"subject,\" available at https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/subject (last visited May 30, 2018).

In each of these definitions, \"subject\" is tied to the concept of being under the political authority of a sovereign power. Reading that meaning into \u00a7 11-207(a) would produce absurd results.

To adopt S.K.'s argument would require us to read a non-existent exemption into the statute's unambiguous text. That is not our role.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v.

(ii) that consists of an obscene picture of a nude or partially nude figure.\" The statute defines \"item\" to mean a \"(i) still picture or photograph; (ii) book, pocket book, pamphlet, or magazine; (iii) videodisc, videotape, video game, film, or computer disc; or (iv) recorded telephone message.\" Crim. Law \u00a7 11-203(a)(4).

We find this argument without merit. The plain language of the statute prohibits any \"person\" from displaying an \"item\" \"to a minor.\" Crim. Law \u00a7 11-203(b)(1). For purposes of the Criminal Law Article, a minor-defined as \"an individual under the age of 18 years,\" Crim. Law \u00a7 1-101(g) -is clearly a \"person,\" defined to include \"an individual,\" Crim. Law \u00a7 1-101(h).

Law \u00a7 11-203(a)(4)(iii). The State argues that that the digital video file is a \"film,\" for purposes of this statute, because a common dictionary definition of \"film\" is \"motion picture,\" which the State interprets as covering any set of moving images. S.K., appearing to accept that \"film\" means \"motion picture,\" argues that a one-minute digital video file is nonetheless not a \"motion picture\" because it is not \"a movie, the type available to the public in theaters.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   We interpret \"film\" for purposes of this statute differently from either party. \"Film\" has two potentially-relevant common dictionary definitions when used as a noun. The first is, in essence, film as a medium on which images or videos can be stored: \"a thin flexible strip of plastic or other material coated with light-sensitive emulsion for exposure in a camera, used to\n   produce photographs or motion pictures.\"\n   <em>\n    New Oxford American Dictionary\n   </em>\n   , \"film,\" at 646;\n   <em>\n    see also Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary\n   </em>\n   , \"film,\" at 468 (\"a thin sheet of cellulose acetate or nitrocellulose coated with a radiation-sensitive emulsion for taking photographs\");\n   <em>\n    The American Heritage Dictionary\n   </em>\n   , \"film,\" at 658 (\"A thin sheet or strip of flexible material, such as a cellulose derivative or a thermoplastic resin, coated with a photosensitive emulsion and used to make photographic negatives or transparencies\");\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   , \"film,\" at 850 (2002) (\"a thin flexible transparent\n   sheet of cellulose acetate, cellulose nitrate, or other plastic material that is used for taking photographs and that is coated with a light-sensitive emulsion which when exposed and developed contains negative or positive images in black silver or in color\"). The second definition is \"a motion picture; a movie[.]\"\n   <em>\n    New Oxford American Dictionary\n   </em>\n   , \"film,\" at 646;\n   <em>\n    see also Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary\n   </em>\n   , \"film,\" at 468 (\"motion picture\");\n   <em>\n    The American Heritage Dictionary\n   </em>\n   , \"film,\" at 658 (\"A movie, especially one recorded on film\");\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   , \"film,\" at 850 (\"motion picture\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Although each of these definitions might be viable if \"film\" appeared in the statute by itself, that is not the case. Instead, \"film\" is paired within its category with the terms \"videodisc,\" \"videotape,\" \"video game,\" and \"computer disc,\" and so we must interpret it in that context.\n   <em>\n    Bey\n   </em>\n   , 452 Md. at 266,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489352,12314772\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/452/255/\">\n    156 A.3d 873\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We ... do not read statutory language in a vacuum, nor do we confine strictly our interpretation of a statute's plain language to the isolated section alone.\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694575\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/415/413/#p421\">\n    415 Md. at 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694575\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/415/413/#p421\">\n    2 A.3d 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   For two reasons, we conclude that \"film,\" listed as part of this grouping, could only be a reference to film as a physical medium that can contain content, and not as a video itself. First, three of the four other items in the list (\"videodisc,\" \"videotape,\" and \"computer disc\") unambiguously refer only to other types of physical media, not to content that might be placed on such media. And although \"video game,\" if it appeared independently, could refer to either a type of physical media or a particular form of content, \"the commonsense canon of\n   <em>\n    noscitur a sociis\n   </em>\n   ... counsels that a word is given more precise content by the neighboring words with which it is associated.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674164\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/285/\">\n    553 U.S. at 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674164\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/285/\">\n    128 S.Ct. 1830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, construing \"film\" to refer to a \"motion picture,\" at least as broadly as the State interprets that term, would render nearly or entirely superfluous the terms \"videodisc\" and \"videotape.\" When possible, we avoid any interpretation of a statute that would render any of its language superfluous.\n   <em>\n    Md.

We thus conclude that the plain meaning of \"film,\" in the context of this statute, refers to that particular type of media, on which photographs or videos can be produced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The legislative history of \u00a7 11-203 confirms our plain language interpretation. Prior to 1995, former \u00a7 419 of Article 27 of the Maryland Code, the predecessor to \u00a7 11-203, prohibited only \"engag[ing] in the business of selling, showing, advertising for sale, or distributing to a [minor] ... any still picture, photograph, book, pocket book, pamphlet, magazine, video disc, video tape, or recorded telephone message.\" In 1995, the General Assembly amended the statute both (1) to include \"film\" and \"computer disc\" within the existing list of media that could not be distributed and (2) to extend the reach of the statute to the display or exhibition of the items, even if not for \"business.\" 1995 Md. Laws, ch. 133.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The bill file includes\n   numerous\n   references indicating that both \"film\" and \"computer disc\" were understood at that time as being references to forms of media, not content. For example, the Fiscal Note for Chapter 133 observed that it \"add[ed] films and computer discs\n   <em>\n    to the list of media\n   </em>\n   by which pornography may not be conveyed to minors.\" Md. Dep't of Fiscal Servs., Fiscal Note, S.B. 21, at 1 (1995) (emphasis added). And the Judiciary Committee's Bill Analysis included identical language, and also noted separately that the bill would \"add[ ] film and computer discs to the\n   <em>\n    types of prohibited media\n   </em>\n   .\" Judiciary Comm., B.
