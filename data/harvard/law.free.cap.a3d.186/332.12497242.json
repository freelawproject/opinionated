Although anticipated changes in Plan Design affecting the Contract make the question more difficult than it might otherwise appear, we conclude the bid substantially deviated from a material, non-waivable price term in the Solicitation and thus reverse the decision of the Acting Director of the Division of Purchase and Property and order the Contract rebid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Incumbent vendor Express Scripts, Inc., challenges the Acting Director's final agency decision sustaining the Division's award of a three-year contract for Pharmacy Benefit Management to OptumRx, Inc., based on its \"reasonable cost Quote totaling $6,692,234,901.\" The award was the result of an innovative, expedited procurement, specifically authorized by legislation designed to permit the State to secure technical assistance to run an online, automated, reverse auction to select a pharmacy benefits manager or PBM to administer the self-insured, prescription drug plans for the approximately 835,000 active employees, retirees and dependents participating in the State Health Benefits Plan (SHBP) and the School Employees' Health Benefits Plan (SEHBP).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    L.\n   </em>\n   2016,\n   <em>\n    c.\n   </em>\n   67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The State's Bid Solicitation sought a PBM that could provide\n   \"integrated Retail, 90-day Retail,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specialty\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Mail Order Drug management\" and corresponding pharmacy networks \"sufficiently accessible to Plan Members\" with the \"financial capabilities and contractual arrangements with Participating Pharmacies and Pharmaceutical Manufacturers to support a commitment to deliver quality and lowest net cost pharmacy services.\" The Solicitation established the State's expectation that the successful bidder be, among other things, \"[c]ost effective and transparent by\n   quoting competitive, guaranteed Ingredient Cost Discounts,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Administrative Fees\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Rebates,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   practicing effective Pharmacy Benefits\n   Management,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and agreeing to be held accountable through Performance Standards and Financial Guarantees.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This expedited procurement had its genesis in the State's efforts to address the health and sustainability of the State's pension and health care benefits programs, specifically\n   <em>\n    L.\n   </em>\n   2011,\n   <em>\n    c.\n   </em>\n   78. Chapter 78, among other things, created a Plan Design Committee in both the SHBP and the SEHBP, each made up of an equal number of members appointed by the governor and by the public employee unions with the responsibility for the design of the various health plans offered by each program, including those for prescription drug benefits, with \"the authority to create, modify, or terminate any plan or component, at its sole discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    L.\n   </em>\n   2011,\n   <em>\n    c.\n   </em>\n   78, \u00a7\u00a7 45 and 46 (amending N.J.S.A. 52:14-17.27 and N.J.S.A. 52:14-17.46.3 ).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosenstein v.

The union members on the Committee proposed the online automated reverse auction concept for PBM services as an alternative means of capturing savings in the\n   State's prescription drug plans. The unions projected that procuring a new PBM through a reverse auction could save the State as much as $200 million a year. The State projects the annual savings from the contract awarded to Optum will be\n   more than double that amount. Indeed the State contends on the first page of its merits brief that this contract will result \"in $1.6 billion in savings to the SHBP and SEHBP over the term of the new [three-year] contract, as compared to the old contract.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The State's prescription drug plans are self-insured, meaning the State pays for all of the drugs as well as the costs of administering the plans. It uses a pharmacy benefits manager to manage the plans and control the State's costs by negotiating with drug manufacturers and wholesalers as well as with a network of retail, mail and specialty pharmacies to provide members the greatest access to effective medications at the most competitive pricing. The online reverse auction concept was proposed as a way to evaluate the projected costs of competing PBM proposals to the State, all of which have different drug and network discount arrangements, in order to achieve savings in drug costs and PBM services instead of through benefit cuts to employees, retirees and their dependents.\n   <em>\n    The Legislation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On November 3, 2016, Senator Sweeney introduced\n   <em>\n    S. 2749\n   </em>\n   (2016), a bill providing for the expedited procurement of a pharmacy benefits manager, as well as technical assistance to evaluate the qualifications of bidders in that procurement and electronic review of invoiced PBM pharmacy claims.

The Director shall make a prompt decision taking all such information into account, and shall notify the contractor of the compensation to be paid for such work effort.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Reading Sections 5.18 (Change in Plan Design) and 5.4 (Change Order) of the Bid Solicitation in conjunction with Section 5.5 (Change in Law) of the Standard Terms and Conditions makes the following points clear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   First, the State reserved unto itself the right to make any change to the design of its prescription drug plans during the term of the Contract, and, in the case of substantial change to the plans or creation of new plans, to separately secure services from another Vendor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Second, although the parties must meet to discuss any changes the State makes to its plans during the term of the Contract, and any needed Change Orders that might flow from them, no Change Order will become effective until reduced to writing and signed by both parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Third, there will be no change to the Administrative Fee, that is, the \"all-inclusive monthly fee\" for PBM services, which \"multiplied by the number of participating public employees/retirees\" makes up the Vendor's \"monthly compensation,\" when Plan Design changes require only changes in the Vendor's claim administration and related systems or a change to an open enrollment\n   period or additional communications with Network Providers or reissuance of Identification Cards to members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   And fourth, although the parties will engage in negotiations for a change to the Administrative Fee for plan changes requiring additional work or more substantial changes to the Vendor's systems, the Director ultimately decides whether the Administrative Fee is to be adjusted and, if so, by how much.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Although not addressed in Section 5.18 governing Plan Design changes, there is another provision of the Solicitation addressing the effect of Plan Design changes on pricing. Section 4.4.5.2 of the Bid Solicitation, \"\n   <em>\n    Price Sheet/Schedule Attachment Instructions\n   </em>\n   ,\" in Section 4, \"\n   <em>\n    Quote {Proposal} Preparation and Submission\n   </em>\n   ,\" provides in part that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   The PBM shall not make any modification or adjustment to the pricing set forth herein without the prior written consent of the State, except as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   A. Upon a Plan Design change enacted by the State; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   B. Such Plan Design change has a material negative impact on Rebates earned (i.e., a ten percent (10%) or greater reduction in Rebates earned) (collectively, a \"Pricing Adjustment Trigger\"). If a Pricing Adjustment Trigger occurs, any adjustment shall be limited to an adjustment that is solely necessary to return PBM to its contracted economic position prior to the State making the Plan Design change that resulted in the Pricing Adjustment Trigger.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Thus, in contrast to the Solicitation's treatment of substantial Plan Design changes on adjustment of the Administrative Fee, which it leaves in the hands of the Director, changes resulting in a ten percent or greater reduction in the PBM's\n   earned Rebates result in an automatic adjustment under the Solicitation to return the parties to their contracted economic positions. We note that besides the lack of any reference to Section 4.4.5.2 in Section 5.18, neither \"Rebates earned\" nor \"Price Adjustment Trigger\" is a defined term in the Bid Solicitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Further, Section 4.4.5.2 appears to conflict with Section 5.4, governing amendments to the Contract, as it permits a modification or adjustment of the Financial Contracted Terms without a writing signed by the parties. If so, Section 5.1 of the Bid Solicitation, \"\n   <em>\n    Precedence of Special Contractual Terms and Condi\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    tions\n   </em>\n   ,\" provides that Section 5 rather than Section 4 controls interpretation. As neither the Acting Director in his decision nor any of the parties in their briefs to this court relied on Section 4.4.5.2 or even called it to our attention in the context of a Plan Design change, we do not have the benefit of their interpretation of this provision or its significance for the Contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The parties agree, however, that Rebates, and not Administrative Fees, are one of the largest drivers of PBM pricing, which makes this critical provision's placement in a section of the Solicitation instructing bidders on how to fill out their pricing proposals, and the State's failure to include or even reference it in Section 5.18, perplexing. The PBM's main sources of profit are its retention of a portion of any manufacturer Rebates it receives for Specialty and Brand Drugs, its revenue from negotiated discounts and its generic pricing spreads, all of which are included in the Vendor's guaranteed pricing, which, along with the Administrative Fee, make up the Financial Contracted Terms\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   it is obligated to keep \"in effect for the entire Blanket P.O. {Contract} period\" pursuant to Section 3.7.1 of the Bid Solicitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   If we attempt to read Sections 4.4.5.2, 5.18 and 5.4 of the Bid Solicitation in conjunction with Section 5.5 of the Standard Terms and Conditions as we would any contract, \"as a whole, without artificial emphasis on one section, with a consequent disregard for others,\"\n   <em>\n    Borough of Princeton v.

That is, no change is permitted to the Administrative Fee for \"insubstantial\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   changes to the Plans pursuant to Section 5.18 and, change to the other pricing components is permitted under Section 4.4.5.2 only if the design change has resulted in at least a ten percent reduction in Rebates earned. The difference being that the State ultimately controls any adjustment in the Administrative Fee under Section 5.18, while Section 4.4.5.2 permits an automatic adjustment without consent of the State once a Pricing Adjustment Trigger has occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    The Questions and Answers\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Pursuant to the power provided by the Legislature to expedite the procurement, the Division allotted only a one week period for questions from potential bidders about the terms of the Solicitation, during which it received 182 questions. Four of those questions related to Section 5.18, at least one of which, question 174, was from\n   Optum. Those questions and the answers provided by the Procurement Bureau on May 30, 2017, are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-65\"><strong>#</strong> <strong>Page</strong> <strong>RFP Section</strong> <strong>Question (Bolded)</strong> and Answer <strong>#</strong> <strong>Reference</strong> 115 127 Section <strong>Can DPB [Division of Pensions and</strong> 5.18 (Change <strong>Benefits] provide historical information</strong> in Plan <strong>on the frequency of Plan Design changes</strong> Design) <strong>and, of such changes, how frequently</strong> <strong>have they been significant enough to</strong> <strong>justify a change in the Administrative</strong> <strong>Fee?</strong> Historically, Plan Design changes have generally occurred on an annual basis. They have rarely been significant enough to justify a change in the Administrative Fee. 116 128 Section <strong>In the PBM industry, some changes made</strong> 5.18 (Change <strong>by clients such as DPB only affect a</strong> in Plan <strong>handful of medications but could have</strong> Design) <strong>large impacts on rebates. For example,</strong> <strong>if DPB decided to exclude all brand</strong> <strong>medications in a certain therapeutic</strong> <strong>category which were heavily rebated,</strong> <strong>rebate guarantees would need to be</strong> <strong>modified. Can the State confirm that in</strong> <strong>a situation like described here, the</strong> <strong>State would engage in negotiations on an</strong> <strong>item like rebate guarantees?</strong> The State acknowledges that Plan Design changes that exclude certain Brand Drugs will impact Rebate Guarantees.

Accordingly, taking all three answers into account, should the State choose to carve out certain Specialty Drugs for dispensing at a Retail Pharmacy, the parties will work together to preserve the existing financial terms of the Contract but, pursuant to Section 5.4 of the State Standard Terms, it will be the Director who ultimately decides the adjustment necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    Submission of Proposals\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   On the June 12, 2017 proposal submission date, the Division received proposals from Express Scripts, Optum and Caremark PCS Health, LLC. Optum's proposal included the following statement at the center of this appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   OptumRx accepts all terms and conditions of this bid with the following additional language:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   ? Section 5.18-Agree, as it applies to changes that impact administrative fees as outlined in this provision, provided that Vendor reserves the right to modify Financial Contracted Terms based on changes by the State in formulary or any carve out of services set forth in the Agreement, including but not limited to Specialty Pharmacy services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Evaluation Committee, comprised of representatives from the Division of Pensions and Benefits, the New Jersey Education Association and the Procurement Bureau, evaluated each proposal against the requirements of the RFP. Finding that \"all Bidders submitted proposals\n   which conformed to the requests and requirements of the RFP,\" the Committee pre-qualified all three bidders to participate in the Reverse Auction. As explained by the Acting Director, \"[f]ollowing prequalification, price was the only factor to consider as the purpose of a Reverse Auction is to benefit from the bidders reducing their pricing over rounds [of] bidding.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Following a mandatory training in the use of the \"TruBid\" Reverse Auction Tool, all three bidders participated in the first round auction from June 14 to 19, 2017, by submitting their proposed pricing for Administrative Fees, Ingredient Cost Discount Guarantees and Rebate Guarantees using Truveris' automated\n   online software program. Using 2016 actual claims data submitted by the State, Truveris applied a set of trend assumptions based on historic utilization of generic, brand and specialty drugs in the SHBP/SEHBP and an inflation forecast for each drug classification to re-price a sample set of claims in order to create a three-year forecast of SHBP/SEHBP prescription drug costs to the State based on each bidder's price terms. Following the first round, Express Scripts was the low bidder, with a projected price of $6,806,207,205.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   For the second round, conducted from June 22 to 25, 2017, Truveris updated its baseline estimates by applying 2017 contract extension discounts and rebates to the 2016 claims and the bidders updated their price proposals. After tabulating the results of the second round, Optum was declared the low bidder, with a projected price of $6,692,234,901. Express Scripts had the highest bid of the second round, with a projected price of $6,780,344,652. Truveris characterized the bid by Express Scripts as having \"[i]mproved slightly\" in the second round \"with all improvements coming from increased rebate guarantees,\" in contrast to Optum's bid, which Truveris concluded made \"[s]ignificant improvements coming from both improved ingredient cost discounts and improved rebates.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    The Bid Protest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Based on the unanimous vote of the Evaluation Committee, the Division of Purchase and Property on June 29, 2017, announced its intent to award the Contract to Optum, and that the protest period would end the following morning at 9:00 a.m. Express Scripts objected, noting \"the vendors have received nothing more than a bar chart indicating the relative position of the bidders after round two,\" and arguing it was \"patently unreasonable to shorten the protest period to less than a 24-hour period in a multi-billion dollar procurement.\" The Division denied Express Scripts' request to extend the protest period, relying on the ability granted it by the Legislature in Chapter 67 \"to the extent necessary, [to] waive or modify any other law or regulation that may interfere with the expeditious procurement of these services,\" and noting it\n   was \"in the process of providing\" counsel with the documents requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   After receiving \"over 650 pages of materials\" from the Division \"[b]etween approximately 9:00 and 9:30 a.m. on June 30,\" Express Scripts filed its bid protest by the Division's extended noon deadline, requesting a stay of the Contract award and the right to supplement its protest upon receipt of documents still not provided. The Acting Director of the Division issued a final decision the same day sustaining the Division's decision to award the contract to Optum and denying Express Scripts' request for a stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Thereafter, Express Scripts sought additional documents, including the forms submitted by the bidders. On July 5, 2017, the Division provided Express Scripts with that information as well as an outline of\n   the trend assumptions Truveris used in the Reverse Auction Tool. That same day, Express Scripts filed an application for permission to file an emergent motion with this court, which it withdrew after the Division granted it the opportunity to file a supplemental bid protest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The following day, Express Scripts filed a supplemental bid protest and renewed its request for a stay of the Contract award, asserting three reasons Optum's bid should have been rejected: 1) Optum took a material exception to Section 5.18 \"by unilaterally reserving the right to adjust the Financial Contracted Terms,\" 2) the State failed to confirm that Optum \"had the mandated Security, Disaster Recovery and Contingency Plans,\" and 3) the State's \"calculation of estimated bid price was apparently based on undisclosed pricing figures\" and the assumptions the State did disclose \"appear[ed] inaccurate.\" The next day, July 7, 2017, the Acting Director issued a supplemental final agency decision rejecting Express Scripts' bid protest, sustaining the Division's notice of intent to award the contract to Optum and denying the request for a stay. The Acting Director found Optum's proposal was \"responsive to the requirements of the RFP and there is no material deviation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    The Acting Director's Final Decision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Turning first to Express Scripts' claim that Optum's reservation of the right to modify the Financial Contracted Terms was a material deviation from Section 5.18, the Acting Director explained that all potential bidders were put on notice by the Division's answers to the four questions relating to Section 5.18,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   that [the] State fully expects to negotiate all pricing and financial guarantees prior to the implementation of any plan design changes. Specifically, the State rejected [Optum's] proposed modification to the RFP which would permit a Contractor to change pricing any time there is State initiated change to the plan specifications, including the benefit plan, formulary, network etc.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Acting Director thus concluded that \"Optum's proposed reservation [in its proposal] was addressed and rejected during the Questions and Answer Period.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Director went on to explain that \"[i]mportantly, the RFP addresses the situation where a Bidder's proposed language may not conform to the specified requirements of the solicitation.\" Relying on Bid Specification Section 4.0, \"\n   <em>\n    Quote {Proposal} Preparation and Submission\n   </em>\n   ,\" the Director noted \"the RFP advises Bidders that if a proposed term or condition conflicts with the RFP, or diminishes the State's rights under any Contract, that term will be considered null and void.\" Section 4.1, as quoted by the Director, provides in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   Quotes {Proposals} including Vendor {Bidder} proposed terms and conditions may be accepted, but\n   <em>\n    Vendor {Bidder} proposed terms or conditions that conflict with those contained in the Bid Solicitation {RFP} as defined in Section 2.0 of this Bid Solicitation {RFP}, or that diminish the State's rights under any Blanket P.O. {Contract} resulting from the Bid Solicitation {RFP}, will be considered null and void\n   </em>\n   . The State is not responsible for identifying conflicting Vendor {Bidder} proposed terms and conditions before issuing a Blanket P.O. {Contract} award. It is incumbent upon the Vendor {Bidder} to identify and remove its conflicting proposed terms and conditions prior to Quote {Proposal} submission. In the event that a Vendor {Bidder} intends to propose terms and conditions contrary to the Bid Solicitation {RFP}, these Vendor {Bidder} proposed terms and conditions shall only be considered if submitted\n   pursuant to the procedure set forth in Section 1.3.1 of this Bid Solicitation {RFP}. Vendors {Bidders} shall not submit exceptions on the \"Terms and Conditions\" Tab through NJSTART. Under no circumstance is the State required to accept a Vendor's {Bidder's} exception to the Bid Solicitation {RFP}.\n   In the event that prior to Notice of Intent to Award, the Division notifies the Vendor {Bidder} of any such conflicting Vendor {Bidder} proposed term or condition and the conflict it poses, the Division may require the Vendor {Bidder} to either withdraw it or withdraw its Quote {Proposal}.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   After award of Blanket P.O. {Contract}:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    if conflict arises between a Vendor {Bidder} proposed term or condition included in the Quote {Proposal} and a term or condition of Bid Solicitation {RFP}, the term or condition of the Bid Solicitation {RFP} will prevail\n   </em>\n   ; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   B. if the result of the application of a Vendor {Bidder} proposed term or condition included in the Quote {Proposal} would diminish the State's rights, the Vendor {Bidder} proposed term or condition will be considered null and void.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   [Emphasis is the Acting Director's.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Thus relying on Section 4.1, the Acting Director concluded \"[h]ere, to the extent that Optum's proposed reservation in response to RFP \u00a7 5.18 conflicts with a term of the RFP, the RFP terms prevail.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Acting Director further found, based on the order of precedence set forth in Section 5.1, \"\n   <em>\n    Precedence of Special Contractual Terms and Conditions\n   </em>\n   ,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   that \"the RFP, as amended by Bid Amendment[,] prevail[s] over ... Optum's submitted technical proposal.\" Addressing the materiality of the deviation, the Acting\n   Director concluded that \"Optum did not have an advantage over other Bidders by taking an exception to the mandatory terms of the RFP as those terms are not entitled to any effect. As such, there is no material deviation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The Acting Director also rejected Express Script's claim that the State failed to confirm Optum had complied with Section 3.12, which requires that \"[t]he Vendor {Contractor} must provide a detailed system design document showing Security Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan, Contingency Plan and Backup Plan.\" The Director began his analysis by noting the difference between Section 3.12, which applies to the \"Vendor {Contractor},\" that is, \"the Vendor {Bidder} awarded a Blanket P.O. {Contract} resulting from this Bid Solicitation\n   {RFP},\" and Section 4.4.3.3.4, \"\n   <em>\n    Plans Required by Bid Solicitation {RFP} Section 3.12\n   </em>\n   ,\" which requires only that \"[t]he Vendor {Bidder} shall provide its\n   <em>\n    draft\n   </em>\n   plans required by Section 3.12.\" (Emphasis is the Acting Director's.) Section 4.4.3.3.4 further provides \"[t]he plans should demonstrate to the Evaluation Committee that the Vendor {Bidder} understands the scope of work required for a successful implementation of the system, its operations and maintenance and support.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Acting Director further noted that during the question and answer period, a potential bidder asked, and the State agreed, that bidders could opt to have their draft plans available for review at their own facilities, instead of submitting them, \"[d]ue to the highly sensitive nature\" of disaster recovery and contingency plans. That question and the Division's response was incorporated into Addendum No. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In its proposal, Optum addressed the security plan required by Sections 3.12 and 4.4.3.3.4 as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     SECURITY PLAN AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 3.12.1\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   As allowed in the questions and answers provided to question 100 on May 30, 2017, we have responded with the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   Due to the sensitive nature of the information, our complete business continuity and disaster recovery plans are considered proprietary and confidential. For audit purposes, the plans may be viewed in a controlled environment with UnitedHealth Group subject matter experts available to answer questions. The plans may not be\n   copied or removed after the meeting. This policy is in place to protect not only UnitedHealth Group operations and employees, but also the security, integrity, and confidentiality of protected information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Optum addressed its disaster recovery and contingency plans in identical fashion, only adding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   An overview document is available, which describes the governance, strategy, and controls for the entire program. This document is not intended to replace the business continuity or disaster recovery plan review, but does provide the reassurance that UnitedHealth Group has a well-defined program in place to verify customer impact is minimized during a disaster.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   Proprietary and Confidential[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The Acting Director found that \"while Optum may not have included a detailed security plan within its Proposal, it did include a 'Data Storage and Tape Management Overview' document,\" in which it \"discussed the steps taken to ensure security, data protection, other controls, data center facilities, and encryption.\" He explained Optum marked that document as \"confidential and proprietary information,\" and \"it was redacted in whole at Optum's request in accordance with N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Acting Director thus noted that \"while the document was not produced to [Express Scripts], it was reviewed by the Evaluation Committee during its prequalification review of Optum's Proposal. The Committee concluded that the information disclosed demonstrated that Optum understood the security requirements of the RFP required for a successful implementation of the system.\" As a result, the Acting Director found that \"[c]ontrary to [Express Scripts'] assertion, Optum complied with the RFP requirement that the Bidder submit a\n   <em>\n    draft\n   </em>\n   plan that demonstrates to the Committee that the Bidder understands the scope of work required for a successful implementation of the system,\n   its operations and maintenance and support,\" and thus \"there was no deviation from the requirements of the RFP.\" (Emphasis is the Acting Director's.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Acting Director rejected as untimely Express Scripts' claim relating to the price assumptions Truveris applied in the Reverse Auction Tool, concluding that any protest relating to \"the assumptions and methodology used in the Reverse Auction Tool\" \"should\n   have been filed in connection with or in response to Solicitation # 17DPP00106\" awarded to Truveris in April 2017. Further, the Acting Director noted \"Truveris implemented the following assumptions provided by the [Division of Pensions and Benefits] into the Reverse Auction Tool:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   Generic Utilization: 1.5%\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   Brand Utilization: 1.5%\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   Specialty Utilization: 8%\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   Generic Inflation: 2.7%\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   Brand Inflation: 12%\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   Specialty Inflation: 13%.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The Acting Director maintained that \"[t]hese assumptions were the only assumptions utilized in the Reverse Auction Tool\" and that they were \"applied to all Bidders' inputted data. All other data, specialty, brand, generic classifications, utilized by the Reverse Auction Tool in projecting the proposed proposal pricing was input by the Bidder.\" He further noted, however, that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   While the assumptions utilized in the Reverse Auction Tool were in place prior to proposal submission and remained consistent throughout the two rounds of proposal price submission by the Bidders, in an effort to prevent Bidders from skewing their inputted data, and to ensure that the State received the most accurate information resulting [in] the best offer, the above assumptions were not provided to Bidders prior to proposal submission.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   He found that because \"[t]he evaluation methodology and the assumptions remained consistent throughout the evaluation process and throughout the two rounds of proposal price submission. ... neither Truveris nor the Bureau had the ability to manipulate the data to skew the respective position of the Bidders.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The Acting Director concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   Finally, simply because [Express Scripts] disagrees with the results of the Reverse Auction is no reason to set aside the Contract Award to Optum. ... The assumptions utilized in the Reverse Auction Tool did not result in a skewing of the respective Bidders nor did it result in an inaccurate depiction of the Bidders' proposals compared to one another as the assumptions applied to all of the Bidders.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   He further noted that \"even if there were errors in the assumptions used by Truveris to create the Reverse Auction Tool, those assumptions affect all Bidders, such that all Bidders remained on a level playing field,\" and \"even without utilizing these assumptions,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Express Scripts' proposal price was higher than both Caremark's and Optum's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The Acting Director also analyzed and rejected Express Scripts' request for a stay of the contract award to preserve the status quo applying the\n   <em>\n    Crowe\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   factors.

Explaining that \"[f]ailure to award the new Contract by June 30, 2017\" would prevent Optum from doing everything necessary \"to ensure that it can handle open enrollment of members in October 2017\" thereby jeopardizing \"the $1.6 billion in savings over the life of the new Contract,\" the Acting Director concluded \"[t]he State's and the public's interest in moving forward with the protest period, in order to satisfy the public purposes of the procurement, outweighs any of [Express Scripts'] legally cognizable interests.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <em>\n    Express Scripts' appeal and request for stay\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Express Scripts filed its appeal from the Acting Director's decision the day after it was issued and followed up with an emergent motion for a stay pending appeal.

We did, however, grant Express Scripts' subsequent motion to accelerate our consideration of the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Once the merits panel began its review in December, we found the appeal presented a closer question than we originally perceived. Oral argument on December 18, although helpful in understanding some of the complexities of the bid pricing, did not assuage our concern that Optum may have been awarded the Contract despite a material deviation in its bid. Although Express Scripts had not renewed its motion for stay, our reassessment of its likelihood of success on the merits and the looming January 1, 2018 Contract start date led us to conclude a stay was \"necessary in order to permit the court to consider appellant's challenge to the bid award without the risk of disruption we [had] avoided previously.\" Accordingly, on December 21, 2017, we entered, sua sponte, an order staying the Optum takeover scheduled for January 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The State immediately moved for emergent reconsideration, arguing a stay would result in \"extreme disruption\" owing to the active State employees bi-weekly pay group scheduled to switch over to Optum for their pharmacy benefits at midnight on Saturday December 23, in advance of the Contract start date, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services having already \"automatically terminated all SHBP/SEHBP Members from the [Express Scripts] Employer Group Waiver Plan,\" which \"could cause Medicare-eligible Members to have no Part D prescription drug coverage because Medicare has now approved the Optum plan.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   We entered an order on December 22, scheduling oral argument on the State's motion for reconsideration on December 26, but did not modify the stay. On December 23, Justice LaVecchia denied the State's request to file an emergent application in the Supreme\n   Court in light of our having scheduled argument on the motion,\n   but ordered the Clerk of the Court to forward to the panel the papers submitted to the Court on the emergent application \"especially as those papers address the applicants' claims of potential harm to new enrollee members,\" i.e., those new members who enrolled with Optum during the October 2017 open enrollment who were not previously enrolled with Express Scripts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   On December 24, the State and Optum advised us that despite our stay order and the Supreme Court having denied interim relief, Optum commenced performance as scheduled at midnight on December 23. After reviewing the parties' supplemental filings and hearing argument on December 26, we granted the State's motion for reconsideration and vacated our December 21 stay order. We did so in recognition of the \"significant, substantial steps in performance of the awarded contract\" taken by the State and Optum, but without \"condoning the[ir] conduct\" in commencing performance under the Contract, \"which was not consistent with the spirit of the stay we issued.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   We further made clear the \"order should not be interpreted as a reflection of the panel's ultimate consideration of the merits of [Express Scripts'] appeal.\" On December 27, the Court advised it would consider Express Scripts' motion for stay at its conference on January 9, 2018. The Court denied the motion on January 12 without opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <em>\n    The standards governing our review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Because this dispute arises in the context of a publicly bid contract, we approach the task of reviewing the Acting Director's decision rejecting Express Script's bid protest mindful that the\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   [b]idding statutes are for the benefit of the taxpayers and are construed as nearly as possible with sole reference to the public good.

Plan Design changes \"not contemplated by\" the RFP obviously posed a significant risk to potential bidders in this procurement. Although Section 4.4.5.2 permits the Vendor to adjust its pricing to return it to its \"contracted economic condition\" in the event Plan Design changes result in a ten percent or greater reduction in Rebates earned, the size of this Contract would suggest that Plan Design changes resulting in less than a ten percent reduction could still have a substantial effect on a PBM's profits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Similarly, although the State committed itself in the question and answer period to work with the Vendor to preserve the existing financial terms of the Contract in the event it chose to carve out certain Specialty Drugs to allow dispensing at a Retail Pharmacy, it refused a request to modify the term of the RFP permitting the State to, ultimately, unilaterally impose an adjusted Contract price in the event it reduced the scope of the work.

The State claimed Optum's additional language pulled together the different provisions of the RFP in which the State discussed the effect of Plan Design changes on pricing terms, such as Section 4.4.5.2 and the responses to the questions posed to Section 5.18, using the \"language of the Contract.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   The State argued because Optum employed the language of the Contract, its reservation of the right \"to modify Financial Contracted Terms\" had to be understood in the context of Section 5.4, the provision governing Change Orders, even though \"modify\" is\n   not a defined term and Optum nowhere referred to Section 5.4 in its additional language in response to Section 5.18. Because Section 5.4 provides that \"[a]ny changes or modifications to the terms of this Blanket P.O. {Contract}\n   shall be valid only when they have been reduced to writing and signed by the Vendor {Contractor} and the Director,\" the State contends Optum was not reserving a \"unilateral right\" to change the pricing in response to Plan Design changes, as alleged by Express Scripts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Instead, the State argued, Optum was only reserving the right to negotiate the various components of its pricing in accordance with Section 5.4 (with the exception of its Administrative Fee, any change to which Optum agreed was controlled by the procedure set forth in Section 5.18), \"based on changes by the State in formulary or any carve out of services set forth in the Agreement, including but not limited to Specialty Pharmacy services.\" Because the RFP contemplates the parties entering into a negotiated Change Order in response to Plan Design changes, the State argued, Optum's language, while not a precise match of that of the RFP, and thus strictly speaking a deviation, was not materially different and certainly not so different as to cause rejection of its bid under\n   <em>\n    River Vale\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   We have rejected already the argument that Optum's additional language \"reserv[ing] the right to modify Financial Contracted Terms\" could sensibly be read to mean that Optum was merely reserving the right to ask the State to enter into a Contract Amendment in the event it made changes to the Formulary or opted to reduce the scope of the work under the Contract. Even were we to accept that Optum was only reserving the right to negotiate a change to its pricing in those circumstances, the State's \"synthesis\" argument still fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   The problem is, as we read the Bid Solicitation, the Vendor's opportunity to amend the Contract in response to Plan Design changes to the Formulary or \"any carve out of services set forth in the Agreement, including but not limited to Specialty Pharmacy services,\" is limited. Moreover, in some instances a Plan Design\n   change would appear to permit the Vendor to adjust its price without consent of the State and in others to permit the State to ultimately impose a price change without consent of the Vendor, as Section 5.18 permits it to do with regard to the Administrative Fee. In neither circumstance does the Bid Solicitation require a Contract Amendment executed by both parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   For example, although Section 4.4.5.2 generally prohibits the Vendor from making \"any modification or adjustment\" to the pricing set forth in its bid \"without the prior written consent of the State,\" it permits an exception when a Plan Design change has had \"a material negative impact on Rebates earned,\" defined as a ten percent or greater reduction (a \"Pricing Adjustment Trigger\"). In that case, the Vendor may make an adjustment in its prices \"as solely necessary to return PBM to its contracted economic position\" before the Plan Design change, without a negotiated Change Order. Section 4.4.5.2, however, does not suggest any right in the Vendor to modify its pricing in response to a Plan Design change not resulting in a Pricing Adjustment Trigger.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Regarding the carve out of services, Section 5.18 of the Bid Solicitation and Section 5.4 of the State Standard Terms and Conditions, \"\n   <em>\n    State's Option to Reduce Scope of Work\n   </em>\n   ,\" make clear the State retains\n   the sole discretion to reduce the scope of work under the Contract at any time, whether or not in response to a Plan Design change. Although the State committed to working with the Vendor to preserve \"the existing financial terms\" of the Contract in the event it \"chooses to carve out certain Specialty Drugs to allow dispensing at a Retail Pharmacy\" in response to Questions 29 and 144 regarding Section 3.1.4C, \"\n   <em>\n    Scope of Work\n   </em>\n   ,\"\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Specialty Pharmacy\n   </em>\n   ,\" it refused to delete the last sentence of Section 5.4A, which permits the Director to impose an adjusted contract price reflective of the reduced scope of work in the event the parties cannot negotiate one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   the State's response to Question 177. Optum's language \"reserv[ing] the right to modify Financial Contracted Terms based on ... any carve out of services\" fails to acknowledge the State's ability to impose an adjusted contract price in those circumstances without resort to a signed Change Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Accordingly, we fail to see how Optum's additional language is a \"synthesis\" of the Solicitation's several different provisions addressing the Vendor's ability to modify its pricing in response to anticipated Plan Design changes. The language is broader than Section 4.4.5.2 and does not acknowledge the State's ability to impose a price change under Section 5.4 of the State's Standard Terms when it reduces the scope of the work, even when the State agrees to work with the Vendor to preserve \"the existing financial terms\" as it has committed to do in the event it carves out certain Specialty Drugs to allow dispensing at a Retail Pharmacy in accordance with Section 3.1.4C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   The failure of Optum's additional language to acknowledge the State's right to impose an adjusted contract price when it reduces the scope of the work under Section 5.4 of the Standard Terms is underscored by Optum's agreement with Section 5.18 \"as it applies to changes that impact administrative fees,\" while \"reserv[ing] the right to modify Financial Contracted Terms based on ... any carve out of services.\" As the RFP permits the State to impose new pricing in either circumstance in the event negotiations with the Vendor are unsuccessful, Optum's language would thus appear to constitute a clear exception to the State's right to impose a new price for a reduced scope of work under Section 5.4 of the Standard Terms and not a \"synthesis\" of the two provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   As we noted, the Acting Director did not evaluate the entire RFP in an attempt to determine the significance of Optum's additional language to the RFP as a whole as part of a bid\n   conformity analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    On-Line Games\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"607972\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/279/566/#p593\">\n    279 N.J.

We disagree. As detailed here, this was an extremely expedited and complex procurement. Both the State and Optum opposed the stay last July, claiming Optum needed to seek Medicare Part D plan approval by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, prepare for open enrollment beginning October 1 and be in a position to perform on January 1, 2018, and that a stay would derail those efforts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   When we entered our sua sponte stay after argument on December 21 based on our revised assessment of Express Scripts' likelihood of success on the merits, the State and Optum contended Medicare Part D approval having already been secured and open enrollment completed, a stay at that point would cause extreme disruption. Although we came to agree they were correct,\n   neither the size and complexity of the Contract nor the failure to have stayed its award makes this procurement unreviewable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   As the Supreme Court wrote over sixty years ago, \"all bids must comply with the terms imposed, and any material departure therefrom invalidates a nonconforming bid as well as any contract based upon it.

Here, one of the most critical provisions on the effect of Plan Design changes on pricing, Section 4.4.5.2, is in a Section entitled, \"\n   <em>\n    Price Sheets/Schedule Attachment Instructions\n   </em>\n   .\" The provision, which permits the Vendor to modify its pricing without the prior consent of the State in the event of a\n   materially adverse Plan Design change, is at odds with Section 5.4, which provides no changes or modifications can be made to the Contract unless signed by both parties. Section 4.4.5.2 is not referenced in Section 5.18, the Section potential bidders were advised in Section 1.1 would control changes to the Contract in the event of Plan Design changes, and the State did not refer potential bidders concerned about Plan Design changes on their pricing to the section in the question and answer period. Although the necessity of definite and precise specifications is critical for any procurement, it is even more imperative in this procurement in light of anticipated Plan Design changes, which, because of the composition of the Plan Design Committees, are beyond the State's control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Notwithstanding our conclusion that Optum's bid was nonconforming and its Contract invalid, and that it is solely responsible for the nonconforming language in its bid, particularly in light of the proposed reservation the Division rejected during the question and answer period, the same disruption to the prescription plans which caused us to reconsider our stay of the Contract prevents us from ordering Optum's removal during the rebid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Although the absence of a stay has presumably permitted the State to secure the first-year savings in the SHBP/SEHBP the procurement promised, no savings can justify the impairment to the integrity of the bidding process caused by an irregular proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    On-Line Games\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"607972\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/279/566/#p593\">\n    279 N.J.

In the Supreme Court, the State contended the Division's answers to the bid questions transformed Section 5.18 from \"initially a provision solely about modifying administrative fees\" to \"a provision addressing changes to the administrative fee and to the more sensitive financial terms.\" The State further asserted that changes \"the State may make in formulary or specialty pharmacy ... would have to be made by the [Plan Design Committees], under [their] Chapter 78 authority, and thus would be changes in law and subject to that contract provision.\" Based on those two, somewhat dubious, contentions, the State argued Optum's reservation of the right to \"modify Financial Contracted Terms,\" \"understood as it is used in the RFP .... as amendments ... in writing and agreed by both parties,\" \"[t]o the extent ... it does not entirely comport with back and forth submissions in the Change in Law provision, such difference in the nature of the written exchanges does not deprive the State of the ability to make a Change in Law adjustment to the contract.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-230\">\n    The parties provided us their briefs to the Court as a courtesy only. Because the State made entirely different arguments to us, we do not address this new argument further. We note only that its foundation, particularly as it relates to Plan Design changes constituting a change in law, does not appear sound, and the argument does not alter our conclusion that an immateriality finding was impossible on this record.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"24\">\n   <p id=\"p-231\">\n    Optum has not argued it was attempting to \"synthesize\" the various sections of the RFP in which the State addressed the effect of Plan Design changes on pricing. Indeed, nowhere in Optum's brief does it ever make reference to Section 4.4.5.2. Optum's argument is that \"in both the RFP and in the clarifying Q &amp; As, the Division directed that where it made significant changes to the plan following award, the contractor would have an opportunity to renegotiate its pricing to account for those changes\" and that its \"proposal did nothing more than reaffirm OptumRx's right to enter into those negotiations, consistent with \u00a7 5.18.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"25\">\n   <p id=\"p-232\">\n    Express Scripts argued to the Acting Director that a Plan Design change to the Formulary having \"a less than 10% impact on rebates\" provides \"the Vendor no right to an adjustment under the RFP,\" and that Optum's exception gave it \"free [rein] to adjust the rebate guarantee downward, harming the State in its ability to select a formulary to best serve its needs\" and \"the level playing field of the bidders.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"26\">\n   <p id=\"p-233\">\n    When we put this question to counsel at oral argument on the appeal, counsel for both Express Scripts and the State agreed the State could not impose new pricing in response to a Design Change and instead would be forced to terminate the Contract. At oral argument on reconsideration of our stay a week later, the State argued it could impose terms under Section 5.5 of the State Standard Terms pursuant to Section 5.18 as it relates to the Administrative Fee. As we explained in n. 22, following that argument, the State argued to the Supreme Court that it could impose terms following Plan Design changes because the Plan Design Committees would be operating \"under [their] Chapter 78 authority, and thus would be changes in law and subject to that contract provision.\" The State cited no law in support of that assertion, and we have already expressed our doubts as to its validity.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"27\">\n   <p id=\"p-234\">\n    Although we suggest no impropriety, we find particularly concerning the Acting Director's statement in the final agency decision that \"[w]ith the posting of Bid Amendment {Addendum} # 2, all potential Bidders were advised that State fully expects\n    <em>\n     to negotiate all pricing and financial guarantees prior to implementation of any plan design changes\n    </em>\n    .\" (Emphasis is ours.) That statement is presumably based on the Division's answer to Question 117, in which the State expressed its expectation that in the event it excluded certain Brand Drugs from the Formulary, it \"would discuss any needed amendments to any Financial Guarantees,\" echoing the statement in Section 5.18 that in the event of a Plan Design change, \"the parties shall meet to discuss the change and discuss the needed change orders.\" As we have noted, the State refused any modification to Section 5.18 in Addendum 2, which plainly states \"there shall be no change in the Administrative Fee\" when Plan Design changes require only changes in the Vendor's claim administration and related systems or a change to an open enrollment period or additional communications with Network Providers or reissuance of Identification Cards to members and is silent as to the remaining price components. Accordingly, even leaving aside the negative implication of Section 4.4.5.2 as restricting adjustments to the remaining price components from Plan Design changes to those causing a Pricing Adjustment Trigger, the Acting Director's statement would appear, at best, overbroad, but could, at worst, appear as acquiescing in Optum's additional language \"reserv[ing] the right to modify Financial Contracted Terms based on changes by the State in formulary or any carve out of services set forth in the Agreement, including but not limited to Specialty Pharmacy services.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
