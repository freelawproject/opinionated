Respondents assert that this Court lacks jurisdiction over the Amended Petition because Petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies and lacks standing to bring this original jurisdiction action, among other reasons. Upon review, we sustain Respondents' POs in the nature of demurrer and grant the Department's Application for Summary Relief on the basis that Petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies and dismiss the Amended Petition with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The General Assembly enacted the Pennsylvania Medical Marijuana Act (Act),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   which took effect on May 17, 2016, to establish a framework for the legalization of medical marijuana in the Commonwealth for certain medical conditions. The Act identified the Department as the Commonwealth agency responsible for administering the Act and authorized the Department to promulgate regulations, including temporary regulations, necessary to carry out the Act. Section 301 of the Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7 10231.301 ; Section 1107 of the Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7 10231.1107. In accord with this authority, the Department promulgated temporary regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201131.1\">\n    28 Pa.

Code \u00a7 1141.24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Between February 20, 2017, and March 20, 2017, the Department accepted applications from entities interested in obtaining a limited number of medical marijuana grower/processor permits and/or dispensary permits. During the application period, the Department received 457 applications-177 for growers/processors and 280 for dispensaries. The criteria set forth in Section 603(a.1) of the Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7 10231.603(a.1), and the factors listed in the temporary regulations,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201141.27\">\n    28 Pa.

In addition, Petitioner attempted to submit a grower/processor permit application, also in Region 2, but failed to comply with the submission requirements, specifically failing to submit the application on a USB drive. The Department rejected the application as incomplete and did not score it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Petitioner filed administrative appeals on all three unsuccessful permit applications\n   with the Department on June 29, 2017, and July 7, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notwithstanding the pendency of its appeals, Petitioner sought relief in this Court's original jurisdiction by filing a petition for review and an application for special relief, which it subsequently amended.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In the Amended Petition, Petitioner challenges the Department's \"permitting process\" for (1) accepting, reviewing, and scoring medical marijuana grower/processor and dispensary permit applications, and (2) issuing permits to selected applicants pursuant to the Act. The Amended Petition names the Department and the 39 applicants awarded grower/processor permits and/or dispensary permits (Permittees) as Respondents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Amended Petition raises five counts. In Count I, Petitioner asserts that the Department scored the applications inconsistently and arbitrarily and refuses to shed light on how it scored applications or awarded permits. By engaging in a secretive permitting process, the Department has deprived Petitioner and all applicants any fair and meaningful administrative review of their decisions in violation of due process. In Count II, Petitioner contends that the Department acted\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   in waiving certain statutory and regulatory requirements and strictly enforcing other requirements. In Count III, Petitioner avers that the Department's permitting process violates the requirements of the Right-to-Know Law (RTKL)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   because the publicly-released applications contain unlawful redactions. In Count IV, Petitioner claims that, by failing to disclose the identities and qualifications of the scorers, the Department's permitting process may be infected by favoritism or bias in further violation of the due process rights of all applicants. In Count V, Petitioner asserts that the Department's permitting process should be invalidated in its entirety and the previously awarded permits rescinded because they were awarded pursuant to an unlawful process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In support of its claim that the Department has scored the applications inconsistently and arbitrarily, Petitioner alleges the following. The Department has not provided objective criteria for scoring necessary for meaningful administrative challenge and review. For example, the scoring rubric made available to applicants assigned 50 of 1000 points (or 5% of the available points) to a section called \"Attachment E Personal Identification.\" This section required applicants to provide two separate, objective items: (1) a photo identification, and (2) a resume for each principal, employee, financial backer and operator. It is unclear how the Department scored this information. No applicant scored fifty (50) points and no applicant scored zero (0) points in this category. Moreover, applicants that submitted the same information received different scores. Amended Petition at \u00b6\u00b6 76-80.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Petitioner submitted two dispensary applications, which were identical except for dispensary location. Yet, the applications\n   received different scores. Amended Petition at \u00b6\u00b6 96-105.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Act requires an applicant for a dispensary application to demonstrate that it has at least $150,000 in capital deposited in a financial institution. Section 607(2)(vi) of the Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7 10231.607(2)(vi). Petitioner demonstrated that it had $15,600,000 in capital, of which $7,287,500 was deposited with Wells Fargo. Despite vastly exceeding the statutory requirement, Petitioner's applications scored 61.80 and 60.60 of 75 points available on the \"Capital Requirements\" section. The applications were not scaled against each other because no applicant received a score of 100%. Amended Petition \u00b6\u00b6 101, 106-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The \"Quality Control and Testing\" section contained a \"yes\" or \"no\" question, with no request for a narrative or documentation in support, worth a total of 50 points. Inexplicably, published scores ranged from 5 to 41 points in this category.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In support of its claim that the Department waived certain statutory and regulatory requirements, Petitioner alleges that the Department waived the requirements for criminal background checks under Section 602(a)(4) of the Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7 10231.602(a)(4), and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201141.31\">\n    28 Pa.

Amended Petition at \u00b6\u00b6 136-37, 151-71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Petitioner also avers that the Department did not fully release public records subject to the RTKL as mandated by Section 302(b) of the Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7 10231.302(b), further exacerbating the lack of transparency in the permitting process and hindering meaningful administrative review. Amended Petition at \u00b6\u00b6 62-63. The Department has not scheduled hearings or provided post-award debriefings for Petitioner and other unsuccessful applicants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201141.35\">\n    28 Pa.

Respondents demur to all counts on the primary grounds that Petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies and lacks standing. In addition, some Respondents object because the Amended Petition is legally insufficient to support a claim for injunctive relief and is not sufficiently specific.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Department also filed an Application for Summary Relief seeking dismissal of the Amended Petition with prejudice because Petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies, lacks standing, and failed to establish the\n   essential elements required for the issuance of an injunction. After briefing\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and oral argument, the POs and Application for Summary Relief are ready for disposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   First, Respondents contend that Petitioner failed to exhaust its administrative remedies before invoking this Court's original jurisdiction. Petitioner has a perfectly suited and adequate administrative remedy to address its complaints regarding the denial and scoring of its dispensary permit applications, and rejection of its grower/processor permit application and has availed itself of this remedy. Indeed, Petitioner's administrative appeals are presently pending before the Department's Secretary. The asserted grounds for the administrative appeals are the same grounds asserted in this original jurisdiction action. There is nothing novel or unique about Petitioner's claims in this regard, as more than 140 other unsuccessful applicants feel the same way,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that the Department got it wrong and the unsuccessful applicant should have been awarded the permit. Petitioner's claims amount to little more than a challenge of the Department's proper application of the Act and temporary regulations. Petitioner cannot establish any exception to the exhaustion requirement to invoke this Court's jurisdiction. Petitioner's \"as-applied\" constitutional challenge to the Department's interpretation and implementation of the Act and temporary regulations does not excuse its failure to exhaust the pending administrative remedies before the Department. Petitioner has not shown that the administrative review process is inadequate or that it will suffer any harm, let alone irreparable harm, during the administrative appeal process. Therefore, Respondents assert that this Court lacks jurisdiction over this action and Petitioner's Amended Petition should be dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Petitioner responds that its claims are exempt from the exhaustion doctrine. Petitioner is not simply challenging its own unsuccessful applications, but rather the constitutionality and validity of the entire\n   permitting process as applied to all permit applicants. Moreover, the administrative remedy is wholly inadequate. The Department cannot grant the requested relief in that it cannot declare its permitting process or review of that process unlawful or enjoin further administration of the permitting process. Only this Court has the authority to grant the declaratory and injunctive relief requested. In addition, Petitioner asserts that the administrative appeal process does not afford unsuccessful applicants a meaningful opportunity to be heard in violation of due process. The Department has refused to explain or defend its scoring decisions or articulate a rationale for selecting winning applicants, asserting scoring is within its sole discretion. Applicants are severely disadvantaged by the secretive process and undisclosed criteria used by the Department in awarding permits. Because of the lack of transparency and hidden standards, any applicant appealing a permit denial is destined to fail. The Department has not afforded Petitioner the debriefing called for by its own regulations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201141.35\">\n    28 Pa. Code \u00a7 1141.35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), and it has delayed the administrative hearings. Petitioner claims it will suffer irreparable harm if it is required to first exhaust administrative remedies before seeking relief in this Court. According to Petitioner, potentially less qualified applicants may have received permits and it will become increasingly difficult to remedy once such permittees enter into contracts with third parties. For these reasons, the exhaustion doctrine does not apply and this Court should overrule Respondents' POs in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   This Court's original jurisdiction extends to \"all civil actions or proceedings ...

During the pendency of its administrative appeals, Petitioner filed its original jurisdiction action in this Court. Petitioner diverted course because it fears it will not get the answers that it seeks regarding the scoring or an opportunity to prove that the permitting process was invalid. However, having failed to go through the administrative appeal process, Petitioner's allegations regarding the process are speculative at best. The appropriate way to advance Petitioner's arguments in this regard is to actually participate in the administrative appeal process, examine the Department's exhibits and cross-examine the witnesses who will testify about the permitting process, including the evaluation and scoring\n   of permit applications. If the Department refuses to provide information, such matters are appropriate to raise to this Court on appeal. By not participating in the administrative appeal process in a meaningful way, there is no basis upon which this Court can conclude that the process is wholly inadequate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Canonsburg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767216\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/492/68/\">\n    422 A.2d at 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"courts should not presume futility in the administrative appeal\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Finally, Petitioner fails to demonstrate that the administrative appeal process \"allows irreparable harm to occur during the administrative process.\"\n   <em>\n    Nicholas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"465074,7859133\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/681/157/\">\n    681 A.2d at 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Petitioner's admission underscores the need to develop a record at the administrative level. There are material factual dynamics involved in evaluating the criteria for scoring permit applications that must be developed in an administrative forum for this Court to determine whether the permitting process violates the Act or temporary regulations.
