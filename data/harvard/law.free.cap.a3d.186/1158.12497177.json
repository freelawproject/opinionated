We recently affirmed this\n   holding in\n   <em>\n    Spiotti\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wolcott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489948\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/46/#p199\">\n    326 Conn. 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 199-200,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489948\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/46/#p199\">\n    163 A.3d 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). In the present case, we are asked to determine whether our holding in\n   <em>\n    Genovese\n   </em>\n   , in which the plaintiff brought an action\n   <em>\n    in the Superior Court\n   </em>\n   pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a, applies equally when a plaintiff has opted to bring his claim pursuant to \u00a7 31-290a before\n   <em>\n    the Workers' Compensation Commission\n   </em>\n   (commission). Specifically, we must determine whether the Compensation Review Board (review board) correctly determined that \u00a7 31-51bb permitted the plaintiff, Simon Williams, to file a claim with the commission alleging that the named defendant, the city of New Haven,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   had\n   violated \u00a7 31-290a by wrongfully terminating his employment in retaliation for bringing a workers' compensation claim, despite the fact that a related issue previously had been decided by the State Board of Mediation and Arbitration (state board) in an arbitration proceeding brought pursuant to the plaintiff's collective bargaining agreement. We conclude that the review board correctly determined that, under \u00a7 31-51bb, the plaintiff's claim brought before the commission pursuant to \u00a7 31-290a was not barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Accordingly, we affirm the review board's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following procedural history and facts that either were found by the review board, the Workers' Compensation Commissioner for the Third District (commissioner), or are not disputed. The plaintiff was employed by the city in its refuse division from 1993 until his employment was terminated on November 1, 2012. In January, 2011, the plaintiff injured his left shoulder, neck and back during the course of his employment. Patrick Ruwe, a physician, treated the plaintiff for his shoulder injury, and Shirvinda Wijesekera, also a physician, treated him for his neck and back injuries. On January 19, 2012, Ruwe released the plaintiff for light duty work for eight hours each day effective January 23, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pursuant to the city's policy of returning injured employees to work as soon as medically reasonable, the city informed the plaintiff that he was assigned to light duty work at the city's fleet maintenance division. His hours were 7 a.m. to 3 p.m., and his work consisted of transferring handwritten work orders to a computerized database. Upon returning to work, the plaintiff requested that his hours be changed to the hours that he had worked before his injury, 5 a.m. to 1 p.m., because the new schedule interfered with his second job. John Prokop, the city's director of public works,\n   explained to the plaintiff that the city could not accommodate that request because the location of the plaintiff's light duty assignment did not open until 7 a.m., and the city did not want the plaintiff to work unsupervised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Upon being informed of this, the plaintiff, later that same day, called Ruwe's office and spoke to his secretary. As a result of this conversation, Ruwe revised his work status report to restrict the plaintiff's hours to four to five hours of work per day. Shortly thereafter, Prokop called Ruwe's office and asked why the plaintiff's hours had been changed just days after he had returned to work. Ruwe then conducted a follow-up examination of the plaintiff and issued a work release form indicating that he had executed the previous form, which restricted the plaintiff's work to four\n   to five hours per day, in order to accommodate the plaintiff's desire to perform his second job and that Ruwe was now lifting that restriction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The city subsequently filed with the commission a notice of intent to reduce or discontinue the plaintiff's workers' compensation benefits and initiated an investigation of the matter. During the course of the investigation, the plaintiff and Ruwe were deposed. Ruwe testified at his deposition that he had reduced the plaintiff's work hours to accommodate the plaintiff's desire to perform his second job and that there was no medical reason for the restriction. Thereafter, the commissioner granted the city's request to reduce the plaintiff's workers' compensation benefits for the period of January 19 through May 22, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After giving the plaintiff notice of its intent to do so, the city conducted a pretermination hearing to determine whether the plaintiff's employment should be terminated because he had committed workers' compensation fraud. The city subsequently notified the plaintiff that his employment was being terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The plaintiff's union, the United Public Service Employees Union, Local 424, Unit 34 (union), then filed a grievance pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement between the city and the union, claiming that the plaintiff had been fired without just cause. The parties agreed to bypass the grievance procedure and to proceed directly to arbitration before the state board, as authorized by the collective bargaining agreement. After conducting evidentiary hearings, the state board issued an award in favor of the city, concluding that it had just cause to terminate the plaintiff because his receipt of workers' compensation benefits was \"the result of the [plaintiff's] intentional deceit\" and his conduct \"amounted to theft ....\" The state board noted that, as defined in The Random House Dictionary of the English Language (2d Ed. 1987) p. 762, \"fraud\" means, among other things, \"deceit, trickery, sharp practice, or breach of confidence, perpetrated for profit or to gain some unfair or dishonest advantage.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The plaintiff then filed an application to vacate the arbitration award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4). The trial court observed that, because the submission to arbitration was unrestricted, the court's review was limited to determining whether \"(1) the award fail[ed] to conform to the submission, or, in other words, [fell] outside the scope of the submission; or (2) the arbitrators manifestly disregarded the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Harty\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3150276\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/275/72/#p85\">\n    275 Conn. 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 85,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=881%20A.2d%20139\">\n    881 A.2d 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). The court concluded that the plaintiff had failed to establish either prong of\n   <em>\n    Harty\n   </em>\n   and, accordingly, denied the application to vacate the arbitration award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Meanwhile, the plaintiff filed a claim with the commission, alleging that he had been wrongfully discharged by the city in retaliation for bringing a workers'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   compensation claim in violation of \u00a7 31-290a.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The city moved to dismiss the claim, contending that it was barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel because the issue had been finally decided in the arbitration proceeding before the state board. The commissioner concluded that, under\n   \u00a7 31-51bb,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   as interpreted by this court in\n   <em>\n    Genovese\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gallo Wine Merchants, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"738686\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/226/475/#p493\">\n    226 Conn. at 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=628%20A.2d%20946\">\n    628 A.2d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the plaintiff was entitled to pursue his claim pursuant to \u00a7 31-290a despite his prior voluntary submission of a related claim to arbitration pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=628%20A.2d%20946\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (by enacting \u00a7 31-51bb, \"the legislature intended to permit an employee, despite his prior voluntary submission of a related claim to final arbitration under a collective bargaining agreement, to pursue a statutory cause of action in the Superior Court\"). In addition, the commissioner concluded that the issue raised by the plaintiff in his claim to the commission pursuant to \u00a7 31-290a, namely, whether the city had retaliated against him for filing a workers' compensation claim, was separate and distinct from the issue raised in the arbitration, namely, whether there was just cause to terminate the plaintiff because he had engaged in workers' compensation fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The city filed a motion to correct the commissioner's finding and award, arguing that the commission lacked\n   jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiff's claim pursuant to \u00a7 31-290a\"in light of the prior [state board] ruling that found [the] termination to be lawful and a prior Superior Court ruling that declined to vacate that arbitration panel ruling.\" The commissioner denied the motion. The city then filed a petition for review with the review board. The review board agreed with the commissioner that, under this court's interpretation of \u00a7 31-51bb in\n   <em>\n    Genovese\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff's claim was not barred by principles of collateral estoppel. The review board also agreed with the commissioner that the issue that the plaintiff raised in his claim to the commission pursuant to \u00a7 31-290a was different from the issue raised in the arbitration proceeding pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement. Accordingly, the review board affirmed the commissioner's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The city contends that, contrary to the review board's determination, this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Genovese\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gallo Wine Merchants, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"738686\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/226/475/#p493\">\n    226 Conn. at 486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=628%20A.2d%20946\">\n    628 A.2d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which held that, under \u00a7 31-51bb, principles of collateral estoppel do not bar an employee covered by a collective bargaining agreement from pursuing a statutory cause of action when a related issue previously has been decided in a proceeding provided for in the agreement, does not apply to the present case because \u00a7 31-51bb applies only to statutory causes of action that are pursued \"in a court of competent jurisdiction ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 31-51bb. The city points out that, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Genovese\n   </em>\n   , in which the plaintiff employee filed his claim pursuant to \u00a7 31-290a in the Superior Court; see\n   <em>\n    Genovese\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gallo Wine Merchants, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 479,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=628%20A.2d%20946\">\n    628 A.2d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; the plaintiff in the present case did not pursue a statutory cause of action in any court, but filed\n   his claim pursuant to \u00a7 31-290a with the commission.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the\n   alternative, the city contends that the provision of \u00a7 31-51bb that permits the plaintiff to pursue a statutory cause of action in a court of competent jurisdiction, despite the fact that his claim previously had been decided by the state board, was satisfied because the plaintiff was permitted to pursue in the Superior Court an application to vacate the arbitration award pursuant to \u00a7 52-418. The city further argues that the review board incorrectly determined that the issues the plaintiff raised in his claim to the commission pursuant to \u00a7 31-290a were different from the issues raised in the arbitration proceeding pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We disagree with the city's first two claims and conclude that the review board correctly determined that \u00a7 31-51bb, as interpreted by this court in\n   <em>\n    Genovese\n   </em>\n   , permitted\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the plaintiff to file his claim pursuant to \u00a7 31-290a with the commission, despite the fact that the state board previously had determined that the city did not wrongfully terminate his employment. We further conclude that we need not determine whether the issue that the plaintiff raised in the arbitration proceeding before the state board was different from the issue that\n   he raised in his claim to the commission pursuant to \u00a7 31-290a because, even if the issues were the same, \u00a7 31-51bb would permit the plaintiff to file his claim with the commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Whether \u00a7 31-51bb permits the plaintiff to file a claim with the commission pursuant to \u00a7 31-290a alleging that the city had wrongfully terminated his employment in retaliation for bringing a workers' compensation claim, notwithstanding the fact that the state board previously had decided in a prior arbitration proceeding that the city had not wrongfully terminated the plaintiff's employment, is a question of statutory interpretation subject to plenary review. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Perez-Dickson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bridgeport\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=304%20Conn.%20483\">\n    304 Conn. 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 507,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20A.3d%2069\">\n    43 A.3d 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). \"When construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature ....

The plaintiff contends that, to the\n   contrary, the legislature intended \u00a7 31-51bb to ensure that employees covered by collective bargaining agreements do not lose statutory rights available to other employees, and the forum in which the statutory cause of action is pursued has no bearing on whether the statute applies. Under the plaintiff's reading of the statute, the legislature intended the phrase \"in a court of competent jurisdiction\" simply to clarify that statutory and constitutional claims need not be brought pursuant to the procedures provided in a collective bargaining agreement, and it was not intended to limit the application of the statute to claims pursued in court.

Second, it is not unreasonable to conclude that the legislature included the phrase \"in a court of competent jurisdiction\" in \u00a7 31-51bb solely because, in the absence of that phrase, the statute would be entirely unclear as to whether such a cause of action may be pursued in proceedings\n   <em>\n    other than\n   </em>\n   those provided for in a collective bargaining agreement, and the legislature was not concerned with specifying the forum in which the cause of action may be brought.

Proc., supra, p. 4567; it is clear to us that the primary problem with which these speakers were concerned was ensuring that generally available statutory\n   <em>\n    causes of action\n   </em>\n   would be available to employees covered by collective bargaining\n   agreements-not with specifying the\n   <em>\n    forum\n   </em>\n   in which such actions could be brought. In other words, these remarks support the conclusion that \u00a7 31-51bb was\n   intended to ensure that, when there is a generally available statutory or constitutional cause of action or remedy, such employees would have the same right to pursue that cause of action or to invoke that remedy as employees not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. See Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, supra, p. 1450, remarks of Attorney Pulda (legislation \"simply restores to union members the causes of action and remedies [for statutory violations] that the legislature originally provided\"); id., p. 1454, remarks of William Rudis, director of political legislation for the Connecticut State Council Machinists (\"union members are no different than any other members of society ... and ought not to be discriminated against\"); id. (\"it is essential that employees in collective bargaining areas be given the same kinds of consistent protections that we see ... folks everywhere in our society today are given\"); id., p. 1528, written remarks of the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union (\"[t]his bill ... would afford employees covered by collective bargaining agreements the same rights as those who are not unionized, a remedy at law or equity for violations of civil or constitutional rights\"). Indeed, Attorney Pulda expressly stated in her remarks that the legislation was intended to protect the right to \"report employers' illegal conduct\n   <em>\n    to the appropriate state agency\n   </em>\n   [including] the right to file workers' compensation claims ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis\n   added.) Id., p. 1448. Thus, this legislative history supports the conclusion that the legislature contemplated that employees covered by collective bargaining agreements would have the same right to raise a statutory claim in an agency as other employees. Accordingly, it is reasonable to conclude that the phrase \"in a court of competent jurisdiction,\" as used in \u00a7 31-51bb, was not intended to specify the forum in which such rights may be vindicated but was intended to make clear that the procedures provided for in a collective bargaining agreement would not be the exclusive vehicle by which employees covered by that agreement may vindicate their statutory and constitutional rights. Indeed, in acting to protect the rights of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements to raise a statutory claim, we can think of no reason why the legislature would distinguish between those who chose to pursue their claims before a state agency and those who chose to pursue their claims in the Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The city contends that, to the contrary, the problem that \u00a7 31-51bb was intended to address was \"that arbitration may be a less effective forum for the final resolution of statutory claims\" than proceedings in court because \"[t]he [fact-finding] process in arbitration usually is not equivalent to judicial [fact-finding]. The record of the arbitration proceedings is not as complete; the usual rules of evidence do not apply; and rights and procedures common to civil trials, such as discovery, compulsory process, cross-examination, and testimony under oath, are often severely limited or unavailable.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Genovese\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gallo Wine Merchants, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"738686\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/226/475/#p493\">\n    226 Conn. at 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=628%20A.2d%20946\">\n    628 A.2d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These concerns carry no weight, the city contends, when an employee has\n   brought a claim before the commission because, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-298, the ordinary rules of procedure and evidence and the ordinary common-law principles also do not apply in proceedings\n   before the commission. The city further contends that \u00a7 31-51bb should not apply to claims filed with the commission because the relief that the commissioner can award pursuant to \u00a7 31-290a is significantly more limited than the relief that the Superior Court can award pursuant to that statute. See General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a (b) (trial court may award reinstatement of employee, payment of back wages, reestablishment of employee benefits to which employee would have been entitled if he had not been discriminated against, and \"any other damages caused by such discrimination or discharge,\" as well as punitive damages and attorney's fees, whereas commissioner is authorized to award only reinstatement, payment of back wages and reestablishment of benefits).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We acknowledge that the particular legislative concerns regarding that fact-finding process in arbitration that this court cited in\n   <em>\n    Genovese\n   </em>\n   are addressed only when an employee has brought a claim in a forum that applies the ordinary rules of evidence and procedure. As we have explained, however, the legislative history of \u00a7 31-51bb shows that the\n   <em>\n    primary\n   </em>\n   purpose of the legislation was not to ensure that the ordinary evidentiary and procedural rules would apply to statutory causes of action pursued by employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement but, rather, to ensure that such employees would have the\n   <em>\n    same right\n   </em>\n   as other employees to pursue a statutory cause of action. Thus, when, in a particular case, a statutory cause of action provides employees with the choice of litigating before an agency or in court, we can see no reason why the fact that the remedies that are available in court are more expansive should bar an employee who is subject to a collective bargaining agreement from pursuing the cause of action before the agency. Indeed, it would be inappropriate to focus on the\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   procedures and remedies available in a proceeding before the commission pursuant to \u00a7 31-290a when considering\n   the\n   <em>\n    general\n   </em>\n   question of whether \u00a7 31-51bb permits an employee who has obtained a decision from the state board pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement to subsequently pursue a statutory cause of action before an agency. We see no evidence that the legislature intended that this determination would be made on a case-by-case basis that depended on the evidentiary and procedural rules governing the statutory cause of action and the scope of the remedies that may be provided by the tribunal in which the action is pursued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Moreover, although the ordinary rules of evidence and procedure do not apply in proceedings before the commission, it has expertise in the area of workers' compensation law that the state board does not have, thereby increasing the likelihood of a correct decision in a claim brought pursuant to \u00a7 31-290a. Indeed, because the commissioner and the review board have greater expertise in this area than the\n   <em>\n    courts\n   </em>\n   , it would be odd if \u00a7 31-51bb was intended to prevent the application of principles of collateral estoppel to workers' compensation claims brought in court but not before the commission.

This is in contrast to the extremely limited judicial review of an arbitrator's decision pursuant to \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4). See\n   <em>\n    Harty\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3150276\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/275/72/#p85\">\n    275 Conn. at 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=881%20A.2d%20139\">\n    881 A.2d 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (when submission to arbitration was unrestricted, trial court's review of decision is limited to determining whether \"(1) the award fail[ed] to conform to the submission, or, in other words, [fell] outside the scope of the submission; or (2) the arbitrators manifestly disregarded the law\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For this reason, we also reject the city's claim that the provision of \u00a7 31-51bb permitting an employee to pursue a statutory cause of action in the Superior Court has been satisfied because the plaintiff filed an application to vacate the arbitrator's decision in the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4). Again, the purpose of \u00a7 31-51bb was to give employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement the same right to bring a statutory cause of action as other employees. As we have just explained, because judicial review of an arbitration award is limited to determining whether the award conformed to the unrestricted submission and whether the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law, the right to file, in the Superior Court, an application to vacate an arbitration award that resulted from proceedings provided for in a collective bargaining agreement is not equivalent to the right to file a claim with the commission pursuant to \u00a7 31-290a, which includes the right to subsequent judicial review under a more liberal standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The city also claims that the review board improperly determined that the doctrine of collateral estoppel did not bar the plaintiff from filing a claim pursuant to \u00a7 31-290a with the commission because it found that the issue raised in the arbitration proceedings before the state board was different from the issue raised in the\n   claim pursuant to \u00a7 31-290a.

Accordingly, even if we were to assume that the issue that the plaintiff raised in his claim to the commission pursuant to \u00a7 31-290a was the same as the issue that the state board previously had decided in arbitration, the claim to the commission would not be precluded. We conclude, therefore, that the review board correctly determined that \u00a7 31-51bb permitted the plaintiff to file a claim with the commission pursuant to \u00a7 31-290a, despite the fact that the state board previously had issued an adverse decision on a similar claim in the arbitration proceeding brought pursuant to the plaintiff's collective bargaining agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The decision of the Compensation Review Board is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In this opinion the other justices concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Connecticut Interlocal Risk Management Agency, a nonprofit association that provides workers' compensation insurance coverage to the city, is also a defendant in this matter.

This court concluded that claim was barred because \"access to the courts under [\u00a7 10-151] is possible only on appeal of a decision of the board of education,\" and the plaintiff had not filed any such appeal and could not have done so, presumably because he did not file a claim with the board of education.

See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 3-62g (\"[i]f, after payment or delivery to the Treasurer, any officer ... of the federal government is compelled by a court of competent jurisdiction to make a second payment, the Treasurer ... shall refund the amount of such second payment\"); General Statutes \u00a7 4-61oo (d) (\"[n]othing in this subsection or subsection [c] of this section shall be construed to give a hiree or an applicant the right to pursue a cause of action in a court of competent jurisdiction for the violation of any provision of this subsection or subsection [c] of this section\"); General Statutes \u00a7 4a-101 (e) (\"[n]o person ... shall be held liable ... unless such person, agency, employee or official is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have acted in a wilful, wanton or reckless manner\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    In this regard, we note that complaints of discriminatory employment practices may be filed with the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46a-82. Inasmuch as the legislative history indicates that the statutory right to be free from discrimination is one of the rights that \u00a7 31-51bb was intended to protect, it would be anomalous to conclude that the statute does not permit the filing of such claims with the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities if such a claim was previously decided in proceedings pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
