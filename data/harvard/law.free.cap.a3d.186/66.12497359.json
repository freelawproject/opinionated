We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the issue on appeal. On April 29, 2014, the defendant was convicted of possession of a weapon or dangerous instrument in a correctional institution in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-174a and sentenced to six years incarceration, execution suspended after thirteen months, followed by three years of probation. The court imposed and the defendant agreed to the standard conditions of probation, which included, inter alia, that he not violate any state or federal criminal law. The period of probation began on February 27, 2015. Thereafter, on May 5, 2015, the defendant was arrested following an incident on the New Haven green when he and two other individuals were seen assaulting a student from Yale University.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 29, 2015, the defendant was arrested when he was found in an abandoned building at 301 George Street in New Haven and charged with\n   burglary in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-103, criminal trespass in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-109, and larceny in the sixth degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-125b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 30, 2015, the defendant was arrested on a warrant for a violation of his probation pursuant to \u00a7 53a-32. As the basis for his violation, the warrant cited the July 29, 2015 arrest as a violation of the general condition of probation that the defendant not violate any state or federal criminal law. An attorney was appointed to represent the defendant. On December 2, 2015, six days before the date of the violation of probation hearing, the state filed a long form information substituting the May 5, 2015 arrest, rather than the July 29, 2015 arrest cited in the original warrant, as the underlying basis for the violation of his probation. The defendant and his attorney were informed of this change on December 2, 2015. The defendant's attorney did not object to the change or seek a continuance of the hearing. Following the violation of probation hearing on December 8, 2015, the court found by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant, by assaulting the victim, violated a criminal law, thereby violating a general condition of his probation. As a result of this violation, the court revoked the defendant's probation and sentenced him to thirty months of incarceration. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendant's sole claim on appeal is that he was deprived of his due process right to fair notice of the charges against him when the state filed a substitute information six days prior to his probation revocation hearing. The defendant argues that the late notice caused him unfair surprise and prejudice in preparing\n   his defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant concedes that his due process claim is unpreserved and seeks review pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566558\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/233/#p239\">\n    213 Conn. 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 239-40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n    567 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989), as modified by\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20773\">\n    317 Conn. 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 781,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201188\">\n    120 A.3d 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   , \"a defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation ... exists and ... deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\" (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12492208\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/178/1103/#p279\">\n    179 Conn.

On that date, the defendant's counsel acknowledged that he and the defendant had received the substituted information. The defendant's counsel voiced no objection and did not seek a continuance at that time. The defendant's probation revocation hearing was held on December 8, 2015, six days later. Prior to the start of the hearing, the defendant's counsel stated that he had reviewed the substituted information with the defendant. It is undisputed that the substitute information was filed prior to the start of the defendant's probation hearing, and the defendant provides no case\n   law, nor do we find any such authority, to support the proposition that six days does not constitute fair notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Furthermore, the condition of the defendant's probation that he was charged with violating was that he would not violate any criminal law, and the arrest warrant application, dated July 30, 2015, specified that condition as the basis of the violation. The state did not alter the underlying condition that it alleged the defendant had violated, that he not violate any criminal law, when it filed the substitute information on December 2, 2015. From the warrant and the substitute information, the defendant was aware that he was accused of violating the criminal laws of this state because of his recent arrests. This court has stated that \"[w]here criminal activity forms the basis for the revocation of probation, the law imputes to the probationer the knowledge that further criminal transgressions will result in a condition violation and the due process notice requirement is similarly met.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hooks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5542965\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/80/75/#p80\">\n    80 Conn.

At the conclusion of the violation of probation hearing, the court found that the state had satisfied its burden of proving that the defendant violated this general condition: \"I find ... by a fair preponderance of the evidence that [the defendant] engaged in criminal behavior while he was on probation. So, he's in violation of his probation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After a careful review of the record, we conclude that the defendant received adequate notice of the ground on which he ultimately was found to have violated his probation.
