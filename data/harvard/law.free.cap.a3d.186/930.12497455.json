Because the more specific provisions of OPRA refer to \"any person,\" and because OPRA is to be construed broadly to achieve the Legislature's over-arching goal of making public records freely available, we conclude that the right to request records under OPRA is not limited to \"citizens\" of New Jersey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Accordingly, we affirm the October 8, 2015 and December 24, 2015 orders on appeal in A-2092-15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We reverse the orders on appeal in A-2704-15 and A-2716-15, and remand those cases to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The appeals present a purely legal issue, as to which our review is de novo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manalapan Realty, LP v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"331456\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/140/366/#p378\">\n    140 N.J. 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 378,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"331456\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/140/366/#p378\">\n    658 A.2d 1230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995). However, we set forth some brief background concerning each case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In A-2092-15, Harry Scheeler, an open government activist who moved from New Jersey to North Carolina in 2014, submitted an OPRA request seeking records from Atlantic County Municipal Joint Insurance Fund (ACMJIF), ACMJIF's fund administrator,\n   and its records custodian (collectively, defendants). Specifically, he sought records concerning legal bills submitted for payment for lawsuits filed against Hamilton Township, Atlantic County. Defendants provided some of the records, but declined to provide what they\n   characterized as \"confidential and privileged memos\" for ongoing litigation. After Scheeler filed an OPRA lawsuit in Burlington County, defendants contended that he had no standing to request documents under OPRA because he was not a citizen of New Jersey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In a series of well-reasoned written opinions, Judge Bookbinder concluded that the right to request public records under OPRA is not limited to New Jersey citizens. He also found that the \"confidential memos\" were not memoranda at all, but were simply detailed legal invoices. The judge concluded that OPRA required defendants to produce them, but he permitted defendants to redact any attorney-client privileged material or work product. Defendants subsequently produced the records, with redactions. The judge also awarded Scheeler counsel fees for the litigation, pursuant to OPRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 47:1A-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In A-2716-15, Scheeler filed a similar OPRA lawsuit against the City of Cape May, seeking records concerning government spending on legal services. In that case, another trial judge dismissed the complaint, reasoning that only New Jersey citizens had standing to request public records under OPRA. The judge was particularly concerned with the burden Scheeler's requests placed on local government resources, asking rhetorically:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   At the time the OPRA was adopted, did the members of the New Jersey Legislature contemplate that they were authorizing an out of state gadfly to repeatedly bombard local governments with demands to produce public records?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In A-2704-15, the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law (LCCR), a national non-profit civil rights organization, sought records from the Atlantic City Board of Education (Board), concerning school level enrollment and disciplinary data. The same judge who dismissed Scheeler's case against Cape May also dismissed LCCR's OPRA complaint against the Board on standing grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The issue presented in these three appeals revolves around a phrase used in the first paragraph of N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1. The municipal defendants rely on the following language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The Legislature finds and declares it to be the public policy of this State that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   government records shall be readily accessible for inspection, copying, or examination by\n   <em>\n    the citizens of this State\n   </em>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [ N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1 (emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In construing a statute, we first consider its language.\n   <em>\n    In re Kollman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4154819\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/210/557/#p568\">\n    210 N.J. 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 568,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4154819,4154132\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/46/1247/\">\n    46 A.3d 1247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). Ordinarily, if the statutory language is unambiguous, our task is complete and we need not look further.\n   <em>\n    DiProspero v.

However, if a word or phrase is ambiguous, we then consider the context in which the language appears, the language of the statute as a whole, the statute's purpose, and its history.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson ex rel. Manzano v. City of Jersey City\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4153915\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/209/558/#p572\">\n    209 N.J. 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 572,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4153915\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/209/558/#p572\">\n    39 A.3d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). In construing a statute, we must be faithful to the Legislature's intent in enacting it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sussex Commons Assocs., LLC v. Rutgers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4154457\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/210/531/#p540\">\n    210 N.J. 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 540-41,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4154457\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/210/531/#p540\">\n    46 A.3d 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). We should, therefore, avoid literal interpretations of words or phrases that will produce an absurd result, contrary to the legislative purpose.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4154457\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/210/531/#p540\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4154457\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/210/531/#p540\">\n    at 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4154457\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/210/531/#p540\">\n    46 A.3d 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In using the term \"citizens of this State,\" the Legislature arguably created an ambiguity in N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1. However, we conclude that any ambiguity is easily resolved. Reading N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1 sensibly,\n   bearing in mind the context in which the phrase \"citizens of this State\" is used, the terms the Legislature used in the rest of OPRA, and considering the statute's history and purpose, we cannot conclude that the Legislature intended to preclude out-of-state residents from making OPRA requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The term \"citizen\" appears in the above-quoted section of N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1, and in its last paragraph:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [A] public agency has a responsibility and an obligation to safeguard from public access\n   <em>\n    a citizen's\n   </em>\n   personal information with which it has been entrusted when disclosure thereof would violate\n   <em>\n    the citizen's\n   </em>\n   reasonable expectation of privacy ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Clearly the term \"citizen\" in the last paragraph does not refer to New Jersey residents. It would produce an absurd result if the government were only required to protect personal information of New Jersey residents and could freely disseminate medical records, school transcripts, and other personal information of out-of-state residents. It is more logical to construe the term \"citizen\" as simply meaning \"a person\" or \"an individual.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Although OPRA has an extensive definitions section, N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1, \"citizen\" is not defined. Other than in N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1, the term does not appear anywhere else in the statute. Rather, the remaining sections of OPRA use the term \"person\" or \"requestor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Significantly, section five of OPRA, which specifically addresses the obligation to produce records, uses the terms \"person\" or \"requestor.\" N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5(a) provides that a government records custodian \"shall permit the record to be inspected, examined, and copied by\n   <em>\n    any person\n   </em>\n   during regular business hours ....\" (emphasis added). Subsection (b) provides that \"[a] copy or copies of a government record may be purchased by\n   <em>\n    any person\n   </em>\n   upon payment of the fee prescribed by law or regulation.\" N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5(b) (emphasis added). Subsection (c) permits \"[t]he requestor\" to review and object to a charge for copying public records. N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5(c). Subsections (f) and (i) indicate that anonymous OPRA requests are permitted, which appears incompatible with a state residency requirement.
