Packard, appeals from the judgment dissolving her marriage with the plaintiff, Jay B. Packard. This appeal has been amended three times, challenging orders entered after\n   judgment. Specifically, the defendant (1) claims that as to the April 7, 2017 judgment, the findings, conclusions and orders are erroneous; (2) challenges the July 28, 2017 order regarding renovations to the marital home; (3) challenges the August 18, 2017 order requiring her to sign a release of medical information to the guardian ad litem; and (4) challenges the October 6, 2017 orders regarding facilitating the sale of the marital home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, she asserts state and federal constitutional violations. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The defendant, in her lengthy and detailed brief, presents no legal analysis and cites virtually no case law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   A narrative account of the demise of the parties' relationship and the effect of various orders on the defendant, however compelling, does not suffice as an adequate brief under our procedural law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[F]or this\n   court judiciously and efficiently to consider claims of error raised on appeal ... the parties must clearly and fully set forth their arguments in their briefs....
