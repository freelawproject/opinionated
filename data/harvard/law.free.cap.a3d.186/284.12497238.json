Significantly, he challenges the admission in evidence of the answer he filed in a parallel civil forfeiture case. We reject defendant's argument that admission of this evidence violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, but we hold that, in the context of this case, the process by which the State induced defendant to file the answer was fundamentally unfair. Although the evidence should not have been admitted, we conclude that the error was harmless. We provide guidance for future forfeiture proceedings to avoid the unfairness that occurred in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We affirm the convictions on all counts, except for the conviction for second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon. Due to plain error in the jury charge, we reverse and remand for retrial as to that count only. We affirm the sentence of thirty years, fifteen years to be served without parole.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The following evidence was the subject of a pre-trial motion to reveal the identity of a confidential informant (CI). The Hoboken police conducted a month-long investigation, during which they used a CI to make several undercover purchases (controlled buys) of drugs from defendant. The CI made the purchases at an\n   apartment on the sixth floor of a building located at a specific address on Marshall Street in Hoboken (the Marshall Street apartment).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on the controlled buys, the police obtained a search warrant for the Marshall Street apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Next, we summarize the evidence placed before the jury during the trial. The police arrived at the Marshall Street apartment to conduct a search pursuant to a warrant. When the apartment's occupants would not immediately open the door for the police, the officers broke down the door with a battering ram. During the search, which focused on the apartment's back bedroom, the police found 347 bags of heroin, packaged in bundles. Some of the heroin was found in dresser drawers, along with other types of CDS. The police also found a metal sifter, equipment used to seal plastic bags, stamping equipment of a kind used to label bags of heroin, drug testing kits, hypodermic needles, a radio scanner, and a book of radio frequencies used by various law enforcement agencies. In a bedroom closet, the police also found handcuffs, a\n   digital scale, a .44 magnum handgun and $2900 in cash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The State presented the following evidence connecting defendant to the back bedroom. In the same dresser drawer that contained some of the heroin, the police found two prescription pill bottles with defendant's name on them. One of the bottles contained Oxycodone pills. The other contained allergy medicine. Each bottle listed a different address for defendant, one in Newark and the other in Brooklyn. The police seized the pill bottles, and they were introduced in evidence at the trial. On cross-examination, one of the officers testified that, during the search of the bedroom, he found some \"personal papers\" with defendant's name on them; however, he did not seize those documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In the bedroom closet that contained the cash and the handgun, the police also found and seized a set of handcuffs with the name \"Zulma\" engraved on them. At the trial, defendant's former live-in\n   girlfriend, a law enforcement officer named Zulma, identified the handcuffs as having been issued to her by her employer. She testified that she had several pairs of handcuffs and did not realize that pair was missing. The former girlfriend also testified that she had a twelve-year relationship with defendant and had two children with him. Their relationship ended in 2001, and she never lived in the Marshall Street apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   While the search of the apartment was proceeding, one of the officers walked into the hallway outside the apartment and saw defendant emerge from a sixth-floor stairwell. The officer placed defendant under arrest. At the police station, another officer asked defendant for some routine pedigree information in order to complete the arrest report. According to this officer, when he asked defendant for his home address, defendant gave the address of the Marshall Street apartment. The officer recorded that information on the arrest report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The State also presented evidence from which a jury could reasonably infer that other members of defendant's family lived in the Marshall Street apartment. When the police entered the apartment, they found it occupied by a man and a woman, both in their fifties or sixties, and a young child-all named \"Melendez.\" The man and woman attended the trial, and one of the testifying police officers identified them to the jury as the two adults named Melendez who were present in the apartment during the search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The State also introduced evidence that defendant filed an answer to a civil forfeiture complaint, in which he admitted that the $2900 belonged to him and claimed it was the lawful proceeds of a check issued to him by the federal government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On this appeal, defendant challenges the conviction and the sentence, raising the following points of argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   POINT I: BECAUSE THE STATE OBTAINED DEFENDANT'S STATEMENT IN A QUASI-CRIMINAL CIVIL FORFEITURE ACTION POST-INDICTMENT, WITHOUT ADMINISTERING\n   <em>\n    MIRANDA\n   </em>\n   RIGHTS, AND THROUGH\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   COERCION BY THREATENING TO PERMANENTLY DEPRIVE DEFENDANT OF HIS PROPERTY, THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN RULING THAT THE STATEMENT WAS ADMISSIBLE IN THE STATE'S CASE-IN-CHIEF DURING DEFENDANT'S RELATED CRIMINAL TRIAL\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   POINT II: THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN PERMITTING TESTIMONY AT TRIAL AS TO AN ALLEGED\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   STATEMENT MADE BY DEFENDANT WITHOUT FIRST CONDUCTING A HEARING TO DETERMINE ADMISSIBILITY, AS REQUIRED BY N.J.R.E. 104(C).

As a result, defendant's\n   statement, that the Marshall Street apartment was his home address, was admissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The arrest report was provided in discovery, and the introduction of the information should not have come as a surprise to the defense. We find no abuse of the trial judge's discretion in denying defense counsel's mid-trial request for a N.J.R.E. 104(c) hearing concerning the contents of the arrest report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Because no rule of law required that the trial judge make a preliminary finding of admissibility as to this statement, a N.J.R.E. 104(c) hearing was not required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.R.E. 104(c) (requiring an in limine hearing \"[w]here by virtue of any rule of law a judge is required in a criminal action to make a preliminary determination as to the admissibility\" of a defendant's statement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As to Point V, the motion judge did not abuse her discretion in denying defendant's application to reveal the identity of the confidential informant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The CI was not a witness in the\n   case, and the charges against defendant were not based on his prior sales of drugs to the CI.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.R.E. 516 ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

We affirm on this point for the reasons stated by the judge in her thorough February 2, 2012 written opinion. Defendant's arguments are without sufficient merit to warrant further discussion.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   2:11-3(e)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Addressing defendant's Point III, we agree that the police narcotics expert should not have been permitted to opine-based on a long hypothetical question that incorporated most of the evidence in this case-that narcotics were packaged and sold from the apartment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, in the context of this case, the error was harmless. The remainder of the expert's testimony consisted of unobjectionable explanations about the drug trade and how the various pieces of evidence found in the back bedroom would be\n   used in manufacturing and distributing heroin. Given the quantity of heroin in the room and the overwhelming admissible evidence, this error would not have caused the jury to convict defendant when it otherwise might have acquitted him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   2:10-2;\n   <em>\n    State v. Macon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1940860\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/57/325/#p337\">\n    57 N.J. 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 337-38,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=273%20A.2d%201\">\n    273 A.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1971).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Addressing defendant's Point IV, we agree that the trial court's charge on second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon was fatally flawed. The error was simple. The trial judge\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   forgot to include in the charge an essential element of the offense-that the State had to prove that defendant did not have a permit for the handgun.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 2C:39-5(b) ;\n   <em>\n    Model Jury Charge (Criminal)\n   </em>\n   , \"Unlawful Possession of a Handgun\" (2001). Instead, through oversight, the judge only charged the jury that the State had to prove that defendant knowingly possessed the handgun. At some point, the judge realized the error and remarked to counsel that the charge was wrong, but he did not call the jury back and give them the correct charge. Instead, he allowed them to proceed to a verdict. As a result, defendant's conviction on that charge must be reversed and the matter remanded to the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Because the trial court merged the firearm possession conviction with the conviction for drug distribution while in possession of a firearm, it is possible that the State will decide not to retry defendant on the firearm possession charge. Within thirty days of the date of this opinion, the State shall inform the trial court in writing whether it intends to proceed with a retrial on this charge. If the State does not intend to pursue the charge, the trial court shall promptly issue an amended judgment of conviction consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Next, we address defendant's arguments concerning the State's introduction, at his criminal trial, of the answer he previously filed in the civil forfeiture action. We review a trial court's evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion, but we review its legal interpretations de novo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Nantambu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4205797\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/221/390/#p402\">\n    221 N.J. 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 402,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4205797\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/221/390/#p402\">\n    113 A.3d 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   These are the most pertinent facts, some of which are derived from the trial judge's April 23, 2013 opinion. According to the opinion, on November 9, 2010, the day\n   after defendant's arrest, he appeared in the Central Judicial Processing court \"for the arraignment on these charges and setting of bail.\" Because defendant was determined to be indigent, his case was referred to the Office of the Public Defender (OPD) for assignment of counsel and \"a public defender represented the defendant regarding the setting of bail.\" About a month later, on December 20, 2010, the same prosecutor's office that was conducting the criminal prosecution filed a civil forfeiture action against defendant and multiple other individuals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   With respect to defendant, the complaint sought forfeiture of the $2900 found in the Marshall Street apartment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On February 3, 2011, the forfeiture complaint was served on defendant in the Hudson County jail, where he was being held on the charges for which he had been arrested in this case. As the trial judge found, \"[t]he State did not serve the defendant's counsel (his public defender representing him for the criminal matter) a copy of the civil forfeiture complaint.\" Nor did the complaint or summons advise defendant that any statement he made in connection with the forfeiture action could be used against him in a criminal prosecution, or that if a criminal prosecution was\n   ongoing, he should make his criminal defense attorney aware of the forfeiture complaint before responding to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Nor did the complaint or summons place defendant on notice of his right to request a stay of the forfeiture complaint pending the outcome of his criminal trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 2C:64-3(f). Instead, the summons contained the standard language advising defendant that he had to file an answer within thirty-five days or face default. The summons advised him that he could contact Legal Services for representation, although that agency does not handle forfeiture cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendant was indicted in the criminal case on February 15, 2011, twelve days after the prosecutor's office served him with the forfeiture complaint. On March 22, 2011, defendant sent a handwritten letter to the judge handling the forfeiture case asking for an extension of time to file an answer. Defendant's letter also asked that counsel be appointed to represent him in the forfeiture action, because he was incarcerated in the county jail and his access to legal advice was \"severely limited.\" Defendant was arraigned on the indictment on March 23, 2011. He was represented by an OPD attorney at that event, but there is no indication in the hearing transcript that his defense counsel knew about the pending forfeiture case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   According to the motion judge's opinion, on April 25, 2011, defendant filed a pro se answer in the forfeiture case, asserting that the $2900 belonged to him and that it was the proceeds of a check issued to him by the federal government.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On August 22, 2012, an assistant prosecutor wrote to the Civil Division Manager, asking that the scheduled forfeiture trial be\n   adjourned until the conclusion of defendant's\n   related criminal case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The letter stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   The above referenced matter is a civil forfeiture action [in] which Luis A. Melendez is currently scheduled for trial on September 5, 2012. The forfeiture complaint arises out of Luis A. Melendez's arrest on November 8, 2010, where he is a defendant in a criminal case. I am requesting that the matter be adjourned and held in abeyance until the criminal action is complete.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Luis A. Melendez is currently incarcerated and filed an answer Pro Se. Mr. Melendez is scheduled for a status conference regarding the criminal matter on September 6, 2012.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The letter was \"cc'd\" to defendant but not to his OPD attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In the criminal trial, the State was permitted to introduce defendant's answer in the forfeiture case as an admission that he owned the $2900, thus linking defendant to the back bedroom and its contents. The trial court rejected defendant's arguments that introducing the answer would violate his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On this appeal, defendant, joined by amicus curiae American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey (ACLU), contends that the State's actions in this case violated his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination by eliciting an incriminating statement without providing\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings; circumvented his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, by eliciting incriminating statements from him while he was represented by counsel; and unfairly required him to sacrifice his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in order to assert his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights against seizure of his property without due process. The ACLU also contends that even if federal constitutional principles do not control here, we should also consider New Jersey jurisprudence that offers greater protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that the facts of this case do not squarely fit within the rubric of the Fifth or Sixth Amendments or analogous New Jersey constitutional principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We also conclude that it is not necessary to decide the case on constitutional principles, because what occurred in this case so clearly violated the doctrine of fundamental fairness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   A. The forfeiture statute\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   To put our conclusion in perspective, we begin by discussing the civil forfeiture statute. The statute, N.J.S.A. 2C:64-1 to -9, allows the State to file an in rem action against two primary categories of seized property: (a) prima facie contraband, such as illegal drugs; and (b) derivative contraband, which is either the proceeds of illegal activity, or property that has been used or is intended to be used to further an unlawful activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 2C:64-1(a). In this case, the State contended that the $2900 found in the closet was derivative contraband, being the proceeds of illegal drug sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   After seizing alleged derivative contraband, the State must file a civil in rem action within ninety days of the seizure if it wishes to seek forfeiture of the property. N.J.S.A. 2C:64-3(a). The State must give notice of the action \"to any person known to have a property interest in the article.\" N.J.S.A. 2C:64-3(c).

Given his admission to the police that he lived in that apartment, the fact that he was arrested emerging from a stairwell on the same floor of the building as the apartment, and evidence that his family lived there, any rational jury would conclude that defendant lived in the apartment. Further, there was other evidence connecting defendant to the back bedroom. That evidence included the two pill bottles with his name on them in the dresser, his ex-girlfriend's unique, monogrammed handcuffs in the closet, and testimony that defendant's personal papers were found in the bedroom. We conclude that defendant's admission that he owned the money in the closet did not cause the jury to convict defendant when they otherwise might have acquitted him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   2:10-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   D. Future guidance\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Although no prejudicial error occurred in this case, we conclude that some procedural modifications are needed in the initiation of forfeiture actions, to prevent this fundamentally unfair situation from recurring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   If a related criminal case is pending, the State must serve defendant's criminal defense lawyer with a courtesy copy of the forfeiture complaint at the same time that the State serves the defendant. Whether or not a criminal case is pending, the State must serve, along with the summons and forfeiture complaint, a notice that more accurately apprises the defendant of his or her rights in the forfeiture case than the standard summons currently does. The notice must advise the defendant that the State has filed a criminal case against the defendant, which relates to the facts asserted in the forfeiture complaint; or, if the State has not yet filed charges, the notice shall advise the defendant that the State may file such criminal charges in the future. The notice must state that any statements the defendant makes in the forfeiture case, including in\n   the answer to the complaint or in a motion to recover the forfeited property, may be introduced in evidence against him or her in a criminal case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The notice must state that the defendant does not have to file an answer to the complaint right now, but instead may ask the court to stay (delay) the forfeiture case until any criminal prosecution is over. However, to avoid losing the forfeiture case by default, the defendant must either file an answer to the complaint or file a motion for a stay, within thirty-five days of receipt of the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The notice must also tell the defendant that he or she may wish to consult with a lawyer before deciding whether to file an answer, a motion for a stay, or any other pleading in the forfeiture case. The notice must state that, if a criminal case is pending, the defendant should contact the attorney who represents him or her in the criminal case, and that even if the defendant's criminal attorney cannot represent him or her in the forfeiture action, the attorney may be able to provide the defendant with some important advice about the matter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   We acknowledge there may be other effective procedures that would address this issue. For example, a defendant's statements made in a forfeiture case might be barred from admission in a parallel criminal action, except for impeachment purposes. However, the Legislature has not taken that step, as it has, for example in the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act, N.J.S.A. 2C:25-29(a), and at least in the context of this case, we do not conclude that the constitution requires it. There may be other practical approaches that would protect the rights of defendants without burdening prosecutors' offices, the OPD, or the court system. We refer this issue to the Civil Practice Committee and the Criminal Practice Committee for their consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Lastly, we affirm the sentence. Contrary to defendant's argument, the judge provided a sufficiently detailed statement of reasons for the sentence, including defendant's multiple prior federal and state convictions and the fact that he was on parole when he committed the current offenses.
