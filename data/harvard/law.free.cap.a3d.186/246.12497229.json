The Court has determined that the issue of the warrantless search for driving credentials should be remanded to the Superior Court, Appellate Division, for reconsideration in light of this Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    State v. Ornette M. Terry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12492690\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/179/378/12492690/#p223\">\n    232 N.J. 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 223,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12492690,12492691\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/179/378/\">\n    179 A.3d 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), and it is so ordered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Defendant's appeal challenging the prosecutor's exercise of peremptory challenges\n   is dismissed without prejudice.
