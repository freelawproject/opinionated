On appeal, the defendant claims that the court's orders were improperly based on the trial judge's admitted bias and prejudice arising from her personal experience as a female golfer. He additionally claims that the court's order requiring him to pay the plaintiff's counsel fees constituted an abuse of discretion where the court made no finding of contempt on the basis of his challenged conduct and the plaintiff had ample financial means to pay her own counsel fees. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The underlying facts are uncontroverted. Following a trial before the court,\n   <em>\n    Winslow, J.\n   </em>\n   , the marriage of the parties was dissolved by a memorandum of decision dated November 18, 2014. As part of its judgment, the court entered various orders regarding custody, support, periodic and lump sum alimony, and property. Included in these orders was a provision that the defendant would \"retain sole rights to the country club membership at Silver Spring Country Club.\" Shortly thereafter, on December 5, 2014, the defendant\n   appealed to this court, outlining in his preliminary statement of issues numerous claims as to the trial court's financial orders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In conjunction with the appeal, the parties participated in a preargument conference.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At\n   the conference, the parties reached an agreement resolving all the issues on appeal. Accordingly, on May 21, 2015, their agreement was memorialized and entered by the court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. George Levine\n   </em>\n   , judge trial referee, as a modified judgment. The modified judgment included the following provision pertinent to the issues now before this court: \"The following sentence shall be added to paragraph 38 [of the original judgment]: The defendant agrees to pay 50 percent of the plaintiff's initiation fee to Innis Arden Country Club.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, upon the entering of the modified judgment, the appeal was withdrawn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In spite of the parties' accord, disagreements between them continued unabated. By a pleading dated August 17, 2015, the plaintiff moved that the defendant be held in contempt for his alleged failure to comply with the life insurance provision of the dissolution judgment, as modified. Later, by a pleading dated October 6, 2015, the plaintiff moved that the defendant be held in contempt for not timely or fully paying his court-ordered child support. On October 13, 2015, the plaintiff moved that the defendant be held in contempt for his alleged failure to comply with the country club initiation fee\n   provision in the modified judgment. The plaintiff also sought counsel fees in conjunction with the prosecution of these postjudgment contempt motions. Finally, by a motion dated December 9, 2015, the plaintiff sought an order that the defendant be required to timely meet his obligation to make periodic payments to her in accordance with the terms of the judgment, as modified. That motion was subsequently marked \"off.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   These postjudgment matters first appeared on the short calendar docket on December 14, 2015. On that date, counsel and the court,\n   <em>\n    Winslow, J.\n   </em>\n   , engaged in a discussion regarding the nature of the pending motions with an eye toward having them heard on a later date. During this colloquy, the defendant's counsel stated his belief that the court would need to hear evidence concerning the defendant's intentions at the time he entered into the postjudgment country club initiation fee agreement. The court, however, disagreed, stating as follows that the plaintiff should be entitled to a membership level at the Innis Arden Country Club equal to that of the defendant at his own club: \"Whatever it is, it's going to be the same for her.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 8, 2016, the court conducted a hearing on the pending motions for contempt and for counsel fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Heard and decided by the court on that date were the following: the plaintiff's request for counsel fees in conjunction with her motion for contempt dated August 17, 2015, regarding life insurance;\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the plaintiff's motion\n   for contempt dated October 6, 2015, regarding child support and request for counsel fees in conjunction with that motion; and the plaintiff's motion for contempt dated October 13, 2015, alleging the defendant's failure to comply with the country club initiation fee provision in the modified judgment and a request for counsel fees in conjunction with that motion. Although not finding the defendant in contempt, the court ordered the defendant to pay one half of the $70,000 initiation fee for a senior membership at the Innis Arden Country Club and to contribute the sum of $5750 toward the plaintiff's counsel fees relating to the life insurance, child support, and country club initiation fee contempt motions. During the hearing, in response to the request of the defendant's counsel to introduce evidence of the plaintiff's golf history, the court stated: \"Don't care what her golf history is, it's what her future is going to be.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Subsequently, the defendant filed a motion with the court to reargue and to reconsider its orders. The court conducted a hearing on April 18, 2016, but denied the motion to reargue. As part of its reasoning for the denial, the court stated: \"I don't think it was because I had a misapprehension of facts. I think it was because I took what facts were presented and applied my prejudices, and every judge has-has life history, and life experience that comes out, perhaps, in the way that we rule on certain things. And you happened to have hit a nerve on this one.\" This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We are mindful that the defendant did not, at any time, ask the court to recuse itself or move for disqualification of the judge. Thus, the defendant's claim of judicial bias is raised for the first time on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the\n   outset, we acknowledge that ordinarily a reviewing court will not entertain an issue raised for the first time on appeal.\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mazda Motor of America, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20Conn.%20610\">\n    313 Conn. 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 619,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20A.3d%201079\">\n    99 A.3d 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). We also are mindful that although this court may review an unpreserved claim of judicial bias for plain error, not every claim of partiality warrants reversal on the basis of plain error. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    D'Antonio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3144456\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/274/658/#p690\">\n    274 Conn. 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 690-91,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=877%20A.2d%20696\">\n    877 A.2d 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005) (although it was improper for trial court to sentence defendant after actively participating in negotiations, court's conduct did not rise to level of bias or implicate integrity of process). Nevertheless, under the present circumstances, we find it necessary to review the defendant's claim of judicial bias under our doctrine of plain error. See\n   <em>\n    Cameron\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cameron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"497673\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/187/163/#p168\">\n    187 Conn. 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 168,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=444%20A.2d%20915\">\n    444 A.2d 915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982) (Supreme Court reviewed unpreserved claim of judicial bias under plain error because it \"implicates basic concepts of fair trial\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"[The plain error] doctrine, codified at Practice Book \u00a7 60-5, is an extraordinary remedy used by appellate courts to rectify errors committed at trial that, although unpreserved, are of such monumental proportion that they threaten to erode our system of justice and work a serious and manifest injustice on the aggrieved party. [T]he plain error doctrine ... is not ... a rule of reviewability. It is a rule of reversibility.

On the basis of representations by counsel, the Innis Arden Country Club offers three levels of membership, with an initiation fee of $70,000 for a senior membership, $38,000 for an associate membership, and $5000 for a house membership. The court opined that it suspected that \"neither party anticipated the problem\" as to the level of the plaintiff's membership in their agreement, or thus in the modified judgment, and that the judgment \"is vague, and needs to be defined.\" We agree with this legal determination. Because the phrase \"initiation fee\" in the modified judgment could have referred to any one of three available levels of membership in the Innis Arden Country Club, each with its distinct initiation fee, that phrase, as used in the modified judgment, was ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Once the court made this correct determination, its task became to ascertain, through a fact bound inquiry, the intent of the parties in using the subject language in their postjudgment agreement. Rather than doing so, however, the court took a different tack. Instead of attempting to ascertain the intent of the parties, the court read its own outcome preference into the disputed language. In doing so, the trial judge explicitly based her ruling on her personal experiences and resulting prejudices instead of seeking to determine the parties' intent in utilizing the language in question. In other words, the court did not undertake the fact bound task of discerning the parties' intent but, instead, ascribed a meaning to the phrase \"initiation fee\" derived solely from its own perception of the historically unfair treatment of women golfers in country clubs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   During the hearings on the motions under review, although the trial judge made clear her intent to base the order regarding the country club initiation fee on her own experiences and prejudices, and not the parties' intent, the defendant at no time sought the court's recusal; nor did the defendant bring to the judge's attention any concerns he may have had regarding her impartiality. Rather, we reiterate, he raises the issue of judicial bias for the first time on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"[A]n appellate court may reach an unpreserved issue sua sponte, pursuant to the plain error doctrine, if: (1) the parties have had a chance to brief the issue; (2) further factual findings are not needed to resolve the issue; (3) the answer to the issue is so obvious as to be not debatable; and (4) leaving the judgment intact would work a manifest injustice.\"\n   <em>\n    Matos\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ortiz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486824\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/144/425/#p790\">\n    166 Conn.

We determine that these requirements have all been met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As discussed previously in this opinion, the parties filed supplemental briefs on the issue of whether this court should accord plain error review. The record clearly reveals that the trial judge repeatedly stated her perception of the subordinate role to which women are relegated in country clubs and, borrowing from her personal experience, determined that the plaintiff should be entitled to precisely the same level of membership in her country club as the defendant enjoyed in his. The court telegraphed this inclination at the December 14, 2015 hearing on this matter and later\n   simply confirmed this view based, not on evidence of the parties' intent in utilizing the language in question, but on the court's stated unfavorable experiences as a woman golfer. Thus, the court not only acted in a partial manner, but it also made plain its biased and prejudiced pathway to making its decision. This impropriety was clear, obvious, and indisputable.\n   In response, the plaintiff correctly argues that a trial judge need not leave insights and common sense derived from her life's experience at the courthouse door. We do not disagree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, attitudes garnered from personal life experience cannot serve as a substitute for properly admitted evidence at a hearing where the court's mandate is to ascertain the intent of the parties. \"Judicial impartiality is the hallmark of the American system of justice.\" 48A C.J.S., Judges \u00a7 247 (2018). The background and experience of a trial judge are disqualifying only if they prevent that judge from assessing the evidence fairly and impartially. \"It is assumed that judges, regardless of their personal backgrounds and experiences in life, will be able to set aside any biases or predispositions they might have and consider each case in light of the evidence presented.\"\n   <em>\n    People\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tye\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3238549\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/141/1/#p25\">\n    141 Ill. 2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 25,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=565%20N.E.2d%20931\">\n    565 N.E.2d 931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=152%20Ill.%20Dec.%20249\">\n    152 Ill.Dec. 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6341249,6342563,6339621,6341029,6339785,6341901,6340143,6341488,6340433,6342353,6340630,6340825,6342106,6341663,6339967\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/833/\">\n    502 U.S. 833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=112%20S.%20Ct.%20112\">\n    112 S.Ct. 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20L.%20Ed.%202d%2081\">\n    116 L.Ed. 2d 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991).\n   In the present case, however, the trial judge's responsibility did not allow her to borrow from her life experiences extrinsic to the law. As the record plainly reflects, the trial judge did not follow her prescribed decision-making pathway but, instead, relied exclusively on her own prejudices born of her life experiences. The court's proper focus should have been on the well established decisional pathway for determining the intent of parties who use ambiguous language in a contract, requiring it to determine the meaning of that language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"[T]he floor established by the Due Process Clause clearly requires a fair trial in a fair tribunal ... before a judge with no actual bias against the defendant or interest in the outcome of [a] particular case.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Bracy\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gramley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11653326\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/899/#p904\">\n    520 U.S. 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 904-905,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11653326\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/899/#p904\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11653326\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/899/#p904\">\n    138 L.Ed. 2d 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997). In sum, the responsibility of the court in hearing a disputed matter is to act with impartiality. This requirement entails not only being impartial but also acting in a manner that projects impartiality.

I mean, I already was aware that there was a claim that [the plaintiff] had had very limited golfing, in the recent years. In fact, I thought it was virtually, nothing. But I guess, maybe from a golfer's point of view, what you just said is virtually nothing, too. But what I heard was ... [that] even if she hadn't been doing it, she was going to take it, or wanted the option of taking it up. \"So, it was not from any lack of factual evidence. I mean, if you feel to make a further record that you want [the defendant] to testify as to what you just said, I guess you could do so .... I had that information, and maybe it wasn't taken from formal testimony. Maybe it was from argument. I presumed it to be correct when I interpreted the judgment.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n    \"[The Defendant's Counsel]: Okay.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n    \"The Court: I don't think it was because I had a misapprehension of facts.

Nor do we know from the record the portion of the counsel fees ordered that pertained to the country club initiation fee dispute and the portion that may have related to other pending motions. Additionally, because we resolve this matter on the basis stated, we do not reach the question of whether the court properly could have ordered the defendant to pay counsel fees to the plaintiff where he was not held in contempt and where she had adequate funds to pay her own counsel fees.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
