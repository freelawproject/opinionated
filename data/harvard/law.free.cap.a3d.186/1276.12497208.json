Lamkin appeals from a judgment entered by the District Court (Portland,\n   <em>\n    J. French, J.\n   </em>\n   ) concluding that she did not have standing to pursue a claim for visitation rights with her grandchild pursuant to the Grandparents Visitation Act (GVA), 19-A M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1801 - 1805 (2017), and, on that basis, dismissing her petition. On appeal, Deborah contends that the court erred in its standing determination.

Lamkin is the mother of Corrie L. Lamkin and the grandmother of the child at issue here. Corrie gave birth to the child in 2008. For the two years following the child's birth, Corrie and her child lived with Deborah and Deborah's husband until Corrie and the child moved into their own home. After Corrie and the child moved, Deborah had contact with the child \"several days per week,\" including \"almost every weekend.\" After the child entered daycare, Deborah cared for him two days per week. Once the child started school, on Wednesdays, Deborah met him when he got off the bus, and he stayed for dinner at her house. That pattern continued until December of 2016, when Corrie became involved in a relationship with her current boyfriend, who causes Deborah concern because he is a registered sex offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 4] On June 2, 2017, Deborah filed a petition, accompanied by an affidavit,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1803(2)(A), to \"establish grandparent's rights\" pursuant to the GVA, seeking \"specific rights of visitation, contact, etc., and/or ... primary physical residence\" of the child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition to reciting many of the facts noted above, which were later addressed in the judgment, Deborah stated in her affidavit that in February of 2017, Corrie left the child with her for five days while Corrie visited Florida, and later that month, both Corrie and the child stayed at Deborah's residence for three weeks after Deborah's husband died. Deborah also alleged that since March of 2017, Corrie has prevented her from having contact with the child. She concluded her affidavit as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   I feel that [the boyfriend] is not a good influence on my daughter, and may present a safety hazard for [the child]. I feel it is in [the child's] best interest to have specific rights of contact and visitation with me, at specific times and dates, and/or for [the child's] primary physical residence to be with me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b6 5] In response, Corrie filed a motion to dismiss for lack of standing. As allowed by statute,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1803(2)(B),\n   Corrie also filed an affidavit in which she stated, among other things, that since the child was three months old, he has been consistently enrolled in daycare or afterschool care and that Deborah has never provided or offered to provide full-time care for the child; that the boyfriend's conviction was based on electronic sexual communications with a teenage girl; that Corrie has attended some of her boyfriend's therapy sessions so she could learn of anything needed for the child's safety; that the boyfriend's probation officer has approved of the boyfriend's contact with the child; that, at Corrie's request, the probation officer notified the Department of Health and Human Services of Corrie's relationship with the boyfriend \"to make sure we had proper approval from every possible angle and that we were above board,\" and that the Department chose not to investigate or become involved in the matter; that, at an activity the child regularly attends, Deborah has had contact with him against Corrie's wishes; and that Deborah is attempting to control Corrie's parenting of the child, which Deborah has done throughout the child's life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b6 6] Two days after Corrie filed her motion to dismiss Deborah's petition, the court granted the motion. The court's order set out the factual findings described above.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court then analyzed the information in the parties' affidavits in terms of the legal standards governing de facto parenthood cases,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1891(2), (3) (2017), and found that Deborah had not provided \"consistent caretaking\" of the child; that Corrie had not \"understood, acknowledged or accepted that or behaved as though [Deborah] is a parent of the child\"; and that Deborah had not \"accepted full and permanent responsibilities as a parent of [the child],\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8204896\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/957/74/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1891(3)(B)-(D). On that basis, the court concluded that Deborah had not established standing because she failed to make a \"prima facie showing of de facto parentage as required ... under the Grandparents Visitation Act\" to proceed on her petition. (Italics omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b6 7] Deborah filed a \"Motion to Reconsider/or for Hearing\" in which she asserted that her relationship with the child rises to the level of a de facto parent and is \"substantially greater than that of a normal and involved grandparent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Deborah also filed another affidavit, in which she requested that the court hold an evidentiary hearing where she would present the testimony of third-party witnesses \"who would verify [her] role as a de facto\n   parent to [the child].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the affidavit, Deborah stated, among other things, that she had encouraged Corrie to enroll the child in daycare so that Corrie would be financially responsible for the child and the child would have interaction with others of his age; that Corrie \"broke off communication\" between Deborah and the child, but Deborah continued to see the child at activities where Corrie was also present and therefore knew that Deborah was present; that Corrie provided Deborah's contact information to third parties to be used in an emergency; and that Corrie has consulted Deborah on parenting issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b6 8] The court denied Deborah's motion, concluding that, even with the additional submissions,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   n.3, she had not demonstrated standing and that a hearing was unnecessary because the body of facts set forth in her various affidavits \"fail to establish the elements of de facto parenthood required under Maine law.\" Deborah timely appealed to us.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   14 M.R.S. \u00a7 1901(1) (2017) ; 19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 104 (2017) ; M.R. App. P. 2(b)(3) (Tower 2016).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b6 9] Deborah argues on appeal that the court erred by dismissing her petition based on its determination that she failed to establish standing. Deborah's petition stated that it was predicated on the GVA, but, as we have noted above,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b64, 7, her submissions to the court also introduced concepts that are specific to the law of de facto parenthood.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court made its standing determination pursuant to the de facto parentage framework prescribed in the Maine Parentage Act (MPA),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1891(3). We conclude that, as a matter of law, when the substance of Deborah's petition is viewed solely as one to establish rights pursuant to the GVA itself, the evidence in the record is insufficient to demonstrate that Deborah has standing. Further, to the extent that Deborah's claim is viewed as one to establish de facto parenthood, she has not demonstrated standing not only because-as the court concluded-the information in the record did not satisfy all of the statutory standing elements, but also because her failure to demonstrate standing pursuant to the GVA necessarily means that she cannot meet the greater standing requirements governing de facto parenthood cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b6 10] We examine the legal aspects of a court's standing determination de novo and review for clear error the factual findings underlying that determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19-A M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1803(2), 1891(2) ;\n   <em>\n    Philbrook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8204896\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/957/74/\">\n    2008 ME 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8204896\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/957/74/\">\n    957 A.2d 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Bissias v.

Standing Principles in GVA and De Facto Parenthood Cases\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b6 11] In its judgment, the court equated the standing requirements in a GVA proceeding with those applicable to a de facto parenthood case. As we explain below, however, there can be a material difference between the two. Accordingly, before addressing how those standards apply to Deborah's petition, we consider the relationship between the statutory principles of standing in GVA and de facto parenthood proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b6 12] A third party's action to establish rights regarding someone else's child interferes with the parent's fundamental right to raise that child and decide with whom, and under what circumstances, the child may have contact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rideout v.

No other urgent reasons have yet been identified.\" (citation omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [\u00b6 17] Therefore, in an action brought under the GVA, when a grandparent attempts to establish standing to pursue a claim for rights of visitation with or access to the child through evidence of a de facto parent relationship, then-contrary to the court's reasoning here-that standing will rest not on the proof that would be required in a de facto parenthood case itself, but rather on proof of standing as prescribed in the GVA, namely, the existence of a \"sufficient existing relationship\" that rises to the level of an \"urgent reason\" as we have explained that principle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   If, however, a petitioner who happens\n   to be a grandparent seeks to be adjudicated as a de facto parent, then the petitioner will be required to prove standing pursuant to de facto parenthood principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   [\u00b6 18] While the differences between the standing requirements in GVA and de facto parenthood proceedings are now a function of statute, we previously described the reason why those differences exist. In a GVA proceeding, a court may award the limited rights of visitation or access, but only to the extent that the award does not \"significantly interfere with any parent-child relationship or with the parent's rightful authority over the child.\" 19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1803(3). This contrasts with de facto parenthood proceedings, as well as child protection and guardianship cases, where there is the prospect of a much more profound disruption of a parent's relationship with his or her child because the full panoply of parental rights and responsibilities can be awarded to third persons, thereby requiring a stronger justification to allow the case to progress to a plenary hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pitts v. Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6960835\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/90/1169/\">\n    2014 ME 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6960835\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/90/1169/\">\n    90 A.3d 1169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting 19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1803(3) ). Therefore, not only do the elemental standing requirements differ in the two types of proceedings, but the overall principle and nature of standing in a de facto parenthood case must be seen conceptually as more substantial than in GVA cases in order to justify the deeper level of governmental intrusion into a parent's constitutionally protected interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   [\u00b6 19] Against this legal backdrop, we now consider the sufficiency of evidence of Deborah's standing to pursue rights pursuant to the GVA and as a de facto parent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   B. Sufficiency of Evidence of Deborah's Standing\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [\u00b6 20] As we have noted, Deborah commenced this action pursuant to the GVA but also raised the specter of de facto parenthood, and the court's analysis centered on the standing requirements imposed in a de facto parenthood case. Therefore, we review Deborah's petition both as a claim pursuant to the GVA and one seeking de facto parenthood. We first conclude that Deborah has not established, as a matter of law, that she has standing to pursue a GVA claim. And beyond that, she has failed to demonstrate standing for a de facto parenthood claim both because, as the court correctly concluded, the record does not satisfy all of the statutory elements, and also because her failure to meet the lower threshold of GVA standing necessarily means that she cannot meet the greater standard imposed in de facto parenthood claims. We address Deborah's claim of standing in both contexts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [\u00b6 21] Preliminarily, we note that in its order, the court examined Deborah's factual assertions that were most supportive of her claim. With one exception relating to Corrie's boyfriend, discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b624, the court did so by accepting those assertions as true, which is an evidentiary standard that was more generous than that to which Deborah was actually entitled. The GVA specifically provides that the court shall make its standing determination based on facts\n   <em>\n    found\n   </em>\n   by the court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1803(2)(C) (\"The court shall determine on the basis of the petition and the affidavit\n   <em>\n    whether it is more likely than not\n   </em>\n   that there is a sufficient existing relationship or, if a sufficient relationship does not exist, that a sufficient effort to\n   establish one has been made.\" (emphasis added) ). Similarly, as we stated in an opinion published after the court issued its judgment, when attempting to demonstrate standing in a de facto parenthood case, the petitioner is subject to a burden of persuasion and not merely one of production.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20ME%2072\">\n    2018 ME 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 19, 25-26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12497394\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/186/837/\">\n    186 A.3d 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even when the record is viewed as the court did, Deborah has not demonstrated standing to become entitled to a plenary hearing for GVA rights or de facto parenthood, which we address in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   1. GVA Standing\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   [\u00b6 22] In her submissions, Deborah stated that Corrie and the child lived at Deborah's residence until the child turned two years old, which was at the end of 2010. Corrie and the child then moved into a separate residence. From that time until Corrie chose to limit Deborah's contact with the child starting approximately in March of 2017, Deborah's contact with the child largely occurred one day per week after school and during most weekends, and by means of electronic communication, except for a unique circumstance in early 2017, shortly after Deborah's husband died, when Corrie and the child stayed at Deborah's residence for approximately three weeks. Notably, as Deborah acknowledged in her affidavits, she provided limited care for the child, and the child remained enrolled in daycare and, later, in afterschool care. In short, although Deborah's contact with the child was on a somewhat predictable basis, that contact was nonetheless intermittent. As we have held, intermittent contact with a child is not an urgent reason that would allow a court to grant visitation rights to a grandparent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robichaud\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9314962\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/820/1212/\">\n    2003 ME 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9314962\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/820/1212/\">\n    820 A.2d 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   [\u00b6 23] In addition to the contact Deborah described, she asserted that Corrie had listed Deborah as the child's emergency contact and that Corrie consulted with her about parenting issues. These extrinsic forms of Deborah's involvement in the child's life are typical of a grandparent's support for a grandchild and cannot be seen to rise to the level of urgency necessary to allow the court to consider intruding into Corrie's constitutionally protected relationship with the child.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Katon v. Brandi M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7275109\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/32/1047/\">\n    2011 ME 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 2-3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7275109\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/32/1047/\">\n    32 A.3d 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming the dismissal of a GVA petition for lack of standing on the basis that the contact averred was \"typical for a grandparent and not extraordinary\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   [\u00b6 24] As noted above, the one contested aspect of the evidence where the court did make findings relates to Corrie's boyfriend, who is a convicted sex offender. In her affidavit, Deborah expressed concern about the child's safety in his presence. In a responsive affidavit, however, Corrie provided detailed information about her interaction with the boyfriend's probation officer and therapist to determine if the child was at risk, the probation officer's approval of contact between the boyfriend and the child, and the probation officer's contact with the Department of Health and Human Services at her request so that that agency is fully aware of the child's circumstances. Based on the information provided in these competing affidavits, the court found that Corrie had addressed Deborah's concerns. The court was entitled to make findings of this type, and the finding is supported by the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Philbrook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8204896\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/957/74/\">\n    2008 ME 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8204896\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/957/74/\">\n    957 A.2d 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In one of her affidavits, Deborah expressly asserted that the presence of the boyfriend in the child's life was one of the two specific circumstances that, she claimed, entitled her to rights to the child even over the\n   mother's objection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to the court's findings, her concern is not substantiated and cannot rise to the level of an urgent reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   [\u00b6 25] For purposes of the GVA standing analysis, Deborah therefore has not demonstrated the existence of a substantial existing relationship that constitutes an \"urgent reason,\" as we have explained that concept,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Dorr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6793893\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/467/\">\n    2016 ME 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 16-17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6793893\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/467/\">\n    140 A.3d 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , necessary to justify governmental intrusion in Corrie's relationship with her child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   2. De Facto Parenthood Standing\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   [\u00b6 26] When Deborah's petition is seen as seeking an adjudication of de facto parenthood, the court correctly concluded that her relationship with the child fell materially short of the exacting standards necessary for a third person to be determined as a child's parent. Our review of the record developed by the parties does not reveal triable contentions that Deborah engaged in consistent caretaking of the child, that Corrie accepted or acknowledged Deborah as a co-parent of the child, or that Deborah accepted \"full and permanent responsibilities\" as the child's parent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1891(3)(B)-(D). These are requisite elements of a claim to become a judicially recognized de facto parent and are therefore also elements of standing necessary to pursue that claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6793893\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/467/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1891(2)(C).

CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   [\u00b6 28] Because Deborah did not establish standing to proceed to a plenary hearing on her petition pursuant to the GVA or the more stringent statutory requirements of a de facto parenthood claim, we affirm the judgment dismissing her petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The entry is:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Deborah's petition named Corrie and the person believed to be the child's father as the respondents. In the affidavit filed with her petition, Deborah stated that the putative father did not believe that the child was his and has had little or no contact with Corrie or the child. The record does not indicate that the putative father was served, and he has not participated in this proceeding. Title 19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1803(2)(A) (2017) requires that a GVA petition and accompanying affidavits need only be served on one of the parents or legal guardians of the child. Here, Corrie accepted service of the petition, which allowed the matter to proceed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    With respect to the boyfriend, the court found that Corrie has addressed any concerns by-among other things-maintaining continuous contact with the boyfriend's probation officer and therapist, and by complying with restrictions they imposed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    As another ground stated in the motion and argued on appeal, Deborah contends that she was not given the twenty-one days allowed by rule to respond to Corrie's motion to dismiss.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    M.R. Civ. P. 7(c)(2). Even if the court acted on Corrie's motion prematurely, that error is of no moment because the court issued another order after fully considering the additional argument and factual assertions that Deborah submitted in her motion for reconsideration. If anything, that process gave Deborah a particular advantage because, in the end, she was able to respond with knowledge of the deficiencies in her standing presentation that the court described in its initial order.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    M.R. Civ. P. 61 (harmless error standard).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    In fact, the court acted with commendable expediency in acting on Corrie's motion to dismiss. Because of the disruptive effect of a third-party proceeding on a parent-child relationship,\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Rideout v.

The trial court's decision hinged upon whether Deborah established standing as a de facto parent to the child. This is not the proper test to be applied by the trial court in order to determine standing in a GVA case. Because it was the trial court that mistakenly introduced the issue of de facto parenthood, our review must focus on whether Deborah has established standing pursuant to the GVA and not pursuant to the principles of de facto parenthood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   A. The Trial Court's Application of the Wrong Standard\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   [\u00b6 30] Although Deborah's cause of action was for contact pursuant to the GVA, the Court's opinion repeatedly refers to Deborah's attempts to establish standing by proving that she was a de facto parent. Court's Opinion \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4, 7, 9, 20. For example, the Court refers to Deborah as \"a putative de facto parent\" to the child, states that Deborah's \"submissions to the court ... introduced concepts that are specific to the law of de facto parenthood,\" and asserts that even though \"Deborah commenced this action pursuant to the GVA,\" she \"raised the specter of de facto parenthood.\" Court's Opinion \u00b6\u00b6 1, 9, 20. The Court also references the language at the very end of Deborah's petition-that she was seeking \"primary physical residence\" of the child-as support that she was seeking a de facto parenthood adjudication, and yet in footnote four, the Court acknowledges that Deborah was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   seeking primary physical residence of the child. Court's Opinion \u00b6\u00b6 4, 7 n.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   [\u00b6 31] The record, however, does not support these assertions by the Court. Because a trial court's decision on standing is based on the pleadings without a hearing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1803(2)(C) (2017), we must look to the documents that were presented to the trial court prior to its decision. In Deborah's petition for contact pursuant to the GVA and her accompanying affidavit, there is no reference whatsoever to the term de facto parentage or the Maine Parentage Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1891 (2017). In response to Deborah's GVA petition, Corrie filed a motion to dismiss with an accompanying affidavit. In this responsive pleading, which incorporated a memorandum of law, there is also no reference to the term de facto parentage. The memorandum of law cites and analogizes to our case\n   <em>\n    Robichaud v. Pariseau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9314962\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/820/1212/\">\n    2003 ME 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9314962\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/820/1212/\">\n    820 A.2d 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which is a GVA case that does not involve de facto parentage issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   [\u00b6 32] Without any further documents presented to the court by Deborah or Corrie, the trial court for the first time mistakenly referenced de facto parentage when it concluded that Deborah had failed to make a prima facie showing that she was a de facto parent to the child and that she therefore lacked standing to proceed. In its order dismissing Deborah's petition for visitation, the trial court concluded that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Petitioner has not shown de facto parent status, and thus cannot constitutionally pursue visitation rights under the Grandparents Visitation Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Accordingly ... the court declines to find that she has made a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing of de facto parentage as required for her to establish standing under the Grandparents Visitation Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   [\u00b6 33] In response to the court's order, Deborah filed a motion for reconsideration and requested an alteration of the court's decision, and it was at that point, for the first time, that Deborah referred to de facto parentage and the legal precedents cited by the trial court in its order. It is obvious that she was trying to bring the facts of her case under the umbrella of de facto parentage as a result of the trial court's improper application of that standard. It is wholly inaccurate to imply, in any way, that Deborah's case strategy was the reason the trial court incorrectly applied the de facto parentage standard to determine whether Deborah had standing to proceed. Of its own volition, the trial court steered this case onto a side track dealing with de facto parentage where it did not belong; it is a mistake for us to continue down that track.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   [\u00b6 34] Although Deborah's post-judgment motion filed in the trial court and her brief on appeal construe her arguments in\n   terms of de facto parentage, that legal strategy is the logical outgrowth of the trial court's erroneous application of the de facto parentage framework to Deborah's initial GVA petition. I must reiterate that upon the GVA petition and the responsive pleading, neither Corrie nor Deborah ever mentioned de facto parentage, and it is entirely unnecessary for this Court, upon appellate review, to consider Deborah's arguments regarding de facto parentage-which she advanced only after the court improperly introduced this concept into the case-as the precursor to her GVA petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   [\u00b6 35] In the end, it should not make any difference who raised the issue of de facto parentage-the trial court used the wrong legal standard when it failed to assess standing in this case pursuant to a GVA analysis. Because this is a GVA case, and not a de facto parenthood case, the statutory requirements for standing pursuant to the GVA should be the only issue that we consider in our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   B.

Using the de facto parentage test creates a much higher bar than necessary to establish standing in a GVA case. Because this is a GVA case not involving any claim for de facto parenthood, and the trial court used the wrong legal standard, we should remand for the trial court to consider the pleadings using the proper \"extraordinary contact\" standard articulated in\n   <em>\n    Robichaud\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   [\u00b6 41] Although the Court acknowledges that the trial court used the wrong legal standard to determine Deborah's standing, it does not remand the case to the trial court to determine standing using the proper standard.

The grandmother in\n   <em>\n    Robichaud\n   </em>\n   described her contact as occasional visits with the grandchildren, with visits sometimes lasting one day to one week over about a three-year period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.

We agreed and concluded that this level of contact was \"intermittent\" and therefore did not show that the grandmother had had extraordinary contact with the grandchildren.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Dorr\n   </em>\n   , we decided that the facts-the grandmother attended a baby shower for the child, went to the hospital the evening that the child was born, and had some unspecified amount of contact with the child-did not establish a sufficient existing relationship to confer standing.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6793893\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/467/\">\n    2016 ME 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 4, 20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6793893\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/467/\">\n    140 A.3d 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   [\u00b6 44] This case is very different. The relationship between Deborah and the child was anything but ordinary or intermittent. Unlike the grandmother in\n   <em>\n    Robichaud\n   </em>\n   , Deborah's contact was extraordinary and not typical. The following facts, which are not contested, are contained in the grandmother's affidavit: Corrie and the child lived with her, full time, for the first two years of the child's life. When Corrie moved out, she moved only a half-mile away, and Corrie and the child had contact with the grandparents several days a week. Deborah had the child with her at least one day per week and most weekends for the first several years of the child's life. As soon as the child was old enough for daycare, Deborah had him two days per week while Corrie was at work, and Deborah\n   saw him almost every weekend. When the child started school, she would meet him at the bus on Wednesdays and feed him dinner. Deborah spoke with the child on the phone and through other electronic media several days per week. This close relationship continued for eight years until December of 2016, when a conflict arose between Corrie and Deborah because of Corrie's boyfriend. Later, after the child's grandfather, Deborah's husband, died, Corrie and the child moved in with Deborah for almost a month. This contact between Deborah and her grandchild was regular, close, and intensive; it was far from \"typical.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Court's Opinion \u00b6 23;\n   <em>\n    Katon v. Brandi M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7275109\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/32/1047/\">\n    2011 ME 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 2-3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7275109\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/32/1047/\">\n    32 A.3d 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In fact, it is the exact type of \"secure, stable and beneficial\" relationship that the Legislature intended to permit grandparents to preserve and maintain through its enactment of the GVA.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   n.13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   [\u00b6 45] Although these facts would not entitle the grandmother to de facto parenthood status-a status she never requested-the grandmother's relationship with the child far exceeds that which is typical of a \"connected, extended family\" and is exactly the kind of \"sufficient existing relationship\" the Legislature intended should give rise to grandparent standing to seek visitation. If called upon to make a conclusion from the facts contained in the affidavit-which would be unnecessary were we to remand so that the court could apply the proper legal standard-we should conclude that Deborah has established standing to proceed on her petition.
