(Chase), for summary judgment with respect to all claims asserted by Pineda against Chase. This matter came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties' written and oral submissions and after reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and proceed to decide the appeal at this time. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2008, Pineda attempted to refinance loans secured by mortgages on two properties that he owned in Providence. During the refinance proceedings, Pasquale Scavitti III (Scavitti), an attorney, acted as the settlement agent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Scavitti and Pineda had been acquaintances, and in 2006, Scavitti assisted Pineda with a previous refinancing for those same two properties. It is undisputed that in connection with Pineda's 2008 refinancing, Scavitti defalcated funds disbursed by Chase that were intended to satisfy promissory notes secured by mortgages on Pineda's two properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 26, 2008, Pineda filed a complaint in Superior Court naming both Chase and Scavitti as defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pineda claimed that Chase agreed to issue him two new loans, each in the amount of $195,000, to pay promissory notes secured by mortgages on the properties,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   but that Scavitti, whom Chase engaged as its closing agent, converted the loan proceeds for his own use and failed to disburse them. Specifically, Pineda alleged breach of fiduciary duty, civil liability for a crime pursuant to G.L. 1956 \u00a7 9-1-2, breach of contract, conversion, and unjust enrichment. Subsequently, Chase moved for summary judgment. Chase contended that it could not be held liable for Scavitti's tortious conduct under a theory of respondeat superior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, Chase maintained that summary judgment was proper because Scavitti was not Chase's attorney during the closing and therefore was not an agent of Chase. In the alternative, Chase contended that, even if Scavitti was Chase's attorney, Scavitti's defalcation of the loan funds was not within the scope of any alleged agency relationship with Chase. Pineda, on the other hand, argued that Chase was liable for Scavitti's actions because Chase gave Scavitti the authority to receive and disburse the loan funds, and Scavitti's malfeasance was within that authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In his bench decision, the hearing justice found that there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Scavitti was acting as an agent of Chase at the time he absconded with the loan funds. However, the hearing justice ultimately determined that summary judgment was appropriate because, even if Scavitti were an agent of Chase, there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Scavitti's conduct was within the scope of the purported agency relationship with Chase. Specifically, the hearing justice relied on the Restatement (Second)\n   <em>\n    Agency\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 228(1)(c) at 504 (1958) for the proposition that a servant's conduct is only considered within the scope of an agency relationship for respondeat superior purposes if \"it is actuated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the master.\" He concluded that \"there is no evidence, and none has been submitted by [Pineda], that the conduct of Mr. Scavitti would have been in any way, at least in part, for the purpose of serving the master, even if Chase was the master.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following the entry of summary judgment in favor of Chase, Chase filed a motion for the entry of final judgment under Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, to which Pineda assented. Final judgment was entered on January 29, 2016, and Pineda timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This Court reviews a hearing justice's grant of a motion for summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Fogarty v.

In his decision, the hearing justice concluded that a genuine issue of material fact existed with respect to whether Scavitti was an agent of Chase. This finding is consistent with our previous conclusions that \"the existence of an agency relationship sufficient to allow vicarious liability to attach * * * is an issue of fact[.]\"\n   <em>\n    McNulty v.

During his deposition, Scavitti discussed his relationship with Chase in regard to the real estate closing proceedings for Pineda's two properties. Scavitti testified that Pineda selected Scavitti's office to serve as the settlement agent in the closing proceedings. In his capacity as settlement agent, Scavitti testified that he received a package from Chase containing information pertinent to the closing, including the closing instructions. Scavitti also testified that his office signed the settlement statement as the settlement agent, prepared a title commitment binder and sent it to Chase, sent wiring instructions and additional documents to Chase, and received authorization from Chase to close the transaction. Scavitti also testified that the funds provided by Chase were\n   wired to his office's bank account. In addition, Scavitti testified that it was Pineda who paid him for his work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Pineda, during his deposition, testified that when he decided to refinance his properties in 2008, he went to Scavitti's office and completed the loan application. In addition, Pineda completed and signed a form entitled \"Rhode Island Disclosures,\" on which the box indicating \"I DO want the Lender to choose a title attorney\" was checked, but then crossed out, and the box indicating \"I DO NOT want the Lender to choose an attorney\" was checked, with Scavitti's name and contact information provided. Pineda testified that he did not know what the document was because he could not read English, but agreed that his signature was inscribed at the bottom of the form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the present case, as in\n   <em>\n    Groff\n   </em>\n   , we are again wading in \"the murky ethical waters of what is undoubtedly a common practice at real estate closings [and] we are reluctant to dive in\" and decide the issue of agency at the summary-judgment stage.\n   <em>\n    Groff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8170397\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/966/1262/#p1268\">\n    966 A.2d at 1270, 1275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming summary judgment on other grounds, but determining that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether an attorney who embezzled loan proceeds at a real estate closing, while acting as a closing agent, had an attorney-client relationship, and thus, an agency relationship, with the lender or the borrower);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baker v.

Thus, we concur with the hearing justice's finding that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether Scavitti was an agent of Pineda or Chase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    Scavitti's Malfeasance and the Scope of His Alleged Agency Relationship with Chase\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The hearing justice did not conclude his analysis upon finding that a genuine issue of material fact existed with respect to the question of agency. Instead, he proceeded to the scope-of-employment element of the agency test and decided that summary judgment was appropriate. On appeal, Pineda argues that the hearing justice erred in finding that, in addition to the elements needed to establish agency, he was also required to show that Scavitti's defalcation benefited Chase. Chase maintains, however, that the hearing justice's inquiry was properly focused on whether Scavitti acted within the scope of his alleged agency relationship with Chase when he stole the loan funds for his own benefit. Chase further contends that, because it is undisputed that Scavitti acted in his own interest, Pineda's claim must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In applying the Restatement (Second)\n   <em>\n    Agency\n   </em>\n   approach, we have held that \"[a]n employer is liable for the acts of an employee when the employee is acting within the scope of his or her employment.\"\n   <em>\n    Vargas Manufacturing Co. v. Friedman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7866741\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/661/48/#p53\">\n    661 A.2d 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 53 (R.I. 1995) (citing Restatement (Second)\n   <em>\n    Agency\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 140, 228 ). In making his scope-of-employment determination, the hearing justice in the present case relied on the Restatement, which provides that the conduct of a servant is within the scope of employment if:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"(a) it is of the kind he is employed to perform;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"(b) it occurs substantially within the authorized time and space limits;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \"(c) it is actuated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the master, and\n   \"(d) if force is intentionally used by the servant against another, the use of force is not unexpectable by the master.\" Restatement (Second)\n   <em>\n    Agency\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 228 at 504.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The hearing justice found no disputed facts pertaining to the third prong of the scope-of-employment test. An act is considered within the scope of an agency relationship only if the servant is at least partly motivated by his or her intent to serve the master.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7866741\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/661/48/#p53\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, when examining the third prong, the Restatement provides that \"[i]t is the state of the servant's mind which is material.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7866741\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/661/48/#p53\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 235 cmt.\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   at 520. Therefore, in order to determine Scavitti's intent, we must look to his manifestations and the attendant circumstances.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7866741\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/661/48/#p53\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   After looking at the evidence presented, the hearing justice determined that Scavitti's conduct in converting the loan funds was not motivated, in any part, by a purpose to serve Chase. It was, in fact, Scavitti's uncontroverted testimony that his defalcation of the loan funds was in no way motivated by a purpose to serve Chase. During his deposition, Scavitti was asked \"[W]hen you decided to take the loan proceeds and use it for a purpose other than what's set forth in the closing instructions from Chase, what interests of Chase were you advancing, if any?\"-to which Scavitti responded, \"None.\" Moreover, Scavitti admitted that Chase's closing instructions directed him to use the funds received from Chase to pay off the prior mortgage that preceded Chase's loan, yet Scavitti failed to make that payment and acknowledged the fact that the \"misapplication of the[ ] funds\" did not benefit Chase. Thus, Scavitti's defalcation was \"so different from the act authorized that it [was] not within the scope of the employment\" or the purported agency relationship.

Moreover, Scavitti's conduct was \"clearly inappropriate\" and \"unforeseeable in the accomplishment of the authorized result.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7866741\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/661/48/#p53\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 231 cmt.\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   at 513. Additionally, Scavitti's malfeasance caused Chase to not be placed in the first lien position on the property; therefore, instead of benefiting Chase, arguably his actions injured Chase.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burke v.

At that point, the burden shifted to Pineda to prove the existence of a disputed issue of material fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Giuliano v.

Pineda contends that the record before the Superior Court included evidence that there was a disputed issue of material fact regarding whether Chase benefited from Scavitti's tortious conduct. Specifically, he asserts that Chase benefited from Scavitti's actions by receiving \"two prima facie valid recorded mortgages upon the [p]laintiff's realty, [and] two prima facie valid negotiable promissory notes held by * * * Chase * * * with a combined face value of approximately $400,000[ ].\" Additionally, he maintains that Chase benefited by receiving several installments of payments on the notes from Pineda subsequent to the closing of the loans. Furthermore, he contends that\n   Chase accepted and held the payments under the notes in addition to other payments made before and at the closing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   However, Pineda failed to raise these alleged issues of fact before the hearing justice, thereby waiving this argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Shy C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=126%20A.3d%20433\">\n    126 A.3d 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 434, 435 (R.I. 2015) (noting that the raise-or-waive rule is a \"long adhered to\" and \"important jurisprudential principle\" providing that \"an issue that has not been raised and articulated previously at trial is not properly preserved for appellate review\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

Moreover, Pineda did not provide any evidence, notwithstanding the benefits that he now alleges Chase received, that Scavitti's defalcation of the loan funds was motivated in any part by a purpose to serve Chase. Therefore, when a party \"fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case[,]\" summary judgment is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Lavoie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8326098\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/918/225/#p227\">\n    918 A.2d at 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p322\">\n    477 U.S. at 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p322\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Pineda fails to assert any supporting arguments or provide relevant caselaw for this right-to-a-jury-trial claim. Moreover, in light of our determination that Pineda failed to show an issue of fact as to whether Scavitti was acting within the scope of any alleged agency relationship with Chase, even when viewing the evidence most advantageously to Pineda, Chase is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We conclude, therefore, that Pineda's right to a jury trial was not violated by the hearing justice's grant of summary judgment in favor of Chase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    IV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the final judgment on appeal.
