In particular, we must decide whether the value of salvage recovered by the demolition contractor enlarges the lien fund available to unpaid subcontractors who file lien claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The contract at issue did not require the property owner to pay a fixed price to the prime contractor for the demolition. Instead, the contractor paid the owner for the right to demolish the building and to salvage materials. We conclude the ultimate market value of the salvage materials, transferred to the contractor in return for its demolition work, constitutes an element of the \"contract price,\" N.J.S.A. 2A:44A-2, and enhances the size of the \"lien fund\" available to lien claimants, N.J.S.A. 2A:44A-9. However, the net value of the fund is reduced by the contractor's cash payment to the owner. We also hold that the CLL requires a signatory of a corporation's lien claim to demonstrate he or she is a corporate officer pursuant to the corporation's bylaws or board resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We therefore modify the trial court order that the lien fund here consisted of the value of the salvage ultimately retrieved from the demolition site; and reverse the order that an employee of one of the lien claimants informally designated a \"financial director\" had sufficient authority to file a lien claim on behalf of his employer. We also affirm the trial court's denial of attorney's fees to one of the lien claimants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The litigation arises out of the demolition of a power generating station in South Amboy known as the Werner Generating Station. NRG REMA, LLC (NRG) is the property owner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   NRG sought bids from firms willing to undertake the demolition project. Some bidders wanted NRG to pay them from $400,000 to $6.6 million to demolish the generating station. Six others were willing to pay for the right to demolish the structure, offering $250,000 to $1.4 million. Those bidders counted on profiting from the resale of salvaged metals and equipment. But that upside was fraught with risk. It was difficult to estimate the\n   amount of such material, and the ease of extracting it. NRG made no promises on that score.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   NRG selected Werner Deconstruction, LLC (Werner), which agreed to pay NRG $250,000 and to demolish the generating station, in return for the salvage. NRG claims it rejected more remunerative bids than Werner's because of its demonstrated capacity to finish the job on time. According to their contract, title to \"Salvage Materials\"-defined as \"equipment, parts, components and materials ... to be salvaged during demolition, excavation or other operations\"-vested in Werner when it paid NRG, which it evidently did on May 10, 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   If NRG terminated the contract for cause, title to all Salvage Materials remaining on site would revert to NRG. NRG also retained a security interest in the\n   Salvage Materials, which NRG could exercise if it terminated the contract while Werner was in bankruptcy. Werner posted a $2 million letter of credit, upon which NRG could draw if Werner defaulted. The prime contract imposed no payment obligation on NRG after it conveyed title to the Salvage Materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The value of the Salvage Materials was a factor in the parties' respective rights and duties if NRG terminated the contract for cause. Werner would be liable for NRG's costs of completion, minus revenue NRG reasonably obtained for the remaining Salvage Materials. Werner would also be entitled to a credit for its pre-termination costs, minus revenue it realized from the Salvage Materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Four days after executing the prime contract, Werner subcontracted with BTU Solutions DE, LLC (BTU).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Essentially, BTU stepped into Werner's shoes to perform the prime contract. BTU initially projected that costs of roughly $4.5 million would generate $13 million in salvage-related revenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   But, it did not turn out that way. BTU overestimated the amount of salvageable metal and equipment, and underestimated the cost of recovery. Some copper cable that BTU expected to find apparently already had been removed from the long-defunct station. Other cable was encased in asbestos and more costly than anticipated to salvage. Extraction of steel from the site was also more complicated than anticipated. Shortfalls in the revenue stream that BTU anticipated would fund its expenses, required BTU to borrow working capital, incurring additional costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Then, Superstorm Sandy hit in October 2012. The site filled with salt water, destroying otherwise salvageable equipment, dispersing asbestos throughout the site, and further complicating remediation. Several months thereafter, BTU entered into its\n   subcontract with Site Enterprises, Inc. (Site), which agreed to perform demolition work after the storm in return for $3.7 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   BTU struggled to pay its subcontractors, including Site. On December 26, 2013, Site filed a lien claim for $450,000, asserting it had not been paid, and ceased work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   BTU did not begin selling significant quantities of Salvage Materials until 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In March 2014, BTU contracted for environmental consulting services from Creative Environmental Solutions Corp. (Creative). Before a year passed, Creative filed its lien claim on December 24, 2014 in the amount of $350,000. It was signed by Ross Sikarev. He was Creative's \"financial director,\" a title he received at an informal dinner meeting with Creative's president, Victoria Drozdov. No formal meeting of Creative's board, amendment to its by-laws, or corporate resolution confirmed Sikarev's authority to sign a lien claim on Creative's behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The NRG-Werner contract, and the Werner-BTU subcontract required Werner and BTU to ensure the project was lien-free. However, neither company paid Site's and Creative's lien claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After Site's lien filing, but before Creative's, BTU removed over 8000 tons of ferrous metal, for which it received $2,093,014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   After Creative's lien claim, BTU removed just 181 more tons of ferrous material. The record indicates that BTU received $29,418 in return.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Meanwhile, in April 2014, Werner submitted a change order for $52,427 for removing oil from the project. NRG approved it over a year later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Eventually, Creative filed an action to foreclose on its lien against NRG's property (No. A-0567-16). Thereafter, NRG and BTU filed a declaratory judgment action (No. A-5432-15) against Creative, Site and others, to establish that the lien fund was limited to $52,427, the change order amount. The trial court consolidated the two actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After motion practice, the trial court concluded that the lien fund was $2,093,014, rather than $52,427 as NRG contended. Furthermore, the judge rejected NRG's argument that Creative's lien was invalid because an authorized officer did not sign it. Consistent with those findings, the court granted Creative summary judgment in its action against NRG and BTU, entitling Creative to a lien of $350,604 plus interest, and entitling it to foreclose on NRG's property. The court denied NRG's cross-motions for summary judgment for a declaration that the lien fund was limited to $52,427. Although the court initially granted Creative's request for counsel fees under N.J.S.A. 2A:44A-15(a), the court vacated the order upon NRG's motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   NRG and BTU\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   now jointly appeal the trial court's rulings concerning the value of the lien fund as to Site and Creative. They also appeal the trial court's ruling as to the propriety of Creative's signatory on its lien claim. Creative cross-appeals the denial of its motion for counsel fees. Site is solely a co-respondent and has not sought any affirmative relief on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We exercise de novo review of the trial court's grant of summary judgment, and apply the same standard as the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Henry v.

Site and Creative argue, since NRG transferred title to the Salvage Materials before significant work began, it constituted a prepayment that did not reduce the lien fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   NRG does not dispute that the right to the Salvage Materials was contractual consideration for Werner's agreement to demolish the generating station and pay NRG $250,000. However, NRG rejects the notion that the Salvage Materials' ultimate resale value set the \"price\" NRG paid. NRG contends that the NRG-Werner contract defines the lien fund. NRG contends non-monetary consideration is not payment. Until NRG agreed to the change order, it \"agreed to pay\" nothing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 2A:44A-3(f). Also, according to NRG, the \"contract price\" and the \"earned amount of the contract,\" which define the size of a lien claim, were zero. N.J.S.A. 2A:44A-9(a), -9(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Supporting Site's and Creative's position, the CLL evidently recognizes non-monetary consideration in defining a \"contract.\" A \"contract\" is an agreement evidencing the contracting parties' \"respective responsibilities,\" including \"price,\" which apparently refers to monetary amounts, \"or\n   <em>\n    other consideration to be paid\n   </em>\n   ,\" which may refer to non-monetary consideration like salvage. N.J.S.A. 2A:44A-2 (emphasis added). \"Contract price\" in turn means \"the amount specified in a contract,\"\n   <em>\n    ibid.\n   </em>\n   , which arguably incorporates such non-monetary consideration. \"Contract price\" then defines the size of the lien claim. The CLL grants a lien \"for the value of the work or services performed, or materials or equipment furnished\n   <em>\n    in accordance with the contract and based upon the contract price\n   </em>\n   ....\" N.J.S.A. 2A:44A-3(a) (emphasis added). Also, \"[t]he amount of a lien claim shall not exceed the unpaid portion of the\n   <em>\n    contract price\n   </em>\n   of the claimant's contract for the work, services, material or equipment provided.\" N.J.S.A. 2A:44A-9(a) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Yet, in support of NRG's position, the CLL defines \"lien fund\" in monetary terms. It is \"\n   <em>\n    the pool of money\n   </em>\n   from which one or more lien claims may be paid.\" N.J.S.A. 2A:44A-2 (emphasis added). The\n   CLL requires contractors to file claims that \"substantially\" adhere to a prescribed form, which describes the contract price solely in terms of dollars.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 2A:44A-8 (Construction Lien Claim form, \u00b64). Monetary payments are also implied by\n   use of the word \"amount\" in the provision limiting the \"amount of a lien\" on an owner's property \"to the amount [the owner] agreed in writing to pay, less payments made ....\" N.J.S.A. 2A:44A-3(f). Likewise, the \"lien fund shall not exceed ... the earned amount of the contract between the owner and the contractor\" in the case of first or second tier claimants. N.J.S.A. 2A:44A-9(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The import of Site's and Creative's contentions is that salvage constitutes a form of payment by the owner that enhances the lien fund.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The NRG-Werner contract apparently presents an atypical (but possibly recurrent) case-in which the contractor deems the salvage so valuable that the contractor is willing to pay the owner for the right to undertake a demolition project. However, Site's and Creative's reasoning would presumably apply to any case in which salvage is transferred, even if it comprises a far less substantial portion of the total consideration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   In such a case, the value of salvage would still enhance both the total contract price and the lien fund calculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   We resolve the facial ambiguity in the statute in the subcontractors' favor. To reach that result, we need not rely solely on the established \"tie-breaker\" principle favoring contractors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Craft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1276306\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/179/56/#p67\">\n    179 N.J. at 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1276306\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/179/56/#p67\">\n    843 A.2d 1076\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Deeming the value of the Salvage Materials an element of the contract price is consonant with the\n   CLL's dual goals. It vindicates the interest of contractors, subcontractors and suppliers in receiving payment for the value of their work. In the extreme case before us, salvage was the only form of payment (putting aside the modest change order). As Site aptly noted, Werner and BTU did not agree to perform the work for free.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Including salvage value as part of the contract price and the lien fund also need not disserve an owner's interest in avoiding double-payment, so long as the owner takes appropriate measures to avoid premature transfer of salvage value. NRG could have transferred title to salvage as the contract progressed, or withheld transfer until the project's completion, or withheld transfer at least until salvage was actually recovered and ready for resale.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   NRG could have taken steps to protect subcontractors like Site, which claimed it performed $450,000 of uncompensated work\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   BTU sold the lion's share of Salvage Materials. Instead, NRG prepaid the entirety of the consideration owed\n   Werner at the outset of the contract's performance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We acknowledge the total amount and value of the salvage was uncertain at the time of contract, and remained uncertain throughout the project.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   It would have been difficult for NRG to calculate\n   what amount of interim payments of salvage to transfer commensurate with partially completed work. Thus, deeming salvage value part of the contract price would inject a level of complexity and uncertainty that is at odds with one of the CLL's fundamental goals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas Group\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"105806\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/163/507/#p517\">\n    163 N.J. at 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"105806\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/163/507/#p517\">\n    750 A.2d 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that CLL was designed \"to simplify the lien-filing process\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Study Commission\n   </em>\n   at 3 (expressing the goal \"to remove uncertainty, lack of clarity and ambiguity\" in current law and to establish rights that \"clearly limited to specified amounts\");\n   <em>\n    N.J.

However, we may infer an intent to consider salvage value as a form of consideration from the Legislature's rejection of statutory language that the Mechanic's Lien Law Study Commission recommended. The Commission proposed to limit the lien claim amount \"to the contract price, or any portion therefore, for the work, services, material or equipment provided in accordance with the contract at the time of the filing of the lien,\n   <em>\n    less the amount of salvage value of any recoverable material not\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    incorporated in the improvement\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Study Commission\n   </em>\n   , Appendix A at 9 (emphasis added). We understand that the highlighted language may have been meant to refer to unused materials brought onto a project site, as opposed to materials removed in demolition.

The suggested notarial was modified to state that the notary was satisfied Sikarev was \"an officer/shareholder\" and \"by virtue of [Creative's] Bylaws or Resolution of its Board of Directors ... executed\" the lien claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Creative never amended its bylaws to designate Sikarev as an officer, nor did its Board adopt a resolution approving Sikarev's appointment. The record contains no other writing establishing his position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   We recognize that N.J.S.A. 2A:44A-8 requires that a lien claim \"be filed in\n   <em>\n    substantially\n   </em>\n   the ... form\" prescribed, and the reference to bylaws or a board resolution is found in what the section describes as a \"\n   <em>\n    suggested\n   </em>\n   notarial.\" (Emphasis added). Yet, Creative's lien claim did not substantially conform to the prescribed form. Creative made no effort at all to adopt a bylaw, or a board resolution, appointing Sikarev to be a corporate officer; nor does the record reflect that Sikarev presented any other evidence of his appointment to the notary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   We do not interpret the reference to a \"suggested\" notarial statement to mean the notarial statement is optional. Section 6 requires that the \"lien claim form as provided by section [2A:44A-8] shall be signed,\n   <em>\n    acknowledged and verified\n   </em>\n   by oath of the claimant setting forth ... the claimant's identity ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   N.J.S.A. 2A:44A-6(a)(1)(b). The word \"suggested\" evidently refers to the precise wording of the form. The notary's statement is designed to verify the signatory's identity and authority, as section 6 requires. Therefore, a corporate\n   signatory must present to the notary evidence of his authority as an officer by virtue of bylaws or board resolution. That was not done here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   As Creative did not memorialize Sikarev's appointment in its corporate bylaws or a board resolution, we need not address whether New York law permitted Creative to appoint an officer as \"Financial Director\" in the first place. We note that Creative relies on the authority of its \"board [to] elect or appoint a president, one or more vice-presidents, a secretary and a treasurer,\n   <em>\n    and such other officers as it may determine\n   </em>\n   , or as may be provided in the bylaws.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Bus.%20Corp.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20715\">\n    N.Y.
