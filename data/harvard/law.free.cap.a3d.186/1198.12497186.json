The respondent claims that the trial court improperly (1) determined that the termination of his parental rights was in the child's best interest; and (2) denied his motion to transfer guardianship of the child to the child's maternal grandmother (grandmother).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following relevant facts were found by the court or are otherwise undisputed. On October 30, 2015, the petitioner, the Commissioner of Children and Families (petitioner), filed coterminous petitions of neglect and termination of the respondent's and the mother's parental rights to their child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subsequently, the petitioner\n   also filed a motion to review and approve the permanency plan of termination of parental rights and adoption. By way of background, the Department of Children and Families (department) became involved with the family due to incidents of domestic violence and the mother's serious recurrent substance abuse. The department had twice obtained temporary custody of the child and placed her with her current foster parents. On both occasions, the grandmother declined to take care of the child due to age and health issues. At the time of the second placement, the child already was staying with the foster parents under an informal arrangement and the grandmother suggested to the department that the child remain in their care. At the time of disposition, the child was four years old and had been living with the foster parents for more than two years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 19, 2016, the mother filed a motion for transfer of guardianship of the child to the grandmother, which was adopted by the respondent. The mother then sought to consolidate this motion with\n   the coterminous petitions. Thereafter, the trial court consolidated the above matters and heard argument over the course of a five day trial. The court heard testimony from various witnesses, including the grandmother, the foster\n   mother, the court-appointed psychologist, Derek Franklin, and an independent psychologist, Bruce Freedman, who had been retained by the mother. On July 25, 2017, the court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. Henry S. Cohn\n   </em>\n   , judge trial referee, in an oral decision, adjudicated the child neglected on the ground that she had been denied proper care and attention and permitted to live under conditions injurious to her well-being. In the same decision, the court terminated the parental rights of the respondent and the mother on the ground that they had failed to rehabilitate within a reasonable time, and denied the mother's motion to transfer guardianship. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After hearing argument, this court, sua sponte, issued an order for articulation and supplemental briefing. Specifically, we ordered the court to \"please articulate what other facts [it] found, besides the existence of the bond between the child and her foster parents, to support its determination that termination of parental rights was in the child's best interest and its denial of the motion to transfer guardianship to the maternal grandmother.\" The trial court thereafter filed an articulation with this court, which states in relevant part: \"In determining that terminating the respondent parents' parental rights is in [the child's] best interest, the court has considered various factors, including her interest in sustained growth, development, well-being, and in the continuity and stability of her environment ... her age and needs; the length and nature of her stay in foster care; the contact and lack thereof that she has had with her father and mother; the potential benefit or detriment of her retaining a connection with her biological parents; [and] her genetic bond to each birth parent ... and the seven statutory factors and the court's finding thereon. The court has also balanced [the] child's intrinsic need for stability and permanency against the potential benefit of maintaining a connection with her biological parents.... In consideration\n   of all these factors and after weighing all of the evidence, the court found that clear and convincing evidence established that it was in the best interests of [the] child to terminate the parental rights of both respondent parents.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) In light of the trial court's articulation, the parties provided supplemental briefing. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The respondent first claims that the trial court improperly determined that the termination of his parental rights was in the best interest of the child. Specifically, the respondent argues that the court, in basing its dispositional finding on the child's bond with the foster parents and the extended duration for which she had lived with them, essentially engaged in an improper comparison of the \"foster parents' relationship with the child and the stability of their home with that of the biological parents.\" In making this argument, the respondent relies on\n   <em>\n    In re Paul M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=154%20Conn.%20App.%20488\">\n    154 Conn.

The respondent acknowledges that our observation in\n   <em>\n    In re Paul M.\n   </em>\n   addresses a comparison of material advantages between the homes of foster and biological parents. He argues, however, that the trial\n   court's reasoning amounted to a comparison of \"relative abilities to care for the child\" and that \"[s]uch a comparison is just as damaging as comparing material advantage because it would also tend to prejudice the court to look at the advantages of the adoptive placement rather than the statutory grounds.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In his supplemental brief, the respondent also argues that the \"statutory finding regarding the positive bond\n   that the child has with the foster parents should ... not be used to support a termination.\" Rather, it \"should only be used as a factor in finding that it would not be in the child's best interest to terminate ... parental rights.\" (Emphasis omitted.) Finally, the respondent argues that the court's reliance on the child's bond with the foster parents constituted an improper consideration, at the dispositional phase of the termination proceeding, of where the child should reside posttermination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We disagree that the trial court's consideration of the child's bond with the foster parents was improper, or that it led to an improper determination of where the child would reside. We also disagree with the respondent's theory of how the best interest standard should be applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"We begin with the applicable standard of review and general governing principles. Although the trial court's subordinate factual findings are reviewable only for clear error, the court's ultimate conclusion that a ground for termination of parental rights has been proven presents a question of evidentiary sufficiency.... That conclusion is drawn from both the court's factual findings and its weighing of the facts in considering whether the statutory ground has been satisfied.... On review, we must determine whether the trial court could have reasonably concluded, upon the facts established and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, that the cumulative effect of the evidence was sufficient to justify its [ultimate conclusion].... When applying this standard, we construe the evidence in a manner most favorable to sustaining the judgment\n   of the trial court.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    In re Egypt E.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491812\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/175/21/#p525\">\n    327 Conn. 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 525-26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491812\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/175/21/#p525\">\n    175 A.3d 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"[A] hearing on a petition to terminate parental rights consists of two phases, adjudication and disposition....

The respondent asserts that the trial court's decision in the present case, unlike\n   <em>\n    In re Paul M.\n   </em>\n   , is primarily based on the child's bond with the foster parents and, therefore, is deficient.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As a factual matter, we disagree with the respondent that the trial court, in terminating his parental rights, relied principally on the child's bond with the foster parents. The court first found that the petitioner had proven the adjudicative ground by clear and convincing evidence; a finding not challenged by the respondent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In the dispositional phase, the court, while issuing an oral decision, not only noted the child's strong emotional bond with the foster parents, but also considered her emotional ties to the respondent. The court then considered the unlikelihood of the respondent's rehabilitation within a reasonable time and the urgent need for permanence and stability for the child. After briefly considering the issue of the transfer of guardianship, the court then concluded its finding as to the termination of parental rights as follows: \"\n   <em>\n    I'm considering the child's sense of time ... or her need for a secure and permanent environment.\n   </em>\n   The relationship ... the child has with the foster parents,\n   <em>\n    the totality of the circumstances\n   </em>\n   , that the termination of parental rights is in the child's best interest.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In its subsequent articulation, the court stated that it had considered the seven statutory factors of \u00a7 17a-112 (k), as well as the child's \"interest in sustained growth, development, well-being\" and \"continuity and stability of her environment ... her age and needs; the length and nature of her stay in foster care; the contact and lack thereof that she has had with her father and mother; the potential benefit or detriment of her retaining a connection with her biological parents; [and] her genetic bond to each birth parent.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) The court also stated that it had \"balanced [the] child's intrinsic need for stability and permanency against the potential benefit of maintaining a connection with her biological parents.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In light of the trial court's reasoning, we are not persuaded by the respondent's argument that this case is deficient in a manner that\n   <em>\n    In re Paul M.\n   </em>\n   was not. In fact, this case is similar to\n   <em>\n    In re Paul M.\n   </em>\n   , in that here, as there, the trial court first found by clear and convincing evidence that the adjudicative ground for termination was met before making its dispositional finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    In re Paul M.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=154%20Conn.%20App.%20488\">\n    154 Conn.

In both\n   cases the trial court was statutorily required, in the dispositional phase, to consider the children's bond with their foster parents because of the extended time the children had spent in their care.

See id., at 503,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20A.3d%20552\">\n    107 A.3d 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[t]he testimony of the social workers regarding their observations of the adjustment of [the child]\n   <em>\n    to the foster home, the level of care he receives and the devotion of the foster parents to him\n   </em>\n   satisfy the court that remaining in his present placement is the best possible outcome and accordingly in the best interest of the child\" [emphasis altered; internal quotation marks omitted] ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The respondent contends, however, that a comparison of the child's emotional ties with the respondent and her bond with the foster parents essentially amounts to a comparison of their parenting abilities.

The respondent in that case claimed that the trial court impermissibly had compared the parenting abilities of the foster and biological parents by basing its decision to terminate his parental rights on the child's emotional ties with the foster parents. Id., at 867-69,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201271\">\n    120 A.3d 1271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, the respondent in that case took issue with the following excerpt from the trial court's memorandum of decision: \"Based on all the foregoing, the court by clear and convincing evidence finds termination of the parental rights of the mother\n   and [the respondent] as to [the child] is in the best interest of such child. The court concludes that subjecting [the child] to a removal from the foster family\n   <em>\n    with whom he has bonded and with whom he can attain permanency through adoption\n   </em>\n   would not be in his best interest given the circumstances of this case.\" (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201271\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 868 n.19,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201271\">\n    120 A.3d 1271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In rejecting the respondent's claim, in that case, that the trial court had engaged in an improper comparison, we observed that the court was required, under \u00a7 17a-112 (k), to consider the three year old child's bond with the foster family because he had spent all but one month of his life with them. Id., at 871,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201271\">\n    120 A.3d 1271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We concluded that in considering this bond, the court did not determine that the foster home was \"better,\" rather, the court had found that the foster home \"in general, provided for the child's needs, including emotional needs for love and stability.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201271\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Similarly in the present case, the child was four years old at the time the trial court issued its decision and had spent more than two years in the care of the foster parents. As in\n   <em>\n    In re Joseph M.\n   </em>\n   , therefore, the court, in the present case, was statutorily required to consider the child's emotional ties with the foster parents. In light of the court's reasoning for terminating the respondent's parental rights, and after carefully reviewing the record, we are persuaded that here, as in\n   <em>\n    In re Joseph M.\n   </em>\n   , there was no comparison of the parties' parenting abilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We also are unpersuaded by the respondent's argument that the court improperly considered the child's placement in the\n   dispositional phase of the termination proceeding. Specifically, the respondent's reliance on\n   <em>\n    In re Denzel A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"228792\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/53/827/\">\n    53 Conn.

The respondent correctly asserts that this court reiterated in\n   <em>\n    In re Denzel A.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    In re Sheena I.\n   </em>\n   , that \"[i]n the dispositional phase of a termination proceeding, the court properly considers only whether the parent's parental rights should be terminated, not where or with whom a child should reside following termination.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Sheena I.\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 726,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=778%20A.2d%20997\">\n    778 A.2d 997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    In re Denzel A.\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 834,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=733%20A.2d%20298\">\n    733 A.2d 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In both those cases, however, this court declined to consider the transfer of guardianship to the proponent of such transfer\n   <em>\n    in lieu\n   </em>\n   of termination of parental rights. Instead, we held that such a determination should, in certain circumstances, wait until after the parents' rights were terminated. See\n   <em>\n    In re Denzel A.\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 835,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=733%20A.2d%20298\">\n    733 A.2d 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Consistent with these holdings, the trial court here did not make a determination as to a permanent placement for the child during the dispositional phase. Instead, it left the issue as to the appropriate custodian or adoptive parent to be resolved at a later date through the department's interactions with the interested parties: \"[T]he better way to go would be a termination of parental rights and let ... the [department], which is going to become the statutory parent, take on a role of [mediator] in bringing these people together.\" Furthermore, the court's articulation makes clear that the court's decision terminating the respondent's parental rights was based on a consideration of the statutorily required factors. The court explained that although it noted the child's bond with the foster parents, it considered the seven best interest factors in \u00a7 17a-112 (k). The court further noted that its decision was based on the fact that ''the [respondent] had severe and long-standing substance abuse, domestic violence, [and] mental health issues and a long history of engaging in criminal conduct, including attempting to strangle the mother on two separate occasions. The court-appointed\n   psychologist concluded that the best interest of the child required granting the [petition to terminate parental rights], as the parents had virtually no possibility of playing a constructive role in the child's life.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the court did not improperly consider placement of the child with the foster parents when it determined that it was in the child's best interest to terminate the respondent's parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, the respondent's argument that the emotional bond between the child and the foster parents should be used only to determine whether it would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be in the best interest of the child to terminate parental rights is a misstatement of the law. There is simply nothing in the language of \u00a7 17a-112 (k) that supports such an interpretation. Subsection (4) identifies several people for and with whom the child might have \"feelings and emotional ties.\" The statute requires the court to consider and make findings as to all such persons. In doing so, it does not distinguish or limit what use the court is to make of such information in determining whether termination is in the best interest of the child. The respondent's argument would require us to limit the court's consideration of the\n   child's feelings and emotional ties to any person who has exercised physical care, custody or control of a child for at least one year to the lack of such feelings and emotional ties. Not only is this illogical, it is flatly inconsistent with the plain language of subsection (4), which describes such persons as those \"with whom the child has developed significant emotional ties ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (k) (4). By noting the bond between the child and foster parents in this case, the court did no more than what it was statutorily required to do.\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The respondent next argues that the trial court erred in declining to transfer guardianship of the child as an alternative to terminating the respondent's parental rights. Specifically, the respondent argues that the grandmother had an \"extremely close bond\" with the child, and the foster parents could not provide a stable home for the child. In light of these facts, the respondent contends that the trial court should, in the best interest of the child, have transferred guardianship to the grandmother. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"To determine whether a custodial placement is in the best interest of the child, the court uses its broad discretion to choose a place that will foster the child's interest in sustained growth, development, well-being, and in the continuity and stability of its environment.... We have stated that when making the determination of what is in the best interest of the child, [t]he authority to exercise the judicial discretion under the circumstances revealed by the finding is not conferred upon this court, but upon the trial court, and ... we are not privileged to usurp that authority or to substitute ourselves for the trial court.... A mere difference of opinion or judgment cannot justify our intervention. Nothing short of a conviction that the action of the trial court is one which discloses a clear abuse of discretion can warrant our interference.... In determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, the ultimate issue is whether the court could reasonably conclude as it did.... [G]reat weight is given to the judgment of the trial court because of [the court's] opportunity to observe the parties and the evidence.... [Appellate courts] are not in a position to second-guess the opinions of witnesses, professional or otherwise, nor the observations and conclusions of the [trial\n   court] when they are based on reliable evidence.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    In re Anthony A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060591\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/112/643/#p653\">\n    112 Conn.

In fact, the trial court, in issuing its ruling from the bench, noted that \"[t]here's no question that the child is bonded with the grandmother.\" The trial court also, however, had evidence before it that the child was emotionally attached to the foster parents such that she regards them as her parents and refers to them as \"Mommy\" and \"Daddy.\" The court-appointed psychologist, Derek Franklin, testified that the foster parents essentially are the child's \"psychological parents.\" He testified further that removing the child from the care of the foster parents might pose a serious health risk for her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On the other hand, the psychologist retained by the mother, Bruce Freedman, based on his observation of the interaction between the child and the grandmother, testified that they had a close bond. Not having had the chance to observe a similar interaction between the child and the foster parents, Freedman assumed a healthy relationship between them. He concluded, however, that ideally the child should\n   maintain a relationship with the foster parents as well as the grandmother. He opined further that an arrangement where the child was permanently placed with the foster parents would work just as well, as long as the child maintained a relationship with the grandmother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In its articulation, the trial court summarized the evidence before it as follows: \"The child had lived the majority of her life with the preadoptive foster parents. The foster father had some financial difficulties and minor criminal charges that had been resolved several years previous.... The mother had recruited the foster mother from time to time for placement.... The\n   grandmother had declined twice to take custody of the child, due to her age and health.... The court-appointed psychologist deemed the foster parents 'psychological parents' ... [and] [r]emoval of the child would put the child at risk for behavioral or emotional problems.\" Finally, the trial court noted in relation to the mother's expert that the \"best solution for [him] would be a shared care arrangement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In light of this evidence, the trial court essentially had to decide whether an immediate removal of the child from the foster parents' care to the grandmother's care was in the best interest of the child. After observing, in its oral decision, the child's bond with the grandmother, the court stated: \"[T]he better way to go would be a termination of parental rights and let ... the [department], which is going to become the statutory parent, take on a role of mediation in bringing these people together. And I think in this family, which-very close family where people are always having parties and working things out, that the transfer of guardianship is going to be denied and let's see if we can't get [the] grandmother and [the foster parents] together. I think [the foster parents]-I should comment on the fact that [the foster parents] had some financial difficulties. There were four instances of some kind of money problems. There was a-or a fight, disorderly conduct, but these were about ten years ago and they don't seem to have occurred again.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   It is clear from the court's reasoning that it neither ignored the child's close relationship with the grandmother, nor certain past deficiencies of the foster parents. Rather, the court considered all the evidence before it to decide whether immediately transferring guardianship to the grandmother would be in the best interest of the child. We will not, on appeal, second-guess the court's determination that it was not.
