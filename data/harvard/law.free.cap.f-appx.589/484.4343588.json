Lira-Xochicale argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-20\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by varying upward 15 months from the high end of Lira-Xochicale\u2019s advisory guideline range of 41 to 51 months of imprisonment. Lira-Xochicale and his co-conspirators smuggled women into the United States and used violence, intimidation, and threats of deportation to force them to engage in prostitution. Lira-Xo-chicale transported at least six prostitutes for the conspiracy, one of whom he called his \u201cwife,\u201d and he converted his apartment into a makeshift brothel by hanging a sheet from the ceiling, placing a mattress on the floor, and providing condoms and containers of personal lubricant. The district court reasonably determined that a sentence of 66 months of imprisonment was required to address the \u201cnature and circumstances of [Lira-Xochicale\u2019s] offense\u201d and his \u201chistory and characteristics,\u201d and \u201cto reflect the seriousness of [his] offense,\u201d \u201cto promote respect for the law[,] ... to afford some deterrence to criminal conduct[,] and to protect ... further victims [against similar future] crimes [by Lira-Xochicale] and the members of the conspiracy.\u201d See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). And Lira-Xochicale\u2019s 66-month term is substantially less than his statutory maximum sentence of 15 years of imprisonment. See <em>United States v. Dougherty, </em>754 F.3d 1353, 1362 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-21\">The reasons provided by the district court were sufficiently compelling to justify the extent of its upward variance. See <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1186-87 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc). The district court explained that the recommended sentencing range failed to account for Lira-Xochicale\u2019s \u201cintegral part [in] the conspiracy\u201d; his involvement with \u201cmore than eight victims\u201d; his \u201ccoordination] [of] the transportation and delivery of prosti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>tutes with both of the main or lead defendants\u201d; his \u201ctransport[ion][ofj many of the prostitutes between various locations throughout Georgia and other states\u201d; and his actions \u201cas a pimp for prostitutes in the ... Atlanta, Georgia area.\u201d Lira-Xochi-cale\u2019s sentence is within the range of reasonable sentences for his role in the conspiracy. <em>See id. </em>at 1190. Lira-Xochicale argues that his \u201crole in the offense ... is not a basis for departing from th[e] [recommended sentencing] range,\u201d United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5H1.7 (Nov.2013), but his sentence was the result of a variance, not a departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Lira-Xochicale argues that his conduct \u201cfalls squarely within the typical sex trafficking involving undocumented immigrants\u201d and he received an unwarranted variance that deserves the \u201ccloser review\u201d called for in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 109, 128 S.Ct. 558, 575, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), but we disagree. Lira-Xochicale\u2019s offense differs from a \u201cmine-run ease,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 109, 128 S.Ct. at 575, where a conspirator smuggles illegal aliens into the United States and transports them for a prostitution ring. Although it might be commonplace for the conspirator to select a location for the prostitutes and to transport them, it is uncharacteristic for him to act as their pimp.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">We AFFIRM Lira-Xochicale\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
