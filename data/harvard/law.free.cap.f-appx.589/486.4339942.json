In August 2003, the bankruptcy court issued a discharge order. Subsequently, the Alabama Department of Human Resources engaged in various activities to try to collect the debt, eventually obtaining an Alabama judgment against Mr. Ghee for the unpaid child-support interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-21\">In 2011, Mr. Ghee filed a <em>pro se </em>adversarial action in bankruptcy court, arguing that the Alabama Department of Human Resources\u2019 collection activities violated the discharge injunction under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524, and seeking to enjoin any future collection activities. Mr. Ghee also disputed that he owed any child-support interest, and if so, the amount he owed. The Alabama Department of Human Resources moved for summary judgment, arguing that the child-support interest debt was not discharged by the bankruptcy court\u2019s August 2003 discharge order.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-22\">The bankruptcy court granted summary judgment for the Alabama Department of Human Resources and abstained pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(c)(1) from determining the amount of child-support interest Mr. Ghee owed under Alabama law. The district court affirmed the order, which Mr. Ghee, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-23\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s decision to affirm the bankruptcy court <em>de novo, </em>which allows us to assess the bankruptcy court\u2019s judgment anew, employing the same standard of review the district court itself used.\u201d <em>In re Globe Mfg. Corp., </em>567 F.3d 1291, 1296 (11th Cir.2009). Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>The bankruptcy court properly determined that any interest Mr. Ghee owed oh child-support arrears under Alabama law was not discharged by - the bankruptcy court\u2019s August 2008 discharge order, as pre-petition child-support interest is part of a non-dischargeable child-support obligation under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(5) (2002). <em>See In re Diaz, </em>647 F.3d 1073, 1089-90 &amp; n. 14 (11th Cir.2011) (\u201c[I]t is clear that pre-petition interest ... [is] part of a non-dischargeable child-support obligation .... \u201d). As such, the Alabama Department of Human Resources\u2019 attempts to collect that interest could not have violated 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524\u2019s discharge injunction, and the bankruptcy court\u2019s granting of the motion for summary judgment was appropriate. <em>See id. </em>at 1090 (\u201c[T]he bankruptcy court was mistaken in its belief ... that the Florida DOR\u2019s and Virginia DSS\u2019s post-discharge efforts to collect unpaid interest on Diaz\u2019s child-support obligation could constitute violations of the discharge injunction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">We lack jurisdiction to review the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision to abstain from deciding whether Mr. Ghee owes child-support interest pursuant to his divorce decree and state law, and, if so, the amount he owes. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(d) (\u201cAny decision to abstain or not to abstain made under subsection (c) ... is not reviewable by appeal or otherwise by the court of appeals under section 158(d), 1291, or 1292 of this title....\u201d); <em>In re Harrell, </em>754 F.2d 902, 907 (11th Cir.1985) (holding that a bankruptcy court\u2019s inquiry is properly limited to determining whether the obligation at issue is a support obligation as opposed to a property settlement and rejecting the \u201cDebtor\u2019s attempt to expand the dischargeability issue into an assessment of the ongoing financial circumstances of the parties to a marital dispute\u201d). <em>See also Stern v. Marshall, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2594, 2620, 180 L.Ed.2d 475 (2011) (noting that \u00a7 1334(c) applies to bankruptcy courts).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">Accordingly, the bankruptcy court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for the Alabama Department of Human Resources is AFFIRMED, and Mr. Ghee\u2019s appeal of the bankruptcy court\u2019s abstention is DISMISSED'for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-6\">. We find no merit to Mr. Ghee\u2019s unsubstantiated argument that the bankruptcy court and the district court violated his right to equal protection of the laws or his right to contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
