He filed a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, where he is incarcerated. The district court construed the petition as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and dismissed it for want of jurisdiction. Proceeding <em>pro se, </em>Goree challenges the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-24\">He contends <em>Rosemond v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 1240, 188 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>L.Ed.2d 248 (2014), requires reversing his conviction and sentence for aiding-and-abetting the possession of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence. Because Goree challenges the validity of his conviction, his petition was properly construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>E.g., Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877-78 (5th Cir. 2000). He has not shown his claims could be brought in a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) because, even if <em>Rosemond </em>applies retroactively, he has not established his claim was foreclosed previously. The law in the Eighth Circuit, the circuit in which he was convicted, was consistent with <em>Rosemond </em>and, in fact, was cited in <em>Rosemond. </em>134 S.Ct. at 1249 (citing <em>United States v. Akiti, </em>701 F.3d 883, 887 (8th Cir.2012)).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Furthermore, Goree has not shown he was convicted of a nonexistent offense, because the record supports he had the foreknowledge required under <em>Rosemond </em>to be guilty of aiding and abetting his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) offense. <em>See, e.g., Christopher v. Miles, </em>342 F.3d 378, 382-83 (5th Cir.2003). Thus, he has not demonstrated the remedy under \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Accordingly, the petition was properly dismissed because the district court lacked jurisdiction over the \u00a7 2255 motion, which could be filed, if at all, in the district where Goree was sentenced. <em>E.g., Pack v. Yusuff </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b305-10\">Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
