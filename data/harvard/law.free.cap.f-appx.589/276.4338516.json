He contends the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen as untimely because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>met the changed-eircumstances exception due to China\u2019s enforcement of its population control policies. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). Pursuant to our highly deferential review of the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir.2005), An has not shown the \u2022 BIA abused its discretion in concluding the exception did not apply. <em>E.g., Panjwani v. Gonzales, </em>401 F.3d 626, 632-33 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
