Mejia and the Government agree that Mejia\u2019s prior conviction for sexual assault pursuant to Texas Penal Code \u00a7 22.011 does not qualify as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), which carries a 20-year statutory maximum. The parties disagree as to whether the proper remedy is remand for the district court to enter a modified judgment or for this court itself to modify and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">We agree that there was error. <em>See Rodriguez v. Holder, </em>705 F.3d 207, 215-16 (5th Cir.2013). The conviction and sentence imposed by the district court are AFFIRMED. However, we REMAND to the district court for the limited purpose of correcting the judgment to reflect the correct offense of conviction as under \u00a7 1326(b)(1). <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>588 F.2d 961, 964 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b326-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
