The district court dismissed Bozeman\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim and as untimely. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-21\">We review' <em>de novo </em>the dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim and for being untimely. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 872 (11th Cir.2008); <em>Berman v. Blount Parrish &amp; Co., </em>525 F.3d 1057, 1058 (11th Cir.2008). We accept all allegations in the complaint as true and construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Timson, </em>518 F.3d at 872. \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>ter\u201d from which the district court can draw the reasonable inference \u201cthat the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Bozeman failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Bozeman alleged that she struck a vehicle after it braked suddenly and that the Pooles and Johnson orchestrated the accident to collect an unlawful debt from her. These allegations, even if true, fail to establish that the Pooles and Johnson, individually or collectively, deprived Bozeman of any right under federal law. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985; <em>Griffin v. City of Opa-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir.2001). Boze-man\u2019s complaint also fails to allege facts that could support a finding that the Pooles or Johnson were transformed into state actors either by performing a function \u201ctraditionally [within] the exclusive prerogative of the state,\u201d by acting with the encouragement of the state, or by serving in a close, interdependent relationship with the state. <em>Focus on the Family v. Pinellas Suncoast Transit Auth., </em>344 F.3d 1263, 1277 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Bozeman\u2019s complaint is untimely too. Bozeman\u2019s federal claims, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, must be filed within the statute of limitation provided under Florida law, which is \u201cwithin four years of the allegedly unconstitutional or otherwise illegal act.\u201d <em>Burton v. City of Belle Glade, </em>178 F.3d 1175, 1188 (11th Cir.1999). Bozeman alleged that the accident occurred in 2007, but she did not file her complaint until 2014, approximately three years after the statute of limitation expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">We AFFIRM the dismissal of Boze-man\u2019s complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
