New Wave argues that the court erred when it accepted the magistrate judge\u2019s finding that New Wave failed to show use of the \u201cMr. Foamer\u201d mark in commerce in connection with the sale of any good or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>service and that New Wave could only establish de minimis or token use of the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">New Wave brought suit against the Ap-pellees for trademark infringement, unfair competition/false designation of origin, unfair competition/trade dress infringement, violation of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, and breach of confidential business relationship. It moved for a preliminary injunction, seeking to enjoin Appellees from operating any business using the name Mr. Foamer or using the name in conjunction with its business. New Wave asserts that it used the name Mr. Foamer before Appellees did and that Appellees\u2019 use of the name has caused confusion. Specifically, New Wave used the name in a Christmas card that it sent in November 2011; the card depicted a foam generator as a cartoon character and said \u201cChristmas Wishes from Mr. Foamer.\u201d Appellees incorporated Mr. Foamer, Inc., in July 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to deny a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion. <em>Forsyth Cnty. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, </em>633 F.3d 1032, 1039 (11th Cir.2011). We review the court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThis scope of review will lead to reversal only if the district court applies an incorrect legal standard, or applies improper procedures, or relies on clearly erroneous factfinding, or if it reaches a conclusion that is clearly unreasonable or incorrect.\u201d <em>Schiavo ex rel. Schindler v. Schiavo, </em>403 F.3d 1223, 1226 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">A party seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that \u201c(1) it has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) irreparable injury will be suffered unless the injunction issues; (3) the threatened injury to the movant outweighs whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party; and (4) if issued, the injunction would not be- adverse to the public interest.\u201d <em>Siegel v. LePore, </em>234 F.3d 1163, 1176 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc) (per curiam). \u201c[A] preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy not to be granted unless the movant clearly established the \u2018burden of persuasion\u2019 for each prong of the analysis.\u201d <em>Am\u2019s Health Ins. Plans v. Hudgens, </em>742 F.3d 1319, 1329 (11th Cir.2014) (quoting <em>Siegel, </em>234 F.3d at 1176).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">A party who bring an action for trademark infringement must show \u201cthat its mark has priority and that the defendant\u2019s mark is likely to cause consumer confusion.\u201d <em>Frehling Enters., Inc. v. Int\u2019l Select Grp., Inc., </em>192 F.3d 1330, 1335 (11th Cir. 1999). Trademark rights are gained in the common law via actual prior use in commerce. <em>Tally-Ho, Inc. v. Coast Comm. Coll. Dist., </em>889 F.2d 1018, 1022 (11th Cir. 1990). We have stated that, \u201c[i]n general, uses that are <em>de minimis </em>may not establish trademark ownership rights.\u201d <em>Planetary Motion, Inc. v. Techsplosion, Inc., </em>261 F.3d 1188, 1196 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">The district court did not abuse its discretion. New Wave used the mark a single time, in a Christmas card that purportedly contained a coupon; this coupon and its terms have not been entered into evidence. Thus we do not know how the coupon acted in placing Mr. Foamer in commerce. The card did not infer that New Wave had a new name or was marketing a product with the name Mr. Foam-er; it was a cartoon of one of its products in a Santa hat with a greeting attached. As such, it was a <em>de minimis </em>use of the mark.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, New Wave has not estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>lished trademark ownership rights and has not demonstrated substantial likelihood of success on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b558-7\">. We reject New Wave\u2019s reliance on the Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure for its discussion of token use in this context. The discussion in the manual is about season<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>al products, not a seasonal ad campaign. New Wave\u2019s Christmas card was not akin to \"test markets, infrequent sales of large of expensive items, or ongoing shipments of a new drug to clinical investigators.\u201d TMEP \u00a7 902.02\u2019 (citing S.Rep. No. 515, 100th Cong.2d Sess. 44-45 (1988)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
