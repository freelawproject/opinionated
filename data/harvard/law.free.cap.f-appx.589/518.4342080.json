James argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to consider the statutory sentencing factors before it ordered that his federal sentence run consecutively to his undischarged state sentence of five years of probation. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-17\">James\u2019s sentence is procedurally and substantively reasonable. The district court considered the presentence investigation report, the statutory sentencing factors, and James\u2019s argument that his federal sentence should run concurrent with his state sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a), (b); <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005). The district court had the discretion to order that James\u2019s federal sentence \u201crun concurrently ... or consecutively to the prior undischarged term of imprisonment to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense,\u201d United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5G1.3(c) (Nov. 2013), and it reasonably determined that \u201cthere was no connection between\u201d James\u2019s possession of a firearm and an earlier offense of aggravated assault that would warrant allowing him to serve the sentences for those offenses concurrently. <em>See id. </em>cmt. n. 3(A). The explanation provided by the district Court reveals that it considered James\u2019s background and history and the need for his sentence to provide just punishment for his illegal possession of a firearm, to promote respect for the law, and to deter him from committing further similar crimes. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). And the district court sentenced James within his advisory guideline range of 46 to 57 months of imprisonment, which we consider to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). The district court did not abuse its discretion when it ordered James to serve his 51 month sentence consecutive to his state sentence of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
