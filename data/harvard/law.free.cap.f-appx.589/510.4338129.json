On appeal, Furs-Julius asserts that the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) improperly weighed testimony concerning her \u201clong term blood cancer\u201d and failed to consider an allegation concerning an emergency-room visit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Upon careful review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The Commissioner of Social Security uses a five-step evaluation process to determine whether a claimant is disabled. <em>See Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1178 (11th Cir.2011). If the claimant does not have a severe impairment or combination of impairments, she is not disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(c), 416.920(c). We review the Commissioner\u2019s decision<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for substantial evidentiary support and proper legal bases. <em>See Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Substantial evidence requires \u201cmore than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). On appeal, \u201c[w]e may not decide the facts anew, reweigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the [Commissioner].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cEven if the evidence preponderates against the [administrative agency\u2019s] factual findings, we must affirm if the decision reached is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Martin v. Sullivan, </em>894 F.2d 1520, 1529 (11th Cir.1990). We will not consider arguments that were not raised before the administrative agency or the district court. <em>See Kelley v. Apfel, </em>185 F.3d 1211, 1215 (11th Cir.1999) (per cu-riam).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">Furs-Julius first argues the district court erred in affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision because the ALJ did not properly weigh her testimony that blood transfusions have resulted in \u201ca genuine long term blood cancer.\u201d To the extent we can construe that argument as referring to Furs-Julius\u2019s claims of anemia, the ALJ correctly determined that her anemia was not severe and did not affect her ability to work. The ALJ based this determination on substantial evidence, including treatment notes and lab work showing that Furs-Julius required only one transfusion; a lack of evidence suggesting that she would require additional blood transfusions; a lack of evidence that her anemia met the 12-month durational requirement for severity under the Act; and no evidence demonstrating that her anemia causes any more than minimal functional limitations on her ability to work. <em>See Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1178. Although Furs-Julius argues that the ALJ did not properly weigh her testimony, we cannot reweigh the evidence on appeal. <em>See Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1213 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). The ALJ\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence and are consistent with the applicable legal standards; as such, the findings are conclusive, and we must affirm. <em>See, e.g., Bridges v. Bowen, </em>815 F.2d 622, 626 (11th Cir.1987) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">Next, Furs-Julius avers that \u201cthe courts failed to consider record evidence that she flat[-]lined ... [and was] pronounced dead upon arrival to the emergency room.\u201d However, this argument does not entitle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>her to relief. Furs-Julius did not raise the argument before the ALJ, and we find no support for this assertion in the administrative record. <em>See Kelley, </em>185 F.3d at 1215. Further, even if we could consider this contention and accepted it as true, it does not demonstrate that Furs-Julius has any additional work-related limitations not considered by the district court or the ALJ; thus, we would still have no basis to overrule the district court\u2019s judgment affirming the ALJ\u2019s determination that Furs-Julius is not disabled. <em>See Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1178; <em>Bridges, </em>815 F.2d at 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b540-6\">. Furs-Julius has abandoned, by failing to address on appeal, the ALJ\u2019s findings that: (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>she had engaged in substantial gainful activity since her alleged disability onset date; (2) a mass in her breast was not a severe impairment; and (3) her neck and back pain did not meet or equal a listed impairment. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (noting that, despite our liberal construction of pro se filings, \"issues not briefed on appeal by a pro se litigant are deemed abandoned\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b541-14\">. The Appeals Council denied Furs-Julius\u2019s request for review, making the ALJ\u2019s decision \u2014 issued after an administrative hearing at Furs-Julius's request \u2014 the final decision of the Commissioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b542-17\">.
