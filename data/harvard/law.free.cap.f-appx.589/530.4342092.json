Morgan was sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of 15 years\u2019 imprisonment under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) based on a pretrial stipulation that he had been convicted in Georgia state court of: (1) sale of cocaine, (2) possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, (3) robbery, and (4) aggravated assault and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. Morgan asserts he is entitled to bring a \u00a7 2241 petition based on <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), under the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">The district court did not err in summarily dismissing Morgan\u2019s petition because it plainly appears from his petition that he is not entitled to \u00a7 2241 relief. <em>See Hittson v. GDCP Warden, </em>759 F.3d 1210, 1270 (11th Cir.2014) (stating summary dismissal of a habeas petition is appropriate \u201cif it plainly appears from the petition and any attached exhibits that the petitioner is not entitled to relief\u2019). In order to biting a \u00a7 2241 petition based on <em>Begay </em>under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e), Morgan was required to establish that throughout his sentencing, direct appeal, and \u00a7 2255 proceeding, binding circuit precedent squarely foreclosed his <em>Be-gay </em>claim, and that after Morgan\u2019s initial \u00a7 2255 proceeding, <em>Begay </em>overturned that circuit precedent. <em>See Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1274 (11th Cir.2013) (explaining to successfully bring such a claim pursuant to the savings clause, the petitioner needed to, among other things, establish that throughout his sentencing, direct appeal, and \u00a7 2255 proceeding, binding circuit precedent squarely foreclosed his \u00a7 924(e) claim and that subsequent to his initial \u00a7 2255 proceeding, <em>Begay </em>overturned prior circuit precedent regarding the petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 924(e) claim). Morgan was not sentenced until December 5, 2008, almost seven months after the Supreme Court decided <em>Begay </em>on April 16, 2008. <em>See Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581. He fails to show why he could not have presented this claim at sentencing, on direct appeal, or in a timely-filed first \u00a7 2255 motion. Thus, he has failed to meet his burden of showing his right to the requested form of habeas relief. <em>See Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274. Accordingly, the district court did not err in summarily dismissing his petition on the basis there was no impediment to Morgan raising his current claim either at sentencing, on direct appeal, or in a \u00a7 2255 motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b561-9\">. When reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition, we review questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact <em>de novo, </em>and findings of fact for clear error. <em>Nyland v. Moore, </em>216 F.3d 1264, 1266 (11th Cir.2000). We review <em>de novo </em>whether a prisoner may bring a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e). <em>Williams v.
