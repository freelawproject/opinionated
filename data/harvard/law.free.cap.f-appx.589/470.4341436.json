The district court initially sentenced Roemmele to 144 months imprisonment and ordered restitution in the amount of $14,672,185. Roem-mele appealed his conviction and sentence, and the government cross-appealed, arguing that the district court erred in adopting the forfeiture amount as the amount of loss under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2S1.1. We affirmed Roem-mele\u2019s conviction, vacated his sentence, and remanded his case to the district court for resentencing so that the district court could calculate loss separately from the forfeiture amount. <em>United States v. Hein, </em>395 FedAppx. 652, 658-59 (2010) (unpublished). The district court resentenced Roemmele to 235 months imprisonment and increased the restitution award to $14,804,785 based on two victims\u2019 affidavits that the probation office had received after the initial sentence hearing. Roemmele appeals the length of his sentence and the amount of restitution he was ordered to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-18\">Roemmele contends that, under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), the district court violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial by finding the value of the laundered funds for purposes of applying a nine-level enhancement, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Sl.l(b)(2)(J) (2000), and by ordering restitution where the jury made no specific finding as to the amount of restitution, if any, his victims were entitled to receive. We review <em>de novo </em>the alleged <em>Alleyne </em>errors. <em>United States v. Payne, </em>763 F.3d 1301, 1303 (11th Cir.2014). If an <em>Alleyne </em>error occurred, we will vacate Roemmele\u2019s sentence unless the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-20\">Roemmele argues that, under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Alleyne, </em>the district court erred by finding by a preponderance of the evidence that the value of the laundered funds was more than $10 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>million and less than $20 million, which resulted in the nine-level enhancement contained in \u00a7 2Sl.l(b)(2)(J) applying. Instead, he claims, the jury should have been asked to find the value of the laundered funds beyond a reasonable doubt. Roem-mele\u2019s argument fails. <em>Alleyne </em>held that any fact supporting an enhanced mandatory minimum sentence must be (1) alleged in the indictment and (2) admitted by the defendant or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2155. <em>Alleyne </em>did not change a court\u2019s ability to apply the advisory sentencing guidelines, including making findings of fact that do not alter a statutory minimum or maximum sentence. <em>United States v. Charles, </em>757 F.3d 1222, 1225-26 (11th Cir. 2014); <em>see Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2163. In this case, the district court\u2019s factfinding affected Roemmele\u2019s advisory guidelines range but not the applicable statutory minimum or maximum sentence (indeed, none of the charges in Roemmele\u2019s indictment subjected him to a mandatory minimum sentence). As a result, the district court committed no <em>Alleyne </em>error by finding the value of the laundered funds by a preponderance of the evidence before applying the \u00a7 -2Sl.l(b)(2)(J) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Along the same lines, Roemmele also argues that the district court erroneously ordered restitution under <em>Alleyne </em>where the jury made no specific finding as to the amount of restitution, if any, his victims were entitled to receive.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That argument fails, too. We have held that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), does not apply to restitution orders because the restitution statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663, does not have a prescribed statutory maximum.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Dohrmann v. United States, </em>442 F.3d 1279, 1281 (11th Cir.2006) (collecting cases). <em>Alleyne </em>was an extension of <em>Apprendi. See Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2155, 2160. It-follows from <em>Dohrmann\u2019s </em>logic that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Alleyne </em>does not apply to restitution orders because the restitution statute does not have a prescribed statutory minimum either.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-6\">. The government argues that Roemmele has waived this argument because he did not challenge the restitution amount in his initial appeal. We need not decide the waiver issue, however, because Roemmele\u2019s argument is clearly meritless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b501-7\">. In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court held that any fact supporting an enhanced statutory maximum sentence must be (1) alleged in the indictment and (2) admitted by the defendant or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. In <em>Alleyne, </em>the Supreme Court extended <em>Apprendi\u2019s </em>holding to facts supporting an enhanced statutory minimum sentence. <em>Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2155, 2160.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
