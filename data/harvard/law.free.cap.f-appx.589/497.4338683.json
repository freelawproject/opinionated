Norris had previously been convicted in Alabama on one count of robbery in the first degree, in violation of Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-8-41, and two counts of unlawful possession of marijuana in the first degree, in violation of Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-12-213(a)(1), and the District Court therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>sentenced him under the Armed Career Criminal Act (the \u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) to a prison term of 180 months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He appeals his sentence on the ground that his two convictions for violating \u00a7 18A-12-213(a)(l), possession of marijuana for other than personal use, do not constitute \u201cserious drug offenses\u201d sufficient to serve as predicates for ACCA status. He acknowledges that this court, in <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>583 F.3d 1292, 1294 (11th Cir.2009), held that \u00a7 13A-12-213(a)(l) is a \u201cserious drug offense,\u201d but he argues that subsequent Supreme Court precedent requires that we revisit <em>Robinson\u2019s </em>holding. In particular, he argues that <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), establishes that \u201cthe essential consideration of the categorical approach is whether the statutory elements of the prior offense are the same or narrower than the predicate crime as defined by the ACCA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The ACCA states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">(e)(1) In the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of this title and has three previous convictions ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another, such person shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not less than fifteen years ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\">(2) As used in this subsection\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-9\">(A) the term \u201cserious drug offense\u201d means\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-10\">(ii) an offense under State law, involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802)), for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-14\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Section 13A-12-213(a)(1) of the Alabama Code, entitled Unlawful Possession of Marihuana in the First Degree, states,, in pertinent part: \u201c(a) a person commits the crime of unlawful possession of marihuana in the first degree if ... [h]e possesses marihuana for other than personal use .... (b) Unlawful possession of marihuana in the first degree is a Class C felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-15\">Section 13A-12-213(a)(l) is indivisible in that it does not set out an element of the offense in the alternative. We use a categorical approach to determine whether a state statute that is indivisible qualifies as an ACCA predicate offense. <em>United States v. Howard, </em>742 F.3d 1334, 1345 (11th Cir.2014).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Using that approach, in determining whether \u00a7 13A-12-213(a)(l) is \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under the ACCA, we examine whether \u00a7 13A-12-213(a)(l) involves distribution, manufacture, or possession with intent to distribute or manufacture. <em>United States v. James, </em>430 F.3d 1150, 1155 (11th Cir.2005). If the statute criminalizes a range of actions, we assume that the defendant\u2019s convictions rested on the least of the acts criminalized and ascertain whether those acts are encompassed by the generic federal offenses. <em>Howard, </em>742 F.3d at 1345. A conviction will qualify as an ACCA predicate offense only if the state statute punishes the same acts as, or narrower acts than, those de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>fined in federal law. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Descamps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2281).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">We conclude that the District Court was properly classified Norris as an armed career criminal under the ACCA. Viewing \u00a7 13A-12-213(a)(l) as a whole in light of Alabama courts\u2019 interpretation of the statute, \u00a7 13A-12-213 is the- only section under which possession with intent to distribute or manufacture marijuana can be charged. Moreover, \u00a7 13A-12-213 does not apply either by its terms or based on any Alabama court\u2019s interpretation to any other form of non-personal use of marijuana. Thus, our holding in <em>Robinson </em>that \u00a7 13A-12-213 is a serious drug offense for purposes of ACCA remains good law.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-11\">. The minimum sentence the court could impose for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) was 15 years, i.e., 180 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b528-12\">. In <em>Descamps, </em>the Supreme Court limited the use of the \"modified categorical approach,\u201d in which courts may examine the facts underlying the defendant\u2019s previous conviction, to those statutes that are divisible. The formal \"categorical approach\u201d applies to all statutes that are indivisible. 133 S.Ct. at 2283-84.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
