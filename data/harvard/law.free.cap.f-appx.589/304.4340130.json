He asserts, as he did in district court, that his combined 82- - month sentence is greater than necessary to meet the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and is, therefore, substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-27\">Along that line, he contends the presumption of reasonableness should not apply because: advisory-Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2, the illegal reentry Guideline, lacks an empirical basis; it double-counts his criminal history; and it overstates the seriousness of his offense, which, according to him, is essentially an international trespass. He also notes that his illegal-reentry conviction is less serious than his pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>vious convictions, yet the sentence imposed in this matter exceeds the sentence imposed in his previous cases. He further contends the sentence fails to reflect his personal history and characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the advisory Guidelines-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The 71-month sentence imposed for De-hijar\u2019s illegal reentry offense was within the advisory Guidelines-sentencing range and is, therefore, entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>E.g., United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). As Dehijar concedes, his contention that Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based is foreclosed, along with his double-counting and international-trespass assertions. <em>E.g., United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). (He raises the lack-of-empirical-basis claim only to preserve it for possible further review.)</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The district court considered, but rejected, Dehijar\u2019s attempt to minimize the seriousness of his offenses, noting his history of criminal conduct weighed in favor of a sentence above the 60-month sentence previously imposed. Because Dehijar has not shown the court failed to consider any significant factors, gave undue weight to any improper factors, or clearly erred in balancing the sentencing factors, he has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>E.g., United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">Similarly, Dehijar has not shown his consecutive 11-month revocation sentence was substantively unreasonable. The district court had the discretion to order consecutive sentences. <em>E.g., United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 260 (5th Cir.2009); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a) (\u201cMultiple terms of imprisonment imposed at the same time run concurrently unless the court orders or the statute mandates that the terms are to run consecutively.\u201d); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B 1.3(f) &amp; cmt. n. 4. Because the sen- \u25a0 tences both fell within the advisory Guidelines-sentencing range and were consistent with the Guidelines\u2019 policy regarding consecutive sentences, they are entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>E.g., </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(2), 7B1.4; <em>United States v. Candio, </em>454 F.3d 468, 473 (5th Cir.2006). Dehijar has failed to show the district court abused its discretion by imposing the consecutive sentences, and has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness. <em>E.g., United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 809 (5th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
