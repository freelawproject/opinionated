Under \u00a7 1915(g), a prisoner may not proceed IFP in a civil action or in an appeal of a judgment in a civil action if he has, on three or more occasions during his incarceration, brought an action or appeal that was dismissed as frivolous or for failure to state a claim, unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. Davis has failed to demonstrate that he was under imminent danger of serious physical injury at the time that he sought to file his complaint in the district court, proceed with his appeal, or move to proceed IFP. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g); <em>Banos v. O\u2019Guin, </em>144 F.3d 883, 884 (5th Cir.1998). His allegation that he might be seriously injured at an indefinite point in the future because he has been required to wear shoes that are the wrong size and are damaged is insufficient to establish that he was in imminent danger of serious physical injury at the relevant times. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g); <em>Banos, </em>144 F.3d at 884-85. Thus, Davis\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b326-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
