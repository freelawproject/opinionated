The denial of a motion to reopen is reviewed under \u201ca highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard\u201d. <em>Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, </em>560 F.3d 354, 358 (5th Cir.2009) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">Nyansaseria failed to move to reopen his removal proceedings within 90 days of the BIA\u2019s final order of removal, as required by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1). His challenge necessarily relies on the exceptions to the filing deadline, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4), but he fails, for example, to claim the conditions in Kenya have changed or that the voluntary-departure order was entered <em>in absentia. </em>His summary assertion of \u201cchange of circumstances\u201d fails. Because he provides no other bases supporting an exception, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in dismissing his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b286-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
