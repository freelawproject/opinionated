The complaint purported to advance 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and <em>Bivens</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>claims of inmate-mail violations by Florida Department of Corrections (\u201cFDOC\u201d) officers and the United States Postmaster General (\u201cpostmaster general\u201d). The dismissal order was made in a full opinion: approaching 40 pages.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-12\">The appeal presents these issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-13\">(1)Whether the district court erred in denying Lewis\u2019s motions for extension of time to respond to the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-16\">(2) Whether the district court erred by dismissing Lewis\u2019s complaint before</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-17\">(A)the postmaster general filed a motion to dismiss and (B) the parties conducted discovery</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-18\">(3) Whether the court erred in dismissing Lewis\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted when it concluded that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-19\">(A) Lewis pleaded only unsupported, general, conclusory allegations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-20\">(B) the defendants were entitled to sovereign-immunity protections; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-21\">(C) Lewis did not have a right to send mail at the prison\u2019s expense</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-22\">(4) Whether the district court erred in dismissing Lewis\u2019s complaint for abuse of the judicial process where he misrepresented his litigation history</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-23\">No reversible error is presented by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-24\">a.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-25\">Where an act must be done within a specified time, the court may, for good cause, extend that time. Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(b)(1). We review a district court\u2019s denial of an extension of time for abuse of discretion. <em>See Young v. City of Palm Bay, Fla., </em>358 F.3d 859, 863-64 (11th Cir.2004). Under the abuse-of-discretion standard, \u201cso long as the district court does not commit a clear error in judgment, we will affirm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 863.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-26\">Lewis was granted one extension of time and was informed that no other extensions would be granted. The court did not abuse its discretion by denying Lewis additional extensions of time to respond to the FDOC\u2019s motion to dismiss. Lewis\u2019s many filings during the time in which he had to respond to the motion to dismiss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>undercut his contention that he needed additional time. Furthermore, Lewis\u2019s complaint was due to be dismissed, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">b.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">A \u201ccourt shall review, ... as soon as practicable,\u201d a complaint filed in a prisoner\u2019s civil action against a governmental entity or officer and will dismiss any portion of the complaint that \u201cfails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a), (b)(1). We review a district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) <em>de novo. Leal v. Georgia Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>254 F.3d 1276, 1278-79 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">\u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). We construe a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s pleadings liberally. <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir.2008). But \u201ceven in the case of <em>pro </em>se litigants this leniency does not give a court license to serve as <em>defacto </em>counsel for a party, or to rewrite an otherwise deficient pleading in order to sustain an action.\u201d <em>GJR Invs. v. Cnty. of Escambia, </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998) (citation omitted), <em>overruled on other grounds, as recognized in Randall v. Scott, </em>610 F.3d 701, 709 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">To prevail in a \u00a7 1983 action, a plaintiff must show that he or she was deprived of a federal right by a person acting under color of state law. <em>Griffin v. City of Opa-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir.2001). A complaint is subject to Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal when its allegations indicate the existence of an affirmative defense, AS long as the defense clearly appears on the face of the complaint. <em>Fortner v. Thomas, </em>983 F.2d 1024, 1028 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">\u201cUnder the Eleventh Amendment, state officials sued for damages in their official capacity are immune from suit in federal court.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Georgia Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>16 F.3d 1573, 1575 (11th Cir. 1994). A <em>Bivens </em>action does not lie against a federal agency. <em>FDIC v. Meyer, </em>510 U.S. 471, 486, 114 S.Ct. 996, 1006, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">The district court did not err by dismissing Lewis\u2019s complaint for failing to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Lewis\u2019s complaint was devoid of specific factual allegations against the defendants. Lewis \u2014 making only general, conclusory allegations claiming that the FDOC mishandled his mail \u2014 failed to show that he was deprived of a federal right. <em>See Griffin, </em>261 F.3d at 1303. Moreover, a claim for damages against the FDOC officers fails because the state officials sued in their official capacities are immune from such relief. <em>See Jackson, </em>16 F.3d at 1575. And Lewis has no <em>Bivens </em>claim against the postmaster general in his official capacity, which is construed as a claim against the United States Postal Service. <em>See Meyer, </em>510 U.S. at 484-86, 114 S.Ct. at 1005-06. For background on suits against USPS, see <em>USPS v. Flamingo Indus. (USA), Ltd., </em>540 U.S. 736, 744, 124 S.Ct. 1321, 1327, 158 L.Ed.2d 19 (2004) (although Congress waived the immunity of the postal service, \u201cCongress did not strip it of its governmental status\u201d: an important distinction because \u201c[a]n absence of immunity does not result in liability if the substantive law in question is not intended to reach the federal entity\u201d). Furthermore, to the extent Lewis argues that the court prematurely dismissed his complaint before a response from the postmaster general or a discovery period, this argument is contrary to the screening requirements of \u00a7 1915A. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>addition, Lewis failed to disclose his litigation history, although instructed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b981-14\">. <em>Bivens </em>v. <em>Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
