He challenges the 16-level enhancement imposed pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) for having been deported after being convicted of a drug trafficking offense. Torres-Hernandez argues that his Texas conviction for possession with intent to deliver cocaine did not qualify as a drug trafficking offense because Texas\u2019s definition of delivery is broader than the definition of a drug trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2. He asserts that the Texas offense of delivery may be committed by \u201cadministering\u201d a controlled substance. He further contends that, for the same reasons, the Texas offense does not qualify as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Because Torres-Hernandez failed to object to the enhancement in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Chavez-Hemandez, </em>671 F.3d 494, 497 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-13\">In <em>United States v. Teran-Salas, </em>767 F.3d 453, 460-62 (5th Cir.2014), we rejected the identical argument raised by Torres-Hernandez and stated that \u201cconviction under the administer prong is not a realistic probability because no previous Texas case has involved a conviction under this prong.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461. We determined that the Texas offense of possession with the intent to deliver cocaine was a drug trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2 and an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1326(b)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 461-62 &amp; n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-14\">Torres-Hernandez fails to show that the district court plainly erred. <em>See Teran-Salas, </em>767 F.3d at 461-62 &amp; n. 5. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
