The bankruptcy court determined that abstention was necessary and appropriate based on its conclusion that Milian was attempting to use the bankruptcy court to avoid or delay litigating a. related mortgage foreclosure case in state court. On appeal, the district court concluded that the bankruptcy court did not err in abstaining from exercising jurisdiction over Milian\u2019s adversary complaint. The district court also addressed two additional issues in its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-8\">On appeal, Milian contends that he was denied procedural due process and equal protection under the law by the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision to decline to exercise jurisdiction over his adversary complaint. He argues that the bankruptcy court was biased against him and maintains that it should have exercised discretion over his claims because they were federal in nature. He also alleges that the district court did not conduct a proper and full review of his claims, but rather deferred to the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings and the defendants\u2019 pleadings. He argues that the case did not favor abstention. Finally, he reiterates his assertion that the defendants do not hold the promissory note or the mortgage to his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-9\">\u201cAs the second court to review the judgment of the bankruptcy court, we review the order of the bankruptcy court independently of the district court.\u201d <em>Senior Transeastern Lenders v. Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors, </em>680 F.3d 1298, 1310 (11th Cir.2012). <em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998). Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(d): \u201c[a]ny decision to abstain or not to abstain made under section (c) ... is not renewable by appeal or otherwise by the court of appeals.... \u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-11\">Pursuant to \u00a7 1334(d), we lack jurisdiction to consider the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision to abstain under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(c). Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Additionally, to the extent that the district court addressed issues beyond abstention, those parts of the order are vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-12\">VACATED IN PART AND DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
