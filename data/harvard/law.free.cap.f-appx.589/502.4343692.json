Porro, Jr., and Joan Atkins Porro (\u201cTaxpayers\u201d) petitioned the Tax Court to contest the decision of the IRS Office of Appeals (\u201cAppeals Office\u201d) rejecting Taxpayers\u2019 offer-in-compromise as an alternative to the Commissioner\u2019s collection of Taxpayers\u2019 unpaid federal income tax liabilities for the years 1990 and 1991 by way of levy. The petition was tried to the Tax Court on a fully stipulated record pursuant to Tax Court Rule 122.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Taxpayers did not dispute their liability for the 1990 and 1991 taxes, so the Tax Court moved straight to the question of whether the Appeals Office had abused its discretion in rejecting their offer-in-compromise. It held that no such abuse had occurred, and therefore upheld the Appeals Office\u2019s decision that the Commissioner could collect Taxpayers\u2019 unpaid income taxes through levy.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-14\">Taxpayers appeal the Tax Court\u2019s decision. They present two arguments. The first is that the Commissioner\u2019s collection of their unpaid taxes is foreclosed by the statute of limitations or is otherwise time-barred.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We do not consider this argument because Taxpayers did not present it to the Tax Court. <em>Stubbs v. Comm\u2019r, </em>797 F.2d 936, 938 (11th Cir.1986). The second argument is that the Tax Court abused its discretion in upholding the Appeals Office\u2019s decision rejecting their offer-in-com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>promise.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They present this argument by incorporating by reference arguments their <em>pro bono </em>counsel made to the Tax Court regarding collection-abuse issues. By doing so, Taxpayers have waived their right to argue that the Tax Court improperly upheld the Appeals Office\u2019s rejection of their offer-in-compromise. \u201cIncorporating by reference to earlier filings is not a permissible way to present arguments to this court.\u201d <em>Weatherly v. Ala. State Univ., </em>728 F.3d 1263, 1273 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b533-9\">. Tax Court Rule 122, entitled \u201cSubmission Without Trial,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-10\">(a) General: Any case not requiring a trial for the submission of evidence (as, for example, where sufficient facts have been admitted, stipulated, established by deposition, or included in the record in some other way) may be submitted at any time after joinder of issue ... by motion of the parties filed with the Court. The parties need not wait for the case to be calendared for trial and need not appear in Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-11\">(b) Burden of Proof: The fact of submission of a case, under paragraph (a) of this Rule, does not alter the burden of proof, or the requirements otherwise applicable with respect to adducing proof, or the effect of failure of proof.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b533-12\">. The IRS must assess any tax within three years of a tax return being filed, except \"in the case of a false or fraudulent return with the intent to evade tax,\u201d in which case \"the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for collection of such tax may be begun without assessment, at any time.\" . I.R.C. \u00a7 6501(a), (c)(1). The Internal Revenue Code also provides that a \"tax may be collected by levy or by a proceeding in court, but only if the levy is made or the proceeding begun ... within 10 years after the assessment of the tax.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6502. Thus, to the extent that the Commissioner\u2019s assessment is delayed due to taxpayer fraud, the commencement of this 10-year limitations period is likewise delayed. Taxpayers stipulated before the Tax Court that the statute of limitations did not bar the Commissioner\u2019s collection efforts here because this case involves the filing of fraudulent returns. Taxpayers also claim that the Commissioner is barred from collecting the taxes due because (1) in 1996, the Commissioner elected not to file a criminal tax-evasion charge against them and (2) in 2004, the Commissioner informed the federal district court in New Jersey that the IRS had no claim against the Taxpayers for the years 1990 and 1991. Finally, Taxpayers claim that <em>Gabelli v. S.E.C., </em>568 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1216, 185 L.Ed.2d 297 (2013), which held that the five-year limitations period for filing a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2462 action to collect a civil penalty begins when the offending act occurs, not when it was discovered, bars the collection of their 1990 and 1991 taxes. <em>Gabelli </em>is inapposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b534-6\">. The Appeals Office rejected the Taxpayers\u2019 offer-in-compromise after affording the Taxpayers a hearing at their request pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330.
