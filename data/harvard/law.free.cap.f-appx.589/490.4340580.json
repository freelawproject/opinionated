It granted Jackson a certificate of appealability on whether he could benefit from the equitable exception to that statute of limitations created by <em>McQuiggin v. Perkins, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1924, 185 L.Ed.2d 1019 (2013). He now appeals the dismissal of his \u00a7 2254 petition, which we review <em>de novo. See Hepburn v. Moore, </em>215 F.3d 1208, 1209 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Those imprisoned pursuant to a state court judgment have one year to bring a \u00a7 2254 petition challenging that judgment. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). For Jackson, that one-year limitations period began to run on the date that his time to seek direct review in the Supreme Court of Georgia expired. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). He had ten days after the Court of Appeals of Georgia affirmed his convictions to petition the state supreme court for direct review. <em>See </em>Ga. Sup.Ct. R. 38(1); <em>Pugh v. Smith, </em>465 F.3d 1295, 1299-1300 (11th Cir.2006). The court of appeals affirmed his convictions on June 7, 2000. The tenth day after that date was a Saturday, extending the filing deadline to the following Monday. <em>See </em>Ga. Sup.Ct.. R. 11. So Jackson\u2019s time for seeking direct review in the Supreme Gourt of Georgia expired on June 19, 2000. Jackson had until June 19, 2001, to file a \u00a7 2254 petition. He filed the petition that is the subject of this appeal on June 26, 2013. He missed \u00a7 2244(d)\u2019s deadline by over a decade.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">Jackson asks us to ignore that fact. He argues that he should benefit from the equitable exception to the statute of limitations. <em>See McQuiggin </em>133 S.Ct. at 1931. That exception would allow Jackson\u2019s untimely \u00a7 2254 petition to proceed if he could show that his incarceration is a \u201cfundamental miscarriage of justice\u201d \u2014 in other words, that he is actually innocent. <em>See id. </em>at 1931-32. To do that, Jackson must establish that in light of new evidence it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him. <em>Id. </em>at 1933, 1935 (adopting the test established by <em>Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 329, 115 S.Ct. 851, 868, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995)). If Jackson makes that showing, he is not necessarily entitled to habeas relief, but he may proceed with his untimely \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>See id. </em>at 1931 (\u201cWe have not resolved whether a prisoner may be entitled to habeas relief based on a freestanding claim of actual innocence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">Jackson asserts that no reasonable juror could have convicted him in the face of two documents that were not presented at trial. Those two documents appear to be a police report and three nonconsecutive pages from a transcript of a judicial proceeding. (Neither document bears any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>identifying marks other than a cryptic, handwritten numbering system). Both documents contain statements by the cashier Jackson robbed, saying that she never saw him with a gun. According to Jackson, those two documents satisfy his burden under <em>McQuiggin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Even though the jury did not see those two documents, it did hear the cashier\u2019s testimony, which included her statement that she had seen no gun. But the jury also heard the testimony of another witness who said that she had seen a gun sticking out of Jackson\u2019s waistband during the robbery. Jackson\u2019s two documents do nothing to impeach that other witness\u2019s testimony. They merely reiterate what the jury heard: The cashier herself never saw a gun. Because a reasonable juror could read those two documents and still convict Jackson of armed robbery based on the other witness\u2019 testimony, Jackson has not met his <em>McQuiggin </em>burden to show that in light of new evidence it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him. <em>McQuiggin, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1933, 1935; <em>cf. Rozzelle v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>672 F.3d 1000, 1017 (11th Cir.2012) (\u201c[H]is claim still fails because his \u2018new\u2019 evidence is largely cumulative of what the jury heard, and he has not made a sufficient showing that it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him ....\u201d) (applying <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 324, 327, 115 S.Ct. at 865, 867). The district court did not err by dismissing his untimely \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b521-8\">. .Jackson named \"Mr. Tools\u201d as the respondent in his petition. Noting that the warden of Georgia State Prison, Bruce Chatman, was the proper respondent, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242, the district court sua sponte ordered that Chatman be substituted as the respondent. <em>Cf. West v. Louisiana, </em>478 F.2d 1026, 1029 (5th Cir. 1973) (holding that denial of a habeas petition for failure to name the proper respondent \"would give an unreasonably narrow reading to the habeas corpus statute\u201d), <em>affd in relevant part en banc, </em>510 F.2d 363, 363 (5th Cir. 1975). (In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before October 1, 1981.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b521-13\">. Jackson does not benefit from the statutory provision that tolls the limitations period while a properly filed application for state postconviction relief is pending, because he first filed for state postconviction relief nearly seven years after the statute of limitations had run. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2); <em>Johnson v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>513 F.3d 1328, 1331 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
