Ellsperman<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for failure to state a claim for relief and (2) denying Weaver\u2019s motion, which the District Court treated as a petition for writ of mandamus, that the District Court direct the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Florida to initiate a criminal investigation. Doc. 33. We find no merit in the appeal for the reasons stated by the District Court in its February 18, 2014 order, and therefore affirm the court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-18\">. Ellsperman is Clerk of the Circuit Court of Marion County, Florida. There is no dispute that at all relevant times, he was acting within the scope of his discretionary authority. Insofar as the Second Amended Complaint alleges that Ellsperman violated Weaver\u2019s federal constitutional rights, to recover against Ellsperman on those allegations Weaver had to show that the rights purportedly violated were clearly established at the time Ellsper-man engaged in the conduct complained of. <em>Randall v. Scott, </em>610 F.3d 701, 715 (11th Cir.2010). Absent such showing, Ellsperman was entitled to qualified immunity. As the District Court properly held, Weaver failed to make the required showing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
