Pursuant to a plea agreement, Marchesseault pleaded guilty to the offense, and, on December 7, 2010, the District Court sentenced him to a one-year term of probation conditioned on his serving one hundred hours of community service, attending anger-management classes, and making restitution in the sum of $2,711. Doc. 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-18\">After serving the term of probation and complying with its conditions, Marches-seault, on February 4, 2013, moved the District Court for reconsideration. The court treated the motion as a challenge to his conviction and sentence, and therefore brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. On May 15, 2013, the court denied the motion as time-barred because it had not been filed within one year of the date Marches-seault\u2019s conviction became final. Doc. 47 at 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-19\">On July 19, 2013, Marchesseault filed a notice of appeal challenging the District Court\u2019s May 15, 2013, order. On July 15, 2014, this court treated Marchessealut\u2019s February 4, 2013, motion as a petition for writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>and entertained the appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-20\">\u201cFederal courts have authority to issue a writ of error coram nobis under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Mills, </em>221 F.3d 1201, 1203 (11th Cir.2000). A writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>is available to vacate a conviction after the petitioner has served his sentence. <em>United States v. Peter, </em>310 F.3d 709, 712 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cThe writ of error coram nobis is an extraordinary remedy of last resort available only in compelling circumstances where necessary to achieve justice.\u201d <em>Mills, </em>221 F.3d at 1203. <em>Coram nobis </em>relief is limited to the most fundamental errors, and such relief is only proper when \u201cno other remedy is available and the petitioner presents sound reasons for failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>seek relief earlier.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1203-04; <em>see Alikhani v. United States, </em>200 F.3d 732, 734 (11th Cir.2000) (concluding that defendant\u2019s claims could have been raised in a pretrial motion and were therefore not cognizable on <em>coram nobis </em>review).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The errors flagged by Marchesseault in his motion to reconsider relate to errors in events that occurred prior to his plea of guilty, the plea itself, his presentence investigation report, his restitution, and the effectiveness of his attorney.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He has provided no \u201csound reasons\u201d as to why these issues could not have been raised in pretrial motions, on direct appeal, or in a timely filed \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Mills, 221 </em>F.3d at 1204; <em>see also Alikhani, </em>200 F.3d at 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-16\">. We held that the appeal was timely. Because the District Court did not enter a judgment in a separate document, we deemed its order entered 150 days after May 15, 2013.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b525-17\">. Marchesseault waived several of these issues by pleading guilty and by failing to raise these issues related to his guilty plea on direct appeal. <em>See Peter, </em>310 F.3d at 712 (noting that the failure to challenge a guilty plea on direct appeal waived several types of error in the proceedings which resulted in the guilty plea); <em>see also United States v. Smith, </em>532 F.3d 1125, 1127 (11th Cir.2008) (stating that a guilty plea waives all non-jurisdictional challenges to a conviction).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
