Dak-ing seeks the vacation of his sentence on the ground that it is both procedurally and substantively unreasonably. He contends that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court erred in applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2), 2G2.2(b)(3)(D) and 2G2.2(b)(5), all specific offense characteristics, and that it is substantively unreasonable due to these procedural errors. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-23\">The district court increased the base offense level of Dakings\u2019s offense, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2, by two levels under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2) because the pornographic material he transmitted \u201cinvolved a prepubescent minor or a minor who had not attained the age of 12 years.\u201d Daking argues that the court erred because the child to whom he transmitted the pornography \u2014 D.R.\u2014was over age twelve when he began transmitting illicit content to him. Dakings failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>to object to the courts \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2) enhancement, so we review the enhancement for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">To prevail, Daking must convince us that the court not only erred, but that the error was plain and prejudicially affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Stevenson, </em>68 F.3d 1292, 1294 (11th Cir. 1995). Even then, he would not be entitled to relief unless we conclude that the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of his sentencing proceeding. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1779, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). We find no error here, much less error that is plain. The search of Daking\u2019s computer equipment, and a comparison of the images found to a national child pornography database, revealed that Daking was responsible for images of child victims known to be under twelve.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Section \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5) requires the district court to increase the base offense level by five levels \u201c[i]f the defendant engaged in a pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor.\u201d Section \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(D) requires the district court to increase the base offense level by six levels if \u201c[distribution to a minor that was intended to persuade, induce, entice, or coerce the minor to engage in any illegal activity, other than illegal activity covered under subdivision (E).\u201d The invited error doctrine precludes our review of Daking\u2019s argument that the district court erred in applying these guidelines in fixing the total offense level for his offense because his attorney, at the sentencing hearing, informed the court that he was withdrawing any objections Dak-ings may have had to the application of these guidelines. <em>See Doc. 115: 6, 11-12. See, e.g., United States v. Love, </em>449 F.3d 1154, 1157 (11th Cir.2006) (applying invited error doctrine where defendant requested supervised release as a sentence and then contested his eligibility for supervised release on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">Dakings\u2019 argument that his sentence is substantively unreasonable is based on the assumption that the district court erred in applying the guidelines cited above. Since we do not disturb the court\u2019s application of those guidelines, his argument that his sentence is substantively unreasonable fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-16\">.
