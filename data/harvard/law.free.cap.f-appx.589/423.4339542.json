On appeal, Espinoza argues that his sentence is unreasonable. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">I. GENERAL PRINCIPLES</p>\n<p id=\"b454-14\">\u201cWe review the reasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion using a two-step process.\u201d <em>United States v. Cubero, </em>754 F.3d 888, 892 (11th Cir.2014) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cFirst, we look at whether the district court committed any significant procedural error, such as miscalculating the advisory guidelines range, treating the guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing' to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThen, we examine whether the sentence is substantively unreasonable under the totality of the circumstances and in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-15\">The party challenging the sentence has the burden to show that it is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008). We will reverse only if \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1191 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-16\">II. PROCEDURAL REASONABLENESS</p>\n<p id=\"b454-17\">With respect to procedural reasonableness, Espinoza claims the district court presumed the advisory guidelines range of 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Hill, </em>643 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>F.3d 807, 880 (11th Cir.2011) (\u201cIf a district court applies the guidelines as though they were mandatory or treats the range as presumptively reasonable, that is procedural error.\u201d). Espinoza points to comments the district court made in response to Espinoza\u2019s request for a downward variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Espinoza sought a variance based on the Sentencing Commission\u2019s 2013 Report to Congress (\u201cthe 2013 Report\u201d), which recommended changes to the guidelines provision for non-production child pornography offenses, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2, to reflect technological changes in the way typical offenders receive and distribute child pornography. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Commission, Report to the Congress: Federal Child Pornography Offenses (December 2012).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In considering Espinoza\u2019s variance request, the district court suggested that Congress\u2019s inaction on the 2013 Report might mean that Congress believes \u00a7 2G2.2 does not need to be changed, but that if Congress is merely slow to act, as Espinoza urged, Espinoza could request resentencing after Congress enacts legislation and the Sentencing Commission makes those changes retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Espinoza\u2019s focus on this suggestion, however, ignores the rest of the district court\u2019s comments, which make clear that the district court considered and rejected Espinoza\u2019s variance request based on the particular facts of Espinoza\u2019s case and not because the district court applied a legal presumption of reasonableness. Specifically, after Espinoza\u2019s counsel pointed out that some district courts already were varying downward based on the 2013 Report, the district court acknowledged that it could vary downward \u201cif the offense conduct warranted] it.\u201d The district court concluded, however, that \u201cwith this case,\u201d a downward variance was not appropriate. The district court pointed out that, when law enforcement first uncovered Espinoza\u2019s downloading of child pornography, agents gave Espinoza \u201ca break.\u201d After forensic examination confirmed Espinoza\u2019s confession that he had downloaded and then deleted child pornography, the agents returned Espinoza\u2019s computer and warned him to stop downloading child pornography or face imprisonment. Within three months, however, Espinoza had resumed downloading child pornography and admitted in a second confession to agents that he would not stop unless he was arrested. It was these facts, and not a presumption of reasonableness, that caused the district court to deny Espinoza\u2019s request for a downward variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">We also reject Espinoza\u2019s claims that the district court failed to consider \u00a7 3553(a) factors other than the guidelines range and failed to explain adequately the chosen sentence. The district court explicitly stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and cited several factors, including the offense conduct and the need for deterrence and punishment. <em>See United States v. Dougherty, </em>754 F.3d 1353, 1359 (11th Cir.2014) (\u201cNothing requires the district court to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and an acknowledgment that it has considered each will suffice.\u201d). Furthermore, the district court adequately explained that it denied Espinoza\u2019s variance request because Espinoza\u2019s failed to heed law enforcement\u2019s warning and stop downloading child pornography. <em>See. </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) (requiring the district court to, at the time of sentencing, state in ' open court the reasons for its imposition of a particular sentence); <em>Cubero, </em>754 F.3d at 897 (explaining that the 2013 Report \u201cdoes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>not heighten the district court\u2019s statutory duty [under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(c) ]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">III. SUBSTANTIVE</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">REASONABLENESS</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">As to substantive reasonableness, Espinoza has not carried his burden to show the district court\u2019s imposition of a 151-month sentence, followed by lifetime supervised release, was an abuse of discretion. Espinoza\u2019s prison sentence is at the low end of the advisory guidelines range of 151 to 188 months, and well below the applicable 20-year statutory maximum, both markers of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008). By his own admission, Espinoza downloaded child pornography for a decade \u2014 since he was twelve years old \u2014 and would not, or could not, stop doing so even after being discovered by law enforcement and threatened with imprisonment. Under the circumstances, given the need to deter Espinoza and protect the public, we cannot say either a 151-month sentence or a life term of supervision was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Espinoza argues that the' district court gave insufficient weight to the 2013 Report, which undermines U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2. \u201cWhile a district court may certainly consider the 2013 report in choosing the ultimate sentence, the report does not invalidate \u00a7 2G2.2,\u201d and \u201cuse of \u00a7 2G2.2 as an advisory guideline\u201d does not make the resulting sentence substantively unreasonable, \u201climit the district court\u2019s discretion to determine what weight to give each \u00a7 3553(a) factor,\u201d or \u201crequire the district court to vary from the \u00a7 2G2.2-based guidelines range.\u201d <em>See Cubero, </em>754 F.3d at 900. Here, the 2013 Report was only one factor the district court considered, and it was within the district court\u2019s discretion to give greater weight to the fact that Espinoza was admittedly and demonstrably unable to stop downloading child pornography and to the various \u00a7 3553(a) factors that fact implicated. <em>See United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">Further, the record does not support Espinoza\u2019s claim that the district court \u201cignored\u201d or \u201cgave <em>no </em>weight\u201d to his mitigating facts, such as that: (1) he did not collect child pornography, (2) he had no means to obtain counseling; (3) he had cooperated fully with law enforcement; and (4) his was an unsophisticated first-offender who had not produced child pornography or had contact with children. The district court heard Espinoza\u2019s mitigation arguments, including those supported by the 2013 Report, and was not required to explicitly address them. <em>See United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 833 (11th Cir.2007) (explaining that the district court\u2019s failure to discuss mitigating evidence does not mean the district court ignored or failed to consider that evidence in determining the sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">Under the totality of the circumstances, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion when it imposed a 151-month sentence and a life term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b454-12\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence to reflect the serious of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b455-7\">. At sentencing, Espinoza did not object to the district court\u2019s guidelines calculations based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 and does not raise any guidelines calculation error on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
