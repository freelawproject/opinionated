Watkins complained that the officers interfered with his \u201cliberty interest right ... to use ... property open to [and being used by] the public\u201d in violation of his right to due process under the Fifth Amendment and in violation of his right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-20\">Watkins alleged that he parked his vehicle on private property that was used frequently by \u201cmany people in all kinds of vehicles,\u201d and that Elmore and Lagrasta ordered him to move his vehicle because he was on property owned by the city. The officers stated that they were \u201cgetting a lot of complaints about\u201d Watkins and that they would call a tow truck if Watkins did not remove his broken down vehicle. When Watkins asserted that he was homeless and waiting for a friend to bring him auto parts, Lagrasta identified a place for Watkins to call for assistance. Because Watkins failed to leave, Lagrasta issued Watkins a citation for trespassing and had his vehicle towed to a public lot. A few days later, Watkins visited the police department, where he was told that \u201che was not trespassed from being in or returning to the property\u201d and that the property was owned by a bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-21\">The district court correctly dismissed Watkins\u2019s complaint. Watkins failed to state that the officers deprived him of a constitutionally protected interest in liberty or property without notice or an oppor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>tunity to be heard. <em>Catron v. City of St. Petersburg, </em>658 F.3d 1260, 1266 (11th Cir. 2011). Watkins did not have a legitimate interest in parking his vehicle on private property, and the officers explained to him that he was trespassing and gave him an opportunity to leave. Watkins also failed to state that the officers treated him differently than others similarly situated because of his membership in a protected class. <em>See Jones v. Ray, </em>279 F.Sd 944, 946-47 (11th Cir.2001). Unlike others, Watkins had been generating \u201ca lot of complaints,\u201d and Watkins was not a member of a protected class. <em>See Joel v. City of Orlando, </em>232 F.3d 1353, 1358 (11th Cir. 2000) (\u201cHomeless persons are not a sus-, pect class.\u201d). Watkins argues that the officers denied him the equal protection of law based on a \u201cclass of one\u201d theory, but the officers had a rational basis for their actions. <em>See Griffin Indus., Inc. v. Irvin, </em>496 F.3d 1189, 1202 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">We AFFIRM the dismissal of Watkins\u2019s complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
