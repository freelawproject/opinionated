He contends that trial counsel was ineffective for filing deficient pretrial motions and a deficient sentencing memorandum and for failing to object to the district court\u2019s denial of the Government\u2019s motion for a downward departure. Pretermitting the timeliness of Schwartz\u2019s notice of appeal, we decline to review these claims on direct appeal because the record is not sufficiently developed to determine whether trial counsel was ineffective. <em>See United States v. Isgar, </em>739 F.3d 829, 841 (5th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 123, 190 L.Ed.2d 94 (2014). This determination is without prejudice to Schwartz\u2019s ability to raise his claims in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-23\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b288-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
