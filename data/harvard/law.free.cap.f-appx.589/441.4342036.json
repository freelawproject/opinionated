On appeal, Mr. Alas-Murcia argues that the Attorney General exceeded his authority and contravened Congressional intent in the manner in which he promulgated regulations governing TPS applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b472-16\">We generally review questions of law <em>de novo. De Sandoval v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1276, 1278 (11th Cir.2006). We evaluate whether an agency\u2019s regulation im-permissibly conflicts with its governing statute by applying the two-step test articulated in <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). <em>Scheerer v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>445 F.3d 1311, 1318 (11th Cir.2006). First, we determine \u201cwhether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). If Congress\u2019 intent is clear, we, \u201cas well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1318-19 (quotation omitted). If Congress has not directly addressed the matter or the statute is ambiguous with respect to the matter, we move \u201cto <em>Chevron\u2019s </em>second step to decide whether the agency\u2019s regulation is based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1319 (quotation and bracket omitted). Where Congress gives an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation, as opposed to failing to address the precise question, \u201cthe agency\u2019s legislative regulations are given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary, to the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">TPS is authorized by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a, and \u201callows eligible nationals of a foreign state to temporarily remain in the United States during the pendency of that state\u2019s designation for the TPS program.\u201d <em>Cervantes v. Holder, </em>597 F.3d 229, 231 (4th Cir.2010). The Attorney General may designate any foreign state for TPS if, among other things, he finds that \u201cthere has been an earthquake, ... or other environmental disaster in the state resulting in a substantial, but temporary, disruption of living conditions in the area affected.\u201d Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 244(b)(l)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a(b)(l)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">On March 9, 2001, the Attorney General designated El Salvador under the TPS program due to devastating earthquakes that occurred in that country in February of 2001. <em>See </em>Designation of El Salvador Under Temporary Protected Status Program (\u201cEl Salvador Designation\u201d), 66 Fed. Reg. 14214-01. El Salvador\u2019s designation for TPS has been continually extended, and the current extension remains in effect until March 19, 2015. <em>See </em>Extension of the Designation of El Salvador for Temporary Protected Status, 78 Fed.Reg. 324 18-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">Any alien who is a national of a designated foreign state may be granted TPS if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-9\">(i)the alien has been continuously physically present in the United States since the effective date of the most recent designation of that state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-11\">(ii) the alien has continuously resided in the United States since such date as the [Attorney General] may designate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-12\">(iii) the alien is admissible as an immigrant, except as otherwise provided under paragraph (2)(A), and is not ineligible for [TPS] under paragraph (2)(B); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-13\">(iv) to the extent and in a manner which the [Attorney General] establishes, the alien registers for the [TPS] under this section during a registration period of not less than 180 days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-14\">INA \u00a7 244(c)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a(c)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-16\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b473-17\">In initially designating El Salvador under the TPS program, the Attorney General stated that the designation and registration period would remain in effect from March 9, 2001, until September 9, 2002. <em>See </em>El Salvador Designation, 66 Fed.Reg. at 14214. The Attorney General\u2019s designation noted that individuals who met the requirements for TPS could apply within the initial registration period. <em>Id. </em>Individuals who did not apply during the initial registration period could register during any subsequent extension of designation if they met the requirements set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 244.2(f)(2). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-18\">Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 244.2, aliens who do not apply for TPS during the initial registration period can file TPS applications during any subsequent extension of the designation if they meet the statutory requirements and, at the time of the initial registration period:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-19\">(i) the applicant [was] a nonimmigrant or ha[d] been granted voluntary de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>parture status or any relief from removal;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-4\">(ii) The applicant ha[d] an application for change of status, adjustment of status, asylum, voluntary departure, or any relief from removal which is pending or subject to further review or appeal;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">(iii) The applicant [was] a parolee or ha[d] a pending request for repa-r\u00f3le; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">(iv) The applicant [was] a. spouse or child of an alien currently eligible to be a TPS registrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 244.2(f)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Mr. Alas-Murcia filed his application for TPS on October 9, 2008, over one year after the initial registration period ended. Because Mr. Alas-Murcia failed to file his application during the initial registration period or demonstrate his eligibility for late initial registration under \u00a7 244.2(f)(2), the IJ and the BIA properly found him ineligible for TPS. Mr. Alas-Murcia argues, however, that the registration requirements for TPS set forth in \u00a7 244.2 conflict with Congressional intent concerning TPS applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">We have thoroughly considered Mr. Alas-Mureia\u2019s challenges to the regulation at issue and find them without merit. Congress gave the Attorney General the express delegation of authority to determine and define the registration period, which he did by issuing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 244.2. See INA \u00a7 244(e)(l)(A)(iv), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a(c)(l)(A)(iv). We find that the Attorney General\u2019s promulgation of \u00a7 244.2 was based on a reasonable interpretation of \u00a7 1254a (c)(l)(A)(iv) and was not arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to law. <em>See Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">The statutory language contemplates the Attorney General setting a specific time period for aliens to apply for TPS. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 244(c)(l)(A)(iv), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a(c)(l)(A)(iv). Although \u00a7 1254a(c)(l)(A)(i) provides that, to be eligible for TPS, an alien must have been continuously present in the United States since the \u201cmost recent designation,\u201d that does not make the regulatory creation of an initial registration period manifestly contrary to the statute. Indeed, the statutory phrase \u201cmost recent designation\u201d has consistently been interpreted to refer to the initial registration period designated by the Attorney General. <em>See Cervantes, </em>597 F.3d at 235 (\u201c[T]he statutory phrase \u2018most recent designation\u2019 merely distinguishes the current designation of a foreign state for the TPS program from any prior TPS program designations of that same foreign state.\u201d); <em>De Leon-Ochoa v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>622 F.3d 341, 355 (3d Cir.2010) (rejecting petitioners\u2019 argument that the phrase \u201cmost recent designation\u201d should be read to refer the most recent extension of a state\u2019s TPS designation, rather than the initial designation of a state for TPS).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-13\">Nor does the creation of an initial registration period render the remaining statutory requirements for TPS eligibility superfluous. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 244(c)(l)(A)(i)-(iv), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a(c)(l)(A)(i)-(iv). Finally, the creation of the initial registration period is consistent with the fact that Congress expressly indicated that TPS was to apply to those aliens already in the United States, and was not meant to provide aliens with an incentive to come to the United States seeking such relief. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 244(c)(5), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a(c)(5). <em>See also </em>Temporary Protected Status, Exception to Registration Deadlines, 63 Fed. Reg. 63593-01 (stating that the late registration exception is \u201cnot intended to extend to persons who arrived in the United States ... after the designation was made.\u201d). We therefore defer to the Attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>ney General\u2019s formulation of the initial registration period.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">We deny Mr. Alas-Murcia\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Petition Denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
