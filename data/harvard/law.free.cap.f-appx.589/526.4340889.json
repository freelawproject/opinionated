The district court denied the motion finding that the ineffective-assistance claim was barred by the collateral-attack waiver in Murdock\u2019s plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">On October 14, 2014, the United States Department of Justice issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors regarding the enforcement of appeal waivers in which defendants waive claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal and collateral attack. <em>See </em>Memorandum from James M. Cole, Deputy Attorney General, to All Federal Prosecutors (Oct. 14, 2014), <em>available at </em>http://pdfserver.amlaw.com/ nlj/DOJ \u2014 Ineffective\u2014Assistance\u2014 Counsel.pdf (\u201cFor cases in which a defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance claim would be barred by a previously executed waiver, prosecutors should decline to enforce the waiver when defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance resulting in prejudice or when the defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance claim raises a serious debatable issue that a court should resolve.\u201d). In light of this new policy, and in response to our directive asking the United States Attorney to address its impact on this case, the government has withdrawn its reliance on Murdock\u2019s collateral-attack waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">As a result, the judgment of the district court is VACATED and the case is REMANDED to the district court with the instruction to afford Murdock an evidentia-ry hearing on his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
