We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Alcantara Mejia reiterates his challenge to the eight-level enhancement imposed under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) based on his Texas conviction for delivery of cocaine, for which he received a six-month sentence. In his view, the Texas conviction did not qualify as a drug trafficking offense because Texas\u2019s definition of delivery is broader than the definition of a drug trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2. He asserts that the Texas offense of delivery may be committed by \u201cadministering\u201d a controlled substance. He further contends that, for the same reasons, the Texas offense does not qualify as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">Alcantara Mejia\u2019s claims are foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Teran-Salas, </em>767 F.3d 453, 460-62 (5th Cir.2014). In <em>Teran-Salas, </em>we held that there is no \u201crealistic probability that Texas would prosecute [the] crime under an \u2018administering\u2019 theory in a way that does not also constitute either \u2018dispensing1 or \u2018distributing* under the federal sentencing guidelines.\u201d 767 F.3d at 460; <em>see id. </em>at 458-62. Further, \u201c[e]ven without considering the drug type or quantity, conviction under the administer prong is not a realistic probability because no previous Texas case has involved a conviction under this prong.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461. Therefore, we concluded that the Texas offense of possession with intent to deliver cocaine was a drug trafficking offense under the Guidelines and an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1326(b). <em>Id. </em>at 461-62 &amp; n. 5. By parity of reasoning, the Texas offense of delivery of cocaine is a drug trafficking offense under the Guidelines and an aggravated felony within the meaning of \u00a7 1326(b). <em>See id. </em>at 457 n. 1, 461-62 &amp; n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b298-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
