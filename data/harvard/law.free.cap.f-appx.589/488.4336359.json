(\u201cFCCC\u201d) detainee who is confined pursuant to Florida\u2019s Involuntary Civil Commitment of Sexually Violent Predators Act, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 894.910 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cSVP Act\u201d). Plaintiff Wean appeals, through counsel, the district court\u2019s dismissal of his <em>pro se </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action against defendant Tim Budz, the director of the FCCC. In his second amended complaint, Wean alleged that Budz\u2019s \u201cblack box policy\u201d \u2014 pursuant to which he had been required to wear a small black box<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> over his handcuffs on all trips <em>outside </em>of the FCCC \u2014 violates his substantive due process right under the Fourteenth Amendment to be free from bodily restraint. Upon defendant Budz\u2019s motion, the district court dismissed plaintiff Wean\u2019s \u00a7 1988 action under Fed- \u2022 eral Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. We affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">Under the SVP Act, \u201ca person determined by a court or jury to be a \u2018sexually violent predator\u2019 is required, following his term of incarceration, to be housed in a \u2018secure facility\u2019 and segregated from other detainees not committed under the law in order to receive \u2018control, care, and treatment until such time as the person\u2019s mental abnormality or personality disorder has so changed that it is safe for the person to be at large.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pesci v. Budz, </em>730 F.3d 1291, 1299 (11th Cir.2013) (quoting Fla. Stat. \u00a7 394.917(2)) (emphasis omitted). As we noted in <em>Pesci, </em>\u201cthe FCCC is a facility that houses approximately 600 persons involuntarily committed as sexually violent predators [pursuant to the SVP Act] after their terms of incarceration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a civilly committed detainee, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies to plaintiff Wean\u2019s claim. <em>See Dolihite v. Maughon, </em>74 F.3d 1027, 1041 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">The Due Process Clause provides that no State shall \u201cdeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. The Due Process Clause\u2019s substantive component \u201cprovides heightened protection against government interference with certain fundamental rights and liberty interests.\u201d <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 65, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 2060, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000) (quotation marks omitted). In general, \u201cthe involuntarily civilly committed have liberty interests under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to safety, freedom from bodily restraint, and minimally adequate or reasonable training to further the ends of safety and freedom from restraint.\u201d <em>Dolihite, </em>74 F.3d at 1041 (citing <em>Youngberg v. Romeo, </em>457 U.S. 307, 324, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 2462, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982)). However, a civilly committed individual\u2019s right to freedom from bodily re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>straint is not absolute. <em>See Romeo, </em>457 U.S. at 319-20, 102 S.Ct. at 2460. Rather, in considering whether a substantive due process right has been violated, courts must balance the individual\u2019s liberty interests and the State\u2019s stated reasons for restricting the liberty. <em>Id. </em>at 320-21, 102 S. Ct at 2460-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Here, we cannot say that the district court erred in dismissing Wean\u2019s second amended complaint. Wean did not state a claim under the Due Process Clause because the use of the small black box under the particular facts alleged does not implicate a. protected liberty interest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, the use of the small black box over handcuffs on sexually violent predators during trips <em>outside </em>of the FCCC does not impose an additional restriction so significant that it amounts to a deprivation of a protected liberty interest. <em>See Miller v. Dobier, </em>634 F.3d 412, 414-15 (7th Cir.2011) (holding, in context of procedural due process claim, that imposition of black box restraint did not deprive plaintiff of a protected liberty interest because \u201c[disciplinary measures that do not substantially worsen the conditions of confinement of a lawfully confined person are not actionable under the due process clause ... regardless of whether the confinement is criminal or civil\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Wean\u2019s second amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b519-10\">. According to-the parties, a black box is a rectangular device measuring approximately four inches by three inches that fits over a pair of handcuffs in order to limit hand movements and prevent access to the handcuff\u2019s key holes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b519-13\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal for failure to state a claim. <em>Speaker v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs. Ctrs. for Disease Control &amp; Prevention, </em>623 F.3d 1371, 1379 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b520-8\">. Although plaintiff Wean alleged that the black box causes the handcuffs to dig into his wrists, resulting in pain and numbness in his hands, he did not assert a claim of excessive force or a claim of cruel and unusual punishment under the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Dolihite, </em>74 F.3d at 1041 (indicating that the Fourteenth Amendment due process rights of the involuntarily civilly committed are at least as extensive as the Eighth Amendment rights of the criminally institutionalized). Rather, plaintiff Wean\u2019s claim in this particular case is only a substantive due process claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
