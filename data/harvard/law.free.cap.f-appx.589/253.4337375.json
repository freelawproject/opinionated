He contends that the district court clearly erred when it denied him a minor role reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B 1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-22\">Whether Trejo was a minor participant is a factual determination that is reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 (5th Cir. 2005). There is no clear error if the district court\u2019s factual finding is \u201cplausible in light of the record read as a whole.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-23\">Section 3B 1.2(b) provides for a two-level reduction in a defendant\u2019s offense level if he was a \u201cminor\u201d participant. The minor-role adjustment applies to defendants who are only peripherally involved in the crime. <em>Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 204. The applicability of \u00a7 3B1.2 rests on whether the defendant\u2019s role was minor in relation to the conduct for which he was held accountable, not in relation to the criminal enterprise as a whole. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>242 F.3d 593, 598 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-24\">The record evidence reflects that Trejo illegally transported seven undocumented aliens, including an unaccompanied minor, from Mission, Texas, to a motel in Pharr, Texas. Trejo\u2019s role of driving the illegal aliens to the motel was not peripheral to the advancement of the criminal activity to which Trejo pleaded guilty \u2014 transporting an undocumented alien within the United States for the purpose of commercial advantage and private financial gain. <em>See Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 203-04. As the driver, Trejo\u2019s role was central to the operation of transporting aliens and clearly \u201ccoextensive with the conduct for which he was held accountable.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>242 F.3d at 598-99. In addition, the record evidence indicated that Trejo had been given other responsibility that contributed to the success of the offense; he was found in possession of money as well as a key to the motel room where he left the aliens, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>he was told to buy food. The district court\u2019s factual finding is \u201cplausible in light of the record read as a whole.\u201d <em>Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 203. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in rejecting Trejo\u2019s request for a minor role adjustment under \u00a7 3B 1.2(b). <em>Id. </em>The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b283-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
