On appeal, he contends that the district court plainly erred in entering judgment under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) because his prior Texas manslaughter conviction did not constitute an \u201caggravated felony\u201d as defined under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. Gal-van-Garcia maintains that the case should be remanded for resentencing or, in the alternative, that the judgment should be reformed to omit the reference to \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-23\">As Galvan-Garcia acknowledges, we review his claim for plain error because he did not raise it in the district court. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 368 (5th Cir.2009). We have not resolved the question whether a conviction under the Texas manslaughter statute constitutes an aggravated felony under \u00a7 16. However, Galvan-Garcia has not shown that any error in the categorization of his prior conviction affected his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. </em>United <em>States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). The 70-month sentence Galvan-Garcia received did not exceed the statutory maximum under \u00a7 1326(b)(1). <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>564 F.3d at 369. Although Galvan-Garcia speculates that the district court may have been inclined to grant an authorized departure and may have taken into account the statutory sentencing range, he has not shown a reasonable probability that his sentence would have been lower but for any error by the district court. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>602 F.3d 643, 647 (5th Cir.2010). Because Galvan-Garcia is unable to overcome plain error review and because the Government does not concede that the judgment should be reformed, Galvan-Garcia has not shown that we should remand for resentencing or that the judgment should be reformed. <em>Cf. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 368-69. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b300-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
