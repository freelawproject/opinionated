He argues that despite his career offender status, he was eligible for a sentence reduction under the FSA and Amendment 750 because his original sentencing range was primarily based on a comparison between the offense levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Flakes also argues that the <em>post-United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), advisory guidelines system should apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings and that the district court should be allowed to consider the greater difference between the otherwise applicable guidelines range and the career offender range.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The Government has filed motions for summary affirmance and to waive the requirement for filing an appellate brief arguing that Flakes\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 (5th Cir.2009). In the alternative, the Government requests an extension of time in which to file a brief on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 994(o),\u201d so long as the reduction is consistent with the applicable policy statements. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, while the court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Because Flakes was sentenced as a career offender, the district court did not err in determining that he was not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Anderson, </em>591 F.3d at 791. Further, because Flakes was sentenced before the FSA\u2019s effective date of August 3, 2010, he remained subject to the pre-FSA statutory minimum sentence of 20 years. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii) (2006). Finally, <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings and \u201cdoes not alter the mandatory character of [U.S.S.G.] \u00a7 lBl.lO\u2019s limitations on sentence reductions.\u201d <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motions for summary affirmance and to waive the requirement for filing an appellate brief are GRANTED, its alternative motion for an extension of time in which to file a brief is DENIED, and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b318-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
