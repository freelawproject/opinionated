Cook, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the judgment, raising 29 arguments for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Construing Cook\u2019s arguments liberally, we conclude that, read together, most of them constitute no more than an argument that the district court erred in granting Aetna summary judgment. She argues alternatively that the court\u2019s summary judgment decision is moot because the court granted her leave to file an amended complaint as a consequence of the clerk of court\u2019s issuance of a summons to Unisys Corporation, her employer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">We consider first Cook\u2019s alternative argument that the order granting Aetna summary judgment is moot because the summons issued to Unisys automatically granted her leave to amend her complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We find nothing in the record or the law to support that proposition and therefore proceed to the merits of Cook\u2019s argument that the district court erred in granting Aetna summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s ruling affirming or reversing a plan administrator\u2019s ERISA benefits decision, applying the same legal standards that governed the district court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Blankenship v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>644 F.3d 1350, 1354 (11th Cir.2011).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Judicial review of a challenged benefits decision under ERISA is limited to consideration of the material available to the ERISA plan administrator at the time of the decision. <em>Blankenship, </em>644 F.3d at 1354. Based on that record, the reviewing court performs the following multistep analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-10\">(1) Apply the <em>de novo </em>standard to determine whether the claim administrator\u2019s benefits-denial decision is \u201cwrong\u201d (i.e., the court disagrees with the administrator\u2019s decision); if it is not, then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-11\">(2) If the administrator\u2019s decision in fact is <em>\u201cde novo </em>wrong,\u201d then determine whether he was vested with discretion in reviewing claims; if not, end judicial inquiry and reverse the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-12\">(3) If the administrator\u2019s decision is <em>\u201cde novo </em>wrong\u201d and he was vested with discretion in reviewing claims, then determine whether \u201creasonable\u201d grounds supported it (hence, review his decision under the more deferential arbitrary and capricious standard).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-13\">(4) If no reasonable grounds exist, then end the inquiry and reverse the administrator\u2019s decision; if reasonable grounds do exist, then determine if he operated under a conflict of interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-14\">(5) If there is no conflict, then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>(6) If there is a conflict, the conflict should merely be a factor for the court to take into account when determining whether an administrator\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1355.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">ERISA plan administrators \u201cneed not accord extra respect to the opinions of a claimant\u2019s treating physicians.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1356. Administrators are also entitled to rely on the opinion of the independent medical examiner. <em>Turner v. Delta Family-Care Disability and Survivorship Plan, </em>291 F.3d 1270, 1274 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Based on the district court\u2019s review of Cook\u2019s medical records in the administrative record, we conclude that the court did not err in granting summary judgment to Aetna. The court found that the records showed Cook was not disabled, and that thus the administrator\u2019s decision to deny benefits was not wrong. The court was entitled to, and did, rely on the Independent Medical Evaluation (\u201cIME\u201d) performed by Dr. Richard Wilson, which did not reveal any medical conditions causing disability. <em>Turner, </em>291 F.3d at 1274. Moreover, although Dr. David Clenden-ning, Cook\u2019s treating physician, concluded that Cook was disabled, Dr. Robert Swot-insky, a board-certified specialist in occupational medicine, reviewed the basis for Dr. Clendenning\u2019s assessment, and concluded that \u201c[t]he documentation [did] not corroborate impairment.\u201d Aetna was not required to accord extra respect to Dr. Clendenning\u2019s opinion merely because he was Cook\u2019s treating physician. <em>Blankenship, </em>644 F.3d at 1356. Because the court determined that Aetna\u2019s decision to deny benefits was not wrong, it did not need to move on to the next step of the analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 1355. However, even if Aetna\u2019s decision was wrong, it was not arbitrary and capricious in light of the medical opinions in the record. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-7\">. With the exception of the two arguments we deal with in the text, <em>infra, </em>none of the arguments presented in Cook's brief require comment, including those she failed to present to the district court in the first instance. <em>Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b550-8\">. Cook does not argue that the district court abused its discretion in denying her leave to amend her complaint. But, assuming that she has presented the argument, we find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s proceeding on the basis of Cook\u2019s original complaint because the allegations of the proposed amended complaint were futile and could not have withstood a motion to dismiss. <em>Halliburton &amp; Assocs., Inc. v. Henderson, New &amp; Co., </em>774 F.2d 441, 444 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b550-16\">.Aetna was entitled to summary judgment if it shows that there was no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
