In 2006 he became a lawful permanent resident. He pleaded guilty in 2009 to one count each of mail fraud and money laundering. The district court found that Bamisaiye\u2019s crimes resulted in a total loss to the victims of about $1.8 million. As a- result of his conviction, the Department of Homeland Security began removal proceedings against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">In 2012 an immigration judge (IJ) ordered Bamisaiye\u2019s removal to Nigeria. During that removal proceeding, Bamisai-ye conceded that his conviction made him removable. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(iii); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i). Instead of challenging his removability head-on, he sought a waiver of removability based on the \u201cextreme hardship\u201d his removal would cause his wife and children \u2014 all of whom are United States citizens. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h) (allowing discretionary waivers when removal would result in \u201cextreme hardship\u201d to an alien\u2019s qualifying relatives). The IJ denied Bamisaiye\u2019s application for an extreme hardship waiver and ordered him removed to Nigeria.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-16\">Bamisaiye then filed with the BIA a number of requests for relief from that order, each of which the BIA rejected. It first dismissed his direct appeal of the IJ\u2019s removal order. It then denied his motion to reconsider its dismissal of his appeal. Finally, the BIA denied Bamisaiye\u2019s motion requesting that it reopen his removal proceeding and stay his removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-17\">Meanwhile, Bamisaiye filed his first petition for review with this Court. <em>See Bamisaiye v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>No. 12-15030 (11th Cir. May 29, 2013) (\u201c2013 Order\u201d). That first petition sought review of the BIA\u2019s dismissal of Bamisaiye\u2019s appeal, not its denial of his later motions. We dismissed that petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-18\">After we dismissed that petition, Bami-saiye filed a second motion to reopen his removal proceeding with the BIA. The BIA denied that second motion as both time- and number-barred.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although exceptional circumstances sometimes allow it to grant time- or number-barred motions to reopen, the BIA concluded that Bami-saiye was \u201cstatutorily ineligible for relief\u2019 regardless of those exceptions, because on direct appeal it had accepted the IJ\u2019s finding that Bamisaiye had committed a \u201cparticularly serious crime.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231 (b)(3)(B)(ii) (barring relief from removal where \u201cthe alien, having been con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>victed by a final judgment of a particularly serious erime[,] is a danger to the community\u201d); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(d)(2) (clarifying that this denial of relief is mandatory). Bamisaiye could not overcome the time and number bars, and the BIA therefore denied his motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Bamisaiye now petitions this Court for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of this second motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The government contends that we lack jurisdiction to review Bamisaiye\u2019s petition. We review this issue <em>de novo. Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>482 F.3d 1281, 1283 (11th Cir.2007). When reviewing the BIA\u2019s actions, we have explicit, statutory jurisdiction to review only \u201cfinal orders] of removal,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), but \u201c[i]mplicit in this jurisdictional grant is the authority to review orders denying motions to reopen, any such final order.\u201d <em>Patel v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>334 F.3d 1259, 1261 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">We are stripped of jurisdiction to review a \u201cfinal order of removal,\u201d however, when it is \u201cagainst an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a [listed] criminal offense.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). Among those offenses is an \u201caggravated felony\u201d that \u201cinvolves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.\u201d <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i). Because \u201cour jurisdiction to review denials of motions to reopen derives from our jurisdiction to review final orders of removal,\u201d <em>Guzman-Munoz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>733 F.3d 1311, 1314 (11th Cir.2013), a \u201cjurisdiction-stripping provision [that] would have deprived us of jurisdiction to entertain an attack on the final order of removal ... [also] strips us of jurisdiction to entertain an attack on that order mounted through [the] filing of a motion to reopen.\u201d <em>Patel, </em>334 F.3d at 1262. Notwithstanding these limitations, we always retain jurisdiction for the \u201creview of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">The upshot is that our jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of this second motion to reopen extends only so far as it did when we reviewed its dismissal of Bamisaiye\u2019s appeal. <em>See </em>2013 Order. Bamisaiye conceded his aggravated felony conviction and his removability based on it. We therefore applied \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) to limit our review of that petition, holding that we had jurisdiction only for the review provided by \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) \u2014 review limited to constitutional claims or questions of law. <em>See </em>2013 Order, slip op. at 3. The same is true here. <em>See Patel, </em>334 F.3d at 1262 (\u201c[Wjhere a final order of removal is shielded from judicial review, so, too, is a refusal to reopen that order.\u201d). Unlike in his first petition, however, Bamisaiye now presents a claim that is subject to our limited, \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-14\">Bamisaiye presents no constitutional claims, but he has raised one question of law. He contends that the BIA failed to fully consider the evidence, presented in his second motion to reopen his removal proceeding, that the circumstances in Nigeria had changed since the denial of his first motion to reopen. <em>See Perez-Guerrero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>717 F.3d 1224, 1231 (11th Cir.2013) (holding that \u201cwhether the [BIA] failed to give reasoned consideration to [a petitioner\u2019s] claims\u201d is a question of law) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-15\">Bamisaiye is right that the BIA\u2019s short opinion barely mentions the issue of changed circumstances. He is wrong that it needed to do more. Bamisaiye\u2019s second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>motion to reopen was both time- and number-barred, but he sought relief from these bars based on an exception for applicants seeking \u201cwithholding of deportation based on <em>changed circumstances.\u201d See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii) (emphasis added). Citing its earlier acceptance of the IJ\u2019s finding that Bamisaiye\u2019s convictions were for \u201cparticularly serious crime[s],\u201d the BIA noted in its denial that such a finding makes him \u201cstatutorily ineligible for relief from removal.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(d)(2). That was all the BIA needed to do because ineligibility based on \u201cparticularly serious\u201d convictions forecloses relief under the changed circumstances exception, rendering irrelevant the question of whether circumstances in Nigeria had in fact changed. The BIA thus gave Bamisaiye\u2019s claim all the \u201creasoned consideration\u201d it warranted. <em>Perez-Guerrero, </em>717 F.3d at 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-12\">.
