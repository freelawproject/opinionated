The indictment also contained a forfeiture allegation which stated that upon conviction of either count,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-19\">the defendants shall forfeit to the United States any property constituting or derived from any proceeds which the defendant obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such violations, and any property which the defendants used or intended to be used in any manner or part to commit or to facilitate the commission of the said violations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-20\">[] The property subject to forfeiture includes, but is not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-21\">a) $65,000 in U.S. Currency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-22\">b) One (1) FM Detective 9mm pistol, Serial Number 361135, and eight (8) rounds of 9mm ammunition; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-23\">c) One (1) Taurus Millennium Pro 145 .45 caliber pistol, Serial Number NAM01210, and ten (10) rounds of .45 caliber ammunition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Law enforcement officers seized these items when Chavous and a codefendant met with a confidential FBI agent, who was posing as a narcotics trafficker, at a warehouse and were arrested during the course of a purported drug transaction. Chavous and the codefendant agreed to receive five kilograms of cocaine in exchange for $65,000, which they had brought with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Chavous entered into a plea agreement with the government that called for him to plead guilty to the Count 1 conspiracy and to forfeit to the government the property listed in the forfeiture allegation of the indictment. On September 4, 2012, Cha-vous pled guilty to the Count 1 offense. In doing so, he admitted the facts stated in the government\u2019s proffer, including his statement to the arresting officers that he intended to use the $65,000 to purchase cocaine. The court accepted Chavous\u2019s guilty plea and on November 26, 2012, sentenced him to prison for 135 months. The court also ordered forfeiture of the property described in the plea agreement. Chavous appealed his conviction and sentence (but not the forfeiture order). We affirmed. <em>United States v. Chavous, </em>522 Fed.Appx. 799 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">On January 22, 2014, Chavous, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed a Petition for Hearing for Equal Rights in which he claimed that he was entitled to the $65,000 forfeited to the government because there were no drugs at the warehouse and, thus, the currency could not be subject to forfeiture. The district court referred the petition to a magistrate judge who issued a report recommending that the court deny the petition. He found that the petition was baseless because Chavous had admitted that the money was to be used to purchase cocaine and therefore constituted \u201cproperty used, or intended to be used, in any manner or part, to commit, or to facilitate the commission of, [a drug offense],\u201d within the ambit of the forfeiture statute, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(a)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court adopted the recommendation and denied Chavous\u2019s petition. Chavous now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">We find no error in the district court\u2019s decision. We construe Chavous\u2019s petition as a motion made pursuant to Rule 41(g) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for the return of seized property. First, by the explicit- terms of his plea agreement, Chavous agreed to relinquish any and all rights, interest, and title to the $65,000, and he cannot now demonstrate a possessory interest in this property that he voluntarily agreed to surrender. Furthermore, based on his admitted intent to use the money in a drug trafficking crime and his attempts to disclaim his prior representations about the $65,000, he came to the district court with unclean hands in filing his petition, and the district court would not have erred in denying him equitable relief on this basis. <em>See United States v. Howell, </em>425 F.3d 971, 974 (11th Cir.2005); <em>Cuddeback v. Fla. Bd. of Educ., </em>381 F.3d 1230, 1235-36 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b499-7\">.
