At sentencing, the district court determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Norris had possessed a firearm in connection with the cocaine offense and was therefore not eligible for safety-valve relief under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">On appeal, Norris argues that the district court erred by considering whether it was \u201cclearly improbable\u201d that a machine gun was connected with Norris\u2019s offense, because the- clearly improbable standard only applies to the two-level U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) enhancement for possessing a firearm, rather than the safety-valve provision under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. In making this determination, the district court stated that it could not \u201cfind that it\u2019s clearly improbable that the firearm was not connected to the offense.\u201d The district court also stated several times that it could not determine that \u201cthere was no potential for that firearm to facilitate ... the offense,\u201d because, even though the firearm had been locked in a box, the court could not \u201csay [that Norris] could not open that [lock box] if he had to.\u201d Norris also argues that, in determining his eligibility for safety-valve relief, the district court clearly erred by considering the conduct of an undercover agent, which was outside the scope of Norris\u2019s accountability.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">We generally review a district court\u2019s factual determinations and subsequent denial of safety-valve relief for clear error. <em>United States v. Camacho, </em>261 F.3d 1071, 1073 (11th Cir.2001). Where a defendant fails to object on the basis that a district court applied the wrong legal standard, we review for plain error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir. 2005). Legal interpretations of the Sentencing Guidelines are reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Johnson, </em>375 F.3d 1300, 1301 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Certain drug offenses and quantities can trigger statutorily-mandated minimum prison terms, trumping the recommended guideline sentencing range. <em>United States v. Carillo-Ayala, </em>713 F.3d 82, 88 (11th Cir.2013); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). But Congress created a five-criteria \u201csafety valve\u201d that, if fulfilled, permits a district court to sentence without regard for the statutorily-mandated m\u00ednimums. <em>Carillo-Ayala, </em>713 F.3d at 88. The defendant bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he is entitled to safety-valve relief. <em>Id. </em>at 96. At issue here is the criterion that the defendant not have \u201cpossessed] a firearm or other dangerous weapon ... <em>in connection with the offense.\u201d </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">The Guidelines do not define the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 5C1.2. <em>Carillo-Ayala, </em>713 F.3d at 89. However, in <em>Carillo-Ayala, </em>we held that the requirement could be satisfied by a showing that the firearm (1) was in close proximity to drugs, or (2) facilitated, or had the potential to facilitate, the offense, whether by emboldening an actor who had the ability to display or discharge the weapon, by serving as an integral part of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>drug transaction as in a barter situation, by instilling confidence in others who relied on the defendant, or by serving as a badge of office to help the defendant avoid detection. <em>Id. </em>at 91-96. \u201cWhere any of these possibilities are shown by the evidence, the safety valve is unavailable unless the defendant negates the proof by a preponderance of the evidence....\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 96. The defendant must prove that \u201ca connection between the firearm and the offense, though possible, is not probable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91 (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">As a threshold matter, Norris failed to fairly object to the district court that its comment, \u201cclearly improbable,\u201d might be an erroneous legal standard. This Court, therefore, reviews for plain error. The district court did not commit plain error in determining that Norris failed to carry his burden of proving that the gun was not possessed in connection with the drug offense. It is not at all clear from the transcript that the district court did in fact apply the legal standard of \u201cclearly improbable\u201d as opposed to merely \u201cnot probable.\u201d Moreover, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>error, Norris has failed to persuade us that the error affected his substantial rights. There is not a reasonable probability of a different result in light of the district' court\u2019s findings noted below that Norris had access to the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The district court did not clearly err by improperly considering the conduct of an undercover agent in determining that Norris was ineligible for safety-valve relief. The sentencing transcript reveals that the district court considered the manner in which Norris carried the gun. There was evidence indicating that the case housing the firearm was \u201cflimsily locked.\u201d The district court stated that it could not determine that \u201cthere was no potential for that firearm to facilitate ... the offense\u201d because it could not \u201csay [that Norris] could not open that [lock box] if he had to.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b488-6\">. The Supreme Court has explained that plain-error review involves four prongs. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). \"First, there must be an error or defect \u2014 some sort of deviation from a legal rule \u2014 that has not been intentionally relinquished or abandoned ... by the appellant. Second, the legal error must be clear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute. Third, the error must have affected the appellant\u2019s substantial rights, which in the ordinary case means he must demonstrate that it affected the outcome of the district court proceedings. Fourth and finally, if the above three prongs are satisfied, the court of appeals has the discretion to remedy the error\u2014 discretion which ought to be exercised only if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citations omitted) (alterations adopted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b489-7\">. A defendant is not precluded from arguing that he did not possess a firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d his offense under \u00a7 5C1.2, even if he conceded an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) for possessing a firearm. <em>Caril-lo-Ayala, </em>713 F.3d at 91.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b489-8\">. Because we cannot conclude that the district court was clearly erroneous in finding that Norris himself could have accessed the firearm if he had to, we need not address the alternative holding of the district court that the safety-valve relief was not reasonable because Norris knew that the undercover agent would possess the firearm in connection with the offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
