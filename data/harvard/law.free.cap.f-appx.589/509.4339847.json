Santiago argues that the mandatory registration requirement of the Act is unconstitutional as applied to him whether the statute is subject to intermediate scrutiny or rational basis review. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-22\">We review the application of the Act to Santiago under the rational basis standard. Santiago argues that greater scrutiny is warranted because the registration requirement affects his prospects for housing, employment, and volunteer work, but we rejected a similar \u201cbroad framing of rights\u201d by the defendant in <em>Doe v. Moore, </em>410 F.3d 1337, 1343 (11th Cir.2005). Santiago instead asserts a right to refuse to register and to prevent publication of his sex offender status. <em>Id. </em>at 1344; <em>United States v. Ambert, </em>561 F.3d 1202, 1209 (11th Cir.2009). Because \u201ca state\u2019s publication of truthful information that is already available to the public does not infringe the fundamental constitutional rights of liberty and privacy,\u201d we examine the statute under rational basis review. <em>Moore, </em>410 F.3d at 1345.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>The Act is constitutional as applied to Santiago. To survive review under the rational basis standard, the registration requirement has to be rationally related to a legitimate government interest. <em>Id. </em>The federal government has a legitimate interest in protecting its inmates from being sexually abused by their prison guards. Santiago argues that his relationship with the inmate was consensual and loving, but the Act applies logically to \u201cconsensual sexual conduct\u201d to thwart any person in \u201ccustodial authority\u201d from exploiting his power over an inmate. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16911(5)(C). Santiago also argues that there is no evidence that he will recidivate, but whether a person subject to the registration requirement is \u201cdangerous []or likely to be a repeat offender, is of no moment under [the Act], because the reporting requirements ... turn on the ... conviction alone.\u201d <em>Ambert, </em>561 F.3d at 1208 (discussing <em>Connecticut Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety v. Doe, </em>538 U.S. 1, 7-8, 123 S.Ct. 1160, 1164-65, 155 L.Ed.2d 98 (2003)). Santiago complains about the severe limitations created by the sex offender law in his state of residence, but we-will not consider an argument that the district court refused to consider and that Santiago told the district court that he was \u201cnot challenging.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">We AFFIRM Santiago\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
