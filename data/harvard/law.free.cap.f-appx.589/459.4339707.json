Jones contends that the district court plainly erred by failing to inform him that he could challenge the validity of prior felony drug convictions underlying his mandatory sentence of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-16\">In March 2013 Jones was indicted on one count of conspiracy to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(ii), and 846. The government filed an information and an enhancement notice informing Jones that, based on his four prior felony drug convictions, he faced a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Those four convictions are: a 1996 conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to sell, a 1999 conviction for possession of crack cocaine, a 1999 conviction for delivery of cocaine to a minor, and a 2004 conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to sell, manufacture, and deliver. Jones did not file a written objection to the government\u2019s information or enhancement notice. He did, however, sign a plea agreement admitting his guilt to the sole count in the indictment and acknowledging that \u201cdue to prior drug felony convictions,\u201d he faced a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-17\">At the change of plea hearing the district court reiterated that \u201c[t]he mandatory sentence in the case is life in prison.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>The only possible exception, the court explained, would be if the government filed a substantial assistance motion and the court granted it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jones went ahead with his guilty plea and the government never filed a substantial assistance motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">At sentencing the district court asked whether there were any objections to the presentence investigation report\u2019s conclusion that Jones faced a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. Jones\u2019 attorney answered no. The court then directly addressed Jones:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">If you claim that for any reason those convictions were not valid, or that there is any reason why I cannot properly consider those convictions today in determining the sentence in this new federal case, you need to tell me about that right now. Any basis for challenging the validity of those [convictions] that you don\u2019t tell me about at this time will not be something you can assert later as a basis for challenging this sentence. So the deadline for telling me of any problem with those prior convictions is now. And I need to ask you [more] about those prior convictions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The court detailed each of the four felony drug convictions an'd asked Jones whether he was in fact convicted of those charges on those dates (Jones answered yes) and whether he had any basis for challenging the validity of the convictions (Jones answered no).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Finally, the court imposed the mandatory sentence of life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">This is Jones\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">n:</p>\n<p id=\"b491-13\">Jones contends that the district court denied him due process and failed to address a core concern of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 when it did not inform him \u2014 specifically, at his change of plea hearing \u2014 that he could challenge the validity of prior felony drug convictions underlying his mandatory sentence of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-14\">Constitutional objections and alleged violations of Rule 11 that were not raised before the district court are reviewed only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1018-19 (11th Cir. 2005). To demonstrate plain error, the defendant must show there is \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Monroe, </em>353 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir. 2003) (citations and internal quotation .marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-15\">\u201cA guilty plea involves the waiver of a number of a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, and must therefore be made knowingly and voluntarily to satisfy the require-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>merits of due process.\u201d <em>Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d at 1019. To determine that a guilty plea is knowing and voluntary, a district court must comply with Rule 11 and address its three core concerns: \u201censuring that a defendant (1) enters his guilty plea free from coercion, (2) understands the nature of the charges, and (3) understands the consequences of his plea.\u201d <em>Id.; see United States v. Frye, </em>402 F.3d 1123, 1127 (11th Cir.2005)</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Jones\u2019 contention that the district court plainly erred by failing to inform him of his right to challenge his prior convictions at his change of plea hearing is meritless. The court\u2019s only obligations in this regard were to (1) \u201cinquire of [Jones] whether he affirms or denies that he has been previously convicted as alleged in the information,\u201d and (2) \u201cinform [Jones] that any challenge to a prior conviction which is not made before sentencing is imposed may not thereafter be raised to attack the sentence.\u201d <em>See </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(b). The statute further instructs the court to fulfill those obligations \u201cafter conviction but before pronouncement of sentence.\u201d <em>See id. </em>The record reflects that the district court did exactly what \u00a7 851(b) told it to do within the time period it was required to do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">In fact the court\u2019s fidelity to \u00a7 851(b) was \u2014 at least in this instance \u2014 above and beyond the call of duty. That is so because Jones\u2019 prior felony drug convictions were more than five years old, meaning that any challenge to their validity would have been barred by \u00a7 851(e). <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(e) (providing that \u201c[n]o person who stands convicted of an offense under this part may challenge the validity of any prior conviction ... which occurred more than five years before the date of the information\u201d); <em>see also United States v. James, </em>642 F.3d 1333, 1340 (11th Cir.2011) (holding that where a defendant\u2019s challenge would be barred by \u00a7 851(e), the district court need not fulfill its obligations under \u00a7 851(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-8\">. The \"safety valve\u201d exception was precluded by Jones\u2019 admission that he had a 2004 conviction for possessing cocaine with intent to sell.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b491-9\">. The government\u2019s information contained multiple typographic errors related to the dates of Jones\u2019 prior convictions. Those errors were corrected in the presentence investigation report. At Jones' sentence hearing, Jones\u2019 attorney objected to the typographic errors in the information. The district court found that the errors were harmless and referred to the correct dates when questioning Jones about his prior convictions. Jones does not assert on appeal that the typographic errors harmed him in any way. He also does not assert that he could mount a successful challenge to the validity of any of the convictions. He argues only that he should have been informed, at the change of plea hearing, of his right to undertake such a challenge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
