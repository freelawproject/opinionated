Stewart raised two claims below, asserting that the following cases represented new rules of law that should be applied retroactively to his case: (1) <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>560 U.S. 563, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (2010); and (2) <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>560 U.S. 218, 130 S.Ct. 2169, 176 L.Ed.2d 979 (2010). On appeal, Stewart argues that the district court erred in dismissing both claims and in concluding that \u00a7 2241 relief was inappropriate. After careful review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b966-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition. <em>Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). Whether a prisoner may bring a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) is also reviewed <em>de novo. Williams v. Warden, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1337 (11th Cir.2013), <em>petition for cert, filed, </em>(U.S. Apr. 8, 2014) (No. 13-1221). The applicability of the savings clause is a threshold jurisdictional issue, as \u00a7 2255(e) serves to limit the district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction over \u00a7 2241 petitions. <em>Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1262-63 (11th Cir.2013); <em>Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1337-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Generally, collateral attacks on a federal conviction or sentence should be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). The savings clause of \u00a7 2255, however, permits a federal prisoner, under limited circumstances, to file a \u00a7 2241 habeas petition. <em>See id.; see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). The savings clause provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-5\">An application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). The statutory restriction on filing second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions, standing alone, does not render \u00a7 2255 \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d for purposes of the savings clause. <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1308 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">In <em>Williams, </em>we held that to satisfy \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause, at least two criteria must be met: (1) the claim must be based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; and (2) the Supreme Court decision must have overturned a Circuit precedent that squarely resolved the claim such that the petitioner could not have meaningfully raised it at trial, on appeal, or in an initial \u00a7 2255 motion. 713 F.3d at 1343. We noted that, while the above two criteria were necessary, they were not necessarily sufficient to entitle a petitioner to savings clause relief. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Bryant, </em>we synthesized this Court\u2019s precedent and laid out a five-part test containing further criteria for when \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause allows the district court to entertain a \u00a7 2241 petition. 738 F.3d at 1274. Under <em>Bryant, </em>in order to have the savings clause permit a \u00a7 2241 petition of a sentencing nature, the petitioner must establish that: (1) the claim that he seeks to advance was squarely foreclosed by binding precedent throughout sentencing, direct appeal, and initial \u00a7 2255 motion; (2) subsequent to a first \u00a7 2255 motion, the precedent that had foreclosed the claim was overturned; (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>the new rule, upon which the claim relies, applies retroactively on collateral review; (4) based on the retroactive application of the new rule of law, the petitioner\u2019s sentence exceeds the statutorily authorized maximum sentence; and (5) the savings clause reaches the specific type of error in question (in <em>Bryant, </em>whether a sentencing, and not an actual innocence, claim was cognizable). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">In <em>Bryant, </em>we relied on the guidance provided by the Supreme Court in <em>Schriro v. Summerlin, </em>542 U.S. 348, 124 S.Ct. 2519, 159 L.Ed.2d 442 (2004), in assessing whether a decision applied retroactively to cases on collateral review. <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1277-78. In <em>Schriro, </em>the Supreme Court explained that its decisions that result in a \u201cnew rule\u201d generally apply to cases still pending on direct review, but not to convictions that are already final. 542 U.S. at 351, 124 S.Ct. 2519. However, new \u201csubstantive\u201d rules generally apply retroactively, including (1) decisions that narrow the scope of a criminal statute by interpreting its terms, and (2) constitutional determinations that place certain conduct or persons beyond the state\u2019s power to punish. <em>Id. </em>at 351-52. New procedural rules, however, generally do not apply retroactively, unless they are part of a small set of \u201cwatershed rules of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352 (quotations omitted). To meet the \u201cwatershed\u201d test, the rule must be one \u201cwithout which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously diminished.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis removed and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">The district court did not err in dismissing Stewart\u2019s petition in this case. First, <em>Carachuri-Rosendo </em>does not apply to Stewart\u2019s case. <em>Carachuri-Rosendo </em>specifically involved the definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d in the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). <em>See </em>560 U.S. at 581-82, 130 S.Ct. 2577. Its ultimate holding that non-recidivist simple drug possession could not be an \u201caggravated felony\u201d has no bearing on whether such an offense could be a \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(44) (defining \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d as an \u201coffense that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year under any law of the United States or of a State ... that prohibits or restricts conduct relating to narcotic drugs.... \u201d); <em>Burgess v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 124, 126, 128 S.Ct. 1572, 170 L.Ed.2d 478 (2008) (holding that \u00a7 802(44) is the operable definition of \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d for purposes of a \u00a7 841 sentencing enhancement). Indeed, the INA\u2019s \u201caggravated felony\u201d definition turns, in part, on the authorized sentence for an analogous federal offense, while \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d depends on the authorized sentence for the offense in question, even for a state offense. Moreover, even if the issue could be considered, Stewart\u2019s 1991 Florida conviction for cocaine possession plainly met the definition of \u201cfelony drug offense,\u201d since it carried a potential sentence of more than one year imprisonment. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 775.082(3)(d) and 893.13(l)(f) (1991). In short, because <em>Car-achuri-Rosendo </em>has no applicability to Stewart\u2019s case, it cannot be a Supreme Court case that overturned precedent that had previously foreclosed Stewart\u2019s claim. <em>See Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">Stewart\u2019s OBrien-based claim also fails to invoke \u00a7 2255(e). To begin with, it is difficult to see how <em>OBrien\u2019s </em>holding and analysis \u2014 which are limited to the \u00a7 924(c)(l)(B)(ii) machinegun provision, <em>see </em>560 U.S. at 221, 130 S.Ct. 2169 \u2014 applies to Stewart\u2019s case. If <em>OBrien, </em>which was decided before <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>570 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), applies here at all, its application is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>limited to the instruction that <em>O\u2019Brien </em>gives about how to discern Congressional intent in determining whether a statutory provision constitutes an element of the offense or a sentencing factor. <em>See O\u2019Brien, </em>560 U.S. at 225-85, 130 S.Ct. 2169. In that context, however, <em>O\u2019Brien </em>did not announce a new rule of law, because there, the Supreme Court expressly noted that its statutory analysis was controlled by, and identical to, the analysis in <em>Castillo v. United States, </em>530 U.S. 120, 120 S.Ct. 2090, 147 L.Ed.2d 94 (2000). <em>See O\u2019Brien, </em>560 U.S. at 235, 130 S.Ct. 2169. <em>Castillo, </em>decided in 2000, was available to Stewart at the time that he filed his initial \u00a7 2255 motion, in 2001. Stewart\u2019s argument, therefore, was not squarely foreclosed at the time of his \u00a7 2255 motion, and <em>O\u2019Brien </em>cannot represent a new rule of law that opened the door to his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">To the extent that Stewart argues that <em>O\u2019Brien\u2019s </em>holding was constitutional in nature, that holding would be similar to the Supreme Court\u2019s later holding in <em>Alleyne. </em>But we recently held that <em>Alleyne </em>claims are not retroactively applicable in a \u00a7 2241 proceeding via \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause. <em>See Jeanty v. Warden, FCI Miami, </em>757 F.3d 1283, 1285-86 (11th Cir.2014). Accordingly, \u00a7 2241 relief is unavailable to Stewart on this claim as well. <em>See Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b965-11\">. As an initial matter, we reject the government's argument that we lack appellate jurisdiction to consider the denial of the \u00a7 2241 petition. As the record shows, Stewart\u2019s notice of appeal was dated on January 29, which was within 60 days of the district court's <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>November 30, 2011 dismissal of Stewart's \u00a7 2241 petition, and thus, timely per the prison mailbox rule. <em>See United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1205 (11th Cir.2012); Fed. R.App.P. 4(a)(1)(B). As for the government\u2019s argument that Stewart\u2019s notice of appeal failed to specify the order being appealed from, it also falls short. While Stewart specified the January 9, 2012 order, in his notice of appeal, the face of his notice of appeal makes clear that he viewed that order as the final order in his case. Construing his <em>pro se </em>notice liberally, Stewart intended to appeal the denial of his underlying petition. <em>See Rinaldo v. Corbett, </em>256 F.3d 1276, 1278 (11th Cir. 2001); <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998). Therefore, we have jurisdiction to hear Stewart's entire appeal, and we proceed accordingly.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
