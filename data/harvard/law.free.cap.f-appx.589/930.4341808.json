Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b961-19\">This case arises out of an agreement, the Outsource Carriage Agreement (\u201cthe Agreement\u201d), between Plaintiff, J.B. Hunt Transport, Inc. (\u201cJ.B. Hunt\u201d), and Defendant, S &amp; D Transportation, Inc. (\u201cS &amp; D\u201d). J.B. Hunt and S &amp; D are both common carriers. Pursuant to the Agreement, S &amp; D agreed to transport a load of pet medication for J.B. Hunt\u2019s customer, PetMed Express Inc. (\u201cPetMed\u201d). A portion of the pet medication was lost in transit, and PetMed\u2019s insurance company, National Union Fire Insurance Company (\u201cNational\u201d), paid PetMed $123,924.80 to cover the loss. National then filed a sub-rogation claim against J.B. Hunt, which J.B. Hunt settled for $92,943.60. J.B. Hunt sought indemnity from S &amp; D, and, after S &amp; D denied liability, brought this action against S &amp; D pursuant to the Car-mack Amendment, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14706, and for breach of contract. A jury returned a verdict for J.B. Hunt, which the parties do not challenge on this appeal. After trial, J.B. Hunt filed motions for attorney\u2019s fees, expenses, and costs, as well as a motion to join Northland Insurance Company (\u201cNorthland\u201d) to the judgment pursuant to Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.4136, alleging that North-land is liable for the judgment as S &amp; D\u2019s insurer. Northland intervened for the limited purpose of opposing J.B. Hunt\u2019s mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>tion to join. The district court referred these issues to a magistrate judge for \u201cappropriate disposition or report and recommendation.\u201d (Order Referring Mot. to Magistrate Judge, Doc. 122 at 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">The magistrate judge issued an order denying J.B. Hunt\u2019s motion to join North-land. J.B. Hunt then filed a timely motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">The magistrate judge next issued a report recommending that J.B. Hunt\u2019s motions for attorney\u2019s fees, expenses, and costs be denied. J.B. Hunt filed an objection with the district court where, in addition to objecting to the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of its motions for attorney\u2019s fees, expenses, and costs, J.B. Hunt reminded the district court of its pending motion for reconsideration on the issue of J.B. Hunt\u2019s motion to join Northland. The district court overruled J.B. Hunt\u2019s objections and adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, but did not address J.B. Hunt\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">Almost three months later, the magistrate judge denied J.B. Hunt\u2019s motion for reconsideration. J.B. Hunt never appealed the magistrate judge\u2019s order to the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">II. Issues on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">J.B. Hunt raises a host of issues on appeal, which boil down to two basic contentions. First, J.B. Hunt contends that the magistrate judge erred in refusing to join Northland pursuant to Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.4186. Second, J.B. Hunt contends that the district court erred in refusing to grant J.B. Hunt\u2019s motions for attorney\u2019s fees, expenses, and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-12\">III. Motion to Join Northland Pursuant to Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.4136</p>\n<p id=\"b962-13\">Turning first to the magistrate judge\u2019s order refusing to join Northland pursuant to Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.4136, we hold that we lack appellate jurisdiction, and we therefore dismiss this portion of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-14\">\u201cThe law is settled that appellate courts are without jurisdiction to hear appeals directly from federal magistrates.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Renfro, </em>620 F.2d 497, 500 (5th Cir.1980). An exception exists in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c), which allows a magistrate judge to issue a final appealable order with <em>consent of all parties. McNab v. J &amp; J Marine, Inc., </em>240 F.3d 1326, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2001). Here, J.B. Hunt never appealed the magistrate judge\u2019s order to the district court. Furthermore, we find nothing in the record to support a finding of consent, and no party asserts such consent on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-15\">J.B. Hunt argues that its motion for reconsideration was a proper appeal to the district court for purposes of establishing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>appellate jurisdiction in this court. (Am. Reply Br. of Appellant at 13). However, even if this is what J.B. Hunt intended, the fact remains that the magistrate judge, and not the district court, addressed J.B. Hunt\u2019s motion for reconsideration. If the motion was truly intended for the district court, and was addressed improperly by the magistrate judge, J.B. Hunt should have raised this issue with the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">Similarly, the fact that J.B. Hunt\u2019s objection to the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendations referenced its pending motion to reconsider, (Pl.\u2019s Objections to Magistrate\u2019s Report and Recommendations, Doc. 156 at 1-2), does not impact our analysis. Neither the report and recommendation itself, nor the district court\u2019s order adopting it, addressed J.B. Hunt\u2019s motion to join Northland pursuant to Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.4136. (Order Approving Report of Magistrate Judge; Overruling Objections, Doe. 157).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">J.B. Hunt does not argue that the district court erred in not addressing its motion to reconsider, but, instead, asks this court to review the substance of the magistrate judge\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We cannot review orders issued by magistrate judges. Accordingly, we dismiss this portion of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See McNab, </em>240 F.3d at 1327-28; <em>Renfro, </em>620 F.2d at 500 (dismissing the portion of the appeal that asked the court to directly review a magistrate judge\u2019s order, but hearing the remainder of the appeal on the merits).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">IY. Attorney\u2019s Fees, Expenses, and Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b963-9\">On the issue of attorney\u2019s fees, expenses, and costs, J.B. Hunt claims that the district court erred in four ways in denying its motions. First, J.B. Hunt contends that it is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees, expenses, and costs under the terms of the Agreement. Second, J.B. Hunt contends that the district court had discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees, expenses, and costs, and it abused this discretion by failing to award them. Third, J.B. Hunt contends that S <em>&amp; </em>D sought attorney\u2019s fees, expenses, and costs in its Answer, and is thus estopped from opposing J.B. Hunt\u2019s motion. Fourth, J.B. Hunt contends that the district court\u2019s alternative basis for denying the motions \u2014 that J.B. Hunt failed to comply with Local Rule 7.3 \u2014 was an abuse of discretion. Because the district court held that J.B. Hunt failed to comply with Local Rule 7.3, which constituted an independently sufficient basis to deny J.B. Hunt\u2019s motions, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-10\">We review a district court\u2019s enforcement of its local rules for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Kilgo v. Ricks, </em>983 F.2d 189, 192-93 (11th Cir.1993) (reviewing a district court\u2019s dismissal of an action pursuant to a local rule for want of prosecution). \u201c[District courts enjoy broad discretion in deciding how best to manage the cases before them.\u201d <em>Chudasama v. Mazda Motor Corp., </em>123 F.3d 1353, 1366-67 (11th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-11\">J.B. Hunt contends that, because it had a motion to modify the judgment pending, the requirements of Local Rule 7.3 were tolled until the final judgment was entered. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>J.B. Hunt relies on <em>Members First Federal Credit Union v. Members First Credit Union of Florida, </em>244 F.3d 806 (11th Cir. 2001), where we held that a Rule 59 motion to alter or amend the judgment suspends the finality of the district court\u2019s judgment for purposes of determining the timeliness of a motion for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">J.B. Hunt\u2019s argument fundamentally misapprehends the issue. As the district court properly noted, whether J.B. Hunt\u2019s motion to amend the judgment tolled the deadline to file motions for attorney\u2019s fees, expenses, and costs is irrelevant. Since J.B. Hunt chose to file such a motion anyway, it was required to do so consistent with the other requirements of Local Rule 7.3, <em>ie. </em>\u201cthose not related to the timing of the motion.\u201d (Order Approving Report of Magistrate Judge; Overruling Objections, Doc. 157 at 2). The magistrate judge noted at least three different ways in which J.B. Hunt failed to comply with Local Rule 7.3, which J.B. Hunt does not dispute: (1) J.B. Hunt did not provide S &amp; D with a draft motion in order to enable a good faith negotiation on the topic; (2) J.B. Hunt did not provide a description of tasks done during the hours claimed; and (3) J.B. Hunt did not provide an invoice of expenses. (Report and Recommendation, Doc. 155 at 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">J.B. Hunt also contends that it would have been impossible to comply with Local Rule 7.3. But J.B. Hunt never sought relief from the district court in this regard, and, furthermore, J.B. Hunt stated in its motions that they were pursuant to and in compliance with Local Rule 7.3. (Pl.\u2019s Mot. for an Award of Att\u2019y Fees and Related Nontaxable Expenses, Doc. 117 at 1, 4); (PL\u2019s Mot. to Tax Costs, Doc. 118 at 1, 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">In light of the foregoing, we hold that the district court\u2019s denial of J.B. Hunt\u2019s motions for attorney\u2019s fees, expenses, and costs for failure to comply with Local Rule 7.3 was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">Because we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the motion for failure to comply with Local Rule 7.3, we need not address J.B. Hunt\u2019s other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-9\">Y. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b964-10\">In light of the foregoing, we dismiss the portion of the appeal based on the magistrate judge\u2019s refusal to join Northland pursuant to Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.4136 and affirm the district court\u2019s denial of J.B. Hunt\u2019s motions for attorney\u2019s fees, expenses, and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-11\">DISMISSED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b962-9\">. J.B. Hunt argues that its motion for reconsideration was a proper appeal to the district court for purposes of establishing appellate jurisdiction in this court. (Am. Reply Br. of Appellant at 13). We address more fully below whether this motion, as well as J.B. Hunt\u2019s objection to the magistrate's report and recommendations, constitute an appeal to the district court. We conclude that they do not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b962-10\">. J.B. Hunt\u2019s reliance on <em>Wiggins v. Alameda County, </em>717 F.2d 466, 467 (9th Cir.1983), is misplaced. (Appellant, J.B. Hunt Transport, Inc.\u2019s Resp. to Jurisdictional Question at 11). <em>Wiggins </em>addresses the \u201ccollateral order doctrine,\u201d which allows for interlocutory appeal of certain collateral issues prior to the entry of final judgment. <em>Wiggins, </em>717 F.2d at 467. It does not provide an exception to the rule that a magistrate judge\u2019s order must be appealed to the district court if we are to review it. <em>Wiggins </em>only involved an appeal directly from the magistrate judge because the parties consented to trial by the magistrate judge under 28 U.S.C. 636(c). <em>See Wiggins, </em>717 F.2d at 467.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b963-7\">. We also note that the plain language of J.B. Hunt\u2019s motion suggests that J.B. Hunt was asking the magistrate judge to reconsider her decision, not asking the district judge to review the magistrate judge's decision. J.B. Hunt\u2019s motion invokes the court's \"inherent authority to reconsider its decisions,\u201d not the district court\u2019s authority to review a magistrate judge\u2019s order. (PL's Mot. for Recons., Doc. 144 at 2). J.B. Hunt also makes its motion \"pursuant to Fed. R. of Civ. P. 59(e),\u201d which is not the proper basis for a district court\u2019s review of a magistrate judge\u2019s decision. (PL's Mot. for Recons, at 2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
