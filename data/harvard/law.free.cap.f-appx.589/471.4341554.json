On appeal, Covera-Pen-aloza argues that his sentence, was unreasonable because (1) the guideline range was based primarily on a felony conviction that occurred almost 20 years ago; (2) he had no other felony convictions and the remainder of his criminal history, which was mainly for DUI and simple battery, stemmed from his untreated alcohol dependency; (3) his reasons for re-entering the country were to be with his family and work; and (4) he had a history of being a hard worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We review the sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness under the totality of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190-91 (11th Cir.2008). We are obliged to remand for resentencing if left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 1191. A court\u2019s unjustified reliance on any one \u00a7 3553(a) factor may be a \u201csymptom of an unreasonable sentence,\u201d and a sentence may be substantively unreasonable when the court fails to consider pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 1191\u2014 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">The party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of showing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010). \u201cA court of appeals may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a district court sentence within the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2457, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Additionally, a sentence imposed well below the statutory maximum penalty is an indicator of a reasonable sentence. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (holding that defendant\u2019s sentence was reasonable in part because it was well below the statutory maximum penalty).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Other factors include the nature and circumstances of the offense, the defendant\u2019s history and characteristics, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7). Finally, the statutory maximum term of imprisonment for an alien whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for the commission of an aggravated felony is 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>The sentence was substantively reasonable, based on the totality of circumstances. <em>See Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191. In imposing the sentence, the district court did not unjustifiably rely on Covera-Pena-loza\u2019s aggravated felony from 1993. Rather, the court\u2019s explanation for the sentence made it clear that the sentence length was due, in large part, to Covera-Penaloza\u2019s continued disrespect for the law and the danger his criminal conduct posed to the public. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Given (1) Covera-Penaloza\u2019s criminal history, which included numerous DUI convictions committed after he illegally re-entered the country; (2) that the sentence was within the applicable guideline range; and (3) that the sentence was well below the statutory maximum penalty, his 23-month sentence was substantively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005); <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence as reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
