Hoegh sought review of the conduct of a state court foreclosure action brought by Credit-Based Asset Servicing and Securitization, LLC, expressly referencing a provision of the Florida Constitution that she believes was violated by Defendants. The district court dismissed the complaint after concluding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>which holds that a district court does not have jurisdiction to review judgments of state courts of competent jurisdiction based on purported constitutional violations. <em>See </em>263 U.S. 413, 415-16, 44 S.Ct. 149, 150, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-23\">We review dismissal of a complaint by the district court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo. <em>Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Fla. v. United States, EPA, </em>105 F.3d 599, 602 (11th Cir.1997). The district court properly applied <em>Rooker </em>and therefore did not err. Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
