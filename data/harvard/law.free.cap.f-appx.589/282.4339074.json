Hernandez-Perez argues that his sentence should be vacated and his case remanded for resentencing because of an error in the calculation of the Sentencing Guidelines. He contends that the district court erred by including a 12-level enhancement based on a finding that a prior North Carolina conviction for discharging a firearm into an occupied property, in' violation of a prior version of North Carolina General Statute \u00a7 14-34.1, was a crime of violence for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-24\">Hernandez-Perez objected to the determination that this prior offense was a crime of violence; however, the district court overruled the objection and sentenced him to a within-guidelines sentence of 30 months of imprisonment. Hernandez-Perez also objected that the sentence imposed was both proeedurally and sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>stantively unreasonable. Therefore, we review application of the enhancement de novo. <em>See United States v. Guillen-Alvarez, </em>489 F.3d 197, 198 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">As the parties concede, \u00a7 14-34.1 is not one of the enumerated offenses listed in \u00a7 2L1.2, Application Note l(B)(iii)). <em>See also United States v. Alfaro, </em>408 F.3d 204, 208-09 (5th Cir.2005) (finding that similar Virginia statute was not an enumerated offense). Therefore, for the enhancement to apply, \u00a7 1434.1 must have as an element \u201cthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2, Application Note l(B)(iii)). \u201c[W]hen classifying a prior offense for sentence enhancement purposes,\u201d courts apply \u201cthe categorical approach set forth in <em>Taylor v. United States,\u201d </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L'.Ed.2d 607 (1990), which requires courts to look \u201cto the elements of a prior offense, rather than to the facts underlying the conviction.\u201d <em>Alfaro, </em>408 F.3d at 208.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The version of \u00a7 14-34.1 in effect at the time of \u2022 Hernandez-Perez\u2019s conviction criminalized the willfhl or wanton discharge of a firearm \u201cinto any building, structure ... or enclosure while it is occupied.\u201d N.C. Gen.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 14-34.1 (2002). The North Carolina Supreme Court has added an additional element, which requires a showing that the defendant discharged the firearm \u201c \u2018with knowledge that the building [was] then occupied by one or more persons or when he [had] reasonable grounds to believe that the building might be occupied by one or more persons.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. James, </em>342 N.C. 589, 466 S.E.2d 710, 714-15 (1996) (quoting <em>State v. Williams, </em>284 N.C. 67, 199 S.E.2d 409, 412 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">We have not previously addressed whether this particular North Carolina statute is a crime of violence for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2. However, we have previously held that a similar Virginia statute is not a crime of violence for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See Alfaro, </em>408 F.3d at 208-09 (addressing VaCode Ann. \u00a7 18.2-279 (1993)). We concluded that the Virginia statute did not have \u201cas a necessary element, the use, attempted use, or threatened use of force against another\u201d because \u201ca defendant could violate this statute merely by shooting a gun at a building that happens to be occupied without actually shooting, attempting to shoot, or threatening to shoot another person.\u201d <em>Alfaro, </em>408 F.3d at 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">The Government argues that <em>Alfaro </em>is distinguishable because, unlike the Virginia statute at issue in that case, the North Carolina statute requires the discharge of a firearm into a residence known by the defendant to be occupied. However, we note that both the Virginia and North Carolina statutes criminalize conduct involving occupied buildings. <em>See </em>N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 14-34.1 (2002) (\u201cwhile it is occupied\u201d); VaCode Ann. \u00a7 18.2-279 (1993) (\u201cwhen occupied by one or more persons\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the Government is correct that North Carolina courts have added the additional requirement that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>defendant know, or have \u201creasonable grounds to believe,\u201d that the building is occupied, that requirement does not necessarily mean the Hernandez-Perez\u2019s conviction had an element of a use, attempted use, or threatened use of force against the person of another.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">We also reject the Government\u2019s assertion that the instant case is more like <em>United States v. Hemandez-Rodriguez, </em>467 F.Sd 492 (5th Cir.2006). In that case, the defendant received a 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2 based on a prior Texas conviction for \u201cdeadly conduct\u201d under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 22.05(b)(1), which is defined as the knowing discharge of a firearm at or in the direction of one or more individuals. <em>See Hemandez-Rodriguez, </em>467 F.3d at 493-94. In affirming the application of the enhancement in that case, we distinguished our prior holding in <em>Alfa-ro, </em>noting that \u00a7 22.05(b)(1) requires the shooting to be at or in the direction of an individual, not merely a building or structure. <em>Id. </em>at 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Because Hernandez-Perez\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 14-34.1 did not necessarily include an element of the use, attempted use, or threatened use of force against the person of another, we conclude that Hernandez-Perez\u2019s prior conviction was not a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the absence of any indication that the district court imposed some sort of alternative sentence, we VACATE Hernandez-Perez\u2019s sentence and REMAND this case for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"A75\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b313-7\">. We need not determine whether it is appropriate to further narrow Hemandez-Perez\u2019s conviction under the modified categorical approach. As we will explain below, a violation of the relevant statute by discharging a weapon into a <em>building </em>is not a crime of violence. Therefore, even assuming the modified categorical approach could be used to establish that Hemandez-Perez was convicted for discharging a weapon into a <em>building, </em>it would not change the outcome in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b313-12\">. The Virginia statute also criminalized conduct involving an unoccupied school building, but our conclusion in <em>Alfaro </em>did not depend exclusively on that portion of the statute. <em>Alfaro, </em>408 F.3d at 209.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b314-6\">. After our decision in <em>Alfaro </em>the Supreme Court of Virginia issued an opinion in <em>Ellis v. Commonwealth, </em>281 Va. 499, 706 S.E.2d 849, 852-53 (2011), which suggests that the Virginia statute also includes a knowledge requirement. We are satisfied that North Carolina's knowledge requirement does not compel a finding that Hernandez-Perez\u2019 conviction was for a crime of violence, but we offer no opinion on whether <em>Ellis </em>would have changed the analysis of the Virginia statute addressed in <em>Alfaro.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b314-22\">. We emphasize that our holding is limited to Hernandez-Perez's conviction. We are not deciding, for example, whether violating \u00a7 14-34.1 by shooting into a vehicle would be a crime of violence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
