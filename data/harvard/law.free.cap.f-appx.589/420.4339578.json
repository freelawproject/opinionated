While he concedes that he had never traveled outside of the United States since his initial arrival in the country in 1998, Alas contends that it was unconstitutional for his \u00a7 212(h) waiver application to be pretermitted on the basis that he had not concurrently sought readmission or filed an adjustment-of-status application when he filed the instant waiver application. In support of his argument, Alas asks that we reevaluate our holding in <em>Poveda v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>692 F.3d 1168 (11th Cir.2012), in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Judulang v. Holder, </em>565 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 476, 181 L.Ed.2d 449 (2011), and our earlier holding in <em>Yeung v. INS, </em>76 F.3d 337 (11th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-25\">. Alas also asserts that our remands in such cases as <em>Yeung </em>and <em>Lawal v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>710 F.3d 1288 (11th Cir.2013), had instructed the BIA to review its precedent with regard to \u00a7 212(h), but the BIA nonetheless has failed to conduct the requested legal analysis. Alas thereby re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>quests that we remand his case with specific instructions for the BIA to determine that his \u00a7 212(h) waiver may be filed without a concurrent filing of an adjustment-of-status application, or, alternatively, for the BIA to conduct a legal analysis on \u00a7 212(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision as the final judgment. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007). However, because the BIA explicitly agreed with the IJ\u2019s findings, we review the decisions of both the BIA and the IJ as to those issues. <em>Ayala v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 941, 948 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Under the prior precedent rule, we are bound to follow a prior binding precedent \u201cunless and until it is overruled by this court en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>606 F.3d 1303, 1305 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation omitted); <em>see also United States v. Kaley, </em>579 F.3d 1246, 1255 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that our precedent is binding unless it is contradicted by a decision that is \u201cclearly on point\u201d from either the Supreme Court or this Court sitting <em>en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) of the INA provides that an alien who has been convicted of one crime of moral turpitude within five years of admission is deportable (if the sentence for the crime is one year or longer). INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)\u00a9, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)\u00a9. Section 212(a) of the INA lists the classes of aliens who are inadmissible to the United States and ineligible to receive a visa, including, <em>inter alia, </em>individuals who have committed such a crime involving moral turpitude (\u201cCIMT\u201d). INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)\u00a9\u00a9.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">Section 212(h) of the INA allows the Attorney General, in his discretion, to grant hardship waivers to certain classes of inadmissible aliens, including those who have committed CIMTs, if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-10\">(1) (A) in the case of any immigrant it is established to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-11\">(B) in the case of an immigrant who is the spouse, parent, son, or daughter of a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if it is established to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that the alien\u2019s denial of admission would result in extreme hardship to the United States citizen or lawfully resident spouse, parent, son, or daughter of such alien; ... and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-12\">(2) the Attorney General, in his discretion, and pursuant to such terms, conditions and procedures as he may by regulations prescribe, has consented to the alien\u2019s applying or reapplying for a visa, for admission to the United States, or adjustment of status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">INA \u00a7 212(h), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h). Part 1245 of Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations, titled \u201cAdjustment of Status to that of Person Admitted for Permanent Residence,\u201d provides in relevant part that, except as provided in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1235 (related to aliens applying for admission at the port-of-entry) and 1249 (related to aliens applying for a waiver in conjunction with an adjustment-of-status application), \u201c[a]n application under this part shall be the sole method of requesting the exercise of discretion under sections 212(g), (h), (i), and (k) of the [INA], as they relate to the inadmissibility of an alien in the United States.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.1(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-14\">In <em>Yeung, </em>we concluded that, because the BIA had applied \u00a7 212(h) so as to create two classifications of aliens, identical in every respect except that one class had departed and returned to the United States while the other had not, the BIA\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 212(h) was unconstitutional as applied. <em>Id. </em>at 341. We remand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>ed the ease to allow the BIA to reconsider its prior interpretation of \u00a7 212(h) in the first instance and construe \u00a7 212(h) consistent with statutory, constitutional, and policy concerns. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Subsequently, in <em>Poveda, </em>we considered \u201cwhether a removable alien [was] eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility, under [INA \u00a7 212(h) ], 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h), if he remained] within the United States, but fail[ed] to apply for an adjustment of his status.\u201d <em>Poveda, </em>692 F.3d at 1171. We held that, in <em>Yeung, </em>the BIA \u201cheld out the possibility that a \u00a7 212(h) waiver would be available for a deportee who had departed and returned to this country subsequent to his conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1174 (quotation omitted). However, post <em>Yeung, </em>the BIA had \u201cbacked away from\u201d that interpretation and considered a \u00a7 212(h) waiver to be available in two situations. <em>Id. </em>at 1173-74. First, \u201cthe Attorney General may provide a waiver to an alien at the border who seeks admission, including an alien who has departed the United States after committing a deportable offense, so long as the alien remains outside of our borders while applying for relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1173. Second, \u201cthe Attorney General may provide a waiver to an alien within our borders after his conviction for a deportable offense so long as he applies for an adjustment of status.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We determined that this interpretation of the statute was consistent with its plain language and was entitled to Chevron<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> deference. <em>Id. </em>at 1174,1176.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Also in <em>Poveda, </em>we stated that an alien\u2019s eligibility for a \u201cstand-alone\u201d \u00a7 212(h) waiver was not based on his \u201clack of international travel,\u201d but rather a rational distinction \u201cbetween those criminal aliens who seek to be admitted to the United States, and those criminal aliens who are being deported from the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1177 (quotation and emphasis omitted). We concluded that those aliens seeking admission to the United States or those who are assimilated to the position of somebody seeking admission \u2014 such as by applying for adjustment of status \u2014 were eligible for a \u00a7 212(h) waiver. <em>Id. </em>Lastly, we concluded that there was a rational basis to distinguish between those aliens seeking admission and those aliens subject to deportation. <em>Id. </em>at 1177-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">After issuing our decision in <em>Poveda^ </em>we considered in <em>Lawal </em>whether a lawful permanent resident who had departed the United States and reentered without being stopped at the port-of-entry after becoming inadmissible because of criminal convictions was eligible for a \u00a7 212(h) waiver without concurrently filing an adjustment of status application. <em>See Lawal, </em>710 F.3d at 1289. We concluded that an ambiguity existed between the BIA\u2019s current interpretation of \u00a7 212(h), as articulated in <em>Poveda, </em>and the BIA\u2019s prior precedent under <em>Matter of Sanchez, </em>17 I. &amp; N. Dec. 218 (BIA 1980), which held that lawful permanent residents who had left the United States after being convicted of a crime that rendered them inadmissible and later reentered the United States were treated as if they were outside of the border seeking admission. <em>Id. </em>at 1292-93. We concluded that it was unclear whether the BIA\u2019s current\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 212(h) overruled <em>Sanchez, </em>and we remanded the case for the BIA to address this issue in the first instance. <em>Id. </em>at 1293-94. Subsequently, this court rejected the petitioner\u2019s position in <em>Lawal. See Rivas v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>765 F.3d 1324 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>(11th Cir.2014).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Here, pursuant to the prior precedent rule, we are bound to follow our ruling in <em>Poveda, </em>in which we concluded that a rational basis existed to limit the \u201cstandalone\u201d \u00a7 212(h) waiver to only those aliens seeking admission into the United States, and to require all other aliens to concurrently file an application for a visa, admis-' sion, or adjustment of status. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 212(h), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h); <em>Poveda, </em>692 F.3d at 1173, 1177-78; <em>Martinez, </em>606 F.3d at 1305. As for Alas\u2019s reliance on <em>Judu-lang, Yeung, </em>and <em>Lawal, </em>none of these decisions directly contradicts <em>Poveda, </em>and we also did not decide <em>Yeung </em>and <em>Lawal en banc. See Kaley, </em>579 F.3d at 1255. Finally, Alas\u2019s contention that the BIA has failed to sufficiently reconsider its precedent related to \u00a7 212(h) is meritless, because the binding opinion in <em>Poveda </em>concluded that the BIA had in fact reconsidered and altered its interpretation of \u00a7 212(h) since the issuance of <em>Yeung. See Poveda, </em>692 F.3d at 1173-74; <em>Martinez, </em>606 F.3d at 1305.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Accordingly, because <em>Poveda </em>forecloses \u25a0 Alas\u2019s eligibility for a \u201cstand-alone\u201d \u00a7 212(h) waiver, the BIA did not err in dismissing his appeal of the IJ\u2019s decision to pretermit his \u00a7 212(h) waiver application. <em>See Poveda, </em>692 F.3d at 1173, 1177-78. We therefore deny Alas\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b452-6\">. <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def.
