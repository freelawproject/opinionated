The convening authority approved the adjudged sentence to a dismissal and confinement for thirty months, but suspended the dismissal for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">Appellant\u2019s sentence was adjudged on 11 November 1999. On 18 May 2001, the Deputy Assistant Secretary, Army Review Boards, \u201csuspend[ed] the remaining confinement until 23 May 2002 on condition of [appellant\u2019s] submission of a request for voluntary excess leave<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to run concurrently with and for the duration of the suspension and any appellate review.\u201d This case is before the court for review under Article 66, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866.</p>\n<p id=\"AGde\">We disagree with appellant\u2019s second assignment of error that appellant\u2019s convictions of Specifications 7 and 8 of Charge II must be dismissed because the definition of \u201cchild pornography\u201d was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. We hold that the military judge\u2019s failure to properly instruct the court members on the definition of child pornography constituted harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. We also urge military judges to clearly explain the knowledge requirement for possession and receipt of material showing sexually explicit conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-16\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b757-17\">Appellant was fifty years of age when, in an America Online (AOL) chat room, he introduced himself to four females he believed to be minors under the age of fifteen. Thereafter, he privately communicated with them over the Internet, using instant messages and electronic mail (e-mail). Appellant sent them pictures of himself over the Internet: (1) in his Army uniform, (2) nude or with his penis exposed, and/or (3) of himself masturbating. Appellant asked one person he believed to be a female minor to sit naked in a chair and masturbate with her legs spread wide for the camera, and requested that she video tape herself \u201cfrom the chest up, focused on [your] face as you touch yourself and cum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>Appellant sent numerous e-mail messages to a thirteen-year-old girl. He eventually told her that he wanted to drive to Louisville, Kentucky, to meet her and that he \u201cdesperately want[ed] to make love\u201d to her. Appellant called her on the telephone, frightening her. She told appellant that she was grounded to discourage him from coming to her hometown to look for her. Appellant never drove to Louisville to meet her.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">On his way to Virginia from temporary duty in Texas, appellant traveled three hundred miles out of his way to Birmingham, Alabama, to meet a female he believed to be a minor. Appellant rented a motel room and then contacted her via e-mail. He tried to convince her to sneak out of her home at night and meet him at his motel for sexual activity. However, after considerable e-mail discussion she declined to meet with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Three months later, appellant arranged for a stop-over in Chicago, Illinois, as he traveled by plane to Las Vegas on official Army business. Appellant rented a hotel room to meet with a female he believed to be a minor so that he could engage in sexual activity with her. He brought a video camera to his hotel room to film his anticipated activities. Appellant talked to her on the telephone to make final arrangements for their rendezvous outside his hotel. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents met appellant in front of his hotel and arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">An FBI agent testified about what appellant said in his interview:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-7\">[A] year [ago] he began to get interested in younger girls, [ ] he found them appealing, and the idea of sex with them was exciting____he said he thought maybe it was the forbidden fruit aspect of the thought of having sex with a younger girl.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3j\">Appellant also stated that pornographic images of children under the age of eighteen were likely to be found on his home computer. FBI agents searched appellant\u2019s residence and seized his computer hard drive, as well as ten computer diskettes locked in a box in appellant\u2019s master bedroom closet. Over one hundred other computer diskettes were seized from his residence. Pictures or depictions stored in Grafics Interchange Format (GIF) computer files<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and Internet emails were saved on appellant\u2019s computer hard drive and on the diskettes found at appellant\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-12\">Many of the diskettes contain one or two images that are child pornography. Some are attached to e-mails, and include e-mail messages, such as, \u201cI like this one but you know i am not like bad an[d] slutty or nothin[g] like that\u201d (attached under file name \u201cUU13fk.jpg\u201d). Two of the ten diskettes found inside the box in appellant\u2019s bedroom closet contain at least three images of child pornography. All six images described in the next paragraph were saved on more than one diskette.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-13\">Diskette number three includes images depicting: (1) a nude female minor with the photograph taken at an upward angle to emphasize her vagina (under file name \u201c\u00dc\u00dc\u00dc11.JPG\u201d); (2) two nude female minors masturbating (under file name \u201cGIRLS. JPG\u201d); and (3) one nude female minor licking another nude female minor\u2019s nipple and spreading her vagina\u2019s labia with her fingers (under file name \u201c15 &amp; 16LEZ.JPG\u201d). Diskette number four includes images depicting: (1) a partially clothed female minor with her breasts and vagina exposed (under file name \u201c\u00dc14CUTE.JPG\u201d); (2) a nude female minor performing oral sex on an adult male (under file name \u201c\u00dc\u00dcIDAD.JPG\u201d); and (3) an adult male penetrating the vagina of a female minor with his penis (under file name \u201c!!!!13fk.jpg\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-14\">During appellant\u2019s testimony on the merits, he said that he intentionally saved items to the diskettes found in the box in his closet, and that he had fantasized about sexual activities with thirteen and fourteen-year-old girls.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-15\">The defense presented no evidence or argument at trial that supports appellant\u2019s position on appeal \u2014 that the images do not depict real children. The defense did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>assert that appellant was ignorant of how the images reflected sexually explicit conduct. The defense did not make a motion to dismiss based upon the images depicting adults and not minors, or upon an allegation that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256(8) included an unconstitutional definition of child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">We find as fact, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant: (1) knowingly received and possessed two 3.5 inch computer diskettes, numbers three and four, each containing three or more visual depictions; (2) that such visual depictions were of real<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct; (3) that appellant knew that such visual depictions showed sexually explicit conduct; (4) that appellant knew that at least one of the persons engaged in the sexually explicit conduct in such visual depiction was a minor; and (5) that diskettes numbers three and four each contain three or more visual depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct that had been transported over the Internet and downloaded by appellant using a computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Prior to the panel\u2019s deliberations on findings, the military judge instructed the members regarding the elements of Specification 7 of Charge II, \u201cfirst, that on [specified dates and location] the Accused knowingly received certain material. That is, child pornography, as defined in Title 18 United States Code Section 2256( [8]). And second, that the material was transported in interstate commerce by computer.\u201d He also instructed the members with regard to the elements of Specification 8 of Charge II:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-8\">[F]irst, that on [specified dates and location], the Accused knowingly possessed material. To wit, 3.5 inch computer diskettes containing three or more images of child pornography, as defined in Title 18 United States Code, Section 2256( [8]). The second element is that the material, that is, one or more 3.5 inch computer diskettes, containing three or more images of child pornography that had been mailed or shipped or transported in interstate commerce by any means, including by computer, or that was produced using materials that had been mailed or shipped or transported in interstate commerce by any means, including computer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-13\">The military judge defined the term \u201cknowingly\u201d for Specifications 7 and 8 of Charge II,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-16\">To find that the Government has satisfied its burden of proof as to the first element of the offenses alleged in Specifications 7 and 8 of Charge II, you must find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the Accused knowingly received and knowingly possessed child pornography as I have defined that term for you. The term knowledge or knowing, as used in the statute applicable to Specification 7 and 8 of Charge II, requires that the Government must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, both, one, that the Accused knowingly received, with regard to Specification 7, and knowingly possessed, with regard to Specification 8, the visual depiction in question, and two, that the Accused knew or believed that one or more of the persons depicted were minors, keeping in mind, as I previously instructed you, that for Specification 7 only one image need be of child pornography, and in Specification 8 three or more [images] on any one disk must be. With regard to the second point I just mentioned, that is, the Accused knew or believed one or more of the persons depicted were minors, the Government may meet its burden by, one, proving actual knowledge on the part of the Accused that the person[]s depicted were minors; or two, by proving that the Accused believed them to be minors and that the persons depicted were minors. This, like any other fact, may be proved by circumstantial evidence. Thus, after reviewing all of the evidence, you are eon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>vineed, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the persons depicted are minors and that the Accused believed them to be minors, then the Government has met its burden with respect to the knowledge element. On the other hand, if you cannot find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the persons depicted are minors, or if you cannot find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the Accused believed them to be minors, then you must find the Accused not guilty. In deciding this issue of knowledge and whether the persons depicted are minors, you must consider all the relevant facts, evidence and circumstances surrounding the case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">The military judge could have more clearly explained the knowledge requirement to the members, specifically that appellant <em>knew </em>the visual depictions he received and possessed showed <em>sexually explicit conduct.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The military judge provided appropriate instructions to the members regarding the definitions of: (1) interstate commerce; (2) number of child pornography images required (including an augmented unanimity instruction); (3) minor; (4) sexually explicit conduct, (5) visual depiction; and (6) possession.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> He defined child pornography using 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256(8), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-6\">Child pornography means any visual depiction, including any photograph, film, video, picture or computer generated image or picture, whether made or produced by electronic, mechanical or other means, of sexually explicit conduct, where</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-7\">(A) the production of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-8\">(B) such visual depiction is or appears to be of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-9\">(C) such visual depiction has been created, adapted or modified to appear that an identifiable minor is engaging in sexually explicit conduct; of-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am2\">(D) such visual depiction is advertised, promoted, presented, described or distributed in such a manner that conveys the impression that the material is or contains a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">There was no defense objection to the definitions pertaining to child pornography or to the elements of Specifications 7 and 8 of Charge II, nor was there a defense request for a clarifying instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b760-14\">Child Pornography Statute\u2019s Constitutionality</p>\n<p id=\"b760-15\">After appellant\u2019s case was tried, the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe prohibitions of [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7\u00a7 2256(8)(B) and 2256(8)(D) are overbroad and unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, </em>535 U.S. 234, 258, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 152 L.Ed.2d 403 (2002). <em>Free Speech Coalition, </em>however, reaffirmed that important societal interests \u201cjustified a ban on the possession of pornography produced by using children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 250,122 S.Ct. 1389 (citing <em>Osborne v. Ohio, </em>495 U.S. 103, 110 S.Ct. 1691, 109 L.Ed.2d 98 (1990)). Specifically, the <em>Free Speech Coalition </em>decision did not declare unconstitutional the possession or receipt of visual depictions \u201ccreated, adapted, or modified to appear that an identifiable minor is engaging in sexually explicit conduct\u201d (otherwise known as \u201cmorphed\u201d images).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Kelly, </em>314 F.3d 908 (7th Cir.2003) (upholding definitions of child pornography not expressly declared unconstitutional by <em>Free Speech Coalition). </em>Second, the unconstitutional (B) and (D) sub-paragraphs of \u00a7 2256(8) are severable. As the Supreme Court said in <em>Champlin Refining Co. v. Corp. Comm\u2019n of Oklahoma, </em>286 U.S. 210, 234, 52 S.Ct. 559, 76 L.Ed. 1062 (1932), \u201c[t]he unconstitutionality of a part of an Act does not necessarily defeat ... the validity of its remaining provisions.\u201d Here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>the remaining portions of \u00a7 2256(8), both sub-provisions (A) and (C) of the definition of \u201cchild pornography,\u201d can be read separately to address discrete types of images that the Congress sought to prohibit from being possessed or received. Accordingly, we hold that appellant\u2019s second assignment of error\u2014 that appellant\u2019s convictions of Specifications 7 and 8 of Charge II must be dismissed because the definition of child pornography was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad \u2014 is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">We review the military judge\u2019s decision regarding \u201cthe substance of any instructions given, \u2018to determine if they sufficiently cover the issues in the case and focus on the facts presented by the evidence. The question of whether a jury was properly instructed [is] a question of law, and thus, review is <em>de novo.\u2019 \u201d United States v. McDonald, </em>57 M.J. 18, 20 (2002) (quoting <em>Maxwell, </em>45 M.J. at 424).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">\u201cAlthough the error may not have been \u2018plain\u2019 at the time of the court-martial proceeding, it is sufficient if the error becomes \u2018plain\u2019 at the time of appellate consideration.\u201d <em>United States v. Baker, </em>57 M.J. 330, 337 (2002) (Crawford, C.J., dissenting) (citing <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997)). If an improper instruction is given, \u201cthe test for determining whether this constitutional error was harmless is whether it appears \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.\u2019 \u201d <em>McDonald, </em>57 M.J. at 20 (quoting <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967)). \u201cStated differently, the test is: \u2018Is it clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found the defendant guilty absent the error?\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 18, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed\u00fcd 35 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">Use of the definitions declared unconstitutional in <em>Free Speech Coalition </em>is error. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hall, </em>312 F.3d 1250, 1259-60 (11th Cir.2002), <em>writ denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 1646, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-- (2003); <em>Richardson, </em>304 F.3d at 1064; <em>United States v. Lee, </em>57 M.J. 659, 661-662 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App.2002), <em>pet. granted, </em>58 M.J. 142 (2003), <em>available at </em>2003 CAAF LEXIS 117 (Jan. 24, 2003). The military judge also could have more clearly explained to the members that they must find beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant <em>knew </em>that the visual depictions he received and possessed showed <em>sexually explicit conduct. See United States v. X-Citement Video, </em>513 U.S. 64, 77-78, 115 S.Ct. 464, 130 L.Ed.2d 372 (1994) (holding that knowledge requirement extends to sexually explicit nature of the material and age of the performer); <em>United States v. Lacy, </em>119 F.3d 742, 747 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-13\">Because the defense posed no objection to the instructions provided to the members, the waiver rule applies in the absence of plain error. <em>See </em>Rule for Courts-Martial 920(f); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>50 M.J. 451, 456 (1999). We need not decide, however, whether the military judge\u2019s instructional errors were plain error if we determine that any error was harmless beyond reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>57 M.J. 375, 381 (2002); <em>see United States v. Carpenter, </em>51 M.J. 393, 397 (1999) (citing <em>United States v. Powell, </em>49 M.J. 460, 464-65 (1998)).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Appellant engaged in a series of actions designed to obtain, and then did knowingly receive and possess, visual depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct. Evidence that the minors in the depictions were real is overwhelming; there is not a shred of evidence indicating that the images were computer generated. Further, the military judge instructed the members that in order to convict appellant they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that \u201cthe persons depicted [in the pictures] are minors and that the [a]ceused believed them to be minors.\u201d We find that these instructions negated the possibility that the members may have found that the minors depicted in the images were \u201cvirtual\u201d rather than real minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">As to appellant\u2019s knowledge that the depictions showed sexually explicit conduct, these images clearly meet the statutory definitions of such conduct. We conclude that the error with regard to the definition of child pornography, and any failure to more clearly instruct on the knowledge requirement, were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. It is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the court members would have found appellant guilty even if properly instructed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Assuming the military judge committed instructional error, we disagree with appellate defense counsel that the required remedy is dismissal of Specifications 7 and 8 of Charge II. Under the facts of this case, it would be more appropriate to affirm an attempted possession and receipt of child pornography in violation of Article 80, UCMJ,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> or a simple disorder in violation of Article 134, UCMJ, than to dismiss these two specifications.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> A reviewing court may disapprove a finding because of an instructional error and substitute a lesser-included offense. <em>United States v. McKinley, </em>27 M.J. 78, 79 (C.M.A.1988); <em>see also United States v. Standifer, </em>40 M.J. 440, 445 (C.M.A.1994). \u201cThis is true even if the lesser-included offense was neither considered nor instructed upon at the trial of the case.\u201d <em>McKinley, </em>27 M.J. at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">We have considered appellant\u2019s other assignment of error and the matters appellant has asserted under <em>United States v. Grostefon, </em>12 M.J. 431 (C.M.A.1982), and find them to be without merit. The findings of guilty and the sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">Judge BARTO and Judge SCHENCK concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b762-13\">We suggest the use of the following pattern instruction by military judges when provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>ing the elements for violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2252A(a)(2) and 2252A(a)(5)(B) (receipt and possession of child pornography):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-6\">First, [that on specified dates and location], the accused knowingly [received] [possessed] material, to wit, [e.g., 3.5 inch computer diskettes] containing [one or more] [three or more] visual depiction[s];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-7\">Second, that such visual depiction [s] was [were] of a real minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-8\">Third, that the accused knew that such visual depictionfs] showed sexually explicit conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-9\">Fourth, that the accused knew that at least one of the persons engaged in the sexually explicit conduct in such visual depictionfs] was [were] a minor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-10\">Fifth, that one or more [e.g., 3.5 inch computer diskettes], containing [one or more] [three or more] visual depictionfs] of [a] minor[s] engaged in sexually explicit conduct had been mailed, shipped, or transported in interstate commerce by any means, including by computer, or were produced using materials that had been mailed, shipped, or transported in interstate commerce by any means, including computer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-11\">An act is done \u201cknowingly\u201d if done voluntarily and intentionally, and not because of ignorance, mistake, accident, or other innocent reasons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-12\">This suggested instruction is an adaptation of the Ninth Circuit Court\u2019s Manual of Model Criminal Jury Instructions, Sexual Exploitation of Child-Possession of Child Pornography under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B), <em>http://w ww.ce9.uscourts.gov/weblsdocuments.nsf/criminal+jury, </em>at page 322 of the 2000 revised version. <em>See United States v.

We suggest use of these pattern instructions by military judges when providing the definitions for violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(2) and 2252A(a)(5) (receipt and possession of child pornography).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-14\">Interstate Commerce [and Foreign Commerce]</p>\n<p id=\"b763-15\">The term \u201cinterstate commerce\u201d includes commerce between one State, Territory, Possession, or the District of Columbia and another State, Territory, Possession, or the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-16\">[The term \u201cforeign commerce\u201d includes commerce with a foreign country.]</p>\n<p id=\"b763-17\">The use of the Internet to send an image from one computer to another constitutes transporting the image in interstate commerce, even if the receiving computer and the sending computer are located in the same state.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-18\">Reference. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 10 (defining \u201cinterstate commerce\u201d and \u201cforeign commerce\u201d), <em>United States v.

Hersh, </em>297 F.3d 1233, 1254 n. 31 (11th Cir.2002), <em>writ denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 1319, 154 L.Ed.2d 1071 (2003) (receiving an image over the Internet meets the interstate commerce requirement of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A) (citing <em>United States v. Carroll, </em>105 F.3d 740, 742 (1st Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-23\">Visual Depiction</p>\n<p id=\"b763-24\">18 United States Code Section 2256(5) defines the term visual depiction to include undeveloped film and video tape and data stored on computer disk or by electronic means, which is capable of conversion into a Usual image.</p>\n<p id=\"AEph\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Sexually Explicit Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">18 United States Code, Section 2256(2) defines the term sexually explicit conduct as: actual or simulated A) sexual intercourse, including genital to genital, oral to genital, anal to genital or oral to anal, whether between persons of the same or opposite sex; B) bestiality; C) masturbation; D) sadistic or masochistic abuse; or E) lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person. Some of the images that have been introduced in evidence may not involve sexual intercourse or masturbation. Such images may, nonetheless, constitute sexually explicit conduct, if they depict lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area. Not every exposure of the genitals or pubic areas constitutes lascivious exhibition. Whether a picture or image of the genitals or pubic area constitutes such a lascivious exhibition requires the consideration of the overall content of the material. It is for you to decide the weight or lack of weight to be given any of the following factors. A picture or image need not involve all of these factors to constitute a lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area. You may consider such factors as, one, whether the focal point of the pictures or images is on the genitals or pubic area; two, whether the setting of the pictures or images is sexually suggestive, that is, in a place or pose generally associated with sexual activity; three, whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose or in an inappropriate attire considering the age of the minor; four, whether the child is fully or partially clothed or nude; five, whether the pictures or images suggest sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity; six, whether the pictures or images are intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer; seven, whether the pictures or images portray the child as a sexual object; and eight, any captions that may appear on the pictures or images or materials that accompany the picture or image. You are not permitted to find that the images involve lascivious exhibition just because you don\u2019t like them or find them distasteful. You may, however, consider the factors I just listed and whether the images are, in fact, a lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area. Whether the images involve lascivious exhibition is a matter for you to decide beyond reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Reference. <em>See Hilton, </em>257 F.3d at 57-58 (defining the term \u201clascivious\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256(2)(E)) (citing <em>United States v. Amirault, </em>173 F.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">Minor</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">18 United States Code, Section 2256(1) defines the term minor as being any person under the age of eighteen years. For purpose of the statute in question, the age of the individual at the time the visual depiction was transported, received or possessed is irrelevant. What is controlling is whether the person in the visual depiction was under the age of eighteen years at the time the picture was taken of that person engaging in sexually explicit conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">Reference. <em>See United States v. Marcus, </em>193 F.Supp.2d 552, 557 (E.D.N.Y.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-11\">Augmented Unanimity</p>\n<p id=\"b764-12\">Number of child pornography images required. As to Specification [7] of Charge [II], there is no requirement that the government prove that the accused received more than one image of child pornography. As to Specification [8] of Charge [II], the government must prove that the accused possessed material, that is, a 3.5 inch computer disk, containing three or more images. More specifically, the statute prohibits the possession of, in this case, any diskette that contains three or more images. If the evidence is that diskette number one has two images, diskette number two has one image, and diskette number three has two images, the accused has not violated the statute. On the other hand, if the evidence shows that diskette number one has four images, diskette number two has one image, and diskette number three has two images, then the accused may be found guilty of the offense with respect to diskette number one. Therefore, as long as you find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused knowingly possessed at least three images that meet the definition of child pornography as I instructed you on any one diskette, you many find the accused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>guilty of this offense. Additionally, at least two thirds of the members or [] members must agree on the same three images.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Reference. An augmented unanimity instruction is appropriate when \u201cmore than one basis for conviction is presented in a single [specification]\u201d and when \u201ca conviction may occur as the result of different [members] concluding that [an accused] committed different acts.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>74 F.3d 701, 712-13 (6th Cir.1996) (holding judge\u2019s failure to <em>sua sponte </em>provide augmented unanimity instruction was not plain error because \u201cjury would [not] have had any trouble reaching unanimity on the fact that one item described in each of those counts was obscene\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Possession</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">To satisfy the first element of the offense alleged in Specification [8] of Charge [II], you must find, beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused had knowing possession of the material in question. The word \u201cpossession\u201d means to exercise control of something. Possession may be direct physical control, like holding an item in one\u2019s hand, or it may be constructive, as in the case of a person who hides an item in a locker to which the person may return to retrieve it. Possession inherently includes the power or authority to preclude control by others. It is possible, however, for more than one person to possess an item simultaneously, as when several people share control of an item.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">Reference. <em>See </em>Dep\u2019t of Army, Pam. 27-9, Legal Services: Military Judges\u2019 Benchbook, para. 3-37-l.d (1 Apr. 2001), (defining \u201cpossess\u201d in the context of wrongful possession of drugs, in violation of Article 112a, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 912a).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b757-9\">.
