He was sentenced to a dishonorable discharge, confinement for three years, total forfeitures, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. The convening authority approved the sentence but suspended confinement in excess of 20 months in accordance with the terms of a pretrial agreement between Appellant and the convening authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>The Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings and sentence in a short-form, unpublished opinion. <em>United States v. Inong, </em>NMCM No. 98-01667 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App. Sep. 29, 1999). Thereafter, Appellant petitioned this Court for review, and for the first time at either the trial or appellate level, he sought sentence relief for what he argued was illegal pretrial punishment. In response, this Court set aside the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals and remanded the case to that court \u201cto consider this question initially and to take remedial action if necessary.\u201d <em>United States v. Inong, </em>54 M.J. 375 (C.A.A.F.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Prior to that remand, but after the lower court initially decided Appellant\u2019s case, this Court decided <em>United States v. Southwick, </em>53 M.J. 412 (C.A.A.F.2000), and <em>United States v. Tanksley, </em>54 M.J. 169 (C.A.A.F.2000). In <em>Southwick </em>and <em>Tanksley, </em>we held that when the record reflects a tactical decision to present the issue of illegal pretrial punishment to the court-martial panel with the goal of obtaining a lesser sentence, rather than presenting the issue to the military judge for the purpose of obtaining pretrial punishment credit, that tactical decision waives the issue of whether a specific credit for pretrial punishment is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Relying on these cases, the Court of Criminal Appeals again affirmed the findings and sentence in Appellant\u2019s case, concluding that Appellant made a tactical decision at trial to use the conditions of his pretrial confinement as a means of obtaining a lesser adjudged sentence, rather than seek credit against his adjudged sentence by arguing the issue of illegal pretrial punishment. <em>United States v. Inong, </em>57 M.J. 501, 502-03 (N.M.Ct.Crim. App.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Thereafter, Appellant again petitioned this Court for review, and we granted the petition on the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">I. WHETHER APPELLANT WAS SUBJECTED TO ILLEGAL PRETRIAL PUNISHMENT BY BEING CONFINED IN MAXIMUM CUSTODY FOR 37 DAYS IN VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 813 (2000).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-11\">II. WHETHER THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT APPELLANT AFFIRMATIVELY WAIVED THE ISSUE OF ILLEGAL PRETRIAL PUNISHMENT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-12\">As to Issue II, we hold the Court of Criminal Appeals correctly applied <em>Southwick </em>and <em>Tanksley </em>to the facts of Appellant\u2019s case, and thereby correctly determined that Appellant is not entitled to any appellate relief stemming from the conditions of his pretrial confinement. We further hold that in the future, failure at trial to raise the issue of illegal pretrial punishment waives that issue for purposes of appellate review absent plain error. <em>See United States v. King, </em>58 M.J. 110 (C.A.A.F.2003)(holding the same as to restriction tantamount to confinement).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-13\">Given our resolution of Issue II, we need not address Issue I.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-14\">\n<em>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b521-15\">Between October 2, 1996, and January 9, 1997, Appellant conspired with two different servicemen on three separate occasions to steal government-owned computers worth in aggregate more than $8,700. In turn, each of these planned larcenies was completed, with Appellant and his co-conspirators breaking into several Navy office buildings in the middle of the night and stealing the desired computers. However, shortly thereafter, Appellant\u2019s co-conspirators were questioned by law enforcement agents, and they made statements incriminating both themselves and Appellant. As a result, charges were preferred against Appellant for these offenses, and he soon faced court-martial.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-16\">But a court-martial was something Appellant was unwilling to face, so on July 19, 1997, he left the military in order to avoid prosecution, and remained absent until March 1, 1998, when his absence was terminated by apprehension. Prior to his apprehension, Appellant continued his criminal conduct by knowingly writing ten bad checks while he had insufficient funds and no intent to pay. Nine of the checks were for cash received totaling $2,700, and one was to \u201cpur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>chase\u201d yet another computer valued in excess of $3,400. All of the checks bounced.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Initially, Appellant was apprehended by civilian authorities. At the time of his apprehension, Appellant was found illegally concealing a loaded .40 caliber handgun underneath the seat of a car. Shortly thereafter, Appellant was transferred to military control and placed in \u201cmaximum custody\u201d pretrial confinement. In an affidavit filed with the Court of Criminal Appeals after our remand, Appellant described these conditions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">On March 10, 199[8] I was confined to the Camp Pendleton Base Brig. Upon arrival at [4:00 a.m.] my head was shaved bald and I was placed in [maximum] confinement.[<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>] Two U.S. Marine guards escorted me in my bare feet, with leg irons and my hands handcuffed to my waist to a 5-foot by 8-foot metal cell. The Ambient air temperature was right around 48 degrees Fahrenheit. I was given three wool blankets and told to fill out a cell evaluation and then go to sleep. At [4:45 a.m.] I went to sleep and was told to rise at [5:00 a.m.] by guard for reveille. I was feed [sic] my meal through a 12 inch by 5 inch opening in the metal door. The same opening used to pass a toilet brush to clean my toilet. When I showered I was handcuffed and any other time I left the special quarters area I was handcuffed to my waist and legs were shackled with leg irons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">On or about March 28, 199[8] my brig assigned counselor, SGT [M] informed me that if I signed a Pre-trial agreement he would get me out of [maximum] Confinement. Later that week I spoke to my defense counsel, Lt. [N], and counsel informed me that he would be coming to the brig to discuss a Pre-trial agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">On or about April 4, 199[8] Lt. [N], Defense counsel, arrived at Camp Pendleton base brig. He informed me of a pretrial agreement the government had offered and that if I accepted the agreement He would get me out of [maximum] Confinement. I signed the agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">On or about April 10,199[8] I received a fax copy of my signed pre-trial agreement from my Convening Authority, naval Weapons Station: Seal Beach. Upon receipt of that agreement I gave a copy to my Brig Counselor, SGT [M]. SGT [M] stated that he would be able to get me out of [maximum] Confinement soon. On or about April 15, 199[8] I was released from [maximum] Confinement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">Appellant argues the conditions of this maximum custody pretrial confinement amounted to illegal pretrial punishment entitling him to sentence credit. The Government has not contested Appellant\u2019s version of the conditions of his pretrial confinement, and we accept them as true for purposes of this appeal. <em>See United States v. Steele, </em>53 M.J. 274, 275 (C.A.A.F.2000)(uneontested facts in document offered by Appellant and admitted by this Court accepted as true for purposes of appeal). As for Appellant, he has never suggested that the relationship between entering into a pretrial agreement and being released from maximum custody affected the voluntariness of his pretrial agreement or the providence of his pleas, and no such issue is before us. <em>See Inong, </em>57 M.J. at 503 n. 5 (\u201c[Appellant] stated, under oath, that no one had threatened or forced him to enter into the pretrial agreement, [and] that he entered into the agreement voluntarily\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">\n<em>PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b522-12\">Neither Appellant nor his defense counsel filed any complaint or grievance prior to trial asserting that the conditions of Appellant\u2019s pretrial confinement rose to the level of illegal pretrial punishment. Moreover, at trial, before receiving Appellant\u2019s pleas, the military judge asked if the defense had any motions, and the defense had none. That is significant, because if Appellant wanted sentence credit for what he believed was illegal pretrial punishment at the confinement facility, he could have asked for it, as he was not precluded from doing so by the terms of his pretrial agreement. <em>See United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number><em>McFadyen, </em>51 M.J. 289 (C.A.A.F.1999) (accused can waive right to seek relief for illegal pretrial punishment as part of pretrial agreement with convening authority).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Although at trial Appellant did not seek sentence credit for illegal pretrial punishment, he twice made reference to the conditions of his pretrial confinement when he gave an unsworn statement before being sentenced. At the beginning of his statement, he said: \u201cWhile I was confined at Camp Pendleton base brig, the first weeks I spent I spent in solitary confinement. I sat in a six by nine cell, next to convicted murderers, rapists and drug dealers.\u201d At the end of his statement he also said: \u201cDuring my six weeks of solitary confinement at Camp Pendleton base brig, I sunk to the lowest point in my Life____ In that six by nine cell ... I realized I must accept responsibility for my actions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">Appellant\u2019s trial defense counsel also referenced the conditions of Appellant\u2019s pretrial confinement during counsel\u2019s sentencing argument. Counsel said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-9\">Earlier we mentioned that the maximum [confinement the accused faces] is 126 years. That\u2019s a long time, sir. What is the purpose of keeping him in there that long? The message we\u2019re sending out to the fleet is \u201chey, we\u2019re not going to tolerate this. And that\u2019s why if you get caught, we\u2019re going to send you to Camp Pendleton, spend six weeks in maximum and then whatever else time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">On appeal, Appellant asserts that during the period of his pretrial confinement, the brig had a policy of confining all pretrial detainees in maximum custody who could be sentenced to more than five years\u2019 confinement, and that the policy was applied arbitrarily to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A49\">1. <em>Appellant\u2019s Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"A7\">Article 13 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-12\">No person, while being held for trial, may be subjected to punishment or penalty other than arrest or confinement upon the charges pending against him, nor shall the arrest or confinement imposed upon him be any more rigorous than the circumstances required to insure his presence [at trial].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-15\">Thus, in <em>United States v. Fricke, </em>53 M.J. 149 (C.A.A.F.2000), this Court recognized that Article 13 prohibits two things: (1) the intentional imposition of punishment on an accused before his or her guilt is established at trial, i.e., illegal pretrial punishment, and (2) arrest or pretrial confinement conditions that are more rigorous than necessary to ensure the accused\u2019s presence at trial, i.e., illegal pretrial confinement. <em>Id. </em>at 154 (citing <em>United States v. McCarthy, </em>47 M.J. 162, 165 (C.A.A.F.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-16\">If an accused, or appellant, can demonstrate that either existed, he or she is entitled to sentence relief. <em>United States v. Mosby, </em>56 M.J. 309, 310 (C.A.A.F.2002)(\u201cburden is on appellant to establish ... violation of Article 13\u201d); Rule for Courts-Martial 305(k)[hereinafter R.C.M.](\u201cadditional credit for each day of pretrial confinement that involves an abuse of discretion or unusually harsh circumstances\u201d); <em>United States v. Suzuki, </em>14 M.J. 491 (C.M.A.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-17\">Notwithstanding these rules, an appellant is not entitled to sentence credit on appeal for what is alleged to have been illegal pretrial punishment or confinement if such relief was not sought at trial, but instead, a tactical decision was made to use the complained of conditions as a means of obtaining a lesser adjudged sentence. <em>Southwick, </em>53 M.J. at 416; <em>Tanksley, </em>54 M.J. at 177. In Appellant\u2019s case, the Court of Criminal Appeals concluded that is exactly what happened. We agree with the court below. Appellant is now precluded under <em>Southwick </em>and <em>Tanksley </em>from arguing that the conditions of his pretrial confinement violated Article 13. He is therefore entitled to no sentence relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-18\">2. <em>Future Cases</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-19\">In <em>United States v. Huffman, </em>40 M.J. 225, 227 (C.M.A.1994), a majority of this Court held that \u201cwe will not invoke waiver [of alleged Article 13 violations] unless there is an affirmative, fully developed waiver on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>record.\u201d Today, however, we conclude <em>Huffman\u2019s </em>affirmative waiver rule is unworkable. As a result, we now overrule <em>Huffman </em>and begin following the \u201craise or waive\u201d rule required by the <em>Manual for Courts-Martial, United States </em>(2002 ed.)[hereinafter <em>MCM\\, </em>as relates to assertions of illegal pretrial confinement and punishment. <em>See </em>R.C.M.s 905(e), 906(b)(8); <em>Huffman, </em>40 M.J. at 228-29 (Crawford, C.J., joined by Gierke, J., dissenting in part and concurring in the result). In so doing, we also overrule <em>Southwick, </em>53 M.J. at 416, and <em>Tanksley, </em>54 M.J. at 177-78, to the extent they establish a \u201ctantamount to affirmative waiver\u201d rule in the Article 13 arena.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">This we do not do lightly, respectful as we are of the important doctrine of stare decisis. Thus, in <em>United States v. Tualla </em>52 M.J. 228 (C.A.A.F.2000), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">Under this fundamental principle, adherence to precedent \u201cis the preferred course because it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 231 (quoting <em>Payne v. Tennessee, </em>501 U.S. 808, 827, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720 (1991)). However, we also recognized in <em>Tualla </em>that \u201c[sjtare decisis is a principle of decision making, not a rule, and need not be applied when the precedent at issue is \u2018unworkable or ... badly reasoned.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Unfortunately, <em>Huffman\u2019s </em>affirmative waiver rule has proven to be unworkable when one considers the result it has generated in light of the strong policy reasons behind the \u201craise or waive\u201d rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The purpose of the <em>MCM\u2019s </em>\u201craise or waive\u201d rule is \u201cto promote the efficiency of the entire justice system by requiring the parties to advance their claims at trial, where the underlying facts can best be determined.\u201d <em>King, </em>58 M.J. at 114. This rule is especially important in the military justice system \u201c[bjecause of the turnover of personnel and changing conditions at [military] confinement facilities.\u201d <em>Huffman, </em>40 M.J. at 229 (Crawford, C.J., joined by Gierke, J., dissenting in part and concurring in the result). Once an Article 13 violation is suspected, the parties \u201cmust determine who was responsible for operating the facility, interview witnesses at the facility to determine the nature of the confinement conditions, and determine\u201d whether there actually was illegal pretrial punishment or confinement. <em>Id. </em>\u201cObviously, raising an allegation such as [this] on appeal for the first time that could have been raised as early as in the pretrial stage places an unnecessary burden on a worldwide justice system. That is precisely why there are Manual Rules invoking waiver.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">The rationale behind waiver is \u201cto eliminate the expense to the parties and the public of rehearing an issue that could have been dealt with by a timely objection or motion at trial\u201d by the one party best positioned to make that happen \u2014 the party in need of relief. <em>Id. </em>This principle is \u201cessential\u201d to the continued effectiveness of our heavily burdened trial and appellate judicial systems. <em>Hormel v. Helvering, </em>312 U.S. 552, 556, 61 S.Ct. 719, 85 L.Ed. 1037 (1941). At odds with this principle, however, is the result produced by the <em>Huffman </em>rule and exemplified by Appellant\u2019s case \u2014 \u201cone more case demonstrating the wisdom of the waiver rule in R.C.M. 905(e).\u201d <em>Fricke, </em>53 M.J. at 156 (Gierke, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">Time and again since <em>Huffman </em>was decided, appellants have waited until the appellate stages of the court-martial process to advance claims of illegal pretrial confinement and punishment, and to seek sentence relief. <em>See Tanksley, </em>54 M.J. at 169; <em>United States v. Scalarone, </em>54 M.J. 114 (C.A.A.F.2000); <em>Southwick, </em>53 M.J. at 412; <em>Fricke, </em>53 M.J. at 149; <em>United States v. Yunk, </em>53 M.J. 145 (C.A.A.F.2000); <em>United States v. Avila, </em>53 M.J. 99 (C.A.A.F.2000); <em>see also King, </em>58 M.J. at 110 (same for restriction tantamount to confinement). At the same time, however, appellants frequently have placed before the trial level sentencing authority information and argument about those very same pretrial conditions, hoping it will result in a lenient sentence. <em>See Tanksley, </em>54 M.J. at 177; <em>Southwick, </em>53 M.J. at 416; <em>Inong, </em>57 M.J. at 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>The end result of this practice is expensive, time-consuming appellate litigation characterized by undeveloped factual records (which could have been created at the trial level), the resulting need for remands and rehearings, and the difficulty in conducting those proceedings years later when confinement facilities, personnel, and programs have changed. We therefore conclude that <em>Huffman </em>is unworkable and must be overruled, along with the <em>Southwick </em>and <em>Tanksley </em>\u201ctantamount to affirmative waiver\u201d rule. We therefore hold that once this opinion becomes final, failure at trial to seek sentence relief for violations of Article 13 waives that issue on appeal absent plain error. <em>See King, </em>58 M.J. at 114 (same for restriction tantamount to confinement). Having said that, however, we urge all military judges to remember that nothing precludes them from inquiring sua sponte into whether Article 13 violations have occurred, and prudence may very well dictate that they should.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\n<em>DECISION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The decision of the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b522-8\"> In his affidavit, Appellant mistakenly referred to the year as \"1997\u201d and the confinement as \"solitary.\u201d <em>United States v. Inong, </em>57 M.J. 501, 502 n. 2 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b525-7\">Judge BAKEK</author>\n<p id=\"AmiD\">(concurring in part and in the result):</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">I would decide this case on the ground that Appellant has not carried his burden of demonstrating a violation of Article 13, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 813 (2000). As this court has recognized on previous occasions, Appellant\u2019s failure to raise the matter at trial may be indicative of, but not dispositive as to, whether or not an individual was subject to pretrial punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">Although I agree with the majority and the lower court that <em>United States v. Southwick, </em>53 M.J. 412 (C.A.A.F. 2000), and <em>United States v. Tanksley, </em>54 M.J. 169 (C.A.A.F. 2000), were the law at the time, I am less confident than the majority that an appellate court can infer from Appellant\u2019s sentencing statement a tactical choice to abstain from seeking credit for alleged pre-trial punishment as a means of obtaining a lesser adjudged sentence. Certainly, I am not prepared to conclude that Appellant\u2019s words, or those of his counsel, amounted to an affirmative waiver on Article 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">In my view, <em>Tanksley </em>and <em>Southwick </em>invite appellate courts to engage in appellate speculation regarding trial tactics that in context may be undue. This concern is readily avoided by the prospective rule adopted by the court today or by having military judges affirmatively inquire where the facts suggest the possibility of Article 13 credit. Where liberty interests and unlawful government conduct converge in Article 13, legal policy should favor clear black-letter rules. Therefore, I join that part of the lead opinion adopting a clear raise or waive rule linked as it is to this Court\u2019s admonishments that military judges should exercise their inherent and prudential authority to affirmatively inquire where the facts suggest that an Article 13 violation may have occurred. <em>See United States v. King, </em>58 M.J. 110, 115 (Baker, J., with whom Erdmann, J., joined concurring in result).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
