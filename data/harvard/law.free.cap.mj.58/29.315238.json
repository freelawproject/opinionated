She was convicted of three specifications of assault and one charge of \u201cchild neglect,\u201d in violation of Articles 128 and 134, Uniform Code of Military Justice [hereinafter UCMJ], 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 928 and 934, respectively. Appellant contested one of the assault specifications and entered a conditional plea on the charge of \u201cchild neglect\u201d under Article 134, preserving the issue of whether the charge stated an offense. The adjudged and approved sentence provided for a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for 30 months, and reduction to pay grade E-l. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings and sentence. <em>United States v. Vaughan, </em>56 M.J. 706 (A.F.Ct.CrimApp. 2001). We granted review of the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-13\">WHETHER CHILD NEGLECT THAT DOES NOT RESULT IN HARM TO THE CHILD IS AN OFFENSE UNDER THE UNIFORM CODE OF MILITARY JUSTICE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-14\">For the following reasons, the decision of the lower court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-15\">Appellant was stationed at Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany, and resided off-base with her infant daughter in nearby Pickliessem, Germany. The Government originally charged her with leaving her daughter unattended on divers occasions for time periods ranging from 30-45 minutes up to six hours. In response to Appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the child neglect charge for failure to state an offense, the military judge held that the shorter time periods did not support a charge of child neglect, but allowed the Government to proceed on the longer time period. Appellant conditionally pleaded guilty to child neglect for leaving her 47 days-old daughter, SK, alone in her crib for six hours from 11:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. while she went to a club that was a 90 minute drive away. She had called the child\u2019s father earlier in the day, and he agreed to watch SK while she went to the club. When the father did not arrive, Appellant left for the club anyway. At the time she left the child, Appellant believed that he was not going to show up, since he had failed to do so on previous occasions. She further testified that she locked the door and that no one other than the father had a key. The father, in fact, did not show up to care for SK during Appellant\u2019s absence. SK suffered no apparent harm during Appellant\u2019s absence. Appellant was charged with \u201cchild neglect\u201d as a \u201cservice-discrediting\u201d offense under clause 2 of Article 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-16\">Appellant challenges her conviction on three bases. First, she argues that she did not have notice that her conduct was subject to criminal sanction under Article 134 and that the specific charge and military judge\u2019s subsequent guidance, did not provide proper notice as to the specific elements of the offense. Second, she argues that her con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>duct falls outside the definition of child neglect because SK was not harmed by being left alone. Third, she argues that her actions were not service discrediting. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aa\">A. <em>Fair Notice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Due process requires \u201cfair notice\u201d that an act is forbidden and subject to criminal sanction. <em>United States v. Bivins, </em>49 M.J. 328, 330 (C.A.A.F.1998). It also requires fair notice as to the standard applicable to the forbidden conduct. <em>Parker v. Levy, </em>417 U.S. 733, 755, 94 S.Ct. 2547, 41 L.Ed.2d 439 (1974). In <em>Parker, </em>the Supreme Court gave meaning to these concepts in the context of Article 133, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 933 (2002) and Article 134.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The Court held that the language of Article 134 was not so vague that service members could not understand what conduct was proscribed and, therefore, Article 134 was not facially void for vagueness. <em>Id. </em>at 756-57, 94 S.Ct. 2547. \u2018Void for vagueness,\u201d the Court ruled, \u201cmeans that criminal responsibility should not attach where one could not reasonably understand that his contemplated conduct is proscribed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 757, 94 S.Ct. 2547. The Court noted that interpretations by this Court, military authorities, as well as the examples in the <em>Manual for Courts-Martial, United States </em>(2002 ed.), [hereinafter MCM], have limited the broad reach of the literal language of Article 134. <em>Id. </em>at 753-54, 94 S.Ct. 2547. At the same time, the Court did not preclude future application of Article 134 to actions not specifically mentioned in the <em>MCM. </em>\u201cBut even though sizable areas of uncertainty as to the coverage of the articles may remain after their official interpretation by authoritative military sources, further <em>content may be supplied even in these areas by less formalized custom and usage.\u201d Id. </em>at 754, 94 S.Ct. 2547 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">Citing <em>Parker v. Levy, </em>this Court has held that as a matter of due process, a service member must have \u201c\u2018fair notice\u2019 that his conduct [is] punishable\u201d before he can be charged under Article 134 with a service discrediting offense. <em>Bivins, </em>49 M.J. at 330. This Court has found such notice in the <em>MCM, </em>federal law, state law, military case law, military custom and usage, and military regulations. <em>See MCM </em>Part IV, at para. 60.c.(4)(b)-(c) (permitting offenses under federal and state law to be charged under Article 134); <em>id: </em>Part IV, at paras. 60-114 (listing specified Article 134 offenses); Article 137, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. 937 (2002) (requiring explanation to members of punitive UCMJ Articles 77-134, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 877-934 (2002)); <em>United States v. Boyett, </em>42 M.J. 150, 153-54 (C.A.A.F.1995)(noting that a court may take judicial notice of regulations as evidence of military custom). <em>United States v. Guerrero, </em>33 M.J. 295, 298 (C.M.A.1991)(citing Article 137 and military customs on civilian dress as evidence of notice for prosecution for \u201ccross dressing\u201d). Therefore, the question is whether Appellant had fair notice that leaving her child alone for six hours under the conditions presented, and without apparent harm, was subject to sanction under Article 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">Both sides agree that child neglect is not specifically listed in the MCM as an Article 134 offense. Therefore, we must look elsewhere to determine whether Appellant should have reasonably contemplated that her conduct was subject to criminal sanction, and not simply the moral condemnation that accompanies bad parenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">(1) <em>Case Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-13\">Military case law in this area is scant, and arguably can be read to provide some support to both the Government\u2019s and Appellant\u2019s position. The Army Court of Criminal Appeals has held that child neglect that does not result in harm is not an Article 134 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>offense absent a regulation clearly prohibiting the conduct. <em>United States v. Wallace, </em>33 M.J. 561, 563-64 (A.C.M.R.1991). In contrast, the Air Force Court in <em>United States v. Foreman, </em>ACM No. 28008, 1990 WL 79309, at *1, 1990 CMR LEXIS 622, at *2 (A.F.C.M.R. May 25,1990), held in an unpublished opinion, that while child neglect \u201cis viable\u201d as an Article 134 offense, the facts presented during the providence inquiry in that case were insufficient to sustain the conviction. While these cases are not controlling, they demonstrate that the lower courts\u2019 approaches have been contextual, and that service members have heretofore been charged under Article 134 with child neglect for leaving children unattended. Significantly, Appellant\u2019s relevant service court has gone furthest in ruling that an offense of \u201c[child neglect] is viable under clause 2 of Article 134.\u201d <em>Foreman, </em>1990 WL 79309 at *1,1990 CMR LEXIS at *2.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">(2) <em>State Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Appellant further argues that she did not receive fair notice from state statutes that her conduct overseas was criminal under Article 134. Moreover, even if state statutes provided general notice that child neglect was subject to criminal sanction, several of those statutes require a finding of substantial harm in order to sustain a child neglect conviction. Thus, according to Appellant, absent a showing of substantial harm, her plea is improvident.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">In our view, the preponderance of states laws support a contrary conclusion. A majority of state statutes submitted by Appellant (34 of 48, including the District of Columbia) criminalize child neglect in the context of a protected relationship, regardless of actual harm to the child, when the conduct violates a duty of care and places the child at risk of harm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the better view is that state statutes generally serve to provide constructive notice that child neglect through absence of supervision or care, with an attendant risk of harm, can constitute a criminal offense. The locus of the charged conduct does not change the measure of notice. Appellant was not charged through assimilation of a state statute in Germany, but through application of Article 134, with uniform application worldwide.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">(3) <em>Custom</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-12\">Fair notice does not depend on military case law or state statute alone. In <em>Parker v. Levy, </em>the Supreme Court recognized that in addition to constructions of Articles 133 and 134 provided by the <em>MCM </em>and military courts, \u201cless formalized custom and usage\u201d may further define the scope of conduct proscribed by Article 134. 417 U.S. at 754, 94 S.Ct. 2547. In our view, there is established military custom of protecting dependents from harm. Dependents are an integral part of the specialized military community which the Supreme Court addressed in <em>Parker. </em>This is especially true of dependents based overseas over whose welfare the United States bears increased responsibility in the absence of normal familial and social ties, as well as the array of public services available within the United States. Moreover, dependents overseas can often face heightened security concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-13\">Several Department of Defense (DOD) regulations apply. Department of Defense, Directive 6400.1, <em>Family Advocacy Program </em>(July 23,1992) [hereinafter Directive 6400.1], for example, addresses the Family Advocacy Program (FAP). The FAP is a \u201cprogram designed to address prevention, identification, evaluation, treatment, rehabilitation, followup, and reporting of family violence. FAPs consist of coordinated efforts designed to prevent and intervene in eases of family distress, and to promote healthy family life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>10, at para. E2.1.5. Directive 6400.1 states that the local FAP office shall be notified immediately when an act of child abuse occurs. <em>Id. </em>5-6, at para. 6.1. It further defines the term as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number><em>Child Abuse and/or Neglect. </em>physical injury, sexual maltreatment, emotional maltreatment, <em>deprivation of necessities, </em>or combinations for a child by an individual responsible for the child\u2019s welfare <em>under circumstances indicating that the child\u2019s welfare is harmed or threatened. </em>The term encompasses both acts and omissions on the part of a responsible person. <em>Includes</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-3\"><em>Id. </em>9, at para. E.2.1.3 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">DOD Instruction 6400.3 further notes that it is DOD policy to \u201c[pjrovide a safe and secure environment for DOD personnel and their families.\u201d Department of Defense, Instruction 6400.3, <em>Family Advocacy Command Assistance Team </em>2, at para. 4.1. (February 3,1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Significantly, Directive 6400.1 mandates that in the case of alleged instances of child neglect and/or abuse:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">[T]he local FAP office ... shall ... ensure implementation of the following procedures:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\">6.1.3. <em>Notification of military law enforcement and investigative agencies.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">6.1.4. Notification of the local public child protective agency (in alleged child abuse cases only) in the United States and where covered by agreement overseas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-9\">6.1.5. <em>Observance of the applicable rights of alleged offenders.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-10\">Directive 6400.1 5-6, at paras. 6.1, 6.1.3-6.1.5. (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">Thus, DOD regulation provides notice that child neglect is potentially subject to military criminal investigation. While DOD and service regulations are not the same as UCMJ offenses, this Court may take notice of such regulations as evidence of notice through custom of an Article 134 offense. <em>United States v. Boyett, </em>42 M.J. 150, 152 (C.A.A.F.1995). We need not decide whether custom and regulation, state law, or military case law alone would meet the requirements for due process notice enunciated in Parker,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that when addressed together, appellant should reasonably have understood that her contemplated conduct was subject to military criminal sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-14\">B. <em>Sufficiency of the Specification</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-15\">Appellant\u2019s due process argument has two facets. As addressed above, Appellant argues that she was not on fair notice that child neglect was subject to criminal sanction under Article 134. Additionally, Appellant contends on appeal that whether or not she was on general notice, the Government\u2019s charge, and subsequently the military judge\u2019s providence inquiry pursuant to <em>United States v. Care, </em>18 C.M.A. 535, 40 C.M.R. 247 (1969), did not properly define the specific elements of the offense. Thus, Appellant was not on fair notice as to what conduct was specifically proscribed under Article 134. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-16\">In conducting the providence inquiry, the military judge advised Appellant that the elements of the offense of child neglect charged under Article 134 were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-17\">The first element of this specification is that between on or about 2 January 1999 and on or about 3 January 1999, at or near Pickliessem, Germany, you neglected your daughter, [SK].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-18\">The second element is that you did so by leaving [SK] in your house without supervision or care for an unreasonable period of time, without regard for the mental or physical health, safety, or welfare of [SK],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-19\">The third element is that [SK] is a child under the age of one year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-20\">And the fourth element is that under the circumstances, your conduct was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>the armed forces or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The Government immediately corrected the military judge on element four, noting that the child neglect had only been charged as \u201cservice discrediting\u201d under the second clause of Article 134. While Appellant had earlier entered a conditional plea, subject to her motion to dismiss for failure to state an offense under Article 134, she did not challenge the specific elements of the offense as defined by the military judge. Rather, the judge reviewed the elements and facts with Appellant ensuring her understanding of the relationship between fact and law. During the <em>Care </em>inquiry, for example, the military judge elaborated on the four elements of the offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\">MJ: When we talk about negligence in this case, we\u2019re talking about culpable negligence, where it\u2019s above what would be simple negligence. \u201cCulpable negligence\u201d is a degree of carelessness greater than simple negligence. \u201cSimple negligence\u201d is the absence of due care. The law requires everyone at all times to demonstrate due care for the safety of others. And what a reasonably careful person would demonstrate under the same or similar circumstances. That is what due care means.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKu\">MJ: Now, culpable negligence, on the other hand, is a negligent act or failure to act, accompanied by a gross, reckless, wanton, or deliberate disregard for the foreseeable consequences of your conduct, results to others, instead of merely a failure to use due care. So it\u2019s a grossness. It\u2019s larger than simple negligence. So those are the definitions and the elements. Do you feel like you understand those? ACC: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-7\">MJ: Okay. So, do you agree then that a child of that age, about a month-and-a-half, needs to generally have supervision or someone around them to watch over them? ACC: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-8\">MJ: Now I know that at other times you might leave briefly, and that\u2019s one thing, and we talked about that. And I\u2019m not allowing the government to go forward. And I know you\u2019ve left her before for brief occasions, maybe up to 30 minutes or so, if that\u2019s correct. But this is a much longer period of time, six to seven hours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-10\">So I need to make sure that you feel comfortable that you agree that what you did was more than simple negligence. That means that your decision to leave her \u2014 and this wasn\u2019t any emergency that made you leave the child, that you had to take care of something else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-11\">ACC: No, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-12\">MJ: It was just for whatever you wanted to do personally, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-13\">ACC: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-14\">MJ: It was more than simple negligence. That means that your failure to be there and supervise her and care for her during this period of time, that first of all, that was unreasonable. Do you agree that that period of time was an unreasonable period of time to leave her in your house alone? ACC: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-15\">MJ: Again, without anybody coming in to take care of her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-16\">ACC: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-17\">MJ: And do you agree that potentially, depending upon what might happen\u2014 sometimes little babies can have milk or something, and they can vomit little amounts, or they could potentially, if they\u2019re on their back or their side, or anything like that, choke. Again, that didn\u2019t happen. And you were fortunate, because when you came home the baby was okay. Is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-18\">ACC: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-19\">MJ: But do you agree that during that period of time any number of things potentially could have happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-20\">ACC: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-21\">MJ: I mean, the baby could have needed diapers changed. So you agree that that was then an unreasonable time to leave her, and that that was a disregard for her mental, her physical health, her safety, and her potential welfare?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-22\">ACC: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-23\">MJ: And do you agree that under that circumstance, again, not knowing that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>was going to show up or not, and knowing in the past that he hadn\u2019t shown up, that you were not using the care you should have in ensuring that somebody was going to be there to take care of her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\">ACC: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">MJ: And, again, do you agree that this is more than mere negligence? It\u2019s culpable negligence. That\u2019s more than simple negligence. Do you agree?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">ACC: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">An Article 134 offense that is not specifically listed in the <em>MCM </em>must have words of criminality and provide an accused with notice as to the elements against which he or she must defend. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>26 M.J. 445, 447-48 (C.M.A.1988).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Article 134 states that a specification not listed in the <em>MCM </em>may be used to allege a general offense under <em>MCM, </em>Part IV, at para. 60.e.(6)(c). Here, because the charged offense was not listed in the <em>MCM, </em>the military judge defined the elements herself, without specifying the source of her definitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">In our view, the elements she listed capture the essence of \u201cchild neglect\u201d as reflected in military custom and regulation as well as a majority of state statutes. The military judge correctly determined that child neglect requires culpable negligence and not just simple negligence. She further concluded that such negligence was defined by what was reasonable under the circumstances, i.e., that leaving SK unattended for an \u201cunreasonable time\u201d equated to gross or culpable negligence. Moreover, these are terms in general and common usage within the UCMJ. <em>See </em>e.g., <em>MCM </em>Part IV, at para. 16.b.(3) &amp; c(3) (dereliction in performance of duties); <em>id. </em>at para. 34.c.(3) (improper hazarding of vessel); <em>id. </em>at para. 44.c.(2)(a) (involuntary manslaughter by culpable negligence); <em>id. </em>at para. 80.b.(2) &amp; (e) (firearm, discharging-through negligence); <em>id. </em>at para. <em>85.c.(2) (homicide, </em>negligent). Finally, consistent with a majority of statutes and military custom and regulation, the military judge did not require a showing of harm, but rather an absence of due care measured by an absence of regard for the mental or physical health, safety or welfare of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-14\">This approach is consistent with our conclusion regarding the enumerated offense of maltreatment. <em>United States v. Carson, </em>57 M.J. 410 (C.A.A.F.2002) (finding that prosecution for maltreatment does not require proof of physical or mental harm, rather \u201c[i]t is only necessary to show, as measured from an objective viewpoint in light of the totality of the circumstances, that the accused\u2019s actions reasonably could have caused physical or mental harm or suffering\u201d). Based on the totality of circumstances, the trier of fact must determine whether an accused\u2019s actions reasonably could have caused physical or mental harm or suffering. We do not take issue with the military judge\u2019s conclusion in this ease that Appellant could properly plead to such a possibility in the case of a newborn infant left alone in a crib for six hours in a locked apartment with all the attendant risks of choking, suffocation, or fire. We need go no further in defining the specific elements of the first requirement for an Article 134 offense \u2014 that the accused did or failed to do certain acts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Whether acts or omissions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>amount to \u201cchild neglect\u201d under Article 134, as measured by the elements given above, in another instance will depend on the facts as evaluated by the trier of fact.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, we hold that the elements given by the military judge gave Appellant sufficient notice. The military judge properly defined \u201cchild neglect\u201d as culpably negligent conduct, unreasonable under the totality of the circumstances, that caused a risk of harm to the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">C. <em>Service Discredit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Having found that Appellant was on notice and that the offense of child neglect does not require actual harm to the child, we now look to Appellant\u2019s final contention that her conduct was not, in any event, service-discrediting and, therefore, not an offense under <em>MCM </em>Part IV, at para. 60.b. An unlawful act can serve to establish service discredit. <em>Bivins, </em>49 M.J. at 330 (prosecuting bigamy, even though specified bigamy elements not met); <em>Davis, </em>26 M.J. at 448 (noting that conduct that is generally illegal tends to be discrediting for that very reason). As a result, the Government urges adoption of a per se rule of service discredit in the case of child neglect. However, given the range of conduct that might reasonably be charged under the specified elements above, inter alia, raising questions of fact regarding time, risk, and location, we decline to do so. Whether a given act of \u201cchild neglect\u201d amounts to criminal conduct under Article 134 will invariably present questions of fact for the trier of fact to determine. This will be equally true of the second part of the test: whether the conduct was discrediting. In Appellant\u2019s case, we have no finding of fact because she conditionally plead guilty to the offense. Therefore, we rely on the <em>Care </em>inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">We are satisfied, based on the facts of the case that Appellant\u2019s plea was provident regarding the service-discrediting element of the offense.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Not only did Appellant violate service custom and the norms of many states, her actions while living abroad would not reflect well on the United States military. <em>MCM </em>Part IV, para. 60.c.

If she was, then she could be prosecuted under that Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-21\">In her brief, Appellant argues in the alternative: First, that she was not on notice her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>conduct was subject to prosecution under Article 134, and second, that her conduct was not service-discrediting. The majority accepts these arguments as distinct, and addresses them individually. As to the lack-of-notice argument, the majority recognizes that \u201cchild neglect is not specifically listed in the <em>[Manual for Courts-Martial, United States </em>(2002 ed.) ] as an Article 134 offense,\u201d and that it has to \u201clook elsewhere to determine whether Appellant should have reasonably contemplated that her conduct was subject to criminal sanetion[.]\u201d 58 M.J. at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Looking elsewhere (i.e. \u2014 military case law, 34 state statutes criminalizing child neglect, and DOD regulations evidencing a military custom of protecting dependents), the majority finds that when these sources are \u201caddressed together, Appellant should reasonably have understood that her contemplated conduct was subject to military criminal sanction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">As to the non-service-discrediting argument, the majority states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\"><em>Whether a given act of \u201cchild neglect\u201d amounts to criminal conduct under Article 131 </em>will invariably present questions of fact for the trier of fact to determine. This will be equally true of the <em>second part of the test: whether the conduct was discrediting.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 36 (emphasis added). The majority then concludes \u201cAppellant\u2019s plea was provident regarding the service-discrediting element of the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36. In reaching this conclusion, the majority focuses on the fact that Appellant violated military custom, and did so abroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Thus, the majority clearly states there is a two-part test. First, an accused must be on notice that her conduct can be prosecuted under Article 134. And second, assuming the accused is on notice, her conduct must be service-discrediting. Yet how can an accused (1) be on notice that her conduct is punishable under clause 2 of Article 134, while (2) it still must be determined whether her conduct created the prohibited effect, i.e. \u2014 service-discredit? In my view, that is not possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">Clause 2 of Article 134 punishes only service-discrediting conduct. Therefore, it is impossible to be on notice one\u2019s conduct violates clause 2 of Article 134 without also being on notice the conduct is service-discrediting within the meaning of the statute. Stated differently, there simply is no way the first prong of the majority\u2019s test can be satisfied without the second prong of the test also being satisfied \u2014 and that is because they are intertwined components of the same analysis. I cannot imagine a conclusion by this Court that an accused was on notice his or her conduct could be prosecuted under Article 134, but that the conduct was not service-discrediting.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">Thus, while I agree with the result in this case, I reach that result in a different manner. As stated earlier, the only question is whether Appellant was fairly on notice that her conduct was service-discrediting within the meaning of Article 134. <em>See United States v. Sullivan, </em>42 M.J. 360, 366 (C.A.AF.1995)(whether reasonable officer would know his conduct was service-discrediting); <em>United States v. Guerrero, </em>33 M.J. 295, 297 (C.M.A.1991) (\u201cappellant was on notice that conduct which ... brings discredit upon the Navy is an offense under Article 134.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">To answer that question, it is important first to note that the inquiry is an objective one. It is not whether Appellant was on notice that conduct like hers was service-discrediting under Article 134, but rather, whether a reasonable enlisted person would be on notice that conduct like Appellant\u2019s was service-discrediting and, therefore, was punishable under Article 134. <em>See Sullivan, </em>42 M.J. at 366 (whether \u201creasonable officer\u201d knew the conduct was service-discrediting under Article 134); <em>United States v. Hartwig, </em>39 M.J. 125, 130 (C.M.A.1994)(\u201cAny <em>reasonable officer </em>would recognize that [the conduct in issue] would risk bringing disrepute upon himself and his profession,\u201d in violation of Article 133, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 933.) (emphasis added); <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>34 M.J. 194, 198-99 (C.M.A.1992)(\u201ca <em>reasonable military officer </em>would have no doubt that the activities charged in this case constituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>conduct unbecoming an officer\u201d)(emphasis added &amp; footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Whether a reasonable enlisted person would know that conduct like Appellant\u2019s was service-discrediting within the meaning of Article 134 depends on what \u201cservice-discrediting\u201d means. It means \u201cconduct which has a tendency to bring the service into disrepute or which tends to lower it in public esteem.\u201d <em>Manual for Courts-Martial, supra </em>at Part IV, para. 60.c.(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">As a result, the question finally becomes: Would a reasonable enlisted person fairly be on notice that conduct such as Appellant\u2019s could be punished under Article 134 as tending to bring the service into disrepute or lower it in public esteem? The answer to that is yes, for all the reasons cited by majority, and also because this Court already has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">Article 134 would appear to encompass two general classes of conduct: First, that which is or generally has been recognized as illegal under the common law or under most statutory criminal codes; and, second, that which \u2014 however eccentric or unusual \u2014 would not be viewed as criminal outside the military context. The former category is prejudicial to good order and discipline or is service-discrediting for the very reason that it <em>is </em>(or has been) generally recognized as illegal; such activity, by its unlawful nature, tends to prejudice good order or to discredit the service. On the other hand, the latter category is illegal solely because, <em>in the military context, its effect </em>is to prejudice good order or to discredit the service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-8\"><em>United States v. Davis, </em>26 M.J. 445, 448 (C.M.A.1988). <em>See also United States v. Foster, </em>40 M.J. 140, 143 (C.M.A.1994)(\u201cenumerated articles [of the UCMJ] are rooted in the principle that such conduct per se is either prejudicial to good order and discipline or brings discredit to the armed forces\u201d). Appellant\u2019s conduct clearly falls into the category of \u201cgenerally recognized illegal\u201d conduct and is, therefore, per se service-discrediting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
