Contrary to his pleas, the court-martial found Appellant guilty of four specifications of indecent acts with a minor and one specification of communicating a threat, all in violation of Article 134, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 934. The members sentenced Appellant to confinement for 20 years, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, reduction to pay grade E 1, and a dishonorable discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">On 14 May 1999, the convening authority approved only so much of the sentence as provided for reduction to pay grade E-l, confinement for a period of 20 years, and a dishonorable discharge. Moreover, in a further act of clemency, the convening authority suspended all confinement in excess of 15 years for a period of 15 years from the date sentence was announced. In addition, the convening authority deferred Appellant\u2019s adjudged forfeitures and reduction in rate and waived automatic forfeitures for a period of 6 months from the date of the convening authority\u2019s action to aid Appellant\u2019s dependents.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-12\">We have carefully examined the record of trial and the various briefs and ancillary documents both parties have filed. After careful review, we conclude that the findings and sentence are correct in law and fact and that no error materially prejudicial to the substantial rights of Appellant was committed. <em>See </em>Arts. 59(a) and 66(c), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 859(a) and 866(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-13\">I. Factual Overview</p>\n<p id=\"b697-14\">On the morning of Saturday, 5 September 1998, Appellant was at home with his family in Port Orchard, Washington. He and his wife were working around the home and yard and their children were helping or playing. At one point Appellant asked his adopted, mentally challenged, 13-year-old daughter, E, to join him in the garage. She testified that he fondled her inappropriately. She also testified that, some time later, Appellant committed additional indecent acts with her in the home\u2019s master bedroom and then while they were parked in his pickup truck alongside a two-lane highway some distance away.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-16\">After E told her mother, T, something about these indecent acts, her mother immediately drove all four children in her van to the Naval Hospital at the submarine base nearby. Hospital personnel examined E and, based on what they learned from E and her mother, contacted the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS). Later that same afternoon NCIS Special Agent Connolly contacted Appellant at his home and invited him to his office for an interview. During the interview process, Special Agent Connolly seized certain clothing Appellant was wearing. The shorts and shirts were similar to the clothing T and E had told him Appellant had been wearing that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-17\">During the difficult days that followed, E made various additional statements concerning what had happened to her to medical treatment providers. Prohibited by a court order from returning to his home, Appellant expressed his feelings to some of his friends. One of these statements resulted in the charge of communicating a threat to kill his wife. The command then commenced court-martial proceedings against Appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-18\">II. Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b697-19\">Appellant has filed a total of 14 assignments of error, 12 in his initial brief and an additional two in a brief Appellant filed following a motion this Court granted, over Government objection, to file supplemental assignments of error out of time. We will consider each in the order Appellant has raised them.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-20\">III. Legal Sufficiency</p>\n<p id=\"b697-21\">Appellant first contends that the evidence is legally insufficient as to the Charge and its five specifications. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>The elements of committing an indecent act with a minor are: (a) that the accused committed a certain act upon or with the body of a certain person; (b) that the person was under 16 years of age and not the spouse of the accused; (c) that the act of the accused was indecent; (d) that the accused committed the act with intent to arouse, appeal to, or gratify the lust, passions, or sexual desires of the accused, the victim, or both; and (e) that, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces. Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1998 ed.), Part IV, K 87b(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">The elements of wrongfully communicating a threat are: (a) that the accused communicated certain language expressing a present determination or intent to wrongfully injure the person, property, or reputation of another person, presently or in the future; (b) that the communication was made known to that person or to a third person; (c) that the communication was wrongful; and (d) that, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces. MCM, Part IV, 11110(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The test for legal sufficiency is whether, \u201cconsidering the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a reasonable factfinder could have found\u201d Appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>25 M.J. 324, 324 (C.M.A.1987)(citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). After reviewing the entire quantum of evidence in the record under this test, we have no difficulty concluding that it was legally sufficient to support all of the findings of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">IV. Factual Sufficiency</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Appellant also contends that the evidence adduced at trial is factually insufficient. The test for factual sufficiency requires an even more searching examination of the record. \u201c[AJfter weighing the evidence in the record of trial and making allowances for not having personally observed the witnesses,\u201d this Court must itself be convinced of Appellant\u2019s guilt \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>25 M.J. at 325; <em>see United States v. Sills, </em>56 M.J. 239, 240-41 (2002). The evidence need not be free from all conflict for us to be convinced of an accused\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>55 M.J. 724, 731 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App.2001), <em>rev. denied, </em>56 M.J. 467 (2002). The fact-finder may \u201cbelieve one part of the witness\u2019 testimony and disbelieve another.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>8 M.J. 52, 59 (C.M.A.1979). However, we have applied the \u201ctraditional criminal law standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d to support each element of these offenses. <em>Sills, </em>56 M.J. at 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">IVa. Indecent Acts with a Minor</p>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">Appellant argues that the evidence was factually insufficient to prove that he committed indecent acts with a minor as alleged. After carefully reviewing the evidence, we find that there is ample evidence to support the members\u2019 conclusion that Appellant committed four sets of indecent acts on three separate occasions with his adopted daughter, E.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">E testified at length as to Appellant\u2019s acts of sexual molestation on the morning of 5 September 1998. With respect to the first and second specifications under the Charge, E testified that she went into the garage with Appellant because \u201che told me to.\u201d Record at 383. She testified that Appellant picked her up and had her legs \u201caround him\u201d and that appellant\u2019s hands were \u201caround me.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 384. According to her sworn testimony, Appellant also kissed E by \u201cputting] his tongue in [her] mouth\u201d while in the garage. <em>Id. </em>at 396. E also testified that Appellant twice told her \u201cnot to tell,\u201d and that Appellant\u2019s hands went inside her pants and her \u201cbottom.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 386-87. After going in the house, E told her sister, L, what Appellant had done to her. <em>Id. </em>at 388. When asked why she didn\u2019t tell her mother what happened to her in the garage, E replied, \u201cbecause dad was outside.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">E testified that Appellant committed additional criminal conduct some time later. Appellant came to see E while she was playing in her room. She testified that Appellant told her to come into his room. Appellant and E sat down on the bed and he \u201cunzipped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>his pants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390. When asked what happened, E said \u201che rubbed his dingle ... [w]ith his hand ... [u]p and down.\u201d <em>Id. </em>E also testified that she \u201crubbed his dingle\u201d because \u201che told me to.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When asked if Appellant touched her, E said \u201cyes\u201d and explained that he touched her \u201cin my private part.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">E also testified that later that same morning Appellant took her for a ride in his truck, where he proceeded to molest her further. These actions provided support for Specifications 3 and 4 of the Charge. When E went to get the mail, Appellant offered her a ride in his truck, telling her that he would \u201chelp her get the mail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 394. After E got into Appellant\u2019s truck and the mail was retrieved, he took her to \u201csomeplace where I\u2019ve never been\u201d with \u201ca lot of signs.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Appellant began to touch E \u201cin her private parts\u201d on the \u201cinside\u201d of her shorts and underwear. <em>Id. </em>at 395-96. E specifically stated that Appellant\u2019s hands went \u201cinside her body.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396. Appellant also \u201cundid his pants\u201d and \u201crubbed ... his dingle\u201d until \"yellow stuff came out.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Appellant points to various parts of the record to claim that the evidence was exculpatory. However, after considering his arguments carefully, we remain convinced that the evidence establishes that he committed these indecent acts with his minor adopted daughter beyond a reasonable doubt. In particular, we find that Appellant\u2019s one-line argument that E \u201cdenied\u201d that these incidents took place to be entirely unpersuasive. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Brief at 8. Appellant apparently contends that since E answered \u201cyes\u201d to a series of his civilian attorney\u2019s questions during cross-examination, those answers constitute a denial that the incidents ever occurred. In doing so, Appellant overlooks the highly credible and vivid testimony that E gave during her direct examination. Furthermore, at the time of these so-called \u201cdenials,\u201d civilian defense counsel was asking complex, leading questions of this mildly mentally retarded minor when she was obviously tired of testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">We also note that E\u2019s direct testimony was consistent with her prior disclosures of the abuse to her mother and those who examined her in the hours and days afterwards. There was also DNA evidence implicating Appellant in these sexual assaults. Moreover, Appellant\u2019s actions and statements are consistent with a consciousness of guilt. Appellant and his wife, T, had a conversation just outside the hospital on the afternoon of the incidents. According to his wife\u2019s testimony, she asked, \u201cWhere\u2019d you take [E]?\u201d and \u201cWhat\u2019s this about yellow stuff coming out?\u201d Record at 318-19. After admitting that he had taken E for a ride, pulled over to the side of the road, and talked to her \u201cabout sex,\u201d Appellant expressed concern that, as a result of what he had done, \u201cI\u2019m going to be demoted to E-3.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">Appellant argued at trial and on appeal that, if E\u2019s allegations are correct, his actions would simply not have been reasonable. While we certainly agree that sexual assault of a child is unreasonable, indeed, unconscionable, the way in which Appellant went about it seems consistent with his designs. He first fondled and French kissed his daughter in a portion of a darkened garage. He then asked her not to tell anyone. Although she told her younger sister, L, Appellant did not know this. No doubt emboldened by her apparent silence, Appellant next attempted to have her masturbate him in his bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-12\">L\u2019s testimony that, when she found the two of them alone together in the master bedroom, Appellant turned away to zip up his shorts, is compelling support for E\u2019s version of events. Appellant then drove E away from the house in his truck, a virtually unheard-of break from his normal practice of never taking anyone else in his truck. While Appellant may well have risked discovery by sexually molesting his daughter while parked at the side of a country road, the photographs of the truck, with its canopy shell blocking the back window, hardly convince us that such a discovery was likely. Appellant took pains to tell E repeatedly that she was not to tell anyone what he had done to her. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>After all, her breaking this imposed code of silence was the most likely path to discovery. Appellant also took great pains to show that the sexual assault would have been incredible on the basis that their seat belts were fastened. However, during redirect examination E testified that Appellant was able to get the necessary access to her after each had unbuckled their seatbelts. <em>Id. </em>at 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">Appellant also contends that the reports E made to her mother and medical personnel and her in-court testimony are not credible because she describes Appellant\u2019s ejaculate as \u201cyellow.\u201d E testified that \u201cyellow stuff\u2019 came out of appellant\u2019s \u201cdingle\u201d after they \u201crubbed it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396-97. Furthermore, when asked whether the \u201cyellow stuff\u2019 might have been \u201cpee,\u201d E responded \u201cNo,\u201d explaining that it was \u201cslimy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 398. Appellant argued at trial and now contends on appeal that this makes E\u2019s complaint inherently suspect, because, as is the case with every normal male, Appellant\u2019s ejaculate is white. However, an expert witness testified at trial that male ejaculate is a \u201csubstance that has variable color, usually off-white to slightly yellow ... [a]nd its quite sticky and tenacious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 492. Moreover, even if E is wrong regarding the actual color of Appellant\u2019s ejaculate because of errors in her perception or in her memory, we consider that to be of little consequence. We suspect that describing it as \u201cyellow\u201d and \u201cslimy\u201d is much more consistent with her life experiences than the more precise terms \u201coff-white\u201d and \u201ctenacious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">We have considered all of Appellant\u2019s other arguments as to why the evidence should have raised a reasonable doubt in the minds of the triers of fact and of this Court. After doing so, we find more than sufficient evidence in the record to convince us, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Appellant committed the four specifications of indecent acts with a minor as alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">IVb. Communicating a Threat</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">We also find sufficient factual evidence to support Appellant\u2019s conviction of wrongfully communicating a threat. The evidence is overwhelming that Appellant stated the words in the fifth specification to a third person, Ms. H. The expression of these words was wrongful, not made in jest or for any lawful purpose, and under the circumstances was prejudicial to good order and discipline and of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">Appellant contends that the evidence indicates that, at the time he stated those words, he had no actual \u201cpresent intention of threatening anyone\u201d and that <em>\u201cno </em>alleged \u2018threat\u2019 ever took place.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief of 14 Mar 2002 at 5,11. To support the finding of guilty, Appellant only needed to have made known to a third person a \u201cpresent determination or intent\u201d to injure a person \u201cpresently or in the future.\u201d MCM, Part IV, \u00b6 110b(l). Moreover, as the Explanation in the Manual makes clear, \u201cit is not necessary that the accused actually intended to do the injury threatened.\u201d MCM, Part IV, \u00b6 110c. The military judge properly instructed the members as to these legal requirements. Record at 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">The facts of record convince us of the four elements of this offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Ms. H testified that she had known Appellant for 13 years and that their families were close friends. Record at 508. Their families frequently had \u201cfamily get-togethers, [at] their house or [her] house.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ms. H testified that Appellant came to her house on Sunday, 11 October 1998. <em>Id. </em>at 509. While eating breakfast in the kitchen, Appellant approached her and told her \u201cfor the first time, that he had thought about killing'his wife, and that way his children would be in a loving, foster-caring family, and that he would be in jail.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">Ms. H tried to disregard his comments, hoping that he was not serious. <em>Id. </em>She tried to tell him that he could not do that and that \u201cshe didn\u2019t want to hear anything like that,\u201d but Appellant insisted that he had really thought about it. <em>Id. </em>The conversation reached the point where they were \u201ctalking over each other\u201d and Ms. H repeatedly said \u201cNo, no, you can\u2019t do that.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 509-10. Ms. H described Appellant as \u201cvery upset\u201d and \u201cemotionally upset\u201d during their exchange. <em>Id. </em>at 511. Appellant was behaving erratically, and speaking with \u201cdisconnected\u201d sentences, and she had never seen him behave this way. <em>Id. </em>Appellant went so far as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>to threaten Ms. H by stating that \u201cif I said anything to [T], I would have to kill you.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Ms. H was so concerned about these threats that she could not sleep. After thinking about the conversation for a few days and as a family court hearing approached, she contacted the Schnable family\u2019s minister, Pastor C, and reported it to the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS). After speaking with her, Pastor C, who had known Appellant and his family for 10 years, also called NCIS because of his genuine \u201cconcern\u201d over T\u2019s safety as a result of Appellant\u2019s threats. <em>Id. </em>at 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Appellant argues that, since Ms. H waited 3 days before contacting Pastor C and NCIS, she must have thought that he had merely been \u201cventing\u201d about the situation and he had no \u201cpresent intention of threatening anyone.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief of 14 Mar 2002 at 5. He also notes that the Article 32, UCMJ, investigative officer recommended that this particular specification \u201cbe dismissed as having no factual basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6. However, Appellant only needs to have made known to a third person a \u201cpresent determination or intent\u201d to injure a person \u201cpresently or in the future.\u201d MCM, Part IV, \u00b6 110(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">The fact that Appellant may have not planned to immediately carry out his threat is of no consequence to the matter. At Ms. H\u2019s kitchen table, Appellant manifested an intent to injure Mrs. Schnable at some point in the future. Furthermore, he continued to discuss the matter and even went so far as to threaten Ms. H should she tell Mrs. Schnable. Similarly, the recommendation of the Article 32 officer is not relevant in the determination of the court-martial or this Court as to whether or not the evidence establishes the elements beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">In concluding our review of Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, we find that there is ample evidence for this Court to affirm Appellant\u2019s findings of guilty of each of these offenses beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">V. Seizure of Appellant\u2019s Clothing</p>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">Appellant made a timely motion at trial to suppress certain items of clothing that an NCIS agent had taken from him as evidence on the afternoon of 5 September 1998. After hearing evidence and considering the legal arguments of both sides, the military judge ruled that the evidence was admissible. Record at 100; <em>see </em>Appellate Exhibit XLVI (Findings of Fact.) This adverse ruling gives rise to Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error. After conducting our own review, however, we conclude that the military judge ruled correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-12\">The lawfulness of a search or seizure involves a mixed question of law and fact. <em>See United States v. McCarthy, </em>47 M.J. 162, 165 (1997). In cases involving mixed questions of law and fact, a military judge\u2019s factfinding is reviewed \u201cunder the clearly erroneous standard and conclusions of law under the <em>de novo </em>standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Kelley, </em>45 M.J. 275, 280-81 (1996). To reverse, this Court \u201cmust be \u2018left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Walker, </em>50 M.J. 749, 751 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App.1999)(citing <em>Hernandez v. New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 369, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-13\">Military Rule of Evidence 316, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1998 ed.) governs admissibility on evidence seized in a criminal investigation. The rule states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-14\">(b) <em>Seizure of Property. </em>Probable cause to seize property or evidence exists when there is a reasonable belief that the property or evidence is an unlawful weapon, contraband, evidence of crime, or might be used to resist apprehension or to escape.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-15\">A law-enforcement official or other Government agent may seize property that he or she reasonably believes to be evidence of a crime without first obtaining a search warrant or search authorization under several exceptions. <em>See generally </em>Mil. R. Evid. 316(d). The two exceptions relevant to this case are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>(B) <em>Exigent circumstances. </em>The person has probable cause to seize the property or evidence and under Mil. R. Evid. 315(g) a search warrant or search authorization is not required;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-4\">(C) <em>Plain view. </em>The person while in the course of otherwise lawful activity observes in a reasonable fashion property or evidence that the person has probable cause to seize.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Mil. R. Evid. 316(d)(4)(B); 316(d)(4)(C). Mil. R. Evid. 315(g) specifically exempts a law enforcement officer from obtaining a search authorization when there is \u201ca reasonable belief that the delay necessary to obtain a search warrant or search authorization would result in the removal, destruction, or concealment of the property or evidence sought.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">As the U.S. Supreme Court has observed, \u201c[p]robable cause deals with probabilities.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 241, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983). The standard for probable cause is \u201conly a probability, and not a prima facie showing, of criminal activity ----\u201d <em>Id. </em>After a careful review of the relevant facts, we concur with the military judge\u2019s determination that the NCIS Agent had probable cause to seize Appellant\u2019s clothing as potential evidence of a crime without a warrant, because (1) of exigent circumstances and (2) the evidence was in plain view.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">Ya. Exigent Circumstances</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">The law permits a warrantless seizure of potential evidence when a law-enforcement official has probable cause to seize the material and exigent circumstances exist under Mil. R. Evid. 315(g). Mil. R. Evid. 316(d)(4)(B). Exigent circumstances include when such an officer has a \u201creasonable belief that the delay necessary to obtain a ... search authorization would result in the removal, destruction, or concealment of the property or evidence sought.\u201d Mil. R. Evid. 315(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-14\">In this case, the military judge properly ruled exigent circumstances excused the absence of a search authorization.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Agent Connolly had probable cause to believe Appellant may have sexually abused his adopted daughter. E had stated that Appellant had ejaculated and that he wiped some of the ejaculate off with his t-shirt. The NCIS agent testified that he thought there also may be evidence on the shorts and underwear because \u201c[w]ith ejaculation, it shoots up, and it could go \u2014 land anywhere [because of] seepage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89. He also attempted to contact Appellant\u2019s commanding officer but was unsuccessful until later that evening. Finally, since Appellant was not apprehended at that point, he was free to leave and could have easily destroyed the evidence by washing or disposing of his clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-15\">Vb. Plain View</p>\n<p id=\"b702-16\">There is a second strong legal basis that this evidence was admissible at trial. Mil. R. Evid. 316(d)(4)(C) authorizes seizure by a law enforcement agent, when \u201cwhile in the course of otherwise lawful activity observes in a reasonable fashion property or evidence that the person has probable cause to seize.\u201d The seizing officer must also \u201chave probable cause to believe the item is contraband or evidence of a crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Fogg, </em>52 M.J. 144, 149-50 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-17\">Here, Appellant voluntarily met with the NCIS Agent the afternoon the child sexual abuse offenses were allegedly committed, and was acting in the course of otherwise lawful activity. <em>See </em>Mil. R. Evid. 316(d)(4)(C). Appellant arrived at NCIS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>wearing a red t-shirt and shorts that closely fit the description provided by E and Mrs. Schnable. As discussed, this created probable cause to seize Appellant\u2019s clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">The NCIS agent also had \u201creason to believe that there is a possibility of evidence on ... not just the shirt, but the shorts and the underwear.\u201d Record at 100. Even though E said Appellant wiped his ejaculate with the t-shirt, the NCIS agent had reason to believe that the ejaculate could have landed on other items of clothing due to the expected nature of ejaculation. Furthermore, Mrs. Schnable indicated that after seeing Appellant earlier at the hospital, she did not think he had yet changed his clothes. Once Appellant\u2019s shorts and t-shirt were lawfully seized at the Bangor gym, Appellant\u2019s underwear was in plain view. It was reasonable for the NCIS Agent to anticipate that evidence of ejaculate would also be present on Appellant\u2019s underwear. Accordingly, the seizure of Appellant\u2019s clothing was also lawful under the \u201cplain view\u201d exception to the warrant requirement. Mil. R. Evid. 316(d)(4)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Finally, Appellant argues that the seized clothing should have been suppressed because there is no indication of the age of the semen stains, and no evidence of how it was introduced onto the clothing. We disagree. First, the fact that the age of the semen stains found on Appellant\u2019s clothing goes to the weight, rather than the admissibility, of the evidence. Second, there is ample evidence of how the semen likely was introduced onto the clothing. E testified at length that appellant repeatedly molested her by touching her \u201cprivate parts.\u201d Record at 395-98; <em>see </em>Government\u2019s Brief of 18 Dec 2001 at 5-8. She also testified that Appellant rubbed his penis and also had her rub his penis until he ejaculated and wiped off his ejaculate with his shirt. E\u2019s testimony provides convincing evidence of how Appellant\u2019s semen came to be on his clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">We find that the military judge\u2019s factual findings and the conclusions of law on this issue were entirely correct and that he ruled properly in denying Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence. <em>United States v. Ayala, </em>43 M.J. 296, 298 (1995). Accordingly, we find that the evidence was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">VI. Testimony Concerning the Victim\u2019s Mental Condition</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">In a third assignment of error, Appellant contends that the military judge erred by permitting E\u2019s mother to testify that the victim in this case, her adopted daughter, suffered from a mild degree of mental retardation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">Mil. R. Evid. 701 states that a lay witness may testify to an opinion or inference that is \u201c(a) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (b) helpful to a clear understanding of the testimony of the witness of the determination of a fact in issue.\u201d Mil. R. Evid. 701. The rule imposes two requirements. The first is that the opinion must be rationally based on perceptions of the witness. <em>Id. </em>Finally, that opinion must be helpful to the trier of fact. Stephen A. Saltzburg, et al., Military Rules of Evidence Manual (4th ed.1997) at 830; <em>see </em>Mil. R. Evid. 701. Mrs. Schnable\u2019s testimony regarding E\u2019s retardation satisfies all of these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">First, Mrs. Schnable is a mother of six children who was never employed outside the home during her marriage. E joined Mrs. Schnable\u2019s family after she was adopted when she was 2 years old. At the time of the offenses, E was 13 years of age. Mrs. Schnable testified as to the details of E\u2019s underdeveloped physical and mental conditions when they first adopted her and that she was \u201cdiagnosed with mild retardation.\u201d Record at 301-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-13\">After 4 years of home schooling, E was placed back in a special education program at elementary school. E also suffered from a speech impediment, and had received speech therapy since she was 3 years old. Mrs. Schnable also testified that E was not performing at the same level as her other children in both math and reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-14\">Second, Mrs. Schnable\u2019s opinion is rationally based on these perceptions in her capacity as a mother and a teacher. As the military judge properly noted, you do not have to \u201cbe an expert if you\u2019re a parent who\u2019s been around that child for the length of time that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>[Mrs. Schnable] has and who has been witness to school tests, and other developmental measurements, and medical tests, and other things that come over the course of time ----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 63. Mrs. Schnable was able to form an opinion because she was privy to such facts as the child\u2019s mother and teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Finally, we find that Mrs. Schnable\u2019s testimony on this point was quite helpful to the trier of fact in determining facts at issue. At trial, the members heard the testimony of a 13 year old child who was frequently unable to communicate certain information expected of an average young teenager. She had obvious difficulty understanding some of the questions posed. Without placing her cognitive level into some context, the members might well have misunderstood her situation at the time of the offense and at the time of trial. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>26 M.J. 197, 198-99 (C.M.A.1988). Furthermore, the members were presented with a \u201csmall and short\u201d child who likely did not appear to be 13 years old. Her answers could have easily appeared appropriate for her physical size, but not necessarily her age. For these reasons, E\u2019s level of mental functioning is helpful for the members to assess her credibility, and allowed the members to clearly understand E\u2019s testimony. It also helped explain inconsistencies in her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Appellant argues that \u201c[r]etardation is the subject of an expert witness under Mil. R. Evid. 702 and should [sic] have been done in this case.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief of 14 Mar 2002 at 15. Appellant\u2019s reliance on this rule is misplaced. Mil. R. Evid. 702 permits a witness qualified as an expert to testify in a particular area if \u201cscientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence____\u201d Mil. R. Evid. 702. The key question in determining the appropriateness of the expert testimony is whether it would \u201cassist the trier of fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Kyles, </em>20 M.J. 571, 575 (N.M.C.M.R.1985). Mrs. Schnable did not attempt to describe or express an expert opinion as to E\u2019s level of impairment. <em>Compare Jones, </em>26 M.J. at 198-200 (noting that testimony about how a mentally retarded person would react under questioning during an interview is the proper subject of expert opinion testimony under Mil. R. Evid, 702). She simply testified to matters that she had observed, and on the basis of facts known to her as E\u2019s mother. An expert in this field was neither justified nor required under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">We conclude that the military judge did not abuse his discretion by allowing Mrs. Schnable to make reference to her daughter\u2019s mental retardation. <em>Kyles, </em>20 M.J. at 575. Accordingly, we find that Appellant is entitled to no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-12\">VII. Exclusion of Videotape Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b704-13\">In a fourth assignment of error, Appellant contends that the military judge erred to his substantial prejudice by barring the introduction of a videotape defense counsel had developed in preparing for trial. This videotape purported to show the route Appellant told his counsel he had taken with E and the place they had parked on the morning in question. He wanted to introduce it before the members to help prove his theory that there were far more secluded places to molest his child than on the side of a busy highway. On the facts of this case, we find that the military judge ruled correctly-</p>\n<p id=\"b704-14\">A videotape is considered a \u201cphotograph\u201d under the Military Rules of Evidence. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>55 M.J. 433, 438 (2001); <em>see </em>Mil. R. Evid. 1002. Consequently, the admissibility of a videotape is governed by the same rules and principles regarding authentication of photographs in Mil. R. Evid. 901. <em>Harris, </em>55 M.J. at 438-39. By ensuring that a proper foundation is laid or that a document is properly authenticated, the military judge is guaranteeing that the court members could find that particular evidence is what it purports to be. Mil. R. Evid. 901(a). A military judge\u2019s ruling on whether to admit evidence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. McElhaney, </em>54 M.J. 120, 129 (2000); <em>see Harris, </em>55 M.J. at 438 (videotape evidence). A reviewing court will not set aside a trial court\u2019s ruling unless it has a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that it was a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Houser, </em>36 M.J. 392, 397 (C.M.A.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>In this case, Appellant wanted to admit a videotape purportedly filmed along the roadway where E was alleged to have been sexually abused. The purpose of the videotape was to try and demonstrate to the members that Appellant would more likely have \u201cpulled off the roadway into areas of extreme privacy if he were at all prone to do an indecent act towards a child.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief of 14 Mar 2002 at 17; <em>see </em>Record at 727. This videotape was filmed by civilian defense counsel and trial defense counsel in February 1999, apparently following a route Appellant had shown them. Civilian defense counsel unsuccessfully sought to admit the tape based on his own representation that \u201che was told [by Appellant] that was the route.\u201d Record at 781. Appellant now claims that the videotape should have been admitted under \u201cMil. R. Evid. 802(24) or 804,\u201d and that he \u201cshould not have to take the stand\u201d in order to have the evidence admitted. Appellant\u2019s Brief of 14 Mar 2002 at 17. This argument is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The military judge excluded the videotape at trial because Appellant had failed to lay a proper foundation that authenticated the videotape\u2019s contents.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant must put on evidence sufficient to support a finding that the contents of the videotape are what he claims them to be. Mil. R. Evid. 901(a). In this case, Appellant could only make this showing via the testimony of a witness with knowledge that the contents of the videotape depict a particular scene. Mil. R. Evid. 901(a)(b)(l). The only \u201cwitnesses with knowledge\u201d would be the only people in the truck on the morning of the offense \u2014 E and Appellant. E was unable to testify as to a specific route or location. Record at 394 (stating only that Appellant took her \u201csomeplace where [she had] never been\u201d with \u201csigns\u201d and \u201ccars\u201d). Of course, Appellant had the opportunity to establish the videotape\u2019s foundation by testifying, but exercised his right not to do so. Therefore, Appellant failed to demonstrate that the videotape fairly and accurately depicted the purported path that he drove with E. <em>Reichart, </em>31 M.J. at 523. The admissibility of the videotape under Mil. R. Evid. 803(24) or 804 has no consequence because the military judge did not exclude Appellant\u2019s evidence on hearsay grounds. Record at 730-31; Appellant\u2019s Brief of 14 Mar 2002 at 17. Furthermore, Appellant did not seek admission of any videotaped statements or assertions, but a route that he had allegedly driven on the morning in question. Therefore, review under the hearsay evidence rules is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">Appellant could have introduced evidence, including testimony and photographic recordings of secluded areas near his home to make his point, that there were more secretive areas within a short drive of his home where he might have molested his daughter had he been prone to do so. The military judge never limited Appellant\u2019s introduction of evidence to this effect. He merely barred the introduction of a videotape based on representations from Appellant\u2019s counsel that it replicated the route Appellant and E took that morning. The members were quite aware, based on other evidence adduced at trial, that there were secluded places to drive and park in the vicinity of Appellant\u2019s home. Appellant\u2019s counsel had no trouble arguing this very point to the members. We find that this videotape was not crucial to establishing this defense theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">We find that the military judge\u2019s exclusion of the videotape was not error. Rather, it demonstrates the military judge\u2019s sound understanding of the rules of evidence. We conclude that the decision to exclude the videotape as offered was quite correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">VIII. Admissibility of Exculpatory Statements Appellant Made to His Pastor</p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">In a fifth assignment of error, Appellant contends that the military judge erred when he denied his request to have his pastor testify that, during a counseling session after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>the incident in question, Appellant had made certain exculpatory statements. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Hearsay is defined as a \u201cstatement, other than the one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Mil. R. Evid. 801(c). Appellant sought to offer statements he had made to Pastor C, apparently denying that he had ever sexually abused E. These statements would clearly qualify as hearsay since: (1) they had been made out of court; and (2) Appellant offered them for the truth of the matter asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Appellant\u2019s statements to his pastor constitute self-serving hearsay. Unless required by \u201cthe rule of completeness in Rule 304(h)(2),\u201d <em>United States v. Gilbride, </em>56 M.J. 428, 430 (2002), \u201ca self-serving, exculpatory declaration made by an accused is hearsay and inadmissible in evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Condron, </em>17 C.M.A. 367, 372, 38 C.M.R. 165, 170, 1968 WL 5360 (1968)(Quinn, C.J. dissenting)(citing <em>United States v. Harvey, 8 </em>C.M.A. 538, 25 C.M.R. 42, 1957 WL 4645 (C.M.R.1957)).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">In the instant case, Appellant sought to introduce his denial of wrongdoing through the testimony of Pastor C, instead of actually taking the stand himself. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Brief of 14 Mar 2002 at 20 (conceding that Appellant \u201cwanted his statements admitted, not a belief or opinion\u201d). This is precisely the type of inadmissible hearsay that the rule prohibits. <em>See </em>Mil. R. Evid. 801(c). Indeed, if this type of evidence were admissible at trial, any accused could put his exculpatory \u201cside of the story\u201d before the court-martial, while avoiding cross-examination, by telling what he wanted the Court to hear to a clergyman or other trustworthy person, and then having that person testify at trial on his behalf. The military judge did not abuse \u201chis wide discretion\u201d in barring the introduction of this evidence. <em>United States v. Redmond, </em>21 M.J. 319, 326 (C.M.A.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">IX. Admissibility of Statements Made to Medical Personnel</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">In a sixth assignment of error, Appellant contends that the military judge erred when he permitted a nurse, Ms. Graf, to testify as to what E had told her during a sexual assault examination she conducted, and an investigator, Ms. Conrad, to testify as to the circumstances surrounding E\u2019s initial interview. Once again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">As discussed above, hearsay offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted is generally inadmissible. Mil. R. Evid. 801(c) and 802. However, under the \u201cmedical exception\u201d to the hearsay rules, the Military Rules of Evidence provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-11\">The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-12\">(4) <em>Statements for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment. </em>Statements made for the purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment and describing medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external source thereof insofar as reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-13\">Mil. R. Evid. 803(4); <em>see generally United States v. Haner, </em>49 M.J. 72, 76 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-14\">Whether a statement is admissible under this rule depends on the state of mind of the declarant; the guarantee of reliability is premised on the assumption that a patient seeking diagnosis or treatment from a doctor will tell the truth to receive the best possible medical diagnosis and treatment. <em>United States v. Faciane, </em>40 M.J. 399, 403 (C.M.A. 1994). The timing of the medical examination is usually not a factor in determining the admissibility of the statements under Rule 803(4), even where there has been a significant lapse of time. <em>See United States v. Whitted, </em>11 F.3d 782, 787 (8th Cir.1993)(finding a victim\u2019s statements to a physician admissible under medical exception where examination was \u201cnearly three years after the last alleged act of abuse\u201d). Similarly, the fact that the declarant was referred to the medical examination by law enforcement is not a significant factor in determining admissibility under the rule. <em>Haner, </em>49 M.J. at 76 (observing: \u201cThe fact that [the beaten wife] was referred to the hospital [by the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>attorney who wanted injuries documented for prosecution] is not a critical factor in deciding whether the medical exception applies to the statements she made to those treating her.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">In applying the medical exception, our superior Court has only required that evidence offered under Mil. R. Evid. 803(4) satisfy a two-pronged test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">\u201c[F]irst the statements must be made for the purposes of \u2018medical diagnosis or treatment\u2019 and second, the patient must make the statement \u201cwith some expectation of receiving medical benefit for the medical diagnosis or treatment that is being sought.\u201d A key factor in determining whether the second prong is met is \u201cthe state of mind or motive of the patient in giving the information ... and the expectation or perception of the patient that if he or she gives truthful information, it will help him or her to be healed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-7\"><em>Faciane, </em>40 M.J. at 403 (quoting <em>United States v. Edens, </em>31 M.J. 267, 269 (C.M.A. 1990)); <em>see also United States v. Ureta, </em>44 M.J. 290, 297 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">Regarding the second prong, it is well-settled that child sexual abuse cases may require the traditional adult standards to be relaxed when applied to very young victims. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Quigley, </em>40 M.J. 64, 66 (C.M.A.1994); <em>Edens, </em>31 M.J. at 269 (affirming a conviction for child sexual abuse and acknowledging that, regarding the requirement of making the statement with some expectation of receiving medical treatment, \u201cthere may be some relaxing of the quantum of proof in those situations where a child is being treated.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">Appellant argues that the military judge erred by allowing Ms. Graf to testify because her testimony does not satisfy \u201cany of the exceptions to the hearsay rule.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief of 14 Mar 2002 at 21. He is mistaken. To the contrary, the military judge\u2019s ruling was well-supported by the testimony in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">The statements E made to Ms. Graf during her medical evaluation were clearly made for the purpose of medical treatment or diagnosis. <em>Ureta, </em>44 M.J. at 297; Mil. R. Evid. 803(4). E was evaluated at a sexual assault clinic in a hospital setting that handles follow-up evaluations for victims of alleged sexual abuse. E\u2019s mother testified that she \u201cknew what a hospital is for\u201d because the family has so many children with many \u201cbroken arms and sicknesses.\u201d Record at 318. Mrs. Schnable also explained that when she goes to the hospital, E \u201cknows they\u2019re there to help her and get better.\u201d <em>Id. </em>E explicitly indicated this understanding when she testified that you \u201cgo to doctors ... [w]hen you\u2019re sick,\u201d and \u201cgo to nurses ... [w]hen you\u2019re hurt.\u201d Record at 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-12\">Furthermore, Ms. Graf testified that she identified herself as a \u201cspecial kind of nurse who looks at children in a very special way.\u201d Record at 530. Ms. Graf also explained to E that she would take a medical history, conduct an examination, and provide treatment to her if necessary. <em>Id. </em>at 533. E\u2019s evaluation was conducted in an \u201cactual medical examination room\u201d in a hospital environment. <em>Id. </em>at 534. As such, the military judge properly found that E made these statements with \u201can expectation of medical treatment,\u201d and that \u201cshe knew it was to promote her well-being.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537. Consequently, both prongs of the medical exception to the hearsay rule were satisfied. <em>Ureta, </em>44 M.J. at 297; Mil. R. Evid. 803(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-13\">After applying all of the relevant principles of law to the factual situation developed at trial, the military judge ruled that Ms. Grafs testimony was admissible. We see no reason to disturb this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-14\">Finally, Appellant argues that Ms. Conrad\u2019s testimony also should have been suppressed <em>sua sponte </em>because her \u201ctestimony is not allowed under any exceptions to the hearsay rule.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief of 14 Mar 2002 at 21. Appellant\u2019s argument is flawed because Ms. Conrad did not testify about any hearsay statements that E made to her during her interview. <em>See </em>Record at 622-27 (indicating an absence of testimony as to any statements E made to Ms. Conrad). Instead, Ms. Conrad was called on for the purpose of explaining how her interview of E was conducted. Trial counsel recognized that E\u2019s statements to Ms. Conrad would be barred by the hearsay rule, and only called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>her to clarify how E was referred to Ms. Graf. Moreover, the Government properly called Ms. Conrad to rebut allegations of witness contamination Appellant\u2019s civilian defense counsel had made. <em>See id. </em>at 575, 585. Finally, we note that Appellant never objected to Ms. Conrad\u2019s testimony. Accordingly, Appellant has not shown that the military judge abused his discretion in letting the members hear this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">X. Sentence Appropriateness</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">In a seventh assignment of error, Appellant contends that his sentence is inappropriately severe. We disagree. While our experience with cases of this kind indicates that this sentence is more severe than most, we find that it was not so harsh as to demand judicial relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">A court-martial is free to impose any legal sentence that it determines is appropriate. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>14 C.M.A. 435, 437, 34 C.M.R. 215, 217, 1964 WL 4998 (1964); R.C.M. 1002. On review, a court of criminal appeals \u201cmay affirm only such findings of guilty and the sentence or such part or amount of the sentence as it finds correct in law and fact and determines, on the basis of the entire record, should be approved.\u201d Article 66(c), UCMJ. Courts of criminal appeals are tasked with determining sentence appropriateness vice clemency. Clemency, which involves bestowing mercy, is the prerogative of the convening authority. <em>United States v. Healy, </em>26 M.J. 394, 395-96 (C.M.A.1988); R.C.M. 1107(b). An appropriate sentence results from an \u201cindividualized consideration\u201d based on \u201cthe nature and seriousness of the offense and the character of the offender.\u201d <em>United States v. Rojas, </em>15 M.J. 902, 919 (N.M.C.M.R.1983)(citing <em>United States v. Snelling, </em>14 M.J. 267 (C.M.A.1982)), <em>aff'd, </em>20 M.J. 330 (C.M.A.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">In this case, Appellant sexually molested his 13-year-old daughter four times in three separate episodes on the same morning. Several days later he communicated a threat that he was thinking about killing his wife. Indeed, while he was telling his neighbor what he was thinking, Appellant threatened Ms. H\u2019s life should she tell Mrs. Sehnable of their conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">Appellant argues that the \u201csentence imposed by the members of 20 years confinement is in itself crazy.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief of 14 Mar 2002 at 21 (later in his brief Appellant argues \u201cTHIS IS AN OUTRAGE IN ITSELF WITH THE MEMBERS RUNNING AMOK.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22.) To the contrary, Appellant received the degree of punishment the members considered appropriate based on these unconscionable offenses. Furthermore, the members, in adjudging an appropriate sentence, and the convening authority, in approving the sentence, obviously considered the fact that Appellant was a chief petty officer at the time of the offenses. Charge Sheet. Indeed, the premise that senior enlisted personnel may be held to a higher standard of accountability for their conduct than junior enlisted members is well-established in military law. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>22 M.J. 40, 41 (C.M.A.1986). This is not \u201crunning amok.\u201d The sentence was based on the members\u2019 evaluation of the nature of the offenses and the character of the offender. <em>See Snelling, </em>14 M.J. at 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">Additionally, we note that the convening authority granted extensive clemency to Appellant. He suspended all confinement in excess of 15 years, deferred and disapproved adjudged forfeitures, deferred the adjudged reduction in rate, and waived automatic forfeitures for the maximum period the law allows. <em>See </em>Convening Authority\u2019s Action of 14 May 1999 at 2. Clemency is the prerogative of the convening authority, not this Court. <em>Healy, </em>26 M.J. at 395-96; R.C.M. 1107(b). Appellant\u2019s assignment of error simply amounts to another request for clemency, which we are neither inclined nor authorized to grant. We find that no further relief is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-12\">XI. Unsuccessful Request to Enter An <em>Alford </em>Plea</p>\n<p id=\"b708-13\">In an eighth assignment of error, Appellant contends that the military judge erred when he refused Appellant\u2019s request to enter a plea in which he did not admit guilt under <em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>agree; the military judge properly applied the appropriate principles of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Article 45(a), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 845, makes clear that such a plea is not authorized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-6\">If an accused after arraignment makes an irregular pleading, or after a plea of guilty sets up a matter inconsistent with the plea, or if it appears that he has entered the plea of guilty improvidently or through lack of understanding of its meaning and effect, ... a plea of not guilty shall be entered in the record, and the court shall proceed as though he had pleaded not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">In other words, Article 45(a), UCMJ, is a \u201ccodal mandate to reject a guilty plea if the accused \u2018sets up [a] matter inconsistent with the <em>plea____United States v. Roane, </em>43 M.J. 93, 98 (1995). Accordingly, the military judge cannot accept a plea of guilty, and must enter a not guilty plea, whenever an accused makes any declaration that amounts to a claim of innocence. Art. 45(a), UCMJ; <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>43 C.M.R. 945, 952, 1971 WL 12912 (A.F.C.M.R.1971). R.C.M. 910(a)(1) lists the authorized pleas available to an accused at court-martial; <em>Alford </em>pleas are not included. R.C.M. 910(a). Furthermore, the Discussion to that rule clarifies that an irregular plea is one \u201csuch as guilty without criminality.\u201d R.C.M. 910(b), Discussion. Our superior Court has specifically stated that \u201c[t]here may not be an [Alford] plea in the military.\u201d <em>United States v. Figura, </em>44 M.J. 308, 309 (1996)(citing <em>United States v. Epps, </em>25 M.J. 319, 321 (C.M.A. 1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">Appellant nonetheless reasserts his claim that he has a right to plead guilty without acknowledging criminality, suggesting that his position is bolstered by the decision in <em>United States v. Davis, </em>50 M.J. 426 (1999). <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Brief of 14 Mar 2002 at 23-28. The holding in <em>Davis, </em>although reiterating the prohibition against accepting a confessional stipulation as part of a pretrial agreement not to raise any defense, <em>United States v. Bertelson, </em>3 M.J. 314, 317 (C.M.A. 1977), was that the appellant \u201cwas not deprived of due process under the specific facts of this ease.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>50 M.J. at 430. Essen- , tially, Appellant now seeks to have his case remanded so he can plead not guilty and enter into a confessional stipulation of testimony establishing his guilt. However, his reliance on <em>Davis </em>is misplaced. Appellant was always able to enter into a confessional stipulation of testimony. <em>Bertelson, </em>3 M.J. at 316-17. <em>See </em>R.C.M. 811(c), Discussion. And, contrary to Appellant\u2019s assertion, our superior Court held that the specific pretrial agreement in <em>Davis </em>was error. <em>Davis, </em>50 M.J. at 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-13\">Finally, even if this case were remanded, it is by no means certain that the convening authority would be inclined to enter into a pretrial agreement. See Appellant\u2019s Brief of 14 Mar 2002 at 24. And although Appellant claims his primary concern is family unity, the victim has already testified against Appellant during this contested court-martial. Thus, the \u201cdamage\u201d to Appellant\u2019s family from his adopted daughter having to testify has already been done. No one can undo that damage. Furthermore, if protecting his family\u2019s unity was indeed Appellant\u2019s primary concern, nothing prevented him from pleading not guilty at his court-martial and stipulating to the expected testimony of his daughter. Accordingly, we again deny Appellant\u2019s request for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-14\">XII. Additional Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b709-15\">We have carefully examined each of the next four assignments of error Appellant submitted under <em>United States v. Grostefon, </em>12 M.J. 431 (C.M.A.1982). We find each to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-16\">Our superior Court has held that Article 25, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 825, and R.C.M. 912(b)(2) are a constitutional part of the military justice system. <em>United States v. Lov</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number><em>ing, </em>41 M.J. 213, 291 (1994); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>27 M.J. 242, 248 (C.M.A.1988) (citing <em>Ex Parte Quirin, </em>317 U.S. 1, 40, 63 S.Ct. 1, 2, 87 L.Ed. 3 (1942)); <em>United States v. Santiago-Davila, </em>26 M.J. 380, 389 (C.M.A.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">We are unpersuaded that the military judge did anything other than properly exercise his discretion when he limited Appellant\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>of the members. <em>See United States v. Belflower, </em>50 M.J. 306, 307, 309 (1999); R.C.M. 912(d), Discussion. On the facts presented, he merely took the steps necessary to exercise appropriate and efficacious \u201ccontrol over the proceedings.\u201d R.C.M. 801(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Despite the strident allegations contained in Appellant\u2019s brief, we are fully confident, based on our independent review of the record, that the military judge maintained an impartial attitude with respect to these proceedings. He made appropriate evidentiary and other rulings and reigned in counsel on both sides as necessary. When he examined witnesses, it was usually done to meet his responsibility to pose questions from members of the court-martial. We find that when the military judge posed questions on his own, it was merely to clarify testimony and to impartially develop relevant and helpful facts, not to promote a prosecutorial agenda.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">In his final <em>Grostefon </em>assignment of error, Appellant contends that the military judge denied him adequate time to prepare a ease in sentencing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">Appellant and his counsel had several months to prepare a sentencing case, including \u201cletters from [Appellant\u2019s] family.\u201d Record at 830. Following the guilty findings, the military judge offered Appellant as much as \u201can hour\u201d to finalize his sentencing case. <em>Id. </em>at 831. In response, Appellant\u2019s civilian defense counsel only requested \u201ca half hour\u201d to do so. <em>Id. </em>In fact, the sentencing phase proceeded without any further expression of concern after a 40-minute recess. <em>Id. </em>at 833. Moreover, Appellant was apparently able to obtain the exhibits he wanted to submit during the recess. <em>See id. </em>at 835; Defense Exhibits O, P, and Q. All were admitted into evidence. Record at 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">XIII. Supplemental Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">This Court granted Appellant\u2019s motion to file two additional assignments of error out of time. Both are based on an allegation, raised for the first time over 3 years after the trial adjourned, that, in spite of what it says in the authenticated record of trial, the military judge erroneously instructed the members not to discuss the case with defense counsel. After a careful reading of all that both sides have submitted on these two issues, we see no basis to grant relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">The trial counsel reviewed and the military judge authenticated the record of trial less than a month after this court-martial adjourned. Record at 859. According to the signature of the supervisory court reporter, a copy of this record was made available for examination by the defense on 5 March 1999. <em>Id. </em>In every respect, the record appears to be what it purports to be, a verbatim transcription of the general court-martial proceeding in Appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">In a \u201cdeclaration\u201d attached to his motion, Appellant\u2019s civilian defense counsel, who represented Appellant at trial and continues to do so on appeal, states that he and the military defense counsel \u201clooked at each other incredulously\u201d when the military judge provided the members with their final instructions. Motion for Leave to File Supplemental Assignment of Error of 25 July 2002 at 2, K 3. However, neither counsel raised the issue on the record or at any subsequent point for a period of 3 years. Yet Appellant and his civilian defense counsel now contend that he is somehow entitled to dismissal of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">Before dismissing the members and based on the authenticated record of trial, the military judge instructed the members as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-13\">You took an oath at the beginning not to disclose your vote or opinion or that of any other member, and you\u2019re held to that vote. So you cannot disclose your vote or opinion, or that of any other member. You <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>can, however, if you want, discuss other aspects of this case, as long as it isn\u2019t your vote or opinion, or that of any other member. You can choose not to discuss this with anyone. That\u2019s certainly your right. But if you do discuss it with anyone, those are the limits, your \u2014 not your vote or opinion, and not that of any member.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Record at 857. This instruction was in accordance with Mil. R. Evid. 606(b), requiring the deliberations of the members remain confidential. \u201c[I]mproper invasion into the court members\u2019 deliberations [goes] to the very heart of the trial process .... \u201d <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>42 M.J. 484, 487 (1995). \u201cThe purpose of this rule is to protect \u2018freedom of deliberation,\u2019 protect \u2018the stability and finality of verdicts,\u2019 and protect court members \u2018from annoyance and embarrassment.\u2019\u201d <em>Loving, </em>41 M.J. at 236 (quoting <em>United States v. Bishop, </em>11 M.J. 7, 9 (C.M.A. 1981)). Thus, the military judge\u2019s concluding instruction to the members prior to dismissing them was proper.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Additionally, pursuant to Article 54(a), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 854(a), the military judge authenticated the record of trial. \u201cBefore authentication by the military judge, a copy of this record was made for examination by the defense.\u201d Record at 859. \u201cThe record should reflect that the defense counsel was given such an opportunity or why not.\u201d <em>United States v. Munoz, </em>54 M.J. 917, 918 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App.2001); <em>see </em>R.C.M. 1103(i)(l)(B). Defense counsel was also served with the authenticated record of trial by mail on 19 March 1999. Recommendation of the Staff Judge Advocate of 26 Mar 1999 at 3. \u201cSubstantial matters were then submitted by the appellant through his counsel. No objection to the contents of the record was made.\u201d <em>Munoz, </em>54 M.J. at 918; <em>see also </em>Art. 38(c), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 838(c); Petition for Clemency of 22 Apr 1999; R.C.M. 1104(d). We conclude that the Appellant forfeited any objection to the contents of the authenticated record of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Indeed, we are quite comfortable with the presumption that the record of trial properly reflected what actually took place. Appellant does not point to any irregularity in the record to rebut that presumption. The record of trial was properly authenticated. We see no basis to question its accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the military judge did instruct the members not to discuss their verdict with either counsel, Appellant would still not be entitled to relief. That would have been a proper instruction. An appellant does not have a right to question members \u201cconcerning their conduct during the proceedings and deliberations.\u201d <em>United States v. Lambert, </em>55 M.J. 293, 296 (2001); <em>see </em>R.C.M. 1007(c)(as a general rule, \u201cmembers may not ... be questioned about their deliberations and voting.\u201d). As this Court has observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-10\">We are aware that military justice sections, the Navy-Marine Corps Trial Judiciary, and the Judge Advocate General of the Navy may advocate use of post-trial surveys of members as a training tool for trial advocates. We are concerned that such inquiries, though well-meaning, may inadvertently improperly invade the deliberative process of the court-martial. Where such surveys are conducted, they should be carefully limited to objective matters which relate to trial advocacy. Inquiries into the members\u2019 subjective perceptions of the evidence risk creating appellate issues unnecessarily.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-11\"><em>United States v. Ovando-Moran, </em>44 M.J. 753, 756 n. 2 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App.1996). Only after a showing of a proper ground to impeach the verdict may an inquiry be conducted. <em>Lambert, </em>55 M.J. at 295. The trial court has wide discretion in determining whether to investigate the members regarding their verdict and what kind of investigation to make. <em>Id. </em>Here, Appellant does not allege any proper grounds pursuant to Mil. R. Evid. 606(b) to impeach the members verdict. He simply feels he has a right to question them to see if such a ground exists. To allow any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>appellant such unfettered access to the members\u2019 verdict would serve to invade the freedom of deliberation, undermine the stability and finality of verdicts, and subject the members to annoyance and embarrassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">For all these reasons, therefore, we conclude that Appellant\u2019s two supplemental assignments of error are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">XIY. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the findings and sentence, as approved on review below.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Judge VILLEMEZ and Judge HARRIS concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b699-7\">. This incident occurred over Labor Day weekend in the middle of the 1998 general election campaign. According to other evidence, political signs could be found in profusion displayed along the sides of area roads.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b701-9\">. Although this statement itself constitutes uncharged misconduct, the evidence was admissible as part of the <em>res gestae, </em>the circumstances surrounding the charged offense. <em>See United States v.

The military judge also concluded that this clothing was admissible as evidence on the basis of \"inevitable discovery\u201d under Mil. R. Evid. 311(b)(2). Appellate Exhibit XLVI at 1, 3. While we agree that this is true, the more applicable theories on these facts are these two.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b702-12\">. Specifically, the military judge found \"given the circumstances surrounding the fact that these are shorts, the evidence is evidence that could be washed away easily. But there is certainly an issue of as to whether there could be destruction of evidence. Whether there's a reasonable belief, I think that\u2019s evident given the circumstances concerning the agent\u2019s understanding.... [H]e has fairly well established the fact that his belief was at the time that he had a suspect, that he had a victim, that he had reason to believe that there would be evidence found on the shirt, and by his own analysis, potentially the shorts and the underwear. So I think the Government has at least made a case concerning the concept of exigent circumstances.\u201d Record at 97. <em>See also </em>Appellate Exhibit XLVI at 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b705-6\">. The military judge stated: \"I have told you that this was going to be a problem since the moment you mentioned this videotape, so this particular evidentiary hurdle shouldn't be new to you, and you have told me that you understand that the only way this tape\u2019s going to come in is if someone is testifying or there\u2019s some evidence that this was the route that was taken. And I have capsulized for you the state of the evidence as I remember it concerning the route, and it in no way suggests that any tape you would show was the route that was taken.\u201d Record at 730.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b708-8\">. Appellant petitioned this Court on two prior occasions with respect to this issue. First, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>requested extraordinary relief to allow him to plead guilty by means of an <em>Alford </em>plea. We denied relief and characterized Appellant\u2019s claim as \"wholly inaccurate.\u201d <em>United States v. Schnable, </em>NMCCA Order, No. 99-0195 (N.M.Ct.Crim. App. 5 Feb. 1999). Second, Appellant moved for Summary Reversal of his convictions based on the decision in <em>United States v. Davis, </em>50 M.J. 426 (1999). We denied Appellant's requested relief. <em>United States v. Schnable, </em>NMCCA Order, No. 99-0852 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App. 30 Mar. 2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b711-7\">.
