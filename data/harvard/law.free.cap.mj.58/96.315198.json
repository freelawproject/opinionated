The convening authority approved the sentence of a bad-conduct discharge, 18 months\u2019 confinement, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings and sentence. <em>United States v. Gogas, </em>55 M.J. 521 (A.F.Ct.Crim. App.2001). We granted review of the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-7\">I. WHETHER THE AIR FORCE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING THAT A LETTER APPELLANT WROTE TO HIS CONGRESSMAN (PROSECUTION EXHIBIT 9), IN WHICH APPELLANT COMPLAINED OF HIS TREATMENT BY AIR FORCE AUTHORITIES, WAS PROPERLY ADMITTED IN EVIDENCE DURING THE SENTENCING PHASE OF HIS COURT-MARTIAL WHERE 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1034 (2002) PROHIBITS RETALIATION AGAINST SER-VICEMEMBERS WHO COMPLAIN TO CONGRESS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-8\">II. WHETHER THE AIR FORCE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING THAT PROSECUTION EXHIBIT 9 WAS PROPERLY ADMISSIBLE IN SENTENCING UNDER RULE FOR COURTS-MARTIAL 1001 AS A MATTER IN AGGRAVATION AND AS A MATTER RELATED TO APPELLANT\u2019S REHABILITATION POTENTIAL.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AYG\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">On January 27, 2000, Appellant confessed to using LSD on approximately 20 occasions. During sentencing, the Government introduced, without objection, records of two instances of nonjudicial punishment under Article 15, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 815 (2002). One was for Appellant\u2019s underage possession of alcoholic beverages, and the second for Appellant\u2019s failure to go to an appointed place of duty. The Government also successfully introduced three letters of reprimand for Appellant\u2019s minor disciplinary infractions.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-13\">In addition to personnel records, the Government offered a letter, dated May 11, 2000, that Appellant wrote to a Congressman requesting assistance with Appellant\u2019s impending court-martial. In the letter, Appellant recounted his \u201cjourney down the road of self-destruction,\u201d and linked it to his repeated failures to appear for work and to other disciplinary infractions. Appellant complained that the criminal charges had damaged his reputation at work, and argued that the charges were not provable because there was no physical evidence, only witness testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-14\">Defense counsel objected to the letter, arguing that it was not admissible as a matter in aggravation under Rule for Courts-Martial [hereinafter R.C.M.] 1001(b)(4), or as opinion evidence of rehabilitative potential under R.C.M. 1001(b)(5). The Government argued that Appellant\u2019s views in the letter about whether he should be prosecuted for the offenses were evidence of a lack of rehabilitative potential. The military judge concluded that the letter was admissible aggravation evidence because it related to the crimes in question, and that it was relevant to Appellant\u2019s rehabilitative potential.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-15\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b157-16\">I. The Government did not Retaliate Against Appellant</p>\n<p id=\"b157-17\">Appellant claims that his sentence, aggravated by the use of his letter as evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>qualified as an unfavorable personnel action designed to punish him for writing the letter. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Title 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1034(a)(1) provides that \u201c[n]o person may restrict a member of the armed forces in communicating with a Member of Congress or an Inspector General!.]\u201d The statute further dictates that \u201c[n]o person may take (or threaten to take) an unfavorable personnel action, or withhold (or threaten to withhold) a favorable personnel action, as a reprisal against a member of the armed forces for making or preparing ... a communication to a Member of Congress or Inspector General.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1034(b)(1)(A). The Supreme Court has highlighted the statute\u2019s purpose \u201cto let every man in the armed services have the privilege of writing his Congressman or Senator on any subject if it does not violate the law or if it does not deal with some secret matter.\u201d <em>Brown v. Glines, </em>444 U.S. 348, 359, 100 S.Ct. 594, 62 L.Ed.2d 540 (1980) (quoting 97 Cong. Rec. 3776, -3877 (1951)).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">It is clear that to violate 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1034, a person must initiate a negative personnel action specifically in retaliation for a servicemember\u2019s communication with a Member of Congress. In the present ease, there is no evidence that the Government prosecuted Appellant, and that the trial counsel subsequently introduced the letter, to retaliate for any action by Appellant. The Government charged Appellant not because he wrote a letter to a Congressman, but because he wrongfully used and distributed LSD \u2014 offenses that occurred well before Appellant even wrote the letter. In short, while there may be circumstances where the use of a congressional communication in the context of a court-martial proceeding would constitute a prohibited retaliation under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1034, those circumstances are not present here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">II. The Letter was Proper Aggravation Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">Appellant further argues that the letter was improperly admitted as aggravation evidence and as evidence of a matter related to his rehabilitation potential. We hold that the letter was proper aggravation evidence. We need not address the letter\u2019s admissibility as a matter related to Appellant\u2019s rehabilitation potential, for the fact that evidence may be inadmissible under one rule does not preclude its admissibility under a different rule. <em>United States v. Abel, </em>469 U.S. 45, 56, 105 S.Ct. 465, 83 L.Ed.2d 450 (1984); <em>United States v. Ariail, </em>48 M.J. 285, 287 (C.A.A.F. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">R.C.M. 1001(b)(4) permits the Government to introduce evidence of \u201cany aggravating circumstances directly relating to or resulting from the offenses of which the accused has been found guilty.\u201d Aggravation evidence may include \u201cevidence of significant adverse impact on the mission, discipline, or efficiency of the command directly and immediately resulting from the accused\u2019s offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, this Court held in <em>United States v. Vickers, </em>13 M.J. 403, 406 (C.M.A. 1982), that aggravating evidence includes \u201cevidence which is directly related to the offense for which an accused is to be sentenced so that the circumstances surrounding that offense or its repercussions may be understood by the sentencing authority.\u201d Counsel may present such evidence through a stipulation of fact, witness testimony, or the accused\u2019s own statements. Accordingly, in <em>United States v. Irwin, </em>42 M.J. 479, 483 (C.A.A.F.1995), this Court held that a tape recording of the appellant\u2019s statement during the providence inquiry was properly admitted under R.C.M. 1001(b)(4)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>\u201cdirectly related to the offenses of which [the] appellant was found guilty... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Azj\"> In accordance with R.C.M. 1001(b)(4), Appellant's letter was a statement by the accused directly relating to the of-Lenses of which he was found guilty. The letter revealed an aggravating circumstance: Appellant's indifference to anything other bhan his own pleasure. Appellant wrote, \"I was living my life with blinders on and not thinking of the consequences at the time. The only thing I was concerned with was making myself happy with using [LSD].\u201d Indifference to the nature or consequences of criminal conduct is an aggravating factor that may be considered in determining an appropriate sentence for that misconduct.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The military judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting the letter as aggravation evidence. See <em>Vickers, </em>13 M.J. at 406.</p>\n<p id=\"A9t\">The decision of the United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b158-6\">. In addition to relying on the statute\u2019s prohibition against retaliatory actions, Appellant asks this Court to establish a broad privilege or public policy prohibition against use in a court-martial of communications by servicemembers to Members of Congress, even in the absence of retaliation. The remedial provisions of the statute are limited to retaliatory actions, and we decline to extend the statute further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b158-11\">. R.C.M. 1001(b)(4) \"is consistent with the interpretation of paragraph 75 b{3) (later amended to he paragraph 75 b(4) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) by Exec. Order No. 12315 (July 29, 1981)) ... [and] <em>United States v. Vickers, </em>13 M.J. 403 (C.M.A. 1982).\u201d <em>Manual for Courts-Martial, United States </em>(2002 ed.) app. 21, at A21-71.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AMuC\">. Moreover, this Court has noted the devastating link between servicemember drug use and military performance. <em>United States v. Bickel, </em>30 M.J. 277 (C.M.A.1990)(recognizing that drugs diminish the military effectiveness of servicemembers who use them); <em>United States v. Beeker, </em>18 C.M.A. 563, 565, 40 C.M.R. 275, 277 (1969) (identifying the possession of drugs by military personnel as \"a matter of immediate and direct concern to the military as an act intimately concerned with prejudice to good order and discipline or to the discredit of the armed forces\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
