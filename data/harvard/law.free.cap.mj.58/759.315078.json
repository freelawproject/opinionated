In accordance with his pleas, Appellant was found guilty of unpremeditated murder, kidnapping, and obstruction of justice, in violation of Articles 118(2) and 134, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 918(2) and 934. Appellant was sentenced to confinement for life without eligibility for parole, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, reduction to pay grade E-l, and a dishonorable discharge. On 11 July 2000, the convening authority (CA) approved the sentence as adjudged and, except for the dishonorable discharge, ordered it executed. Pursuant to a pretrial agreement, the CA suspended all confinement in excess of 30 years for the period of confinement to be served plus 12 months thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-17\">After carefully considering the record of trial, Appellant\u2019s nine assignments of error, Appellant\u2019s Motion to Correct Errata, Appellant\u2019s Motion to Attach Documents, the Government\u2019s Answer, and the Government\u2019s Motion to Attach Documents in response to this Court\u2019s order to produce documents, we conclude that the findings and sentence are correct in law and fact and that no error materially prejudicial to the substantial rights of Appellant was committed. <em>See </em>Arts. 59(a) and 66(c), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 859(a) and 866(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-18\">Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b813-19\">Appellant and his wife had a 3-year-old daughter and were having marital problems. Appellant had been served with a military protective order (MPO) to stay away from his wife. While living apart, Appellant\u2019s wife stopped by Appellant\u2019s barracks room on 26 March 1999 so that Appellant could have visitation with their daughter. Prosecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>Exhibit 1 (Written Proffer of the Accused). Some time during the visit Appellant and his wife engaged in sexual intercourse while their daughter was asleep. Afterwards, Appellant and his wife got into an argument over support. Appellant alleged that she threatened to accuse him of rape. Appellant struck her, knocking her to the floor. Appellant then repeatedly slammed his wife\u2019s head on the floor. These blows ultimately resulted in her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Appellant was advised by his trial defense counsel that the maximum punishment in his case included life without possibility of parole. Appellant\u2019s Motion to Attach Documents of 3 Jul 2002 (Declaration of Lieutenant Colonel John M. Schum, U.S. Marine Corps, of 2 Jul 2002). Appellant entered into his pretrial agreement with the belief that this statement by his counsel was correct. Appellant\u2019s Motion to Attach Documents of 3 Jul 2002 (undated Declaration of Appellant). At trial, the military judge confirmed trial defense counsel\u2019s advice and also advised Appellant that life without possibility of parole was the maximum punishment. After a comprehensive providence inquiry, the military judge accepted Appellant\u2019s plea to unpremeditated murder and the other offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">The testimony and evidence in sentencing established that Appellant was a polite and normally gentlemanly man, who eared about his daughter. <em>See </em>Defense Exhibits B-E. Appellant had served honorably in the U.S. Army. The staff judge advocate\u2019s recommendation (SJAR) did not specifically acknowledge this honorable service and only lists the dates that Appellant had served in the Army. SJAR of 28 Mar 2000 at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">Life Without Possibility of Parole as an Authorized Punishment</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">In Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, he asserts that because life without possibility of parole was not an authorized punishment under the UCMJ in September 1999, the sentence upon which it was based should be set aside. Appellant avers that this Court should set aside his sentence and order a rehearing or, alternatively, because his pleas were otherwise provident, only approve a sentence of 25 years confinement, with the remaining sentence as adjudged. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">The Constitution vests in Congress the authority \u201c[t]o make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.\u201d U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 14. In effect, Congress can legislate the structure of the military justice system. This includes the authority to establish what sentences can and will be adjudged for specific crimes. <em>Loving v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 748, 767, 116 S.Ct. 1737, 135 L.Ed.2d 36 (1996). When creating the modern military justice system in 1950, Congress delegated to the President the authority to establish the maximum punishment for crimes prosecuted in courts-martial. <em>Id. </em>at 769, 116 S.Ct. 1737. In 1997 Congress .modified this delegation of authority, legislating that for any crime where the President has prescribed confinement for life as a possible sentence, courts-martial automatically have the option of also adjudging a sentence of confinement for life without eligibility for parole. Pub.L. No. 105-85, \u00a7 581(a), 111 Stat. 1629, 1759 (18 Nov 1997)(codified as Title 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 856a).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">At the time of Appellant\u2019s crimes and trial in 1999, the President, by Executive Order, had previously mandated that a military member convicted of non-capital murder could be sentenced to any \u201cpunishment other than death as a court-martial may direct,\u201d which would include confinement for life. Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1998 ed.), Part IV, H 43e(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, due to Congress\u2019 statutory mandate in 1997, confinement for life without eligibility for parole was an authorized punishment Tor Appellant\u2019s crime of unpremeditated murder- \u2014 a bill the President approved when he signed it into law on 18 November 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-13\">a. The Constitutional and Statutory Foundation of the Sentencing Scheme Employed within the Military Justice System</p>\n<p id=\"b814-14\">One of the fundamental precepts of our constitutional system is that the legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>power is vested in Congress. U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 1; <em>Loving, </em>517 U.S. at 758, 116 S.Ct. 1737; <em>United States v. Curtis, </em>32 M.J. 252, 260 (C.M.A.1991). Within that legislative authority is the \u201cpower to fix the sentence for a federal crime.\u201d <em>Mistretta v. United States, </em>488 U.S. 361, 364, 109 S.Ct. 647, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989)(citing <em>United States v. Wiltberger, </em>5 Wheat. 76, 5 L.Ed. 37 (1820)). Likewise, the Constitution vests in Congress the authority to \u201cregulate the Armed Forces,\u201d via a system of military justice, and to determine the military punishments applicable in that system. <em>See Loving, </em>517 U.S. at 760-69, 116 S.Ct. 1737 (holding that this authority flows from Article I, Section 8, Clause 14 of the Constitution); <em>United States v. Teters, </em>37 M.J. 370, 373 (1993)(stating the constitutional power to define Federal military offenses and prescribe their punishments lies with Congress).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">\n<em>1. Congress\u2019 Delegation of Sentencing Authority to the President</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">In 1950, Congress enacted the UCMJ. Title 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-946; <em>Loving, </em>517 U.S. at 768, 116 S.Ct. 1737. The UCMJ contains the laws of procedure of the court-martial system, a list of enumerated crimes that may be tried within that system, and a broad outline of the authorized punishments that may be adjudged for those crimes. Title 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-946. While Congress established broad statutory maximum punishments allowable within the court-martial system, it delegated to the President extraordinary latitude in determining the maximum punishment that could be adjudged for each specific crime.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Loving, </em>517 U.S. at 769, 116 S.Ct. 1737; <em>Curtis, </em>32 M.J. at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">As part of this structure, Congress in Article 18, UCMJ, stated that a general court-martial may, \u201cunder such limitations as the President may prescribe, adjudge any punishment not forbidden by this chapter, including the penalty of death when specifically authorized by this chapter.\u201d Art. 18, UCMJ. In order to further effectuate the delegation of sentencing authority to the President, Congress in Article 56, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 856, stated that the \u201cpunishment which a court-martial may direct for an offense may not exceed such limits as the President may prescribe for that offense.\u201d Art. 56, UCMJ. The Supreme Court in <em>Loving </em>held that Articles 18 and 56, UCMJ, in conjunction with Article 36, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 836, properly delegated to the President broad authority to establish the sentencing regime to be used within the court-martial system.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Loving, </em>517 U.S. at 769-70,116 S.Ct. 1737.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">\n<em>2. The President\u2019s Exercise of the Delegated Sentencing Authority</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">Acting under the authority delegated by the UCMJ, the President has promulgated the specific punishments for each crime under the UCMJ. MCM, Part IV, HH1-113. The punishments for the Punitive Articles are contained in Part IV of the MCM. Additionally, the President promulgated the Rules for Courts-Martial in 1984. Exec. Order 12,473, 49 Fed.Reg. 17,152 (1984). The Rules for Courts-Martial contain procedural rules for courts-martial proceedings that implement the laws established in the UCMJ. Rule for Courts-Martial 101(a), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1998 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">b. Congressional Modifications of the Sentencing Scheme Employed within the Military Justice System</p>\n<p id=\"b815-14\">Beyond question, Congress may modify the sentencing scheme it has established for the court-martial system. <em>See </em>U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, Clause 14; <em>Loving, </em>517 U.S. at 760-69, 116 S.Ct. 1737. As our superior Court stated in <em>United States v. McDonald, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>\u201cCongress would not be disabled from changing the sentencing procedures in the military.\u201d <em>United States v. McDonald, </em>55 M.J. 173, 177 (2001). Such modifications have in fact occurred in a number of ways in the past, with differing effects on the President\u2019s sentencing authority. Congress set the mandatory punishments for some crimes enumerated in the UCMJ, implicitly hmiting the sentencing authority delegated to the President in the UCMJ. <em>See </em>Art. 106, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 906 (establishing death as the mandatory punishment for spying); Art. 118(1) and (4), UCMJ (establishing death or confinement for life as the mandatory punishments for premeditated and felony murder). Congress modified the maximum jurisdictional punishment of special courts-martial, in effect giving the President more \u201coptions\u201d to choose from when utilizing the sentencing authority delegated in the UCMJ. <em>See Taylor v. Garaffa, </em>57 M.J. 645, 647-48 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App.2002)(Congress\u2019 modification of Article 19, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 919, enlarging special courts-martial\u2019s jurisdictional maximum punishment from confinement for 6 months to confinement for 1 year), <em>rev. denied, </em>57 M.J. 455 (2002). Congress created additional punishments that take effect only under certain statutorily defined conditions that did not impact and are not impacted by the President\u2019s sentencing authority delegated in the UCMJ. <em>See United States v. Gorski, </em>47 M.J. 370 (1997)(Congress\u2019 enactment of Article 58b, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 858b, creating automatic forfeiture of pay and allowances contingent upon specific statutorily defined conditions). Congress created additional punishments that take effect at the discretion of the President and stand outside the sentencing scheme established in the UCMJ. <em>See Clinton v. Goldsmith, </em>526 U.S. 529, 119 S.Ct. 1538, 143 L.Ed.2d 720 (1999)(Congress\u2019 amendment of Title 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1161 and the enactment of Title 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1167, allowing the President to \u201cdrop from the rolls\u201d commissioned officers serving a sentence of confinement adjudged by a court-martial).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">Congress exercised this authority again with the enactment of Article 56a, UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 856a. On 18 November 1997, the President signed Public Law 105-85, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998. Pub.L. No. 105-85, 111 Stat. 1629 (1997). This amended the UCMJ by adding Article 56a, which reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-8\">For any offense for which a sentence of confinement for life may be adjudged, a court-martial may adjudge a sentence of confinement for life without eligibility for parole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">Pub.L. No. 105-85, \u00a7 581(a), 111 Stat. 1629, 1759 (1997). This provision took effect on the signing of the Act and was applicable to offenses occurring after that date. <em>Id. </em>This modification to the UCMJ was published in the 1998 edition of the MCM. MCM, App. 2, at A2-15. On 11 April 2002, the President signed Executive Order 13,262, which modified the Rules for Courts-Martial to note that confinement for life without the eligibility for parole was an authorized punishment under the UCMJ. Exec. Order 13,262, 67 Fed.Reg. 18,773 (2002); <em>see also United States v. Czeschin, </em>56 M.J. 346, 348 (2002)(noting that language within the MCM often serves only to recite legal rules created elsewhere).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">c. The Effect of Article 56a, UCMJ, on the Sentencing Scheme Employed within the Military Justice System</p>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">Through amendment of Article 56a, UCMJ, Congress mandated that for any crime where the President has prescribed confinement for life as a possible sentence, courts-martial automatically have the option of also adjudging a sentence of confinement for life without eligibility for parole. The plain language and legislative history of this statute demonstrate that it was self-implementing, requiring no Executive Order in order for it to take effect.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>\n<em>1. The Plain Language of Article 56a, UCMJ</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The meaning of Article 56a, UCMJ, is demonstrated by a number of factors. First and foremost is the plain language of the statute. Article 56a, UCMJ, clearly states that whenever a court-martial may adjudge a sentence -of confinement for life, it \u201cmay adjudge a sentence of confinement for life without eligibility for parole.\u201d It contains no language indicating Congress is merely extending one more sentencing \u201coption\u201d to the President, such as the addition of the words \u201cunder such [limitations] as the President may prescribe,\u201d in Article 19, UCMJ. <em>See Taylor, </em>57 M.J. at 648. The statute is clear and straightforward and should be read as such. <em>See Amoco Production Co. v. Gambell, </em>480 U.S. 531, 552-53, 107 S.Ct. 1396, 94 L.Ed.2d 542 (1987)(stating \u201c[w]hen statutory language is plain, and nothing in the Act\u2019s structure or relationship to other statutes calls into question this plain meaning, that is ordinarily \u2018the end of the matter.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Also revealing is the location of this new language within the UCMJ, specifically its placement as an addendum to Article 56, UCMJ. As explained previously, Article 56, UCMJ, delegates to the President the authority to set the maximum sentences for offenses under the UCMJ. Article 56a, UCMJ, follows immediately upon that delegation, modifying its boundaries. Noticeably, amending Article 18, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 818, did not effect this modification to the UCMJ\u2019s sentencing scheme. Considering Article 18, UCMJ, marks the jurisdictional sentencing boundaries of general courts-martial, that route would have been expected had Congress been intending only to expand the general courts-martial sentencing \u201coptions\u201d available to the President. This should be compared to Congress\u2019 recent modification of Article 19, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 819, to enlarge special eourts-martial\u2019s jurisdictional maximum punishment from confinement for 6 months to confinement for 1 year. <em>See Taylor, </em>57 M.J. at 647-48 (discussing Congress\u2019 modification of Article 19, UCMJ).</p>\n<p id=\"A53\">\n<em>2. The Legislative History of Article 56a, UCMJ</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">The legislative history of this statute likewise demonstrates Congress\u2019 intent was to mandate that whenever the President authorized a sentence of confinement for life, a sentence to confinement for life without eligibility for parole could also be adjudged. The Report of the House Committee on National Security on H.R. 1119,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-10\">This section would add a new article to the [UCMJ]. The new article would establish a court-martial punishment of confinement for life without parole. <em>This new punishment could be adjudged for any offense for which confinement for life is now an authorized punishment. </em>Under current law, any accused who receives a punishment of confinement for life may be considered for parole. The section would also provide that a sentence of life without parole may only be set aside or modified by the action of the [CA], secretary concerned, or other person authorized to act under normal post-trial review procedures, by court decision during appellate review, or by presidential pardon. Punishment of confinement for life without parole would apply to offenses committed after the date of enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">H.R.Rep. No. 105-132 (1997)(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-12\">Congressional intent is further clarified when the House Report is analyzed in light of the military\u2019s parole system. Through Title 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 952 Congress delegated to the service Secretaries the authority to establish a parole system for military personnel confined in military correctional facilities. Title 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 952. In interpreting this grant, the Army Court of Criminal Appeals has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-13\">It is therefore clear that Congress intended for each of the military services to implement a parole system. Pursuant to this Congressional mandate, parole author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>ity has been vested in individuals believed to be best qualified and in the best position to obtain and evaluate information relevant to release from confinement, namely, each military service Secretary. It is equally clear that neither Congress nor the President has authorized courts-martial to impose a sentence that would be inconsistent with this intent or to interfere with this parole authority, such as a sentence of confinement for life without the possibility of parole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-4\"><em>United States v. Smith, </em>44 M.J. 720, 724-25 (Army Ct.Crim.App.1996), <em>sentence set aside on other grounds, </em>46 M.J. 452 (1997); <em>see also Schick v. Reed, </em>419 U.S. 256, 270, 95 5. Ct. 379, 42 L.Ed.2d 430 (1974) (Marshall, J., dissenting)(citing to Title 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952-93 as support for the proposition that confinement without possibility of parole is unknown to military law). It should therefore be clear that when the House Committee on National Security stated that, \u201c[u]nder current law, any accused who receives a punishment of confinement for life may be considered for parole,\u201d it was speaking about the effects of Title 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 952. It follows that it was Congress\u2019 intent to modify the effects of this past legislation<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> by mandating that a sentence to confinement for life without eligibility for parole is available as a sentence for any crime where the President had authorized confinement for life as a punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">d. Appellant\u2019s Erroneous Interpretation of the Effect of Article 56a, UCMJ, on the Sentencing Scheme Employed within the Military Justice System</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">Appellant argues that this Court should set aside his sentence, because life without eligibility for parole was not an authorized punishment under the UCMJ for violation of Article 118(2), UCMJ, at the time of his crime and trial. Motion to Correct Errata of 2 Jul 2002. This assignment of error is based on the argument that Article 56a, UCMJ, required implementation by an Executive Order to become effective. Accordingly, Appellant asserts that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-10\">The absence of an Executive Order implementing life without eligibility for parole as an authorized punishment means that [life without eligibility for parole] was not an authorized punishment at the time of Appellant\u2019s court-martial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">Appellant\u2019s Brief of 1 Jul 2002 at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">Appellant\u2019s argument is founded on two premises, both of which are incorrect. The first premise is that Congress, in enacting Article 56a, UCMJ, was increasing \u201cwhat the maximum sentence <em>may </em>be for an offense committed under the UCMJ.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief of 1 Jul 2002 at 10. Thus, Appellant argues that Congress merely provided the President more \u201coptions\u201d to choose from when exercising the sentencing authority delegated by the UCMJ. As illustration of this point, Appellant compares Congress\u2019 passage of Article 56a, UCMJ, with its modification of Article 19, UCMJ.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s Brief of 1 Jul 2002 at 10. Appellant\u2019s point is that in both statutes Congress only intended to delegate to the President more authority to prescribe greater punishments at courts-martial. <em>Id. </em>Under Appellant\u2019s analysis, whether the President chose to utilize that authority is up to his discretion in his role as Commander-in-Chief. <em>Id. </em>at 5. As explained previously, this is contrary to the plain language and legislative history of Article 56a, UCMJ. <em>See also United States v. Pritt, </em>54 M.J. 47, 50 (2000)(holding that an Executive Order was not required to make a criminal offense prescribed by Congress punishable at a court-martial), <em>cert, denied, </em>531 U.S. 1079, 121 S.Ct. 779, 148 L.Ed.2d 677 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-13\">The second premise, which builds on the first, is that at the time of Appellant\u2019s crime and trial, the President had affirmatively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>mandated that life with possibility of parole was the maximum punishment for Article 118(2), UCMJ. It would then follow that confinement for life without eligibility for parole exceeded the maximum authorized punishment and was therefore unavailable as a punishment at Appellant\u2019s court-martial. As initial support for this premise, Appellant points to Executive Order 13,262 changing R.C.M. 1003(b)(7). Appellant\u2019s Brief of 1 Jul 2002 at 9. Appellant states that through that Executive Order, \u201c[t]he President has now authorized courts-martial to impose a sentence of life without the possibility of parole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Appellant is incorrect in his initial assertion that either the pre- or post-April 2002 R.C.M. 1003(b)(7) specified the maximum sentence to confinement authorized by the President. At the time of Appellant\u2019s crime and trial, R.C.M. 1003(e)(l)(A)(i) stated that the \u201cmaximum limits for the authorized punishments of confinement ... are set forth for each offense listed in Part IV of this Manual.\u201d R.C.M. 1003(c)(l)(A)(i).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Appellant is equally incorrect in his ultimate conclusion that prior to April 2002, there was some form of Presidential limitation on the maximum sentence to confinement that could be adjudged at a general court-martial for violation of Article 118(2), UCMJ.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The maximum punishment prescribed under Part IV of the MCM for a violation of Article 118(2) was, \u201csuch punishment other than death as a court-martial may direct.\u201d MCM, Part IV, K 43e(2). Therefore, at the time of Appellant\u2019s crimes and trial, the President had directed that any punishment authorized by the UCMJ, other than death, could be adjudged for a violation of Article 118(2), UCMJ.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Even under the erroneous interpretation of Article 56a, UCMJ, suggested by Appellant, authorized punishment would include confinement for life without eligibility for parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">e. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">The plain language of Article 56a, UCMJ, as well as its legislative history, demonstrate that Congress\u2019 intent was to mandate that for any crime where the President prescribed confinement for life as a possible sentence, courts-martial automatically have the option of also adjudging a sentence of confinement for life without eligibility for parole. Appellant was convicted at a general court-martial of violating Article 118(2), UCMJ. As even Appellant concedes, at the time of his crime and trial the President had directed that violation of Article 118(2) could be punished with a sentence of confinement for life. Appellant\u2019s Brief of 1 Jul 2002 at 4. Because of the availability of that sentence, Article 56a, UCMJ, came into effect and mandated that the general court-martial Appellant was brought before had the authority to sentence him to confinement for life without eligibility for parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">However, even assuming that Article 56a, UCMJ, was merely expanding the sentencing \u201coptions\u201d available to the President, the regulations promulgated by the President at the time of Appellant\u2019s crimes and trial provided that any authorized punishment under the UCMJ, other than death, could be adjudged for a violation of Article 118(2), UCMJ. MCM, Part IV, H 43e(2). Even under Appellant\u2019s erroneous interpretation of Article 56a, UCMJ, the authorized punishment for his crimes would include the punishment of confinement for life without eligibility for parole. In those cases where the UCMJ and the MCM are found to be in conflict over the maximum authorized punishment to confinement, the UCMJ controls when such conflicts arise. <em>See generally Pritt, </em>54 M.J. at 50. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>no conflict existed between the UCMJ and the MCM on the authorized punishment for committing un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>premeditated murder under Article 118(2), UCMJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">We hold, therefore, that a sentence to life in prison without eligibility for parole was an authorized punishment under the UCMJ at the time of Appellant\u2019s crime and trial. As such, we deny Appellant\u2019s request for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Sentence Appropriateness</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">In Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, he asserts that his sentence is inappropriately severe. Appellant avers that this Court should only approve a sentence of 25 years confinement with the remaining sentence as adjudged. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">This Court may disapprove any portion of a sentence, which it deems to be unjustifiably severe. Art. 66c, UCMJ; <em>United States v. Tardif, </em>57 M.J. 219 (2002); <em>United States v. Healy, </em>26 M.J. 394 (C.M.A.1988). The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces has recognized \u201cthe widely adopted view \u2018that the punishment should fit the offender and not merely the crime\u2019 \u201d. <em>United States v. Mack, </em>9 M.J. 300, 317 (C.M.A.1980)(quoting <em>Williams v. New York, </em>337 U.S. 241, 247, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1949)). As this Court reinforced, \u201c[a]n appropriate sentence results from \u2018individualized consideration\u2019 based upon \u2018the nature and seriousness of the offense and the character of the offender.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Madigan, </em>54 M.J. 518, 522 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App.2000)(quoting <em>United States v. Rojas, </em>15 M.J. 902, 919 (N.M.C.M.R.1983), <em>aff'd, </em>20 M.J. 330 (C.M.A. 1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">It is well settled that within the limits of punishment prescribed by the UCMJ, a court-martial is free to impose any sentence that it determines is fair and just. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>14 C.M.A. 435, 437, 34 C.M.R. 215, 217, 1964 WL 4998 (1964); R.C.M. 1002. Courts of Criminal Appeals are tasked only with determining whether justice was properly administered and whether the accused received the punishment he deserved. <em>Healy, </em>26 M.J. at 395. A sentence should not be disturbed \u201cunless the harshness of the sentence is so disproportionate as to cry out for sentence equalization.\u201d <em>United States v. Usry, </em>9 M.J. 701, 704 (N.C.M.R. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-10\">The CA approved Appellant\u2019s sentence, which included life without possibility of parole, thus determining that this was appropriate. CA\u2019s Action of 11 Jul 2000. Appellant\u2019s assignment of error amounts to nothing more than a request for clemency, which is the prerogative of the CA. <em>Healy, </em>26 M.J. at 395-96. Appellant received the individual consideration required based on the seriousness of his offenses and his individual character, which is all the law requires. <em>Rojas, </em>15 M.J. at 919.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">\u201cMurder is one of the most serious offenses known to society.\u201d <em>United States v. Ginn, </em>1 C.M.A. 453, 456, 4 C.M.R. 45, 48, 1952 WL 2683 (1952). Moreover, our superior Court has recognized the aggravating nature of criminal conduct involving noncommissioned officers. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>22 M.J. 40, 41 (C.M.A.1986)(noncommissioned officers by virtue of their rank and authority have the responsibility to maintain high personal standards). In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Appellant was a sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corps, who brutally assaulted his wife in the presence of his sleeping child by punching her to the floor and then slamming her face into his barrack room\u2019s concrete floor. <em>See </em>Prosecution Exhibits 1 and 2. The catalyst for this assault, according to Appellant, was an argument over child support that devolved into his wife threatening to falsely accuse him of rape. After this assault, Appellant dragged her unconscious body to her car and then, rather than driving her to get emergency medical attention, drove to an isolated wooded area and abandoned her body. At some point between Appellant\u2019s barrack\u2019s room and the woods where he eventually abandoned her body, his wife died from the injuries Appellant had inflicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-12\">While Appellant argues that sentencing evidence demonstrated that he was a \u201cpolite and normally gentlemanly man who cared about his daughter,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief of 1 Jul 2002 at 13, he fails to demonstrate any reason why a sentence of life without possibility of parole is inappropriately severe in his case. There can be no doubt that Appellant\u2019s misconduct was serious and merited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>the punishment adjudged. After reviewing the entire record, we find that the sentence is appropriate for this offender and his offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 395-96; <em>Snelling, </em>14 M.J. at 268. Accordingly, we decline to grant relief.</p>\n<p id=\"AIs\">Denial of Prisoner\u2019s Access to the Courts</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">In Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error, he asserts that he was denied access to a law library during his incarceration at the Marine Corps Base Brig, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. Appellant avers that this Court should only approve a sentence of 25 years confinement with the remaining sentence as adjudged. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Appellant ignores the distinction between the right to detailed defense counsel during trial and on direct appeal and a prisoner\u2019s right of access to the courts to collaterally attack his sentence or the conditions of his confinement. <em>See </em>Arts. 27 and 70, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 827 and 870; <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963); <em>Douglas v. California, </em>372 U.S. 353, 83 S.Ct. 814, 9 L.Ed.2d 811 (1963). While these rights both ultimately stem from the Sixth Amendment, and <em>Gideon v. Wainwright </em>and its progeny are widely-cited in <em>Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343,116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996), and <em>Bounds v. Smith, </em>430 U.S. 817, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977), these two lines of cases implicate two distinct concerns. The right to counsel is concerned with ensuring an accused criminal receives a fair trial. <em>United States v. Palenius, 2 </em>M.J. 86, 90 (C.M.A. 1977). The right of access to the courts is concerned with ensuring that once an accused is imprisoned after trial, he is able to effectively bring his grievances to light in court. <em>See Bounds v. Smith, </em>430 U.S. at 825, 97 S.Ct. 1491 (stating the issue in that case was whether law libraries are needed to give prisoners a reasonably adequate opportunity to present claimed violations of fundamental constitutional rights to the courts). Because of these distinct concerns, the right to counsel requires much more of the Government than the right of access to the courts. Specifically, it requires that individual legal counsel be assigned to represent the interests of an accused in court at trial and on direct appeal. In stark contrast, a prisoner\u2019s right of access to the courts to file grievances can be satisfied by the mere provision of a reasonably well-stocked law library. These distinct considerations were addressed by the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals in <em>United States v. Carter, </em>56 M.J. 649 (AF.Ct. Crim.App.2001), <em>rev. den\u2019d, </em>56 M.J. 467 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Government was statutorily and constitutionally required to provide detailed defense counsel to Appellant to defend him at trial. <em>See Palenius, 2 </em>M.J. at 90 (holding that the right to be represented by counsel at trial and on appeal are primary rights of persons accused of a crime in the civilian and military communities in the United States). Pursuant to this requirement, Appellant was afforded two military defense counsels at trial. Both trial defense counsel vigorously represented Appellant in the pretrial phase, as evidenced by their success in securing Appellant a very favorable pretrial agreement. Appellate Exhibits I and II. Then, during the post-trial/clemency phase, trial defense counsel filed an extensive clemency request. Request for Clemency of 21 Dec 1999. Now, on appeal, Appellant has been detailed appellate defense counsel by the Navy-Marine Corps Appellate Review Activity.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Appellant ignores this continuous legal representation and argues that he was prejudiced by his inability to personally research and raise his first three assignments of error during the post-trial/clemency phase of this proceeding.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Because competent, qualified, and ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>fective trial defense counsel represented Appellant during this phase of the proceeding, as addressed below, we reject this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">In Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error, he asserts that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel when his attorney failed to call military witnesses during sentencing. Appellant avers that this Court should set aside his sentence and remand his case to a court-martial for a new sentencing hearing or, in the alternative, only approve a sentence of 25 years confinement with the remaining sentence as adjudged. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">The Sixth Amendment of the Constitution and Article 27, UCMJ, guarantee an accused the right to the effective assistance of counsel. <em>McMann v. Richardson, </em>397 U.S. 759, 771, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 25 L.Ed.2d 763 (1970); <em>United States v. Ingham, </em>42 M.J. 218, 223 (1995). The competency of counsel is presumed. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>24 M.J. 186, 188 (C.M.A.1987). Thus, Appellant in claiming ineffective assistance \u201cmust surmount a very high hurdle.\u201d <em>United States v. Moulton, </em>47 M.J. 227, 229 (1997). To prevail, Appellant must demonstrate: (1) his counsel was deficient; and (2) he was prejudiced by such deficient performance. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Assistance of counsel is deficient when counsel \u201cmade errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Appellant has suffered prejudice only when counsel\u2019s performance deprived him of a fair trial. <em>Id.; Scott, </em>24 M.J. at 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">Trial defense counsel presented a vigorous sentencing case on Appellant\u2019s behalf. Trial defense counsel submitted four personal letters of support from Appellant\u2019s family and friends. Defense Exhibits B through E. All were heartfelt pleas of compassion on behalf of Appellant, containing numerous details about his personal life, family history, and the community from which he came. These letters were an attempt to humanize Appellant and demonstrate to the military judge the background and life of the man of whom he was sitting in judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">Trial defense counsel also introduced persuasive photographic evidence documenting Appellant\u2019s family life and career in the military. Defense Exhibits F through P. This again was an attempt, as trial defense counsel stated in closing, to show the military judge the \u201cpages of [Appellant\u2019s] life\u201d that stood separate from the crimes to which he pled guilty. Record at 234. Appellant\u2019s military service record was also entered into evidence. Prosecution Exhibits 13 and 14. As trial defense counsel argued in closing, this documentation showed \u201cno negative comments about his character of service\u201d in either the Army or Marine Corps. Record at 238. This documentation also demonstrated that Appellant had served well under hostile conditions in Somalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-11\">Numerous sentencing witnesses called by trial defense counsel augmented the documentary evidence before the military judge. These witnesses included the following people: <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Lawrence Thomas, a family friend since the two were 5 or 6 years old; Maria Thomas, the mother of Lawrence Thomas, who is a close family friend of Appellant\u2019s family; Staff Sergeant Alonzo Wallace, U.S. Army, Appellant\u2019s brother; Julius Wallace, Appellant\u2019s father; and Irene Wallace, Appellant\u2019s mother. These witnesses vividly painted a portrait of a young man from a loving family and community who, while not condoning his actions, were willing to assist in any way possible with Appellant\u2019s return to society. Consistent with this strategy, Appellant made a brief unsworn statement acknowledging his personal acceptance of guilt and begging forgiveness for his crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-12\">On appeal, Appellant asserts trial defense counsel failed to offer a sufficient sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>case at trial, arguing his \u201c[trial] defense counsel failed to present sufficient evidence of rehabilitation, mitigation, and extenuation under R.C.M. 1001.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief of 1 Jul 2002 at 17. Specifically, Appellant argues that trial defense counsel \u201cfailed to seek out available military witnesses to testify to his military character.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The \u201cavailable military witnesses\u201d in question are Sergeant (Sgt) David B. Gattney, U.S. Marine Corps, and Gunnery Sergeant (GySgt) Rodney C. Pettit, U.S. Marine Corps. Motion to Attach Documents of 3 Jul 2002. Appellant states these witnesses \u201cbelieved that [A]ppellant\u2019s rehabilitative potential was outstanding.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at of 1 Jul 2002 at 17-18. The declarations (identified as \u201cAffidavits\u201d) proffered indicate a different story. In his declaration, Sgt Gattney only stated that he \u201cwould have testified favorably in regards to Sgt Wallace\u2019s military character and performance.\u201d Motion to Attach Documents of 3 Jul 2002 (Declaration of Sgt David B. Gattney, USMC, of 2 May 2002). In his declaration, GySgt Petit likewise only stated he \u201cwould have testified favorably to Sgt Wallace\u2019s military character and performances of his duties,\u201d subject to the limitation that his \u201ctestimony would have been limited to my observations as to military character and duty performance during the period I served with him.\u201d Motion to Attach Documents of 3 Jul 2002 (Declaration of GySgt Rodney C. Pettit, USMC, of 10 Apr 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Good military character does not automatically equal rehabilitative potential. R.C.M. 1001(b)(5). Nothing in the declarations demonstrate that either proposed witness \u201cpossessed] sufficient information and knowledge about [Appellant] to offer a rationally-based opinion that [would have been] helpful to the sentencing authority\u201d in regards to his rehabilitative potential. <em>Id. </em>But most importantly, neither proposed witness even stated in their declarations that, under the circumstances, they believed Appellant had rehabilitative potential.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Appellant\u2019s assignment of error also ignores that trial defense counsel, with the knowledge and apparent concurrence of Appellant, made a tactical decision on how to focus the sentencing case. Motion to Attach Documents of 3 Jul 2002 (Declaration of LtCol John M. Schum, USMC, of 2 Jul 2002). Fearing effective cross-examination on the impact of Appellant\u2019s crimes on his unit,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> trial defense counsel made the tactical decision to introduce Appellant\u2019s military character and performance via service book entries. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, Appellant\u2019s argument completely misses one of the well-settled principles underlying Sixth Amendment analysis: that a defense counsel\u2019s tactical decisions are virtually unchallengeable. <em>See United States v. Rivas, </em>3 M.J. 282, 289 (C.M.A1977)(refusing to second-guess the strategic or tactical decisions of defense counsel); <em>see also United States v. Sanders, </em>37 M.J. 116, 118 (C.M.A.1993)(dismissing an appellant\u2019s second-guessing of tactical decisions as \u201cMonday-morning quarterbacking\u201d). We find that trial defense counsel\u2019s performance, both over the course of the trial and during the sentencing hearing, far exceeded the minimum level required by <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Accordingly, we deny his request for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">Trial Counsel\u2019s Sentencing Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">In Appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error, he asserts that improper comments during trial counsel\u2019s sentencing argument amounted to plain error. Appellant avers that this Court should only approve a sentence of 25 years confinement with the remaining sentence as adjudged. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">R.C.M. 1001(g) states, in relevant part, that a \u201c[fjailure to object to improper argument before ... sentencing shall constitute waiver of the objection.\u201d <em>See generally United States v. Reist, </em>50 M.J. 108, 110 (1999). In the case at bar, Appellant premises his assignment of error on the allegation that during the sentencing argument, trial counsel argued that Appellant acted with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>premeditation when he murdered his wife. Appellant\u2019s Brief of 1 Jul 2002 at 19-21. Such an argument by trial counsel would have contradicted Appellant\u2019s plea to unpremeditated murder under Article 118(2), UCMJ, vice premeditated murder under Article 118(1), UCMJ. While Appellant cites the record at page 225 to support his argument, he fails to quote the specific objectionable statements of the trial counsel. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Brief of 1 Jul 2002 at 20-21. Appellant\u2019s argument appears<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> to be founded on the following statement by the trial counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdM\">His thoughts were of inflicting great bodily harm, and his intent was to kill Tonya Wallace as she lay there helplessly on the floor, her face pounded against the deck, and that awful popping sound ringing in the air.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Record at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Appellant failed to object to these comments at court-martial. Accordingly, Appellant forfeited any error through his inaction. R.C.M. 1001(g); <em>see also United States v. Doctor, </em>7 C.M.A. 126, 135, 21 C.M.R. 252, 261, 1956 WL 4578 (1956)(stating, \u201cIt is a little difficult for us to find misconduct which compels a reversal when it purportedly arises out of an argument which had so little impact on [trial] defense counsel that they sat silently by and failed to mention it ... at the time of trial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Even if this Court were to decline to apply forfeiture, Appellant\u2019s claim is not well taken, because he has not demonstrated that trial counsel\u2019s argument constituted plain error. To prevail under a plain error analysis, Appellant has the burden of persuading the Court that: (1) there was an error; (2) it was plain or obvious; and (3) the error materially prejudiced a substantial right. <em>United States v. Kho, </em>54 M.J. 63, 65 (2000); <em>United States v. Finster, </em>51 M.J. 185, 187 (1999); <em>United States v. Powell, </em>49 M.J. 460, 463-65 (1998). The plain error \u201cdoctrine is reserved for \u2018those circumstances in which a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Zaptin, </em>41 M.J. 877, 880 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App.l995)(quoting <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>38 M.J. 106, 111 (C.M.A. 1993)); <em>see </em>Art. 59(a), UCMJ. Appellant fails to establish plain error for the following three reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">\n<em>1. Trial Counsel\u2019s Arguments were Permissible</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">Appellant plead to and was found guilty of the unpremeditated intentional murder of Tonya Wallace, in violation of Article 118(2), UCMJ. Throughout his providence inquiry, Appellant acknowledged his actions were taken with the intent of causing great bodily harm to and the death of his wife, Tonya Wallace. In accord with Appellant\u2019s statements, trial counsel argued during sentencing that Appellant\u2019s \u201cthoughts were of inflicting great bodily harm, and his intent was to kill Tonya Wallace.\u201d Record at 225. This is an accurate description of an \u201cintent to kill\u201d under Article 118(2), UCMJ, not \u201cpremeditation\u201d under Article 118(1), UCMJ. <em>Compare </em>MCM, Part IV, H43c(2) <em>and </em>MCM, Part IV 1! 43c(3)(defining \u201cpremeditation\u201d and \u201cintent to kill\u201d as two distinct forms of <em>mens rea). </em>Therefore, trial counsel was not contradicting Appellant\u2019s admissions made during providence as Appellant now alleges.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-11\">2. <em>Any Error was neither Plain nor Obvious</em></p>\n<p id=\"b824-12\">The U.S. Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152, 163, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982), defined plain error as \u201cerror so \u2018plain\u2019 the trial judge and prosecutor were derelict in countenancing it, even absent the defendant\u2019s timely assistance in detecting it.\u201d Such is not the case here. If there was error upon the military judge\u2019s part for failing to <em>sua sponte </em>cut the trial counsel\u2019s argument off, it was neither plain nor obvious. Therefore, a reasonable military judge could not have been expected to <em>sua sponte </em>intervene under these circumstances. <em>See generally United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)(discussing whether error was plain or obvious when the error was not clear under current law). Appellant has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>met his burden of persuading this Court that there was plain error. <em>See United States v. Barrazamartinez, </em>58 M.J. 173, 175 (2003)(citing <em>Powell, </em>49 M.J. at 464).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">3. <em>Appellant Fails to Demonstrate Prejudice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Finally, assuming error that was plain or obvious, Appellant fails to demonstrate prejudice. In fact, Appellant has cited to no prejudice whatsoever in his brief. Therefore, this assignment of error is analyzed in light of the fact that we are convinced the military judge in Appellant\u2019s judge alone guilty plea case, would not be improperly swayed by the sentencing argument of trial counsel. <em>See United States v. Prevatte, </em>40 M.J. 396, 398 (C.M.A.1994)(holding that a military judge is presumed to know and follow the law). As addressed by our superior Court in <em>Prevatte, </em>prejudice in this light is illusory. <em>Prevatte, </em>40 M.J. at 398. Appellant has failed to demonstrate error, plain or otherwise, or that any prejudice resulted from trial counsel\u2019s statements. Therefore, we deny Appellant\u2019s request for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">Pretrial Agreement Suspension Provision Violates Public Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">In Appellant\u2019s sixth assignment of error, he asserts that a suspension period for the period of confinement and 1 year from the date of release violates public policy. Appellant avers that this Court should only approve a period of suspension of 5 years from the date the sentence was announced. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">A CA may suspend a portion of the sentence for \u201ca stated period or until the occurrence of an anticipated future event.\u201d R.C.M. 1108(d). A period of suspension \u201cshall not be unreasonably long.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In Appellant\u2019s case, the adjudged confinement was life without possibility of parole. The CA suspended all confinement in excess of 30 years for the period of confinement plus 12 months after Appellant\u2019s release. CA\u2019s Action of 11 July 2000 at 2. Such a suspension was negotiated as part of Appellant\u2019s pretrial agreement. Appellate Exhibit II.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-10\">This Court has held that \u201c[pjlacing an appellant on probation for the entire period of his confinement is reasonable as a control and motivating measure and is not violative of public policy or of R.C.M. 1108(d).\u201d <em>United States v. Ratliff, </em>42 M.J. 797, 802 (N.M.Ct. Crim.App.1995). In <em>Ratliff, </em>the CA suspended all confinement in excess of 10 years for the duration of the appellant\u2019s confinement plus 1 year. <em>Id. </em>at 798. This Court held that placing the appellant on probation for approximately 11 years of an adjudged 15 year sentence was not unreasonably long. <em>Id. </em>at 802. Similarly, in the case at bar, it is this Court\u2019s opinion that placing Appellant on probation for 31 years of an adjudged life sentence without possibility of parole is not unreasonably long and does not violate public policy. Therefore, we reject Appellant\u2019s request for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-12\">Erroneous SJAR and CA\u2019s Action</p>\n<p id=\"b825-13\">In Appellant\u2019s seventh assignment of error, he asserts that the SJAR and the CA\u2019s action both misstate the agreed upon sentence limitation and the CA approved the wrong sentence. Appellant avers that this Court should set aside the CA\u2019s action and remand this case for a new SJAR and CA\u2019s action. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-14\">Before a CA takes action on a ease that involves an adjudged bad-conduct discharge, the CA \u201cshall obtain and consider the written recommendation of his staff judge advocate or legal officer.\u201d Art. 60(d), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 860(d); <em>see also </em>R.C.M. 1106. R.C.M. 1106(f)(5) mandates service of the recommendation on counsel for the accused, and it includes a period of 10 days from receipt of the record of trial or the recommendation, whichever is later, for that counsel to comment on any matter in the recommendation. There can be no doubt the SJAR is an important component of post-trial review. <em>See United States v. Cunningham, </em>44 M.J. 758, 763 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App.1996)(noting that because of the significance of the CA\u2019s action in the military justice system, the SJAR is particularly important). However, failure to object to errors in the SJAR will constitute forfeiture of the issue, and an appellant will not be entitled to relief on appeal unless the error rises to the level of \u201cplain error.\u201d R.C.M. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>1106(f)(6); <em>see Kho, </em>54 M.J. at 65; <em>see also Cunningham, </em>44 M.J. at 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Appellant\u2019s counsel was served with the SJAR on 29 March 2000. Acknowledgement of Service of 29 Mar 2000. While an extensive request for clemency had been filed on 21 December 1999, nothing was submitted in response to the SJAR. Clemency Request of 12 Apr 2000. Thus, Appellant is not entitled to relief, unless he can establish that any error in the SJAR was so substantial as to constitute plain error. Appellant claims that the SJAR was deficient in that it: (1) misstates the agreed upon sentence limitation in the pretrial agreement; and (2) fails to state Appellant earned an honorable discharge from the U.S. Army. Appellant\u2019s Brief of 1 Jul 2002 at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">First, Appellant is incorrect about any misstatement of the agreed-upon sentence limitation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The pretrial agreement allows approval of the sentence as adjudged but requires all confinement in excess of 30 years to be suspended for the period of confinement served plus 12 months. Appellate Exhibit II. This is what the SJAR states as the sentence limitation. SJAR of 28 Mar 2000 at 4. Therefore, Appellant\u2019s first allegation is factually incorrect and not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Second, Appellant fails to offer any authority that would require an SJA to include information about an accused\u2019s prior honorable service in his recommendation. This Court has found no controlling precedent on whether information about prior honorable service is specifically required to be included in the SJAR. However, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the SJAR should have put the CA on notice that such service existed, the SJAR in this case effectively did so. While the SJAR did not specifically state that Appellant received prior honorable discharges, it did accurately reflect his two previous enlistments, that he had been awarded numerous Army awards, including the Army Achievement Medal, and that he had no disciplinary history. This information therefore effectively indicated the honorable nature of his prior service. In Appellant\u2019s case, finding similar information in the SJAR was sufficient to have placed the CA on notice of Appellant\u2019s prior honorable service.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">Finally, even assuming error, Appellant fails to demonstrate prejudice. In taking his action, the CA specifically considered the record of trial, which in Prosecution Exhibit 14 contained explicit information detailing Appellant\u2019s prior honorable discharges from the Army. CA\u2019s Action of 11 Jul 2000 at 3; Prosecution Exhibit 14 at 1-3. Therefore, this Court declines to grant relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-10\">Post-Trial Processing Delay</p>\n<p id=\"b826-11\">In Appellant\u2019s eighth assignment of error, he asserts that the CA\u2019s 290-day delay from the date of trial to complete his action is unreasonable and excessive post-trial delay that violates his rights. Appellant avers that this Court should reassess his sentence and set aside the period of suspension in excess of 5 years from the date the sentence was announced. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-12\">An \u201cappellant has a right to a speedy post-trial review of his case.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, 55 </em>M.J. 302, 305 (2001). In reviewing a case where there is an alleged excessive delay in its post-trial processing, this Court must determine whether the excessive delay materially prejudiced the appellant, thus requiring a remedy under Article 59(a), UCMJ. <em>Tardif, </em>57 M.J. at 224. If there is no material prejudice to Appellant in this case, then this Court is \u201crequired to determine what findings and sentence \u2018should be approved,\u2019 based on all the facts and circumstances reflected in the record, including the unexplained and unreasonable post-trial delay.\u201d <em>Id.; see </em>Art. 66(c), UCMJ. However, \u201cappellate relief under Article 66(c) should be viewed as the last recourse to vindicate, where appropriate, an appellant\u2019s right to timely post-trial processing and appellate review.\u201d <em>Tardif, </em>57 M.J. at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-13\">Appellant bears the burden of proving the post-trial delay was unreasonable. However, even if this Court found that there was unreasonable post-trial delay in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>this ease, unreasonable delay alone does not entitle Appellant to relief under Articles 59(a) or 66(e), UCMJ. First, Appellant fails to allege or demonstrate he suffered any actual prejudice, and thus he is not entitled to any relief under Article 59(a), UCMJ. Appellant\u2019s Brief of 1 Jul 2002 at 23. Second, Appellant fails to indicate what, if anything, in the entire record entitles him to relief under Article 66(e), UCMJ. <em>Tardif, </em>57 M.J. at 225. It is this Court\u2019s opinion that relief pursuant to Article 66(c), UCMJ should only be granted under the most extraordinary of circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">In this case, Appellant can only cite unreasonable delay as a basis for relief. Because Appellant fails to establish any other facts or circumstances in the entire record as a basis for relief, this is an inappropriate ease for this Court to exercise its \u201c \u2018broad power to moot claims of prejudice\u2019 \u201d under Article 66(c), UCMJ. <em>United States v. Collazo, </em>53 M.J. 721, 727 (Army Ct.Crim.App.2000)(quoting <em>United States v. Wheelus, </em>49 M.J. 283, 288 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Furthermore, neither Appellant nor trial defense counsel raised the issue of delay with the military judge or the SJA or the CA during the entire post-trial processing period. Appellant raises it for the first time here on appeal. Thus, as part of \u201call the facts and circumstances reflected in the record,\u201d Appellant\u2019s lengthy silence is strong evidence that he suffered no harm and that this is not an appropriate case for this Court to exercise its Article 66(c), UCMJ, authority. <em>See United States v. Fricke, </em>53 M.J. 149, 154 (2000)(holding \u201cthat the failure to object to a military magistrate or chain of command is strong evidence that unlawful pretrial punishment did not occur\u201d). \u201c[Defense] counsel at the trial level are particularly well-situated to protect the interests of their clients by addressing post-trial delay issues before action by the convening authority,\u201d and the \u201c[trial] defense counsel can protect the interests of [an appellant] through complaints ... to the convening authority.\u201d <em>Tardif, </em>57 M.J. at 225. Therefore, any relief under Article 66(c), UCMJ, would serve only to give a windfall to this otherwise undeserving Appellant. As such, we deny Appellant\u2019s request for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">Unreasonable Multiplication of Charges</p>\n<p id=\"b827-11\">In Appellant\u2019s ninth assignment of error, he asserts that kidnapping and murder resulting from the same continuous course of conduct is an unreasonable multiplication of charges (UMC). Appellant avers that this Court should dismiss the kidnapping charge and only approve a sentence of 25 years confinement with the remaining sentence as adjudged. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-12\">Appellant ignores the fact that at trial, the military judge <em>sua sponte </em>found the two charges multiplicious for sentencing purposes. Record at 249. The doctrine of multiplicity for sentencing purposes has been expressly recognized by the Rules for Courts-Martial, as well as our superior Court. R.C.M. 906(b)(12); <em>United States v. Quiroz, </em>55 M.J. 334, 339 (2001). \u201cThis doctrine may well be subsumed under the concept of an [UMC] when the military judge ... determines that the nature of the harm requires a remedy that focuses more appropriately on punishment than on findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 339. In effect, the military judge has already resolved this assignment of error in Appellant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-13\">The doctrine of UMC is designed to address the potential for an abuse of discretion in charging an accused based on the same act or transaction. <em>Id. </em>at 338 (referring to this Court\u2019s \u201cframework for determining whether a given multiplication of charges arising from the same <em>act or transaction\u201d </em>is unreasonable)(emphasis added); <em>see </em>R.C.M. 307(c)(4)(discussion) (stating \u201c[w]hat is substantially one transaction should not be made the basis for an [UMC] against one person.\u201d). Here, Appellant fails to demonstrate the conduct underlying the identified charges constitutes the same act or transaction. Therefore, the doctrine of UMC is not applicable. In any event, Appellant has not shown an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>It is this Court\u2019s opinion that Appellant is clearly guilty beyond any reasonable doubt of kidnapping his wife in addition to her unpremeditated intentional murder, and that the charges are not an UMC. Appellant, after having brutally smashed his wife\u2019s head and face against the concrete floor multiple times, thinking that he had, in fact, killed her, was in the process of removing her unconscious, bleeding body from his barracks room to avoid detection when he observed that she was still breathing. When Appellant intentionally continued with his criminal course of conduct to remove his wife\u2019s unconscious, dying body from Camp Lejeune, he, by purposeful design, extinguished even the extremely remote possibility and chance that she would be discovered and her life saved. As such, we decline to grant relief in Appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the findings and the sentence, as approved on review below.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Chief Judge OLIVER and Judge VILLEMEZ concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b814-8\">.

Appellant\u2019s Brief of 1 Jul 2002 at 15-16. If this is in fact Appellant\u2019s position, appellate defense counsel\u2019s vigorous defense of Appellant in this case is evidence of the high quality of counsel regularly provided to Navy and Marine appellants.
