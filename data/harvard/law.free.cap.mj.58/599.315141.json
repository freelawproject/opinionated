On 10 May 2000, the military judge sentenced Appellant to confinement for 45 days, reduction to pay grade E-l, and a bad-conduct discharge. The convening authority approved the sentence and, except for the bad-conduct discharge, ordered it executed. The pretrial agreement had no effect on the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-21\">We have carefully reviewed the record of trial, Appellant\u2019s single assignment of error, the Government\u2019s response, and Appellant\u2019s reply. We conclude that the findings and sentence are correct in law and fact and that no error materially prejudicial to the substantial rights of Appellant was committed. Arts. 59(a) and 66(c), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 859(a) and 866(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-22\">Issue Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b652-23\">At trial, the parties litigated a defense motion to suppress the only evidence of Appellant\u2019s possession of cocaine. After hearing testimony and ruling that the cocaine was admissible as evidence on the merits, the military judge permitted Appellant to enter a conditional plea of guilty to the Charge and Specification under Rule for Courts-Martial 910(a)(2), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2000 ed.); <em>see United States v. Monroe, </em>50 M.J. 550, 553 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App.1999). Appellant thus preserved the evidentiary issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number><em>On </em>appeal, Appellant contends that the military judge erred by allowing the introduction of the vial containing cocaine into evidence. He argues that it was obtained through an illegal search and seizure in violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Military Rule of Evidence 311(a), Manual foe Courts-Martial, United States (2000 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Although we acknowledge that the question is a close one, we find that the military judge was correct when he ruled that there was no violation of Appellant\u2019s rights in how the cocaine came into the possession of the Government. Therefore, Appellant is not entitled to any relief. The applicable facts of the case and our legal analysis follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Applicable Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">While a student at Naval Submarine School, Appellant shared a room in the barracks on Naval Submarine Base New London, Connecticut, with two other students: Electronics Technician Seaman Apprentice (ETSA) Collinge and ETSA Voitlein. Their room consisted of: (1) three racks: a bunk-bed for ETSA Collinge and ETSA Voitlein; and an individual rack for Appellant; (2) three wall lockers and wall units, which were separately assigned to each occupant and bore the name tag of each; (3) four nightstands, which had neither name tags nor locks; and (4) a common-use refrigerator.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Appellant kept his phone book, pictures, manila mailing envelopes, letters, candy, snuff tobacco, and cigarettes in the top drawer of one nightstand located between the beds. Appellant used that particular nightstand on a daily basis. The testimony established that only he stored possessions in its top drawer.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">On the evening of 29 March 2000, Appellant entered his barrack\u2019s room holding a brown plastic vial. He displayed this vial to ETSA Collinge and ETSA Voitlein, claiming that it contained cocaine mixed with a tranquilizer. Appellant then placed the vial in a can of snuff tobacco in the top drawer of his nightstand that was between the beds. Neither ETSA Collinge nor ETSA Voitlein talked to Appellant about the vial or its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">At 0630 the following morning, 30 March 2000, a chief petty officer and a petty officer conducted the regular weekly inspection of Appellant\u2019s room. Because Appellant and ETSA Collinge were both in class at the time, only ETSA Voitlein was present for the routine inspection. ETSA Voitlein testified that, because he did not know either member of the inspection team, he \u201cwas kind of like scared\u201d to tell them about the vial in Appellant\u2019s nightstand. Record at 64. The room inspection uncovered nothing unusual.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">Shortly after the room inspection, ETSA Voitlein searched out Electronics Technician Chief Petty Officer (ETC)(SS) Wilt, a Military Training Instructor whom he knew fairly well. ETSA Voitlein told Chief Wilt that he thought Appellant was \u201cdoing drugs.\u201d Record at 65, 79. ETSA Voitlein and Chief Wilt then discussed what had transpired the previous evening. Chief Wilt asked whether the vial was still in the room. ETSA Voitlein responded that the vial was in a nightstand dresser drawer. Although Chief Wilt clearly did not believe that illegal drugs were actually in the drawer, he told ETSA Voitlein to go get the vial, because he was busy debriefing the inspection team.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">ETSA Voitlein returned to the room and retrieved the vial from inside the snuff tobacco can where Appellant had placed it in the top drawer of the nightstand the previous night. He then delivered the vial to Chief Wilt. Although Chief Wilt directed ETSA Voitlein to retrieve the vial, at the time he did not suspect Appellant to be in possession of any illegal substances. Rather, he surmised that Appellant had been merely joking with his roommates. Subsequent testing, however, revealed that the vial ETSA Voitlein recovered contained some amount of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-13\">At trial, Appellant made a timely motion pursuant to R.C.M. 905(b)(3), to suppress the cocaine that was found in the vial. In his motion, he argued the cocaine was inadmissible pursuant to Mil. R. Evid. 311(a). Appellant argued that ETSA Voitlein, acting as an agent of the Government on the orders of Chief Wilt, searched the top drawer of his nightstand in which he stored his personal effects, searched his can of snuff tobacco, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>seized the vial, and then gave it to Chief Wilt, all without his authorization. For his part, Chief Wilt turned the vial over to law enforcement personnel for testing. These tests proved positive for cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">In its response to the motion at trial, the Government argued the cocaine was admissible because: (1) Appellant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in either the nightstand or the can of snuff tobacco; (2) ETSA Voitlein was acting in a private capacity at the time of the seizure and not in any governmental capacity; (3) ETSA Voitlein had the authority to consent to the search of the nightstand and the can of snuff tobacco; and (4) the Government would inevitably have discovered the cocaine anyway. On appeal, the Government is arguing only the second basis, that ETSA Voitlein was a \u201cnon-government agent\u201d and there was \u201cno quest for evidence by a person acting under color of authority,\u201d to support the military judge\u2019s decision to admit the evidence. On the unique facts of this case, we find that this is the only appropriate basis for admitting the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The military judge ruled at trial that, although Appellant did have an expectation of privacy in the nightstand and its contents and that this expectation was reasonable, introduction of the cocaine seized from the vial in the nightstand was proper. The military judge found that ETSA Voitlein was acting in a \u201cpurely private capacity\u201d when he found the contraband. Therefore, he ruled that the search of the nightstand and seizure of the cocaine did not have to be excluded from evidence under Mil. R. Evid. 311(a). Appellate Exhibit IV (Findings and Order).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides that the \u201cright of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV. Military Rules of Evidence 311 through 317 \u201cexpress the manner in which the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States applies to trials by court-martial.\u201d Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2000 ed.), App. 22-17. Military Rule of - Evidence 311(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-9\"><em>General rule. </em>Evidence obtained as a result of an unlawful search or seizure made by a person acting in a governmental capacity is inadmissible against the accused if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-10\">(1) <em>Objection. </em>The accused makes a timely motion to suppress or an objection to the evidence under this rule; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-11\">(2) <em>Adequate interest. </em>The accused had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the person, place, or property searched; the accused had a legitimate interest in the property or evidence seized____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-13\">In ruling on the motion, the military judge concluded that, in effecting the search of Appellant\u2019s nightstand top drawer and removing the vial of cocaine from that drawer, ETSA Voitlein acted in a \u201cpurely private capacity.\u201d Appellate Exhibit IV at 3. This fact insulated his conduct from the exclusionary provisions of Mil. R. Evid. 311(a). The military judge summarized the issue as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b654-14\">The key to the government\u2019s case is [ETJSA Voitlein\u2019s role. If he was acting as a private party, then his searching for and seizing the can of snuff that contained the vial of cocaine did not violate the Rule of Evidence [311] nor its constitutional underpinnings. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Portt, </em>21 M.J. 333, 334 (C.M.A.1986). Conversely, if he was acting as an agent of the government, then his actions did violate those standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-15\">Appellate Exhibit IV at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-16\">Standards of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b654-17\">This Court is to review a military judge\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Khamsouk, </em>57 M.J. 282, 286 (2002); <em>United States v. Monroe, </em>52 M.J. 326, 330 (2000). We apply a \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard to the military judge\u2019s essential findings of fact, and conduct a <em>\u201cde novo </em>review\u201d of the military judge\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>See United States v. Bruci, </em>52 M.J. 750, 753-54 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App.2000). Our superior Court put it as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>A military judge\u2019s evidentiary ruling is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Findings of fact will not be overturned unless they are clearly erroneous or unsupported by the record. Conclusions of law are reviewed <em>de novo. </em>In reviewing a ruling on a motion to suppress, we consider the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the\u201d prevailing party. \u201cWe will reverse for an abuse of discretion if the military judge\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous or if his decision is influenced by an erroneous view of the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-5\"><em>United States v. Reister, </em>44 M.J. 409, 413 (1996)(quoting <em>United States v. Sullivan, </em>42 M.J. 360, 363 (1995); <em>United States v. Kitts, </em>42 M.J. 23, 28 (1995); <em>United States v. Cardenas, </em>9 F.3d 1139, 1147 (5th Cir.1993)). We agree with our learned colleague that we need to analyze the military judge\u2019s determinations below as mixed questions of law and fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">In analyzing a Fourth Amendment evidentiary issue such as this one, a military judge should consider the following two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">(1) Did the accused have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the area searched and in the property seized? and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-9\">(2) Was the person who conducted the search and seized the property acting as an agent of the Government in a quest for evidence of a crime at the time?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">Only if the answer to each of these two questions is \u201cyes\u201d should the military judge exclude the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">The military judge first found that Appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of the dresser drawer. In this regard, the U.S. Supreme Court has stated that: <em>Bond v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 334, 338, 120 S.Ct. 1462, 146 L.Ed.2d 365 (2000) (citations omitted). <em>See also Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 361, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967)(Harlan, J., concurring). In <em>United States v. Portt, </em>21 M.J. 333, 334 (C.M.A. 1986), the opinion the military judge cited in his written ruling, our superior Court opined: \u201cThe determination of whether a reasonable expectation of privacy exist[s] is a legal conclusion.\u201d The <em>Portt </em>Court continued: \u201cIn considering reasonableness, we must determine 'whether a person invoking the protection of the Fourth Amendment took normal precautions to maintain his privacy \u2014 that is, precautions customarily taken by those seeking privacy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Portt, </em>21 M.J. at 334 (quoting <em>Rakas v. Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 152, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978))(Powell, J., concurring).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-12\">Our Fourth Amendment analysis embraces two questions. First, ... whether the individual, by his conduct, has exhibited an actual expectation of privacy; that is, whether he has shown that \u201che [sought] to preserve [something] as private.\u201d ... Second, ... whether the individual\u2019s expectation of privacy is \u201cone that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-14\">The <em>Portt </em>opinion continued: \u201cGenerally, a warrantless search of a government locker assigned for the personal use of a military member, particularly if the locker were located in living quarters, would be unreasonable, as such lockers are in a class of effects in which there exists a legitimate expectation of privacy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 335. In its brief, the Government has conceded that the military judge\u2019s conclusion to this effect was correct. We agree fully with the military judge\u2019s finding that Appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the drawer and its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-15\">We now turn to the second question: Was ETSA Voitlein acting as an agent of the Government in a quest for evidence of a crime at the time he conducted the search and made the seizure? This issue requires further analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-16\">It is well-settled that the \u201cFourth Amendment is a restriction only against government action; and the fruits of a search and seizure by a private person are not subject to the exclusionary rule.\u201d <em>United States v. Baker, </em>30 M.J. 262, 266 (C.M.A.1990). In <em>United States v. Jacobsen, </em>466 U.S. 109, 113-14, 104 S.Ct. 1652, 80 L.Ed.2d 85 (1984), the U.S. Supreme Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-17\">This Court has also consistently construed [the Fourth Amendment] protection as proscribing only governmental action; it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>wholly inapplicable \u201cto a search or seizure, even an unreasonable one, effected by a private individual not acting as an agent of the Government or with the participation or knowledge of any governmental official.\u201d <em>Walter v. United States, </em>447 U.S. 649, 662, 100 S.Ct. 2395, 65 L.Ed.2d 410 (1980)(Blackmun, J. dissenting).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">It is equally well-settled that the warrantless search and seizure of the personal effects of an individual by a Government agent is <em>\u201cper se </em>unreasonable\u201d and would normally constitute a violation of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Katz, </em>389 U.S. at 357, 88 S.Ct. 507. <em>See also </em>Mil. R. Evm 311(a); <em>Reister, </em>44 M.J. at 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The Supreme Court articulated the following guideline to determine if the warrantless search by a private individual violates the Constitution: \u201cThe test ... is whether Mrs. Coolidge, in light of all the circumstances of the case, must be regarded as having acted as an \u2018instrument\u2019 or agent of the state when she produced her husband\u2019s belongings.\u201d <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 487, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971); see <em>Reister, </em>44 M.J. at 415. In <em>Coolidge, </em>the Supreme Court continued: \u201c[I]t is no part of the policy underlying the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to discourage citizens from aiding to the utmost of their ability in the apprehension of criminals.\u201d 403 U.S. at 488, 91 S.Ct. 2022.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">Military Rule of Evidence 311(c)(1) provides: \u201cA search or seizure is \u2018unlawful\u2019 if it was conducted, instigated, or participated in by ... [m]ilitary personnel or their agents and was in violation of the Constitution of the United States as applied to members of the armed forces.\u201d Our superior Court has observed: \u201cThe Fourth Amendment and Mil. R.Evid. 311 are not violated when a military member acts in a purely private capacity.\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>42 M.J. at 363-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">After hearing evidence, reviewing the legal briefs, and considering arguments, the military judge determined that ETSA Voitlein was acting in a \u201cpurely private capacity\u201d when he conducted the search and recovered the vial containing cocaine. In reaching his finding, the military judge acknowledged that ETSA Voitlein retrieved the vial of cocaine only after the directive given by Chief Wilt: \u201cIt is true that he picked up the vial only after he had been provided guidance by ETC(SS) Wilt____\u201d Appellate Exhibit IV at 3. The military judge ruled that the role of Chief Wilt in the search was irrelevant, a \u201cred herring.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The military judge focused solely on the underlying motivation of ETSA Voitlein. He concluded that ETSA Voitlein was acting based on his private motivations.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-13\">Although we agree with the military judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion, we find Chief Wilt\u2019s knowledge and motivation equally, if not more, important. Indeed, the determining factor in whether or not the cocaine seizure was constitutional is what motivated Chief Wilt\u2019s directions to ETSA Voitlein. Were his directions part of a \u201csearch\u201d in a \u201cquest\u201d for incriminating evidence? <em>See generally Dow Chemical Co. v. United States, </em>476 U.S. 227, 230,106 S.Ct. 1819, 90 L.Ed.2d 226 (1986). If so, we would find that Chief Wilt\u2019s statement, \u201cGo and get it,\u201d would have made ETSA Voitlein his agent in such a quest. Under the unique circumstances of this case, however, we find that Chief Wilt was simply not engaged in a quest for evidence of a crime. While his purported \u201cagent\u201d may have been so engaged based on his own motivation, we find that Chief Wilt, as the key governmental actor, was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-14\">The facts of record establish the genuine pre-search concern and sincerity on the part of ETSA Voitlein. In his testimony, he indicates he did not really want to know what was going on with Appellant that night in their room. However, what he did hear and observe bothered him enough so that it caused him not to sleep well, as he \u201cthought about it all night.\u201d Record at 61, 71. However, he failed to effectively or convincingly communicate this concern to Chief Wilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-15\">Chief Wilt\u2019s immediate response to ETSA Voitlein was to ask him the basis for his suspicions. ETSA Voitlein responded that Appellant had possessed illegal drugs in their room the previous evening. In his testimony at trial, Chief Wilt stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-16\">So I sort of snickered when he claimed, you know, because then I said, \u201cWell what do you mean he showed you the drugs?\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>And he said, \u201cWell he held up a vial or something.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell what did it look like, what was it?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell I really wasn\u2019t paying attention I was laying down trying to get to sleep. I really just didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Record at 79-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Chief Wilt indicated that while he had not previously suspected Appellant of being associated with illegal drugs, he did know that Appellant \u201cwas ADHD\u201d and might be taking medication, such as Ritalin, for that condition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 81. When asked if he actually suspected Appellant of possessing illegal substances even after ETSA Voitlein\u2019s expressions of concern, Chief Wilt repeatedly stated that he did not. <em>Id. </em>at 81, 82, 92-93. Even ETSA Voitlein perceived that fact after he spoke with Chief Wilt and was directed to return to the room and retrieve the questioned vial. When the military judge questioned ETSA Voitlein about why Chief Wilt did not accompany him to the room, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">Q: Was it your impression ... that [Chief Wilt] was busy and he couldn\u2019t physically remove himself from where he was or did he seem to indicate that there was some sort of prohibition on his going up there. A: I think it was more disbelief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Record at 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">Chief Wilt explained that he knew Appellant, based on prior \u201cencounters\u201d with him concerning \u201cminor infractions\u201d involving his failure to maintain proper room and uniform standards. <em>Id. </em>at 81-82. Chief Wilt stated that he expected when ETSA Voitlein returned from getting the questioned item from the barracks room as directed, \u201che was going to bring back a syringe of like flour, sugar, or something to that effect. Something-a joke in other words.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 82. Chief Wilt\u2019s testimony clearly established his belief that Appellant had merely been playing a \u201cjoke\u201d on his roommates. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">In response to subsequent questioning by the military judge, Chief Wilt indicated that prior to the day in question, ETSA Voitlein had expressed displeasure with some things Appellant had been doing. When asked if that prior knowledge of the apparently strained relationship between the two was a factor in his initial disbelief of ETSA Voitlein\u2019s statement about Appellant having drugs in the barracks, Chief Wilt responded that he believed that Appellant was merely \u201cirritating his roommate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-14\">If Chief Wilt had believed illegal drugs were in Appellant\u2019s room, we are fully confident that he would have responded to ETSA Voitlein\u2019s concern in a much different manner. As experienced military officers, there is no doubt in our collective minds that no chief petty officer in the U.S. Navy would give priority to a discussion about dust and gear adrift over the seizure of illegal drugs from the barracks. Had Chief Wilt believed that there could have been illegal drugs in the barracks, we are confident that he would have postponed his participation in the post-inspection debriefing until the matter of the illegal drugs had been properly addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-15\">Given Chief Wilt\u2019s honest belief that ETSA Voitlein\u2019s expressed concerns about Appellant actually having illegal drugs in their barracks room were unreasonable, we conclude that Chief Wilt\u2019s directions did not make ETSA Voitlein a Government agent on a quest for incriminating evidence. That being the case, there was no \u201csearch\u201d for which the Government is legally responsible such that it falls under the penumbra of the exclusionary remedy of Mil. R. Evid. 301(a). A \u201csearch\u201d that would have such implications is defined as: \u201cAn examination of a person\u2019s body, property, or other area that the person would reasonably expect to consider as private, conducted by a law enforcement officer for the purpose of finding evidence of a crime.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1351 (7th ed.1999). In <em>United States v. Hillan, </em>26 C.M.R. 771, 791, 1958 WL 3481 (N.B.R.1958), the Navy Board of Review defined such a \u201csearch\u201d as \u201ca \u2018quest\u2019 or a \u2018looking for\u2019 evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>denee of guilt to be used in a prosecution of a criminal action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Moreover, we find that when ETSA Voitlein actually seized the incriminating evidence, he was doing so out of a \u201cprivate motivation\u201d to protect his \u201cown personal interests.\u201d Among other things, including his desire to get the illegal drugs out of his room and thus insulate himself from possible criminal liability, ETSA Voitlein wanted to prove himself correct with respect to his representations to Chief Wilt. These private motivations insulated his action from the protections of the Fourth Amendment and the exclusionary effect of Mil. R. Evid. 301(a). <em>See United States v. Jacobs, </em>31 M.J. 138, 143 (C.M.A.1990), and <em>United States v. Volante, </em>4 C.M.A. 689, 691, 16 C.M.R. 263, 267, 1954 WL 2451 (1954); <em>see also United States v.

We hold that the military judge was correct when he concluded that \u201cthe facts do not support a finding that there was a search by a government official of the drawer.\u201d Appellate Exhibit IV at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">In <em>Portt, </em>the opinion the military judge cited in his written findings of fact and conclusions of law, our superior Court held that even the actions of a military policeman, when acting in a non-law enforcement capacity, do not fall within the parameters of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protections. <em>Portt, </em>21 M.J. at 334. Thus, even if one concludes that ETSA Voitlein received a derivative official-capacity/law-enforcement cloak of authority, which under the appropriate circumstances might bind the Government to the consequences of his actions, at the point when Chief Wilt sent him back to retrieve the questioned vial, we find that ETSA Voitlein, like the military policeman in <em>Portt, </em>seized the vial as \u201ca private individual not acting as an agent of the Government.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">For the reasons discussed above, we hold that the military judge ruled correctly that the questioned search and seizure did not violate the protections of the Fourth Amendment and the protections of Mil. R. Evid. 301(a). Therefore, Appellant is entitled to no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">Accordingly, we affirm the findings and sentence, as approved on review below.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-13\">Judge HARRIS concurs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b657-11\">.

It is an example of a case where one is not the mirror image of the other.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">An illicit drug \u2014 cocaine \u2014 was found in the appellant\u2019s personal possessions in his barracks room onboard Naval Submarine School, Groton, Connecticut.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The appellant had a pretrial agreement, by which the convening authority gave him confinement protection in return for his guilty plea. The appellant also executed a stipulation of fact in which he admitted his guilt. As promised, the appellant plead guilty at his special court-martial, after making, but losing, a motion seeking to suppress consideration of the cocaine \u2014 the very <em>corpus </em>of his crime \u2014 by the court, with the evidentiary issue being preserved for appellate review per Rule for Courts-Martial 910(a)(2), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2000 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Factually, there is no doubt the appellant committed the offense as alleged. Thus, he may be seen as \u201cmorally\u201d guilty of wrongfully possessing cocaine in his barracks room, a serious offense that is inimical to good order and discipline and the military mission. I respectfully disagree, however, with the majority opinion, which finds he is also \u201clegally\u201d guilty. I believe the act resulting in the seizure of the cocaine from a place everyone seems to agree was one in which the appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy at the time was not a \u201cprivate\u201d search. I believe it was an improper search conducted \u201cby a person acting in a governmental capacity,\u201d and that the seized cocaine should have been excluded from consideration at the appellant\u2019s court-martial. Mil. R. Evid. 311(a), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2000 ed.). By disagreeing with the majority\u2019s analysis of the legal issue concerning the validity of the search itself, consequently, I differ in the application of the standard of review to the military judge\u2019s evidentiary ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">\u201cThe proper standard of review \u2014 that is, the proper degree of deference an appellate court owes to any aspect of the lower court\u2019s decision \u2014 is a threshold issue in an appellate decision. It should be the starting point for the resolution of each separate issue in appeal.\u201d O\u2019Neill, <em>Standards of Review in Illinois Criminal Case: The Need for Major Reform, </em>17 So.Ill.U.L.J. 51 (1992), as quoted in 5 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment \u00a7 11.7(c) at 398 (3rd ed.1996)[hereinafter Search and Seizure].<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">I concur with the majority\u2019s general statement of the appropriate standard of review for this case, in that this Court reviews a military judge\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress proposed evidence for an abuse of discretion, with findings of fact not being overturned unless clearly erroneous and conclusions of law being reviewed <em>de novo. </em>As our senior Court has stated regarding the review of a military judge\u2019s evidentiary ruling; \u201c \u2018We will reverse ... if [the military judge\u2019s] decision is influenced by an erroneous view of the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number><em>Reister, </em>44 M.J. 409, 413 (1996)(quoting <em>United States v. Sullivan, </em>42 M.J. 360, 363 (1995)). I believe this to be the situation in this case, in that the military judge misapplied the law dealing with \u201cprivate searches\u201d to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">In reviewing factual determinations made by a trial judge \u2014 an empirical type process to establish the who-what-why-when-and-how factors in a case \u2014 appellate courts should pay a high degree of deference to the trial court, which is in the better position to evaluate and weigh the pertinent evidence relating to factual issues, while making credibility determinations during the live, in-court testimony of witnesses. Legal conclusions, however, require no such logical deference, as the appellate court, without the immediate and pressing duties and responsibilities involved in a live, ongoing trial, is in a just-as-good, or perhaps in a better position to examine questions of law with its collaborative, deliberative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Applying the fact-law distinction is complicated, however, in cases such as this one, with its mixed question of fact and law. The difficulty exists in attempting to \u201cunmix\u201d the issues, in order to be able to apply the clearly-erroneous standard to the factual aspects or issues, while reviewing the legal issues <em>de novo. </em>If uncertainty exists as to whether an issue is strictly a question of \u201cfact\u201d or of \u201claw\u201d in a case with questions that involve Constitutional rights, it should be reviewed, I believe, <em>de novo. See Ker v. California, </em>374 U.S. 23, 83 S.Ct. 1623,10 L.Ed.2d 726 (1963); 5 LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 11.7(c) at 404-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Application</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">I believe the military judge\u2019s pronouncement concerning the characterization of the search conducted by Electronics Technician Seaman Apprentice (ETSA) Voitlein, at the specific direction of Electronics Technician Chief Petty Officer (ETC)(SS) Wilt, is not a finding of fact, but rather a mixed question of fact and law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, the underlying facts, as determined by the military judge, should be severed and reviewed under a elearly-erroneous standard, while the ultimate question as to whether the established facts add up to a \u201cprivate search\u201d being conducted by ETSA Voitlein should be considered <em>de novo </em>by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">The determination of whether the search in issue in this case was \u201cprivate\u201d or Government-sanctioned is not driven by just a \u201cfactual determination,\u201d such as, perhaps, in those cases where the issue is whether \u201cconsent\u201d to a search was or was not given.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Rather, herein, it is a matter of applying the body of law surrounding \u201cprivate searches\u201d to the facts of the case. While one may verbalize or signal his or her consent to a search, such is not the situation with the legal concept of the private-versus-Government nature of the search questioned in this case, which calls for a conclusion of law, based on an analysis of the facts of the ease. After doing an appropriate <em>de novo </em>review, I believe ETSA Voitlein was acting as an agent of the Government, in a quest for evidence, when he seized the questioned vial from an area in which it is agreed the appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy at the time of the search and seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b660-12\">The basic, relevant facts of this case are not in dispute. ETSA Voitlein, a young Sail- or with 7 months of service in the Navy, knowing the extreme seriousness of an illicit drug being in his barracks room, was confronted with that situation, when one of his roommates \u2014 the appellant \u2014 announced that he had an illegal drug in a container. The appellant openly displayed the container to his two roommates and then secreted it in a drawer only a few feet away from ETSA Voitlein.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After trying but not succeeding in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>ignoring the appellant\u2019s actions with the proclaimed illegal substance, ETSA Voitlein spent a sleepless night worrying about the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The next morning \u2014 after passing on the opportunity to \u201cprivately\u201d remove the questioned container from the room and turn it in \u2014 ETSA Voitlein reported the situation, as required by Navy Regulations, to ETC(SS) Wilt, the Chief Petty Officer in his direct chain of command.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Chief Wilt, with 10 to 15 years of service in the Navy, and knowing his duty and responsibility regarding controlled substances <em>(see </em>U.S. Navy Regulations, Article 1138 (1990)),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> made a hasty, \u201cgut\u201d-reaction decision to disregard the potential validity of ETSA Voitlein\u2019s report, by sending him \u2014 a direction ETSA Voitlein interpreted to be an order \u2014 back to the room to retrieve the vial with whatever substance it might contain. Record at 54-57 (ETSA Collinge\u2019s testimony), 60-61, 67-68, 71 (ETSA Voitlein\u2019s testimony), 79-82 (ETC(SS) Wilt\u2019s testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">\u201cPrivate\u201d versus Government-sanctioned Searches</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">In the prominent \u201cprivate search\u201d cases, including those cited in the majority opinion, an individual, acting on his or her own initiative, seizes or otherwise obtains evidence, which he or she subsequently turns over to the Government. In those cases, the courts have held that the individuals were acting in a private capacity and not as agents of the Government, in that Government officials had no contemporaneous knowledge of the questioned search. <em>See United States v.

ETSA Voitlein was not acting in a private capacity when he seized the appellant\u2019s vial containing cocaine. ETSA Voitlein <em>could </em>have so acted, as he had the opportunity to do so <em>before </em>going to talk to Chief Wilt to seek guidance and direction. ETSA Voitlein, however, chose not to remove the vial from the appellant\u2019s nightstand before seeking out Chief Wilt. The record of trial clearly establishes that ETSA Voitlein genuinely was concerned about the presence in their barracks room of what the appellant had declared to be an illicit drug. At first he tried to ignore it, but the thought of it kept him from sleep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>ing well, if at all, that night. Choosing not to tell the two room inspectors the next morning, because he did not know them, as soon as the inspection was over, ETSA Voitlein sought out Chief Wilt, who was in ETSA Voitlein\u2019s direct chain of command. ETSA Voitlein told Chief Wilt his suspicions about the appellant having an illicit substance in their barracks room, based on what he had observed and what the appellant had said about the contents of the container the previous evening. <em>Only after </em>being directed to retrieve the questioned item from the room, direction that he took to be an order from one senior in his chain of command, did ETSA Voitlein return to the room and seize the vial, the contents of which was established to be cocaine. Record at 45, 49, 60-61, 64-67, 70-71, and 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">While the <em>corpus of </em>the military judge\u2019s legal analysis of the issue was ETSA Voitlein\u2019s motivation, which he concluded was of a non-Fourth Amendment-implicating private nature, the majority opinion herein states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0I\">However, we find Chief Wilt\u2019s knowledge and motivation equally, if not more, important. Indeed, the determining factor in whether or not the cocaine seizure was constitutional is what motivated Chief Wilt\u2019s directions to ETSA Voitlein. Were his directions part of a \u201csearch\u201d in a \u201cquest\u201d for incriminating evidence? <em>See generally Dow Chemical Co. v. United States, </em>476 U.S. 227, 230, 106 S.Ct. 1819, 90 L.Ed.2d 226 (1986). If so, we would find that Chief Wilt\u2019s statement, \u201cGo and get it,\u201d would have made ETSA Voitlein his agent in such a quest. Under the unique circumstances of this case, however, we find that Chief Wilt was simply not engaged in a quest for evidence of a crime. While his \u201cagent\u201d may have been so engaged on his own motivation, we find that Chief Wilt, as the key governmental actor, was not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">I certainly agree that as a Chief Petty Officer (E-7) in the United States Navy, Chief Wilt was the \u201ckey governmental actor\u201d in this case, and as a Chief Petty Officer, he is presumed to act with the color of Government authority in carrying out his official duties. By United States Navy Regulations, as well as time-honored tradition, Chief Wilt is charged with the general duty to ensure the maintenance of good order and discipline within the Naval Service, and he had a specific responsibility within the Naval Submarine School, where he was assigned as the Military Training Instructor Leading Chief and, as such, was in the direct chain of command of both the appellant and ETSA Voitlein, a situation that certainly creates a strong inference of Government action in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">In <em>United States v. Loukas, </em>our senior Court restated the point that the Court \u201chas implicitly held that a superior in the immediate chain of command of the suspect subordinate will normally be presumed to be acting in a command disciplinary function.\u201d 29 M.J. 385, 389 n. * (C.M.A.1990). While the declaration was made in the context of the requirement for rights advisement prior to questioning, I believe the underlying rationale for the declaration is applicable to the situation in this case. Chief Wilt was acting in an official capacity and, likewise, ETSA Voitlein was carrying out an official function when he retrieved the vial at the specific direction of Chief Wilt. The majority opinion, nonetheless, concludes that, since Chief Wilt personally believed the allegation was \u201ctotally unfounded,\u201d his directions to ETSA Voitlein did not make ETSA Voitlein a Government agent on a quest for incriminating evidence. Thus, the linchpin of the majority opinion is Chief Wilt\u2019s motivation at the time he told ETSA Voitlein to retrieve the vial.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">Motivation as a Factor</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">While relevant motivation is the keystone to some of the most seminal private-search cases, in those instances the outcome-determinative motivation has been that of the individual who actually took the action later judicially identified to have been a \u201cprivate search\u201d without Fourth Amendment implications. <em>See Coolidge, </em>403 U.S. at 448 \u2014 49, 91 S.Ct. 2022; <em>Reister, </em>44 M.J. at 416; <em>Portt, </em>21 M.J. at 334; <em>Volante, </em>4 C.M.A. at 690-93, 16 C.M.R. at 264-67; <em>Bruci, </em>52 M.J. at 754. Such is not the fact pattern in this case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>A better analogy to consider the pivotal role of Chief Wilt\u2019s motivation in this case can be developed from a comparison of this case to several of the significant sans-rights-warning-incriminating-statement eases, such as <em>Norris, Loukas, </em>and <em>Duga, </em>where the motivation of the questioner is the decision-determinative factor.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In each of these cases, however, the primary and controlling motivation on the part of the questioner is clearly established, respectively, as either a personal concern about a family member, an aviation safety issue, or a friend\u2019s curiosity.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">In this case, while Chief Wilt might have thought the appellant\u2019s actions the previous evening were a matter of the appellant just playing around, certainly ETSA Voitlein\u2014 the one who actually seized the drug that was the I-beam of the Government\u2019s prosecution of the appellant \u2014 was sincere in his belief that it was no joke. In addressing ETSA Voitlein\u2019s \u201cprivate\u201d motivation, the majority opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\">Moreover, we find that when ETSA Voitlein actually seized the incriminating evidence, he was doing so out of a \u201cprivate motivation\u201d to protect his \u201cown personal interests.\u201d Among other things, including his desire to get the illegal drugs out of his room and thus insulate himself from possible criminal liability, ETSA Voitlein wanted to prove himself correct with respect to his representations to Chief Wilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Clearly one may infer ETSA Voitlein\u2019s actions, in part, were motivated by a desire to ensure he was not wrongly caught up in the appellant\u2019s personal possession of an illegal substance in their shared barracks room. However, I am not sure how that serves to support a search-motivated-by-private-interests conclusion. ETSA Voitlein could have acted on his own, seized the vial, and brought it directly to Chief Wilt; thus saving all parties, including the apparently very busy Chief Wilt, a lot of time. Yet, it is precisely because of his desire to \u201cinsulate himself from possible criminal liability\u201d that he did not act on his own, but rather he went to talk to Chief Wilt, before seizing the vial of cocaine at Chief Wilt\u2019s specific direction. <em>Id. </em>Due to the obvious potential legal-liability dangers inherent in any self-help (personal) effort, ETSA Voitlein consciously and actively sought out Government-sponsorship and direction for the drug decontamination of his barracks room. It may be inferred that he did not want to walk around on his own call carrying a vial containing an illegal substance, running the risk of not being believed when he tried to explain the circumstances to his chain of command.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">However, given the obvious personal element, ETSA Voitlein\u2019s desire and efforts to act in accordance with the Navy\u2019s policy concerning illegal substances should neither be overlooked nor discounted as a motivational factor. When asked during his trial testimony about his knowledge of an individual service member\u2019s duty to help prevent drug abuse, he answered he believed that it was \u201c[t]o go to someone in your chain of command and tell them.\u201d Record at 69. Finally, I see neither value added by, nor any support in the Record for, the majority\u2019s assertion that part of ETSA Voitlein\u2019s motivation in seizing the appellant\u2019s vial of cocaine was that he \u201cwanted to prove himself correct with respect to his representations to Chief Wilt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AHV\">\u201cSilver Platter\u201d Doctrine Analogy</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">Perhaps an even more useful analogy for the motivational approach in examining the case-crucial private-versus-Government-search issue in this case may be to consider the analytical concepts developed in connection with the now-antiquated \u201csilver platter\u201d doctrine. Although the doctrine is no longer a viable evidence-introducing vehicle, the analysis developed to determine whether Federal officials had participated in a state search sufficiently to prevent the introduction of improperly-seized evidence in Federal court is helpful in this case, in deciding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>whether Chief Wilt\u2019s participation in ETSA Voitlein\u2019s seizure of the vial was sufficient to metamorphose the search from a \u201cprivate\u201d one to a Government-sponsored quest for incriminating evidence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">The Supreme Court, in <em>Byars v. United States, </em>provided a caution in examining \u201csilver platter\u201d cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">While it is true that the <em>mere </em>participation in a state search of one who is a federal officer does not render it a federal undertaking, the court must be vigilant to scrutinize the attendant facts with an eye to detect and a hand to prevent violations of the Constitution by circuitous and indirect methods.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">273 U.S. at 32, 47 S.Ct. 248. And in <em>Lustig v. United States, </em>the Court provided the key to its analysis of the \u201csilver platter\u201d cases, which we can analogize to this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">The decisive factor in determining the applicability of the <em>Byars </em>case is the actuality of a share by a federal official in the total enterprise of securing and selecting evidence by other than sanctioned means.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axq\">338 U.S. at 79, 69 S.Ct. 1372.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Making the analogy to the concept of private searches, and after applying these \u201csilver-plate\u201d doctrine standards to the facts of this case, the conclusion is, that while I believe the actions and motivations of Chief Wilt were as he stated in his testimony and not a subterfuge for any type of improper Government action to secure incriminating evidence against the appellant, \u201cthe actuality of a share by a federal official in the total enterprise of securing and selecting evidence by other than sanctioned means\u201d was paramount and controlling in the seizure of the most critical, case-outcome-determinative evidence against the appellant in this ease \u2014 the cocaine itself. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, I believe it reaches the level of a Fourth Amendment transgression.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">I base this conclusion on the fact that ETSA Voitlein could have seized the vial on his own accord, but did not. As required by service regulations, as discussed above, he reported the information concerning the illegal substance to the Chief Petty Officer in his direct chain of command. <em>Only after </em>being directed, or \u2014 from his perspective, ordered \u2014 by Chief Wilt to go and retrieve the vial did ETSA Voitlein return to the barracks room and seize the vial of cocaine. Thus, from the facts established in the Record, but for Chief Wilt\u2019s direction to ETSA Voitlein to go and retrieve the questioned vial, the seizure might not have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">It is beyond the scope of this Court\u2019s consideration to speculate either as to what ETSA Voitlein might have done if Chief Wilt had not told him to go get the questioned vial, or as to what higher authority or law-enforcement personnel may have done if Chief Wilt had taken ETSA Voitlein and his information to one of those entities.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court stated in <em>United States v. Jacobsen:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-13\">Such a warrantless search could not be characterized as reasonable simply because, after the official invasion of privacy occurred, contraband is discovered.... The reasonableness of an official invasion of the citizen\u2019s privacy must be appraised on the basis of the facts as they existed at the time that invasion occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-14\">466 U.S. at 114-15,104 S.Ct. 1652.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-15\">Agency Theory</p>\n<p id=\"b664-16\">\n<em>Qui mandat ipse fecisse videtur.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b664-17\">A person who commands (a thing to be done)is considered to have done it him<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>self.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">The majority opinion is based on the premise that, since Chief Wilt did not actually believe the appellant had an illegal substance in the barracks when he directed ETSA Voitlein to go and get the substance, nothing ETSA Voitlein, as Chief Wilt\u2019s \u201cagent,\u201d believed, said, or did could transform the seizure into a quest for incriminating evidence by a Government agent. The majority opinion seems to be attempting to turn the basic principles of \u201cagency\u201d on its head. In <em>Reister, </em>44 M.J. at 415, our senior Court adopted the agency test used by the Supreme Court in <em>Coolidge, </em>403 U.S. at 487, 91 S.Ct. 2022, when that Court articulated the test as \u201cwhether Mrs. Coolidge, in light of all the circumstances of the case must be regarded as having acted as an \u2018instrument\u2019 or agent of the state when she produced her husband\u2019s belongings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Clearly in this case, ETSA Voitlein was the agent, the direct instrument, of Chief Wilt\u2019s bidding, doing exactly what the Chief had directed him to do. Considering the agency concept, this is not even a close case, where the Government is being held accountable for the consequences of its agent\u2019s unforeseen actions, because those actions were found to have been at least remotely motivated by a purpose to serve the interests of the Government. Rather, to borrow from another Supreme Court decision, vicarious liability should be imposed \u201con the ground that the [S]ailor\u2019s conduct \u2018was not so \u201cunforeseeable\u201d as to make it unfair to charge the Government with responsibility.\u2019 \u201d <em>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 U.S. 775, 795, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998)(quoting <em>Ira S. Bushey &amp; Sons, Inc. v. United States, </em>398 F.2d 167, 171 (2nd Cir.1968)).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Bottom line: (a) In seizing \u2014 without appropriate command authority \u2014 the cocaine from an area in which the appellant enjoyed a legitimate expectation of privacy, ETSA Voitlein did <em>exactly </em>what Chief Wilt directed (ordered) him to do; and (b) The Government is accountable for that conduct, regardless of what Chief Wilt personally and privately did or did not believe.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the motivation/actual beliefs of Chief Wilt determine the outcome of the search and seizure issue in this case, his beliefs would have to be <em>both </em>honest and reasonable. While I agree with the majority opinion that Chief Wilt <em>honestly </em>did not believe ETSA Voitlein to be correct in his allegations against the appellant, I do not agree, from either a traditions-of-the-Navy or a legal-analysis perspective, that Chief Wilt was \u201creasonable\u201d in either his disbelief, or in his resulting somewhat legally-irresponsible actions. I believe that, based on his position of authority and responsibility both within the Navy and, specifically, at the Naval Submarine School, Chief Wilt had a duty to handle the situation with proper legal protocol, with which he indicated he was familiar, when he testified: \u201c[I]f there\u2019s ever an accusation or there\u2019s ever any sort of nod toward possibly being drugs I should probably, okay, stop, all stop, call legal---- That\u2019s my understanding of the procedure if we stumble upon drugs or anything ... contact legal.\u201d Record at 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">Additionally, an inference can be drawn from Chief Wilt\u2019s testimony that at the time he did have some legal knowledge or training, and, at least fleetingly so, he did think about the legal ramifications of the situation. Before directing ETSA Voitlein to go and retrieve the questioned vial, Chief Wilt asked him if the vial was in a drawer within the appellant\u2019s wall locker, or was \u201cout in one of the common area drawers of the room.\u201d Record at 80. When ETSA Voitlein told him it was not in the appellant\u2019s wall locker, Chief Wilt then directed him to go get it. <em>Id. </em>Thus, it appears Chief Wilt knew something about the importance of the legal distinction between an item being in one\u2019s wall locker, with a generally-accepted expectation of privacy in that area, and items located in a \u201ccommon area,\u201d where, commonly, an individual does not enjoy such an expectation.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>As he testified, Chief Wilt knew the proper procedure to follow upon receiving an allegation of at least of some credibility, coming as it did from an eye witness, was to call Legal. He also seems to have indicated by his testimony that, perhaps, he had some knowledge of the \u201ccommon-area\u201d factor in a barracks search-and-seizure situation, although he was wrong in its application to the facts of this case. This is not to imply that Chief Wilt was being less-than-completely truthful in his testimony, but it does create an inference that Chief Wilt has, as any Chief Petty Officer in the Navy should, some background and familiarity with the procedurally-proper way to deal with situations such as the one that forms the basis of this case. While Chief Wilt may not have cognizably considered the legal implications of the circumstances at the time, it appears that he had some grasp of the legal concepts involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">If Chief Wilt actually gave any thought to the legal ramifications of directing ETSA Voitlein to retrieve the vial, he chose to ignore them, because he just did not believe that the appellant had an illicit drug in the barracks room. I disagree with the majority opinion that Chief Wilt made a legally-reasonable decision. While, as Chief Wilt himself points out, he had no formal law-enforcement training, I place little weight on that fact. Record at 74. As an E-7 and in the position of responsibility he held, I believe an inference can (and <em>should) </em>be made that Chief Wilt knew or is accountable for knowing how to correctly handle the factual situation presented to him in this ease. Quite simply, Chief Wilt was busy. He neither took the time to conduct a proper inquiry himself, nor make the minimal effort to get ETSA Voitlein to someone with law enforcement or legal knowledge or responsibilities.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Chief Wilt quickly concluded that the appellant must have been playing a joke on ETSA Voitlein and did not, in fact, have an illicit drug in their room. He based this conclusion on his past history with the appellant and his belief that the appellant did not have the \u201cguts\u201d to do such a thing, as he considered the appellant \u201csort of weak.\u201d Record at 82; <em>see also </em>Record at 80-82, 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">The majority opinion analyzes <em>why </em>Chief Wilt did not believe that the appellant had an illegal substance in the barracks room as ETSA Voitlein reported. However, I believe that is extraneous to our consideration of this case, in that in his testimony, Chief Wilt indicated that at the time he did not think through why he did not believe ETSA Voitlein\u2019s allegation. When asked if his many years of experience in the Navy in dealing with Sailors disgruntled with a roommate was one of the things that prompted him not to believe ETSA Voitlein\u2019s story, Chief Wilt responded: \u201cYou know at the time, sir, I really \u2014 the thought process of why I didn\u2019t believe it, I wasn\u2019t really analyzing why I didn\u2019t believe it at the time but I guess in retrospect____\u201d Record at 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">I understand one might argue that these factors are important to consider, because, although Chief Wilt did not consciously consider them before he made his snap call, they were part of the cognitive process by which he formed his overall opinion of the appellant. And it was his overall opinion of the appellant upon which he based his almost-instantly-reached conclusion that the appellant would not actually bring an illegal drug into the barracks. My point is that \u2014 regardless of what other relevant facts they might <em>know </em>\u2014 we limit our review of a magistrate\u2019s probable-cause determination to the information the seekers of the search warrant <em>actually </em>related to the magistrate.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Likewise, I believe, since Chief Wilt, by his actions, made himself the pseudo/virtual \u201cmagistrate\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>this case, we are so limited in our review of the decision he made to the things that he actually \u201carticulated\u201d in his own mind, before reaching his conclusion on the merits of ETSA Voitlein\u2019s accusation. If we do so, what we are left with as Chief Wilt\u2019s conscious basis for not believing ETSA Voitlein\u2019s timely, eye-witness-based assertions is: Chief Wilt believed the appellant was somewhat \u201cweak\u201d and did not have the \u201cguts\u201d to possess an illegal substance in his barracks room.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Interestingly, if one carries through with the analogy that Chief Wilt made himself the functional equivalent of a magistrate in the real-time adjudication of the search issue, the conclusion is that while he found <em>no </em>probable cause, nevertheless, by directing ETSA Voitlein to go and retrieve the vial, he \u201cauthorized\u201d the search anyway!</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">In its analysis of the case-outcome-determinative issue of whether the seizure of the vial of cocaine by ETSA Voitlein was a \u201cprivate search,\u201d the majority opinion quotes the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Jacobsen, </em>in which the Court'stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">This Court has also consistently construed [the Fourth Amendment] protection as proscribing only governmental action; it is wholly inapplicable \u201cto a search or seizure, even an unreasonable one, effected by a private individual not acting as an agent of the Government or with the participation or knowledge of any governmental official.\u201d <em>Walter v. United States, </em>447 U.S. 649, 662, 100 S.Ct. 2395, 65 L.Ed.2d 410 (1980)(Blackmun, J., dissenting).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">466 U.S. at 113-14, 104 S.Ct. 1652. As discussed above, ETSA Voitlein was \u201cacting as an agent of the Government,\u201d with the specific direction and \u201cknowledge of [a] governmental official,\u201d Chief Wilt. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">Fourth Amendment Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b667-11\">In its 1914 decision in <em>Weeks v.

The efforts of the courts and their officials to bring the guilty to punishment, praiseworthy as they are, are not to be aided by the sacrifice of those great principles established by years of endeavor and suffering which has resulted in their embodiment in the fundamental law of the land.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-14\">232 U.S. 383, 391-93, 34 S.Ct. 341, 58 L.Ed. 652 (1914)(emphasis added).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-15\">The appellant is no less entitled to the citizen protections established in the Constitution than any other U.S. citizen, based either on his military status or the fact that he, in fact, committed criminal misconduct. It is well-recognized judicially that \u201c\u2018[t]he military constitutes a specialized community governed by a separate discipline from that of the civilian,\u2019 <em>Orloffv. Willoughby, </em>345 U.S. 83, 94, 73 S.Ct. 534, 97 L.Ed. 842 (1953), and that \u2018the rights of men [and women] in the armed forces must perforce be conditioned to meet certain overriding demands of discipline and duty____\u2019 <em>Burns v.

While his military status does not affect the appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights in this case, it does affect how we should consider the conduct of Chief Wilt and his position, authority, and responsibilities in the <em>command\u2019s hierarchical structure of discipline. </em>This case thus highlights the events-shaping effects within the military structure dictated by the \u201c \u2018overriding demands of discipline and duty.\u2019\u201d <em>Burns v. Wilson, </em>346 U.S. at 140, 73 S.Ct. 1045. As the Supreme Court concluded in <em>Chappell v. Wallace, </em>462 U.S. 296, 300, 103 S.Ct. 2362, 76 L.Ed.2d 586 (1983):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-5\">This becomes imperative in combat, but conduct in combat inevitably reflects the training that precedes combat; for that reason, centuries of experience have developed a hierarchical structure of discipline and obedience to command, unique in its application to the military establishment and wholly different from civilian patterns.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">As discussed below, Chief Wilt is part of the command\u2019s \u201chierarchical structure of discipline,\u201d with all that status inherently implies. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">\u201cAsk the Chief\u2019 \u2014 Role of the Chief Petty Officer</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">While Chief Wilt indicated he has never received any formal law enforcement training, I do not give much weight to that fact.

Chief Wilt is not merely an E-7 in the rank hierarchy; he is a Chief Petty Officer in the United States Navy, within which the phrase \u201cAsk the Chief\u2019 is one of the Naval Service\u2019s cardinal tenets.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-12\">In the United States Navy, the title \u201cChief Petty Officer\u201d carries with it responsibilities and privileges no other armed force in the world grants enlisted people.

Be thorough in all you do and require of your subordinates thoroughness and military exactitude.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">Point being: Chief Wilt is a part of the command\u2019s \u201chierarchical structure of discipline.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A Chief Petty Officer\u2019s position, responsibilities, and authority is such within a command\u2019s leadership structure, that he or she is part of that select group that would be included in the net cast by our senior Court when it stated: \u201cThis Court has implicitly held that a superior in the immediate chain of command of the suspect subordinate will normally be presumed to be acting in a command function.\u201d <em>Loukas, </em>29 M.J. at 389 n. *.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">While not equating Chief Wilt\u2019s actions with being part of the law enforcement arm of the command, the majority opinion does identify him as \u201cthe key governmental actor.\u201d If one, however, does believe Chief Wilt\u2019s actions in this case are part of the command\u2019s disciplinary arm, it would cast a significantly different light on the way the case is decided. As the Court of Military Appeals indicated in <em>United States v. Volante: </em>\u201cIn the military establishment, law enforcement is frequently an integral part of the broader problem of command.\u201d 4 C.M.A. at 692, 16 C.M.R. at 266. For all the reasons discussed above, I believe Chief Wilt is (and was the day in question) \u2014 by rank and position definition \u2014 a viable part of the command\u2019s disciplinary arm, and, thus, his actions, or lack thereof, should be scrutinized accordingly.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-14\">Concomitant with such events-sculpturing authority comes accountability. As the Supreme Court concluded in <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 392, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-15\">An agent acting \u2014 -albeit unconstitutionally \u2014 in the name of the United States possesses a far greater capacity for harm than an individual trespasser exercising no authority other than his own.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-16\">While I do not believe that Chief Wilt had any improper motives in the way he handled the situation that confronted and tested his leadership skills in this case, for all the reasons discussed above, I believe Chief Wilt\u2014 and, consequentially, the Government\u2014 should be held accountable for his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-17\">At the time the events central to this case occurred, Chief Wilt was directly responsible for 240 young, relatively-new-to-the-Navy Sailors, who were students at the Naval Submarine School. Record at 76. The Naval Service is a part of our society where general-military or mission-specific necessity sometimes requires modification or the limitation of a Sailor\u2019s or a Marine\u2019s Constitutional rights, as a price to pay for the privilege of serving one\u2019s Country. Those who claim such military necessity or who violate a service member\u2019s rights without other just cause should be held to a high standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-18\">In doing that we attempt to balance and weigh the relevant interests of all concerned. On one side of the scale in this case, we have the Fourth Amendment rights of the appellant. On the other side are: the actions of ETSA Voitlein, who properly reports to the Chief Petty Officer in his chain of command <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>his eye-witness account of the appellant\u2019s public secretion of an announced illegal substance in their barracks room the previous evening; the gut-reaction of Chief Wilt, who knew the proper legal procedure to follow upon receiving such an allegation, but who almost instantly concludes the allegation is without any merit, because, in his estimation, the appellant was \u201cweak,\u201d without the \u201cguts\u201d to do such a thing as have an illegal drug in the barracks; and Chief Wilt\u2019s direction to ETSA Voitlein just to go get the substance, when Chief Wilt could have just as easily told him to secure the room, until the master-at-arms arrived to take control of the situation.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Exclusionary Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">A separate, but equally important, issue is whether the physical evidence in this case should have been excluded from consideration at the appellant\u2019s court-martial. In <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 223, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983),<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-6\">The question whether the exclusionary rule\u2019s remedy is appropriate in a particular context has long been regarded as an issue separate from the question whether the Fourth Amendment rights of the party seeking to invoke the rule were violated by the police conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">The Supreme Court has restricted application of the exclusionary rule \u201c \u2018to those areas where its remedial objectives are most efficaciously served.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Payner, </em>447 U.S. 727, 734, 100 S.Ct. 2439, 65 L.Ed.2d 468 (1980) (quoting <em>United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 348, 94 S.Ct. 613, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">Application of the Exclusionary Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">The fact that Chief Wilt and ETSA Voitlein seem to have acted in \u201cgood faith\u201d is commendable, but not controlling. In <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984), the Supreme Court put it in this perspective:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-11\">\u201c \u2018[Gjood faith on the part of the arresting officer is not enough.\u2019 <em>Henry v. United States, </em>361 U.S. 98, 102, 80 S.Ct. 168, 4 L.Ed.2d 134 [ (1959) ]. If subjective good faith alone were the test, the protections of the Fourth Amendment would evaporate, and the people would be \u2018secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,\u2019 only in the discretion of the police. <em>Id. </em>at 97, 85 S.Ct., at 228.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 915 n. 13,104 S.Ct. 3405.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-13\">There is a tendency to view any relief to the appellant in this case as a windfall to one who well-deserves the criminal conviction and punishment adjudged at trial. Applying the exclusionary rule in this case, however, will efficaciously serve its remedial objectives and not just merely set a guilty man free. Consider the following thoughts from cases where the Supreme Court and our own senior Court have wrestled with this difficult issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-14\">It may be that it is the obnoxious thing in its mildest and least repulsive form; but illegitimate and unconstitutional practices get their first footing that way, namely, by silent approaches and slight deviations from legal modes of procedure. This can only be obviated by adhering to the rule that constitutional provisions for the security of person and property should be liberally construed. A close and literal construction deprives them of half their efficacy, and leads to gradual depreciation of the right, as if consisted more in sound than in substance.

They are \u2018to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available way \u2014 by removing the incentive to disregard it.\u2019 \u201d The Court went on in <em>Coolidge </em>to add: \u201cBut it is no part of the policy underlying the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to discourage citizens from aiding to the utmost of their ability in the apprehension of criminals.\u201d <em>Coolidge, </em>403 U.S. at 488, 91 S.Ct. 2022.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">As discussed below, I do not believe that the application of the exclusionary rule in this case will discourage anyone from doing his or her duty in regards to the maintenance of good order and discipline. In <em>Calandra, </em>414 U.S. at 348, 94 S.Ct. 613, the Supreme Court concluded: \u201cThis standing rule is premised on a recognition that the need for deterrence and hence the rationale for excluding the evidence are strongest where the Government\u2019s unlawful conduct would result in imposition of a criminal sanction on the victim of the search.\u201d Such is the circumstance in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Finally, our senior Court in <em>United States v. Khamsouk, </em>57 M.J. 282, 292 (2002) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A41\">Thus, in determining whether invocation of the [exclusionary] rule is warranted, the [Supreme] Court insists that lower courts strike a balance between \u201cthe public interest in determination of truth at trial\u201d and the \u201cincremental contribution that might [be] made to the protection of Fourth Amendment values____\u201d <em>Stone [v. Powell], </em>428 U.S. [465] at 488, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 [ (1976) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">While this dissent is in no way intended to imply any malicious or otherwise improper motives on the part of Chief Wilt, one can easily see the potential for abuse of which our senior Court and the Supreme Court speak in the decisions cited. The Constitutional rights of a service member are far too important, not to have official actions that directly and adversely impact on them thought through thoroughly, with some degree of reasonable care and with the minimal effort most often sufficient to follow the correct, legal, and established procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">For all the reasons stated and discussed above, I believe the finding of a Fourth Amendment violation, by holding the Government accountable for the actions of Chief Wilt \u2014 via his \u201cagent,\u201d ETSA Voitlein \u2014 and the application of the exclusionary rule to the evidence seized in this case, will efficaciously serve the remedial objectives of the rule. It should in no way discourage individual Sailors and Marines from continuing to do their duty in taking appropriate reporting action, regarding criminal misconduct of which they may become aware. This dissent does not question the propriety of the actions of ETSA Voitlein. I also believe that the course of action recommended by this dissent makes a positive, not a negative, statement about the critical and events-altering authority and responsibility incumbent on the command positions inherently held by Chief Petty Officers and above. It fortifies, not denigrates, that status and authority. Hopefully, it will encourage all those in a position of such authority to give proper and due consideration to information such as that provided by ETSA Voitlein to Chief Wilt, and it will foster appropriate action to balance the rights of the individual Sailor and Marine with military necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-13\">Given the circumstance that he actually did the crime as charged and convicted (and, thus, is \u201cmorally guilty\u201d), the appellant may not \u201cdeserve\u201d relief in this case, but such is demanded as his birthright as an American citizen, because, in my opinion, he was not convicted in accordance with the rules and procedures that must be honored before one may be found \u201clegally\u201d guilty. To overturn the appellant\u2019s conviction would not be a travesty; it would be a positive statement for the military justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-14\">Reversing the findings of a trial judge, as discussed above, is not something to be done in a cavalier manner by appellate judges sitting in Washington, D.C., so far removed in time and place from real-time Fleet opera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>tions. As it should be, the standards to be met in order to do so are high. Our senior Court provided us with a vivid sensory perception to apply to the reversal standard, when it stated: \u201c[I]t must be \u2018more than just maybe or probably wrong; it must ... strike us as wrong with the force of a five-week-old, unrefrigerated dead fish.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. French, </em>38 M.J. 420, 425 (C.M.A.1993)(quoting <em>Parts and Electric Motors Inc. v. Sterling Electric, Inc., </em>866 F.2d 228, 233 (7th Cir.1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">The smell in this case is not that of old, dead fish, but rather it is the scent of the thick, foggy mist of musket fire that more than two and a quarter centuries ago drifted over the fields at Lexington and Concord.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">\u201cWhen we assumed the Soldier,____\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b658-7\">.

Saying that this is a \"simple\u201d case in no way implies that it is an <em>easy </em>one, with answers anyone should be able to readily see and agree upon. When first considering the facts, the \"reasonable\u201d outcome of the case <em>seems </em>simple and clear, but upon closer consideration \u2014 through the deliberative process of applying case facts to the relevant and applicable concepts of law \u2014 it quickly becomes evident that getting to the ultimate answer, in fact, is a very difficult task. When that process is finally completed and the case outcome begins to take focus, however, the \"answer\" once again <em>appears </em>to be simple, regardless of where and on which \"side\u201d an individual finally settles on the issues. Thus, this case presents many judicial challenges, whose <em>alpha </em>and <em>omega </em>reflect a mirage of simplicity, when, in reality, it is a case with complex issues upon which reasonable minds certainly may legitimately differ. <em>\"Alpha\" </em>and <em>\"omega\" </em>are the first and last characters, respectively, of the Greek alphabet.

In the realm of criminal law, I would distinguish between \"legal\u201d and \"moral\u201d guilt as follows: If one <em>in fact </em>does a prohibited act, he or she is \"morally\u201d guilty of the offense. To also be found \u201clegally\u201d guilty of the act (and, therefore, be formally punished under our legal system) the individual also would have to be so found per the rules, standards, and procedures that form the basis of the judicial proceedings considering the charged offense. Hopefully more often than not the two match up in a given case; however, sometimes, as in \u2014 I believe \u2014 this case, they do not. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th ed.1999) at pages: (1025) Morality: Conforming with recognized rules of correct conduct; (1606) Moral wrong: An act that is contrary to the rule of natural justice; (905) Legally: In a lawful way; in a manner that accords with the law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b659-12\">.
