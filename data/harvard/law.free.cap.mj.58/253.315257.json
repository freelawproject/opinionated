Appellant was sentenced by a panel of officer members to a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for nine months, total forfeitures, and reduction to E-1. The convening authority reduced the forfeitures but otherwise approved this sentence. The Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings and sentence in an unpublished opinion. <em>United States v.

DuBay, </em>17 C.M.A. 147, 37 C.M.R. 411 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">\n<em>Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">Several weeks before Appellant\u2019s court-martial, the convening authority held a Commander\u2019s Call, at which many of the convening authority\u2019s subordinate commanders were present. One of the things the convening authority spoke about at that meeting was military justice, and exactly what he said became a topic of voir dire at Appellant\u2019s court-martial.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">During group voir dire of the nine original court members, the military judge asked: \u201cDoes any member, having read these Charges and Specifications, believe that you would be compelled to vote for any particular punishment, solely because of the nature of these offenses?\u201d Ml the members responded in the negative. The military judge then further asked: \u201cCan each of you be fair, impartial, [and] open-minded in your consideration of an appropriate sentence?\u201d All the members responded in the affirmative. Trial defense counsel also asked the members: \u201cDo any of you feel that such an offense, using ecstasy, would require a specific \u00a1punishment?\u201d Again, they all responded in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-13\">Thereafter, trial defense counsel asked them: \u2018Was anyone \u2014 did anyone here attend [the convening authority\u2019s] Commander\u2019s Call several weeks ago?\u201d In answer, four members stated they attended the meeting and five stated they did not. The four who attended were Colonel (Col) Berry, Lieutenant Colonel (LtCol) Spence, LtCol Freeman, and Major (Maj) Robertson. Following up on these responses, trial defense counsel questioned Col Berry and LtCol Spence individually about the Commander\u2019s Call. LtCol Freeman and Maj Robertson were not questioned individually about this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-14\">As to Col Berry, trial defense counsel asked: \u201c[T]he Commander\u2019s Call that you went to ... do you remember [the convening authority] mentioning anything about drug use on base?\u201d Col Berry answered: \u2018Yes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>he was very emphatic about \u2014 and I don\u2019t think he used these words \u2014 but, essentially, that drug use was inconsistent with military service.\u201d As to LtCol Spence, trial defense counsel asked: \u201c[The] Commander\u2019s Call that you went to a couple of weeks ago. Do you remember if he said anything about drug use?\u201d LtCol Spence answered: \u201c \u2018It seems like it\u2019s prevalent here on the Gulf Coast.\u2019 I\u2019m going to assume that he did the normal commander thing and then said, \u2018It\u2019s not compatible with military service.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">In response to further questioning by trial defense counsel, Col Berry and LtCol Spence each indicated that no specific reference was made at the Commander\u2019s Call to Appellant or his impending court-martial.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">At the conclusion of individual voir dire, three court members were challenged off the panel, including Col Berry. This left six court members to hear the contested portion of the case and then to adjudge an appropriate sentence. Of those six, three attended the Commander\u2019s Call, including LtCol Spence, who served as the president of the court-martial panel. The other three panel members did not attend the meeting, and a post-trial letter written, by one of them\u2014 Second Lieutenant (2Lt) Greer \u2014 lies at the heart of this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">After appellant\u2019s court-martial, 2Lt Greer, the junior member of the court-martial panel, provided trial defense counsel a letter for submission to the convening authority as part of Appellant\u2019s request for clemency.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The letter described four concerns 2Lt Greer had regarding the panel members\u2019 sentencing deliberations. First, she worried that \u201ceveryone did not agree that [Appellant\u2019s mental illness] should be considered as a mitigating factor.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Second, she believed that because one member stated Appellant would be enrolled in a substance abuse program if he was further confined,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the other members \u201ctook it as fact and used it in their decision making process.\u201d Third, she noted that \u201ca couple of panel members expressed the notion that a Bad Conduct Discharge was a \u2018given\u2019 for a person with these charges[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-14\">Finally, 2Lt Greer found \u201cmost disconcerting ... the mention of a recent Commander\u2019s Call in which [the convening authority] was said to have discussed the increasing problem of Ecstacy use[.]\u201d In that regard, she wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-15\">[A] panel member reminded us that our sentence would be reviewed by the convening authority and we needed to make sure our sentence was sending a consistent message. Another member pointed out that we needed to make sure it didn\u2019t look like we took the charges too lightly because those reviewing our sentence wouldn\u2019t necessarily be aware of the mitigating factors. He or she said it was especially important because our names would be identified as panel members.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-16\">\n<em>Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b315-17\">Having received this letter, trial defense counsel requested that the military judge convene a post-trial session pursuant to Article 89(a) so the defense could question the members about these matters. The military judge denied the request, however, and ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-18\">That some members may have concluded [the accused\u2019s mental illness] deserved less weight than 2Lt Greer does not warrant such an invasion into their deliberative process. Also, that some member(s) might think that lengthier confinement might provide the accused with more treatment options is again a deliberative process this court does not feel appropriate to invade. Similarly, after having heard all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>facts in this ease, if some member[s] felt a bad conduct discharge was a \u201cgiven\u201d in this ease, that does not impeach their responses during voir dire that they were not predisposed to giving such a sentence____ ... There is no evidence that anyone within the panel exerted any command influence over any other panel member[,] and any references to [the convening authority\u2019s Commander\u2019s Call] during the deliberative process did not appear to chill the deliberative process____ This court does not find it appropriate to violate the sanctity of the deliberative process based upon the statement provided by 2Lt Greer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">At the Court of Criminal Appeals, Appellant \u201cconcede[d] that most of the \u2018areas of concern\u2019 in the [letter] do not call into question the validity of his sentence.\u201d <em>Dugan, </em>No. ACM 34477, slip op. at 4. However, he asserted that the letter \u201craises the issue of unlawful command influence and that the [military] judge erred by failing to convene a post-trial hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. He therefore requested a <em>DuBay </em>hearing on the matter to determine the validity of the sentence. The Court of Criminal Appeals denied that request, concluding there was \u201cno evidence of command influence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. In doing so, that court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-9\">[T]he convening authority repeated what everyone in the Air Force has heard many times before, that drug use is incompatible with military service. The issue before us is whether there is any evidence that the convening authority\u2019s purpose in repeating this often used phrase at a command meeting was to influence the court members.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-10\">... The convening authority informed the attendees that drug use was prevalent on the gulf coast of Florida, and that it was incompatible with military service. Neither of these assertions is novel or shocking, and common sense tells us that they were not intended to influence the outcome of any court-martial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-11\">We also find that the alleged comments that the convening authority would know their names and review the sentence, and that the sentence should not appear to be too lenient, do not support the [A]ppellant\u2019s claim of unlawful command influence. Rather, they reflect the reality of the military justice system____ [C]ourt members know the convening authority selects them to serve on the court-martial and reviews the sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-14\">... [T]he convening authority\u2019s exercise of his statutory responsibility and the members\u2019 awareness of that role, without more, does not amount to unlawful command influence because no policy or preference can be imputed to the commander for doing what he is required to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 4-5 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-16\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AjW\">1. <em>Introduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-17\">\u201c[L]ong-recognized and very substantial concerns support the protection of jury deliberations from intrusive inquiry.\u201d <em>Tanner v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 107, 127, 107 S.Ct. 2739, 97 L.Ed.2d 90 (1987). As a result, \u201c[d]eliberations of [court-martial] members ordinarily are not subject to disclosure.\u201d Rule for Courts-Martial [hereinafter R.C.M.] 923 discussion. \u201cThe purpose of this rule is to protect freedom of deliberation, protect the stability and finality of verdicts, and protect court members from annoyance and embarrassment.\u201d <em>United States v. Loving, </em>41 M.J. 213, 236 (C.A.AF.1994) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-18\">Like its counterpart in the federal civilian system, Military Rule of Evidence 606(b) [hereinafter M.R.E.] implements this rule by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-19\">Upon an inquiry into the validity of the findings or sentence, a member may not testify as to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the deliberations of the members of the court-martial or, to the effect of anything upon the member\u2019s or any other member\u2019s mind or emotions as influencing the member to assent to or dissent from the findings or sentence or concerning the member\u2019s mental process in connection therewith, except that a member may testify on the question [1] whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the attention of the members of the court-martial, [2] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any member, or [3] whether there was unlawful command influence. Nor may the member\u2019s affidavit or evidence of any statement by the member concerning a matter about which the member would be precluded from testifying be received for these purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-6\"><em>See also </em>Fed.R.Evid. 606(b)(identical to M.R.E. 606(b) other than reference to military issue of unlawful command influence); R.C.M. 923, 1008 (standard for impeachment of findings and sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Thus, under M.R.E. 606(b), there are three circumstances that justify piercing the otherwise inviolate deliberative process to impeach a verdict or sentence: \u201c(1) when extraneous information has been improperly brought to the attention of the court members; (2) when outside influence has been brought to bear on a member; and (3) when unlawful command influence has occurred.\u201d <em>United States v. Accordino, </em>20 M.J. 102, 104 (C.M.A. 1985). Appellant\u2019s case involves the first and third of these categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">2. <em>Extraneous Information</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">The first two concerns 2Lt Greer expressed in her letter were: (1) other court members did not believe, as she did, that Appellant\u2019s mental condition was a mitigating factor to consider when determining an appropriate sentence, and (2) other court members may have been influenced by one member\u2019s statement that Appellant would be enrolled in a substance abuse program if he was sentenced to confinement. As to the first of these concerns, we agree with the military judge that the members were free to assign to Appellant\u2019s mental condition whatever weight they chose, including no weight at all. Such a decision \u201craises [nothing] other than internal matters regarding the deliberations of the members of the court-martial on sentence\u201d and, therefore, cannot be inquired into post-trial. <em>United States v. Straight, </em>42 M.J. 244, 250 (C.A.A.F. 1995); <em>see </em>M.R.E. 606(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">Regarding the possibility that one of the members informed the others that Appellant would be enrolled in a substance abuse program if sentenced to confinement, appellate defense counsel argues this was \u201cextraneous prejudicial information\u201d within the meaning of M.R.E. 606(b) because \u201cif relied upon,\u201d the members \u201cwould increase the term of confinement they would otherwise impose in order to \u2018help\u2019 [A]ppellant[.]\u201d This, counsel argues, calls into question the validity of Appellant\u2019s sentence and justifies a rehearing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">In <em>Straight, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-13\">[E]vidence of information acquired by a court member during deliberations from a third party or from outside reference materials may be extraneous prejudicial information which is admissible under [M.R.E.] 606(b) to impeach the findings or sentence. [However], the general and common knowledge a court member brings to deliberations is an intrinsic part of the deliberative process, and evidence about that knowledge is not competent evidence to impeach the members\u2019 findings or sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-14\">42 M. J. at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-15\">Here, even if one member did tell the others that Appellant would receive substance abuse counseling if sentenced to confinement, and even if the others did factor that into their sentence determination, it would not involve extraneous prejudicial information. To the contrary, it \u201cwould fall squarely within the deliberative process which is protected by [M.R.E.] 606(b).\u201d <em>United States v. Combs, </em>41 M.J. 400, 401 (C.A.A.F.1995)(court member\u2019s statement that sentence would have been less if appellant had cooperated with police was not competent evidence to impeach sentence). Thus, it cannot be considered by this or any other court as impeaching the validity of Appellant\u2019s sentence. <em>See McDowell v. Calderon, </em>107 F.3d 1351, 1366-67 (9th Cir.1997)(juror\u2019s statement to other jurors about parole consequences of sentence not admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 606(b)); <em>Silagy v. Peters, </em>905 F.2d 986, 1008-09 (7th Cir.1990)(juror\u2019s statements to other jurors about impact of death versus life sentence on actual time served not admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 606(b)); <em>United States v. Motsinger, </em>34 M.J. 255, 257 (C.M.A.1992)(letter from court-mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>tial president concerning reasons for imposing bad-conduct discharge \u201cmay not be considered\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">3. <em>Unlawful Command Influence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The third and fourth concerns expressed by 2Lt Greer in her letter were: (1) some members stated a bad-conduct discharge was a \u201cgiven\u201d in this ease, and (2) some members made statements suggesting they were influenced by the message put out by the convening authority at his Commander\u2019s Call. As to these concerns, we conclude they make a <em>DuBay </em>hearing necessary to determine whether unlawful command influence existed during the sentencing phase of Appellant\u2019s court-martial. Under the circumstances of this case, such statements fall squarely within the \u201cunlawful command influence\u201d exception of M.R.E. 606(b) and are not protected from disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">We begin by noting that to the extent the military judge and the Court of Criminal Appeals concluded Appellant did not meet his initial burden of raising the issue of unlawful command influence, they erred. At trial and on appeal, \u201c[t]he defense has the initial burden of producing sufficient evidence to raise unlawful command influence.\u201d <em>United States v. Ayala, </em>43 M.J. 296, 299 (C.A.A.F.1995). \u201cThe burden of proof is low, but more than mere allegation or speculation. The quantum of evidence required to raise unlawful command influence is \u2018some evidence.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Stoneman, </em>57 M.J. 35, 41 (C.A.A.F.2002)(quoting <em>United States </em>v, <em>Biagase, </em>50 M.J. 143, 150 (C.A.A.F. 1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">\u201cAt trial, the accused must show facts which, if true, constitute unlawful command influence, and that the alleged unlawful command influence has a logical connection to the court-martial, in terms of its potential to cause unfairness in the proceedings.\u201d <em>Biagase, </em>50 M.J. at 150. On appeal, an appellant must \u201c(1) show facts which, if true, constitute unlawful command influence; (2) show that the proceedings were unfair; and (3) show that the unlawful command influence was the cause of the unfairness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Stombaugh, </em>40 M.J. 208, 213 (C.M.A.1994)). The defense has met its burden in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-13\">\u201cWe have long held that the use of command meetings to purposefully influence the members in determining a court-martial sentence\u201d constitutes unlawful command influence in violation of Article 37, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 837 (2000).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Baldwin, </em>54 M.J. 308, 310 (C.A.A.F.2001). We also have held that regardless of a commander\u2019s intent, \u201cthe mere \u2018confluence\u2019 of the timing of such meetings with members during ongoing courts-martials and their subject matter dealing with court-martial sentences can require a sentence rehearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, in <em>United States v. Brice, </em>19 M.J. 170 (C.M.A.1985), we reversed and remanded for a new trial because the members of an ongoing court-martial attended a Commandant\u2019s meeting where drug problems in the military were discussed. In doing so, however, we also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-14\">We do not in any way wish to be viewed as condemning the contents of the Commandant\u2019s remarks since the drug problem in the military demands command attention; nor do we feel that such remarks necessarily constitute illegal command influence. Instead, we base our decision on the confluence of subject and timing, particularly as they affect the minds \u2014 however subtly or imperceptibly \u2014 of the triers of fact[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 172 n. 3 (citing <em>United States v. Grady, </em>15 M.J. 275, 276 (C.M.A.1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-16\">With these principles in mind, we turn now to Appellant\u2019s case. At the outset, we note there is nothing in 2Lt Greer\u2019s letter to indicate the convening authority had any improper intent when he conducted the Commander\u2019s Call, or that he purposefully used that meeting to influence Appellant\u2019s or any other court-martial. Nor does the record in its current form contain any other evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>suggesting such an intent or design on the part of the convening authority. As a result, we have no reason presently to question either the lawfulness of the Commander\u2019s Call or the correctness of the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019s finding that the content of the Commander\u2019s Call was \u201cneither ... novel or shocking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">We also recognize that Appellant\u2019s court-martial took place several weeks after the Commander\u2019s Call, in stark contrast to the <em>Baldwin </em>and <em>Brice </em>cases, where court members attended command meetings while they were actually sitting as court-martial panels. We are therefore mindful that to the extent the timing of such meetings \u2014 coupled with their content \u2014 alone gives rise to an inference of unlawful command influence, such an inference is not warranted in appellant\u2019s case, given the record as it now stands.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">We hold, however, that 2Lt Greer\u2019s letter does constitute some evidence that unlawful command influence may have taken place during the sentencing phase of Appellant\u2019s court-martial. 2Lt Greer\u2019s letter is more than mere speculation because it is \u201cdetailed\u201d and \u201cbased on her own observations.\u201d <em>Baldwin, </em>54 M.J. at 311. Moreover, it contains assertions which, if true, suggest that members of Appellant\u2019s court-martial who attended the Commander\u2019s Call unfairly based his sentence, at least in part, on a <em>concern </em>they would be viewed unfavorably by the convening authority (their commanding officer) if they did not impose a sentence harsh enough to be \u201cconsistent\u201d with the convening authority\u2019s \u201cmessage\u201d at the Commander\u2019s Call that drug use is incompatible with military service.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Such a possibility we cannot ignore, for it is exactly this type of command presence in the deliberation room \u2014 whether intended by the command or not \u2014 that chills the members\u2019 independent judgment and deprives an accused of his or her constitutional right to a fair and impartial trial. For these reasons, we conclude that a <em>DuBay </em>hearing is necessary to determine whether unlawful command influence existed during the sentencing phase of Appellant\u2019s court-martial. Furthermore, because Appellant has successfully raised the issue of unlawful command influence, it is the Government that must now rebut the presumption of unlawful command influence</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-13\">(1) by disproving the predicate facts on which the allegation of unlawful command influence is based; (2) by persuading the <em>[DuBay] </em>judge ... that the facts do not constitute unlawful command influence; ... or (3) ... by persuading the ... <em>[Du-Bay </em>judge] that the unlawful command influence had no prejudicial impact on the court-martial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-14\"><em>Biagase, </em>50 M.J. at 151. \u201cWhichever tactic the Government chooses, the quantum of evidence required is proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Stoneman, </em>57 M.J. at 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-15\">Having said that, we note that when unlawful command influence has been directed at court members, the Government\u2019s third option under <em>Biagase </em>is limited by M.R.E. 606(b). This rule prohibits inquiry into two types of matters: (1) \u201cany matter or statement occurring during the course of the deliberations,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe effect of anything upon [a] member\u2019s or any other member\u2019s mind or emotions as influencing the member to assent to or dissent from the findings or sentence or concerning the member\u2019s mental process in connection therewith[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-16\">The rule has three exceptions to the first prohibition, one of which permits testimony about \u201cany matter or statement\u201d occurring during the deliberations when there is a \u201cquestion whether ... there was unlawful command influence.\u201d The exceptions, however, do not permit circumvention of the second prohibition (inquiry into the effect on a member). <em>See </em>Stephen A. Saltzburg, et al., <em>Military Rules of Evidence Manual </em>722 (4th ed.1997)(\u201cMembers may testify \u2018with respect to <em>objective </em>manifestations of impropriety\u2019 but may not testify \u2018if the alleged transgression is <em>subjective </em>in nature.\u2019 \u201d); <em>see also </em>3 Jack B. Weinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number><em>Weinstein\u2019s Federal Evidence </em>\u00a7 606.04[2][c] (2d ed.l997)(citing examples of subjective and objective evidence of impropriety).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Thus, in this case, M.R.E. 606(b) permits voir dire of the members regarding what was said during deliberations about the commander\u2019s comments, but the members may not be questioned regarding the impact of any member\u2019s statements or the commander\u2019s comments on any member\u2019s mind, emotions, or mental processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">If the military judge who presides at the <em>DuBay </em>hearing is not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that unlawful command influence did not exist during the sentencing phase of Appellant\u2019s court-martial, or that one or more members did not exert the influence of superior rank on a junior member or purport to wear the mantle of the convening authority by conveying to the other members his or her interpretation of the convening authority\u2019s message, that judge shall set aside Appellant\u2019s sentence and order a sentence rehearing. If, however, the military judge finds there were no infirmities in the sentencing process, he or she shall return the record, along with the military judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, to the Court of Criminal Appeals for further review under Article 66(c), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866(c) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Finally, in conducting the <em>DuBay </em>proceeding, the military judge shall not voir dire any member as to \u201cthe effect of anything upon [a] member\u2019s ... mind or emotions as influencing [a] member to assent to or dissent from the findings or sentence or ... [a] member\u2019s mental process in connection therewith.\u201d M.R.E. 606(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">\n<em>Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">The decision of the United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed as to findings but set aside as to sentence. The record of trial is returned to the Judge Advocate General of the Air Force for submission to a convening authority for a hearing on Appellant\u2019s claim of unlawful command influence. If a hearing is impracticable, the convening authority may set aside the sentence and order a sentence rehearing. If a hearing is conducted, the military judge shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law and then shall either order a sentence rehearing or return the record of trial to the Court of Criminal Appeals for further review consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b315-8\">. The letter was neither signed nor sworn to by 2Lt Greer. Nonetheless, during oral argument, the Government agreed it could be treated as such.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b315-9\">. <em>See </em>Rules for Courts-Martial 1105, 1107 (convening authority must consider clemency matters submitted by accused before taking final action on sentence).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b315-19\">. A defense expert testified that Appellant suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of a brutal assault he experienced, and that he could not be effectively treated while in confinement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b315-20\">. Appellant served 150 days of pretrial confinement before his court-martial commenced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b318-8\">. Article 37, Uniform Code of Military Justice [hereinafter UCMJ], 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 837 (2000), states: \"No person subject to [the UCMJ] may attempt to coerce or, by any unauthorized means, influence the action of a court-martial ... or any member thereof, in reaching the findings or sentence in any case[.]\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b319-8\">. We also recognize that Appellant\u2019s case, as in <em>United States v. Brice, </em>19 M.J. 170 (C.M.A.1985), involves both a court-martial for drug use and a command meeting dealing with drag use in the military.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
