A panel of officers sentenced Appellant to a dishonorable discharge, confinement for 11 years, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. In accordance with a pretrial agreement, the convening authority suspended all confinement in excess of 78 months but otherwise approved the sentence. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings and sentence in an unpublished opinion. This Court granted review of the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-9\">I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-10\">WHETHER TRIAL COUNSEL COMMITTED PLAIN ERROR WHEN HE REFERRED TO AMERICA\u2019S \u201cWAR ON DRUGS\u201d AND CALLED APPELLANT A \u201cTRAITOR\u201d DURING HIS PRESEN-TENCING ARGUMENT BEFORE MEMBERS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-16\">II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-17\">WHETHER . APPELLANT\u2019S SENTENCE TO ELEVEN YEARS\u2019 CONFINEMENT AND A DISHONORABLE DISCHARGE IS HIGHLY DISPARATE COMPARED TO HIS ALLEGED CO-CONSPIRATOR\u2019S SENTENCE OF FOUR YEARS\u2019 CONFINEMENT AND A BAD-CONDUCT DISCHARGE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-18\">For the reasons set out below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-19\">\n<em>I. Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b234-20\">At the time of the offenses, Appellant was stationed at Marine Corps Air Station Mira-mar, California. In early February 2000, Appellant\u2019s cousin introduced him to a civilian named Beto. Beto offered Appellant $1,500 to go to Mexico and bring back a pickup truck loaded with marijuana. Appellant agreed, seeing an opportunity to earn some money for his parents and sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-21\">On February 11, 2000, Beto notified Appellant that the truckload of marijuana was ready. Beto told Appellant that it would be better if Appellant had someone with him on the trip from Mexico to the United States. Appellant asked Lance Corporal (LCpl) Martinezgarcia to accompany him. According to Appellant, LCpl Martinezgarcia did not know the purpose of the trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-22\">On the same day, Appellant, Beto and LCpl Martinezgarcia drove to Tijuana, Mexico, where Beto delivered a Volkswagen pickup truck to Appellant. Appellant knew that marijuana was hidden in the truck, but he did not know its quantity or exact location in the truck. When Appellant crossed the border, customs agents detained him and LCpl Martinezgarcia, and they discovered 99 pounds <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> of marijuana concealed in the truck\u2019s right rear fender panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>During his sentencing argument, the trial counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">We in America are engaged in a war on drugs. You have heard from the President. You heard from the agents, and customs, that borders are being flooded\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\">The drug cartels in Mexico are bringing drugs in this country and polluting our population. They\u2019re making money off out-weak individuals. They do it because people like [Appellant] carry the drugs across the border.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-9\">Now as warriors you know you can always fight the battle and fight the enemy on the battlefield. But true tacticians know you win the war by knocking out the logistics.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AI0\">Trial counsel referred to the maximum confinement authorized for Appellant\u2019s offenses (30 years), and he argued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-10\">The reason thirty years is authorized is because it\u2019s worth a lot. It\u2019s worth a lot of punishment because it is the type of activity we need to deter. Not just one individual but anyone who would think about doing it, tarnishing the Marine Corps\u2019 image of bringing drugs across this border. Almost a traitor to our country in that he\u2019s bringing in drugs when we are trying, as a nation, to stop them from coming in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-15\">Trial counsel concluded his argument by asking the court members to impose confinement for 15 years. Appellant\u2019s defense counsel did not object to any of the trial counsel\u2019s sentencing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-16\">LCpl Martinezgarcia, Appellant\u2019s co-conspirator, was charged with conspiring with the Appellant, importing and possessing marijuana, and making a false official statement about his involvement with Appellant, in violation of Articles 81 and 112a, and Article 107, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 907 (2002). His case initially was referred to trial jointly with Appellant\u2019s, but the cases were later severed. LCpl Martinezgarcia pleaded not guilty, but he was convicted and sentenced to a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for four years, total forfeitures, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag-\">\n<em>II. Discussion: Improper Argument (Issue I)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">\n<em>A. Reference to War on Drugs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">Appellant asserts that it was plain error for the trial counsel to introduce the Commander-in-chiefs war on drugs into the deliberation room. The Government argues that it was not plain error to refer to the war on drugs, that America\u2019s war on drugs is common knowledge, and that mentioning it does not bring command sentencing policy into the deliberation room.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-13\">In light of the defense counsel\u2019s failure to object, we review the trial counsel\u2019s argument for plain error. <em>See United States v. Powell, </em>49 M.J. 460 (C.A.A.F.1998); <em>United States v. Kropf, </em>39 M.J. 107, 108-09 (C.M.A. 1994). Appellant has the burden of persuading this Court that there was plain error. <em>Powell, </em>49 M.J. at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-14\">Regarding sentencing arguments, Rule for Courts-Martial 1001(g) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A71\">Trial counsel may not in argument purport to speak for the convening authority or any higher authority, or refer to the views of such authorities or any policy directive relative to punishment or to any punishment or quantum of punishment greater than that court-martial may adjudge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-17\">Reference to departmental or command policies can create the appearance of unlawful command influence. <em>See United States v. Grady, </em>15 M.J. 275, 276 (C.M.A.1983). Reference to such policies \u201cis an area in which trial counsel are well advised to tread lightly.\u201d <em>Kropf, </em>39 M.J. at 109. On the other hand, it is proper for a trial counsel to comment on \u201ccontemporary history or matters of common knowledge within the community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-18\">With respect to trial counsel\u2019s reference to the war on drugs in this case, we agree with the Government that it is a matter of common knowledge. Furthermore, the trial counsel made no reference to either the Commander-in-Chiefs or any other commander\u2019s expectations regarding Appellant\u2019s punishment. Thus, with respect to this as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>pect of the trial counsel\u2019s argument, we hold that there was no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">\n<em>B. Appellant as \u201cAlmost a Traitor\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">A trial counsel is charged with being a zealous advocate for the Government. <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>1 M.J. 285, 238 (C.M.A.1975). During sentencing arguments, \u201cthe trial counsel is at liberty to strike hard, but not foul, blows.\u201d <em>United States v. Baer, </em>53 M.J. 235, 237 (C.A.A.F. 2000). Trial counsel may not, however, \u201cseek unduly to inflame the passions or prejudices of the court members.\u201d <em>United States v. Clifton, </em>15 M.J. 26, 30 (C.M.A.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Trial counsel\u2019s reference to Appellant as \u201calmost a traitor\u201d gives us pause. The term \u201ctraitor\u201d is particularly odious, particularly in the military community. On the other hand, trial counsel used the term only once, and he qualified it with the word \u201calmost.\u201d The term is defined as: \u201c1. One who betrays another\u2019s trust or is false to an obligation or duty; 2. One who commits treason.\u201d MERRIAM-WEBSTER\u2019S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 1252 (10th ed.1993). Treason is defined as \u201cthe betrayal of a trust; treachery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1257-58. It was fair comment on the evidence for trial counsel to argue that Appellant had betrayed the trust placed in him as a member of the United States Marine Corps. Defense counsel did not consider the argument sufficiently offensive to warrant an objection. <em>See Nelson, </em>1 M.J. at 238 n. 6. While we do not condone the trial counsel\u2019s use of this potentially inflammatory term, we hold that Appellant has not carried his burden of persuading this Court that the sentencing argument characterizing him as \u201calmost a traitor\u201d was plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\n<em>III. Discussion: Highly Disparate Sentences (Issue II)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">In <em>United States v. Lacy, </em>50 M.J. 286, 288 (C.A.A.F.1999), this Court set out a three-part test for resolving claims of disparate treatment. When reviewing a decision of a Court of Criminal Appeals, we limit our review to three questions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-9\">(1) whether the cases are \u201cclosely related\u201d; ... (2) whether the cases resulted in \u201chighly disparate\u201d sentences; and (3) if the requested relief is not granted [by the court below] in a closely related case involving a highly disparate sentence, whether there is a rational basis for the differences between or among the cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">Our standard of review is \u201cwhether a Court of Criminal Appeals abused its discretion or caused a miscarriage of justice in carrying out its highly discretionary \u2018sentence appropriateness\u2019 role.\u201d <em>United States v. Durant, 55 </em>M.J. 258, 260 (C.A.A.F.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">Appellant asserts that the court below erred by not granting him sentence relief in light of the significantly less severe sentence of his co-conspirator, LCpl Martinezgarcia. The Government does not dispute that the two cases are clqsely related and that the sentences are highly disparate. The Government argues, however, that the court below did not abuse its discretion by affirming Appellant\u2019s sentence because there was a rational basis for the disparity between Appellant\u2019s sentence and that of his co-conspirator.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">The court below concluded that the two cases are closely related and that the sentences are highly disparate, but it concluded that the Government had carried its burden of showing a rational basis for Appellant\u2019s more severe sentence. The lower court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-15\">Appellant was the one who entered into a criminal conspiracy, agreed to drive the truck containing approximately 99 pounds of concealed marijuana for resale, and then drove it from Mexico into the United States in order to earn $1500. It was he who chose to involve Martinezgarcia in this criminal enterprise because the mastermind of the operation, a drug wholesaler known only as \u201cBeto,\u201d suggested that the undertaking would likely be more successful if someone else was in the pickup truck as they crossed into the United States.... He admitted that, but for his invitation to take part, Martinezgarcia would never have been in the truck____ Indeed, according to Appellant, Martinezgarcia was unaware of the fact that there was any marijuana in the truck.... We conclude, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>therefore, that there are rational and cogent reasons for the apparent disparity in the sentences imposed on Appellant and his co-actor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">We agree with the analysis of the court below. Accordingly, we hold that the court below did not abuse its discretion or cause a miscarriage of justice by affirming Appellant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\n<em>IV. Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">The decision of the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals 4s affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b234-12\"> Although Appellant was charged with importing 99 pounds of marijuana and admitted importing 99 pounds during the plea inquiry, a U.S. Customs Service special agent testified that the 99 pounds included the tape and wrapping, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>the actual weight of the marijuana was approximately 85 pounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b237-8\">EFFRON, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AXc\">(concurring in the result):</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Appellant was represented in this case by both civilian and military defense counsel. Appellant\u2019s counsel did not object to trial counsel\u2019s closing argument. Absent such an objection, in a case that does not involve an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel, the burden is on Appellant to demonstrate plain error under <em>United States v. Powell, </em>49 M.J. 460 (C.A.A.F.1998). Under <em>Powell, </em>Appellant must demonstrate that: (1) there was an error; (2) the error was plain or obvious; and (3) the error materially prejudiced a substantial right. <em>Id. </em>at 463-65. Both the lead opinion and the dissenting opinion set forth reasonable interpretations of trial counsel\u2019s closing argument. In that context, Appellant has not met his burden of demonstrating under the second prong of <em>Powell </em>that any error was so obvious that the military judge should have intervened in the absence of objection by defense counsel.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b237-10\">BAKER, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aq24\">with whom ERDMANN, Judge, joins (dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">Although I agree with the lead opinion\u2019s legal framework, I respectfully dissent from its application of that framework to these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">The lead opinion concludes that Appellant has not carried his burden of persuading this court that trial counsel\u2019s sentencing argument was plain error. In reaching this conclusion the lead opinion relies on three arguments. First, the war on drugs is common knowledge. Second, trial counsel only referred to Appellant as a traitor once, and when he did so the term was qualified by the word \u201calmost.\u201d Third, \u201ctreason\u201d is defined, inter alia, as \u201cthe betrayal of a trust.\u201d 58 M.J. 176. Thus, trial counsel\u2019s reference to Appellant as \u201calmost a traitor\u201d was \u201cfair comment on the evidence\u201d because \u201cAppellant had betrayed the trust placed in him as a member of the United States Marine Corps.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In essence, the lead opinion argues, trial counsel used the word traitor in its colloquial and descriptive sense, and not in its constitutional sense to describe someone who commits treason, like Benedict Arnold.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-14\">I disagree. I think the better view is that trial counsel was appealing to the members\u2019 sense of duty and patriotism as Marines by suggesting that Appellant\u2019s offenses were the equivalent of treason as used in the constitutional sense. To a panel of members sworn to uphold and defend the Constitution, such suggestion, in my view, is inflammatory and runs undue risk of drawing the members unfairly away from the evidence at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-15\">This is clear from the context of trial counsel\u2019s full argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-16\">Now as warriors you know you can always fight the battle and fight the enemy on the battlefield. But true tacticians know you win the war by knocking out the logistics ____ Now Marines stand for an awful lot of things. We stand for what is right in this country. We defend our borders. We have honor and courage. We don\u2019t stand for perfect drug courier and we shouldn\u2019t be the type of people that drug couriers should recruit____ The reason thirty years is authorized is because it\u2019s worth a lot____ [The accused is] [a]lmost a traitor to our country in that he\u2019s bringing in drugs when we are trying, as a nation, to stop them from coming in. We employ thousands of dollars, millions of dollars in doing that, employing the military to stop the drugs____ [H]e tarnished our image. He committed the serious offense against this nation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>First, trial counsel\u2019s reference to Appellant as \u201calmost a traitor\u201d comes in the context of war. The \u201cwar on drugs\u201d is indeed a matter of common knowledge and a colloquialism for efforts to address the importation and use of drugs in the United States. However, counsel did not limit his argument to the policy metaphor. Rather, he appealed to the members as warriors to do their duty in this war. That duty, I infer in the context of a sentencing argument, was to levy harsh punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Second, in his reference to Appellant as \u201calmost a traitor,\u201d trial counsel stated, <em>\u201c[Appellant] committed the serious offense against this nation.\u201d </em>This is the language of treason as understood in the Constitution as a crime <em>against </em>the nation. (\u201cTreason <em>against </em>the United States shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.\u201d US Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 3 (emphasis added)). Nor is this reference a momentary metaphor, it is a central theme in trial counsel\u2019s closing argument covering three pages in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Finally, if one adopts the lead opinion\u2019s view that trial counsel\u2019s argument was fair comment on the evidence because Appellant betrayed a trust, then it is fair comment in any case in which a member of the armed forces commits a common crime. Any accused within the military justice system would become a traitor for acts of \u201ctreason\u201d against \u201ctrust placed in [him/her] as a member of the United States [Armed Forces].\u201d 58 M.J. 176. This does not strike me as an analytic formula suited to upholding a fair and impartial system of military justice. In a military courtroom, the labeling of an accused as a \u201ctraitor\u201d is particularly inflammatory. Therefore, until this Court overrules <em>United States v. Baer, </em>53 M.J. 235 (C.A.A.F. 2000), and <em>United States v. Clifton, </em>15 M.J. 26 (C.M.A.1983), I would consider such language in the context of a drug trial outside the bounds of fair comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Appellant betrayed the trust of the Marine Corps and the public the Marine Corps serves; but Appellant was not on trial for treason against the nation in the war on drugs. Rather, he was on trial for importing drugs into the United States in the context of a United States effort to stem the tide of drugs referred to as a \u201cwar on drugs.\u201d We should be confident he was sentenced for the crime for which he was charged and convicted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
