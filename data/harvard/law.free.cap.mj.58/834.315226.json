The sentence awarded was confinement for 18 months, reduction to pay grade E-l, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and a bad-conduct discharge. The convening authority approved the sentence, but suspended confinement in excess of 12 months in accordance with a pretrial agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">On 12 March 2002, this Court issued its original decision in this case, setting aside the conviction of depositing obscene matter in the mail. <em>United States v. Negron, </em>No. 200100844, 2002 WL 436776 (N.M.Ct.Crim. App. 14 Mar. 2002)(unpublished op.). Having done so, the sentence was reassessed and modified. On 12 April 2002, the Government filed a Suggestion for En Banc Reconsideration of this Court\u2019s decision. Appellant did not file a reply to Appellee\u2019s Suggestion for En Banc Reconsideration, which this Court granted on 24 April 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">We have carefully considered the record of trial, Appellant\u2019s original brief, with its two assignments of error; Appellant\u2019s affidavit of 27 August 2001; the Government\u2019s original response; the Government\u2019s brief on en banc reconsideration; and Appellant\u2019s answer on reconsideration, with his additional contentions. Vacating the original decision of this Court, we now conclude that the findings and the sentence, as approved on review below, are correct in law and fact and that no error materially prejudicial to the substantial rights of Appellant was committed. Arts. 59(a) and 66(c), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 859(a) and 866(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-13\">I. Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b887-14\">In his original appellate brief of 18 September 2001, Appellant submitted two assignments of error: (1) the military judge erred in accepting his plea of guilty to depositing obscene matters in the mail, \u201cwhere the record discloses that the letter so deposited was not calculated to corrupt morals or excite libidinous thoughts;\u201d and (2) the sentence he received is inappropriately severe. Appellant\u2019s Brief of 18 Sep 2001 at 4. In his Answer on Reconsideration of 16 July 2002, Appellant additionally contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-15\">The Military Judge Did Not Include The First Sentence Of The Explanation In Part IV, 1189c Of The Manual In The Definition Of Indecent Language He Provided To The Appellant During The Providence Inquiry And, Therefore, The Appellant\u2019s Guilty Plea May Not Be Affirmed On The Basis Of That Sentence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-16\">The Test Set Forth In <em>United States v. French </em>[31 M.J. 57 (C.M.A.1990),] Is The Exclusive Military Test For Determining Whether Language Is Indecent Or Obscene; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-17\">The Record Is Insufficient To Sustain A Conviction To The Lesser Included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>Offense Of Disorderly Conduct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 7, 9, 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">II. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">During the inquiry into the providence of his guilty pleas, Appellant explained that he worked at the base U.S. Post Office at Torii Station in Okinawa, Japan. As a postal clerk, he was responsible for currency kept in a safe in the post office. On several occasions, Appellant unlawfully took cash from the safe and spent it off base for his personal benefit. The total amount of Government funds taken was $1,540.00. Apparently, intending to return the money at some point, Appellant told the military judge: \u201cI just intended to keep it for a while, sir, temporarily deprive the government of it.\u201d Record at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">Later, Appellant wrote a check for $500.00 cash on his account at Marine Federal Credit Union. Soon thereafter, he withdrew sufficient funds from that account, such that he knew the check would \u201cbounce\u201d when presented for payment. In an attempt to obtain funds to repay the Government and the credit union, Appellant applied for a loan from the same credit union. When his loan application was rejected, Appellant wrote a letter to the credit union and placed it in the United States mail system.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The letter contained the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-8\">Oh, yeah, by the way y\u2019all can kiss my ass too!! Worthless bastards! I hope y\u2019all rot in hell you scumbags. Maybe when I get back to the states, I\u2019ll walk in your bank and apply for a blowjob, a nice dick sucking, I bet y\u2019all are good at that, right?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AaX\">Charge Sheet; Record at 33-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">III. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">As will be discussed and developed below, Appellant\u2019s letter to the unsuspecting personnel at the North Carolina credit union\u2014 measured by the standards of military law\u2014 is obscene. His explicit and descriptive words unmistakably invoke the image of the sexual act itself. Not only did Appellant include a coarse vulgarity to identify this sexual act, but in order to make the picture he intended to paint perfectly clear, he also included a vulgarism to provide a very graphic description of the act itself. In the providence inquiry, Appellant admitted that he \u201cintended to offend them,\u201d by conveying the message that the credit union personnel could commit sodomy on him. Appellant also indicates that he selected the words he used in the letter to provide the maximum possible shock value. We agree. If he had instead sent a picture, rather than the words he wrote, depicting the actions he so graphically described in his letter, <em>obscenity </em>would not be at issue in this case. It would be a \u201cgiven.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b888-13\">IV. Plea Providence \u2014 Depositing Obscene Matters in the Mail</p>\n<p id=\"b888-14\">A. Government\u2019s and Appellant\u2019s Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b888-15\">(1) Government\u2019s Position</p>\n<p id=\"b888-16\">In its Brief on En Banc Reconsideration of 9 May 2002, the Government contends that this Court\u2019s original decision of 12 March 2002 was flawed, in that the majority \u201cerred by interpreting our superior court\u2019s holdings in <em>French </em>and <em>[United States </em>v.] <em>Brinson[, </em>49 M.J. 360 (1998),] to be the <em>only </em>legal definition of indecent language.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. The Government argues that \u201c[o]ur superior court\u2019s holdings in both <em>French </em>and <em>Brinson </em>do not limit the legal definition of indecent language, but merely interpret it in light of a particular set of circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. The Government contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-17\">The term \u201cobscene\u201d is synonymous with the term \u201cindecent,\u201d as defined in the offense of indecent language under Article 134, UCMJ. Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1998 ed.), Part IV, 1\u00cd 94c. \u2022 The Manual defines indecent language as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-18\">\u201cIndecent\u201d language is that which is grossly offensive to modesty, decency, or propriety, or shocks the moral sense, because of its vulgar, filthy, or disgust<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>ing nature, or its tendency to incite lustful thought. Language is indecent if it tends reasonably to corrupt morals or incite libidinous thoughts. The language must violate community standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">MCM, Part TV, 1189c.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">(2) Appellant\u2019s Assertions</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">Appellant contends that his guilty plea to depositing obscene matters in the mail was not provident for two reasons. The first being that this Court is confined to the offense-element definition given by the military judge during the providence inquiry, and the second being that the military judge only elicited legal conclusions from Appellant, and \u201c[mjere conclusions of law recited by the accused are insufficient to provide a factual basis for a guilty plea.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Answer on Reconsideration of 16 Jul 2002 at 3-4, 8; Appellant\u2019s Brief of 18 Sep 2001 at 4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">Concerning the first point, Appellant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-10\">The definition of indecent language given to the Appellant by the military judge during provideney did not include the \u201cgrossly offensive to modesty, decency, or propriety, or shocks the moral sense, because of its vulgar filthy, or disgusting nature\u201d language in the first sentence of H 89c of the Manual. Therefore, the Government is incorrect when it asserts that this Court erroneously disregarded that part of the Manual\u2019s explanation. This Court may not affirm the Appellant\u2019s guilty pleas on the basis of a definition of an element that is different from the one given to him during the provideney inquiry, and for which a factual basis to accept the plea was not established.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">Appellant\u2019s Answer on Reconsideration of 16 Jul 2002 at 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">Addressing the second point, Appellant contends that during the providence inquiry he provided simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d responses to the military judge\u2019s questions of law, contrary to our superior Court\u2019s guidance that mere conclusions of law recited by an accused are insufficient to provide a factual basis for a guilty plea. Appellant\u2019s Brief of 18 Sep 2001 at 4-5; Appellant\u2019s Answer on Reconsideration of 16 Jul 2002 at 5-6.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-15\">The linchpin of Appellant\u2019s argument, however, is that even if the military judge\u2019s providence inquiry was procedurally acceptable, the language in the questioned letter to the credit union is not \u201cobscene\u201d as a matter of military law. Primarily citing our superi- or Court\u2019s decisions in <em>French </em>and <em>Brinson, </em>Appellant submits that the military test to determine if language is criminally indecent solely lies in \u201c \u2018whether the particular language is calculated to corrupt morals or excite libidinous thoughts.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>French, </em>31 M.J. at 60 (quoting <em>United States v. Linyear, </em>3 M.J. 1027, 1030 (N.C.M.R.1977)). Appellant\u2019s Brief of 18 Sep 2001 at 6; <em>see also </em>Appellant\u2019s Answer on Reconsideration of 16 Jul 2002 at 9-11. Appellant believes the military judge also failed to establish a factual basis for concluding the language used in the letter violated the military community\u2019s standards of decency and obscenity and went beyond the customary limits of expression in the military community. Appellant\u2019s Brief of 18 Sep 2001 at 8-9 (citing <em>Roth v. United States, </em>354 U.S. 476, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957); <em>United States v. Hullett, </em>40 M.J. 189 (C.M.A.1994); and <em>United States v. Holt, </em>12 C.M.A. 471, 31 C.M.R. 57, 1961 WL 4522 (1961)); Appellant\u2019s Answer on Reconsideration at 9-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-16\">B. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b889-17\">Looking at the issue of the adequacy of the providence inquiry process first, the guilty-plea nature of this case frames our analysis. Prior to accepting a guilty plea, a military judge must make an inquiry of an accused to ensure a factual basis exists for the plea. Rule for Courts-Martial 910(e), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2000 ed.); <em>see Care, </em>18 C.M.A. at 541, 40 C.M.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>at 253; <em>see also </em>Art. 45(a), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 845(a). This inquiry must elicit sufficient facts to satisfy every element of the offense in question. R.C.M. 910(e), Discussion. This Court reviews a military judge\u2019s decision to accept an accused\u2019s guilty plea for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Eberle, </em>44 M.J. 374, 375 (C.A.A.F.1996); <em>United States v. Gallegos, </em>41 M.J. 446, 446 (C.A.A.F. 1995). A finding of guilty should not be set aside on appeal, unless there is a \u201csubstantial basis in law and fact for questioning the guilty plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Prater, </em>32 M.J. 433, 436 (C.M.A.1991)(internal quotes omitted). Additionally, an unconditional guilty plea waives any objection \u201cto the factual issue of guilt of the offense(s) to which the plea was made.\u201d R.C.M. 910(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">We do not review the adequacy of a guilty plea by speculating on the existence of facts that might invalidate it, particularly when such speculation contradicts the admissions of the accused. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>42 M.J. 443, 445 (C.A.A.F.1995). In consideration of a guilty plea, the evidence should be considered in the light most favorable to the Government. <em>United States v. Hubbard, </em>28 M.J. 203, 209 (C.M.A.1989)(Cox, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">In a review of the adequacy of a guilty plea, our superior Court in <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>57 M.J. 236, 238-39 (C.A.A.F.2002) concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-6\">By its nature, a guilty plea case is less likely to have developed facts, particularly where there is no accompanying stipulation of fact. Those facts that are part of the military judge\u2019s providence inquiry are not subject to the test of adversarial process. We are similarly mindful that a decision to plead guilty may include a conscious choice by an accused to limit the nature of the information that would otherwise be disclosed in an adversarial contest. Thus, this Court has declined to adopt too literal an application of Article 45 and ROM 910(e).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">In our review, this Court must be concerned with the adequacy of the factual basis upon which the military judge predicated his findings of guilty. \u201cMere conclusions of law recited by an accused are insufficient to provide a factual basis for a guilty plea.\u201d <em>Outhier, </em>45 M.J. at 331. In <em>Jordan, </em>our superior Court set aside a decision of this Court on the basis that the military judge had not adequately developed a factual basis for one of the elements of a charged offense. Citing <em>Outhier </em>for the proposition that \u201c[i]t is not enough to elicit legal conclusions,\u201d the Court in <em>Jordan </em>found that during the providence inquiry, the military judge merely posed a series of conclusory questions to which the accused simply responded, \u2018Tes, sir.\u201d <em>Jordan, </em>57 M.J. at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">In <em>Jordan, </em>the Court advised reviewing courts that the entire record should be considered in determining whether a providence inquiry is legally-sufficient, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-10\">When this Court has addressed a bare bones providence inquiry, we have not ended our analysis at the end of the providence inquiry but, rather, looked to the entire record to determine whether the dictates of Article 45, RCM 910, and <em>Care </em>and its progeny have been met.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 239. In an earlier opinion, the Court, then the United States Court of Military Appeals, indicated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-12\">The combination of all the circumstances obtaining here causes us to conclude that the appellant\u2019s plea was informed and voluntary within the meaning of ... <em>Care. </em>We believe no useful purpose would be served by reversing[,] because the judge\u2019s phraseology did not exactly duplicate that of the <em>Care </em>opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-13\"><em>United States v. Burton, </em>21 C.M.A. 112, 115, 44 C.M.R. 166, 169, 1971 WL 12477 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-14\">We find that the providence inquiry in this case was not \u201ca bare bones\u201d inquiry such as that described in <em>Jordan. </em>Rather \u2014 as revealed by a review of the entire record, as urged by both <em>Jordan </em>and <em>Burton </em>\u2014 it is a thorough and complete inquiry. After reviewing the record, this Court concludes that the military judge conducted a proper providence inquiry. While it may be desirable to have more of a dialogue between a military judge and an accused than that which took place in this case, there is no one format that must be followed. The inquiry is not a scripted one-act play with assigned speaking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>parts, and the eloquence element of the elocution is not legally determinative. \u201cMany accused lack the ability to articulate their responses fully, notwithstanding substantial pretrial preparation by their defense counsel.\u201d Francis A. Gilligan and Fredric I. Lederer, Court-Martial Procedure, Vol. 2, 212 (2nd ed.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">As promulgated by <em>Care </em>and its progeny, the purpose of a providence inquiry\u2014 through a discussion between the military judge and an accused into the facts and circumstances surrounding the act or acts charged \u2014 is to establish a factual basis that enables the military judge to conclude that the accused, in fact, is guilty. <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>9 M.J. 364, 366 (C.M.A.1980). In doing so, \u201c[military judges may employ different techniques in complying with the ... <em>Care </em>requirement ... that the military judge question the accused about his actions and intentions in order to determine whether his actions constitute the offenses to which he is pleading guilty.\u201d <em>United States v. Wimberly, </em>20 C.M.A. 50, 51, 42 C.M.R. 242, 243,1970 WL 7057 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">In <em>Wimberly, </em>the Court held that the military judge met the <em>Care </em>standard through his \u201cinterrogation technique\u201d that related the accused personally to the criminal act, followed by the accused admitting to the military judge that the elements the judge had itemized accurately described what he had done. While our superior Court was not overly pleased with the military judge\u2019s technique of questioning the accused with long questions that often covered more than one action or element, it found the interrogation-style inquiry to \u201cmarginally\u201d comply with the <em>Care </em>requirements. In the inquiry in <em>Wimberly, </em>with the exception of his answer to a query asking him if he had any questions, the accused answered every question asked by the military judge with the same simple response: \u201cYes, Your Honor.\u201d <em>Wimberly, </em>20 C.M.A. at 52-55, 42 C.M.R. at 244-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">In <em>Jordan, </em>our superior Court cited its decision in <em>United States v. Sweet, </em>42 M.J. 183 (C.A.A.F.1995), a case in which the military judge\u2019s inquiry was found to have satisfied the requirements of <em>Care.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Jordan, </em>the Court noted that during the providence inquiry in <em>Sweet, </em>the accused\u2019s \u201c \u2018yes\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019 answers to the military judge\u2019s inquiry responded to <em>questions of fact </em>and not just conclusions of law.\u201d <em>Jordan, </em>57 M.J. at 239 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">In this case, while most of Appellant\u2019s answers to the military judge\u2019s questions consist primarily of: \u2018Tes, sir,\u201d our primary focus is not on the length or the brevity of Appellant\u2019s answers. Rather, we must determine whether the military judge properly established on the record a factual basis for a provident plea by Appellant. The military judge\u2019s providence questions in this case were not mere legal conclusions, such as \u201cDid you mail obscene material?\u201d Rather, among other things, they established that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-10\">(1) the letter contained the language alleged;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-11\">(2) Appellant, freely, knowingly, and wrongfully wrote and mailed the letter to the Marine Corps Federal Credit Union branch in North Carolina;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-12\">(3) Appellant did not know who at the credit union might receive the letter;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-13\">(4) it was not sent as a joke, but out of frustration at not getting a desired loan;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-14\">(5) Appellant knew it would probably offend the individual who would read it at the credit union;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-15\">(6) while Appellant did not actually desire that someone at the credit union \u201ckiss [his] rear end,\u201d he did intend to \u201cconvey the message though that someone there at the Marine Corps Federal Credit Union could kiss [his] rear end and commit sodomy on [him];\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-16\">(7) after hearing the military judge once again define the term \u201cobscene,\u201d which included an explanation of the appropriate military-community standard by which to consider the language, Appellant acknowledged that the language he used in the questioned letter fit that definition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>(8) the conduct was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-4\">(9) the members of the credit union who read Appellant\u2019s letter would look down on the United States Marine Corps for him having written \u201cthis grossly vulgar and obscene matter;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-5\">(10) Appellant believed individuals at the credit union were \u201cgrossly offended\u201d by his letter; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-6\">(11) perhaps most importantly for the resolution of this case, Appellant acknowledged that the language used in the letter was \u201ccalculated to corrupt morals or excite lustful thoughts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">Record at 32-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">Thus, based on the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d contained in the Record, we conclude that the providence inquiry in this case complied with the requirements of <em>Care </em>and its progeny. Concerning Appellant\u2019s issue with the definition of \u201cobscene\u201d used by the military judge during the providence inquiry, and the factual basis developed to support his guilty plea based upon it, as amplified below, we find that it adequately covers the definition provided in MCM, Part IV, H89c <em>and </em>the test adopted by our superior Court in <em>French, </em>as reaffirmed and expanded somewhat in <em>Brinson.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">V. Was Appellant\u2019s Letter <em>Legally </em>Obscene?</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">The substantive issue in this case is whether the content of the letter Appellant mailed to the credit union meets the established military test to determine if the language is \u201cobscene\u201d for the purposes of constituting a criminal offense. We start with MCM, Part IV, H 94, which addresses the offense of depositing obscene matters in the mails. Subparagraph c, states: \u201cWhether something is obscene is a question of fact. \u2018Obscene\u2019 is synonymous with \u2018indecent\u2019 as the latter is defined in paragraph 89c. The matter must violate community standards of decency or obscenity and must go beyond customary limits of expression.\u201d The applicable and relevant community standards \u201cfor measuring whether language is indecent are those of the military community.\u201d <em>Hullett, </em>40 M.J. at 191. At MCM, Part IV, 1189c, which addresses the related offense of \u201cindecent language,\u201d the following explanation is provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-13\">\u201cIndecent\u201d language is that which is grossly offensive to modesty, decency, or propriety, or shocks the moral sense, because of its vulgar, filthy, or disgusting nature, or its tendency to incite lustful thought. Language is indecent if it tends reasonably to corrupt morals or incite libidinous thoughts. The language must violate community standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-14\">During the providence inquiry in this case, the military judge twice defined the word \u201cobscene\u201d for Appellant as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-15\">[T]hat form of immorality relating to sexual impurity which is not only grossly vulgar and repugnant to common propriety, but which tends to excite lust and deprave the morals with respect to human relations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-16\">The matter must violate community standards of decency or obscenity and must go beyond customary limits of expression. The community standards of decency or obscenity are to be judge[d] according to the average person in the military community as a whole rather than the most prudish or tolerant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-17\">Record at 36; <em>see also </em>Record at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-18\">We note that this definition of \u201cobscene\u201d actually is taken from the definition of \u201cindecent\u201d contained in the MCM for the offense of indecent acts with another. MCM, Part IV, U 90c. In providing this definition, the military judge gave the definition of \u201cobscene\u201d contained in the then current Military Judges\u2019 Benchbook for use with the offense of depositing obscene matter in the mail.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As noted above, the shadow of this pronouncement of what is \u201cobscene\u201d adequately covers both the definition provided in MCM, Part IV, U 89c <em>and </em>the test for obscenity adopted by our superior Court in <em>French </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>reaffirmed and expanded somewhat in <em>Brinson.'</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">The definition and consideration of \u201cobscenity\u201d necessarily implicates the Constitutional right to \u201cfree speech.\u201d This right\u2014 including even that \u201cspeech\u201d which some might hear in their own ear as \u201coffensive,\u201d \u201cvulgar,\u201d or \u201cindecent\u201d \u2014 is a precious, jealously-guarded, Constitutionally-protected right,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and \u201c[w]hen the Government makes speech a crime, the judges on appeal must use an exacting ruler.\u201d <em>Brinson, </em>49 M.J. at 361.

The Supreme Court in <em>Roth </em>went on to say: \u201cWe hold that obscenity is not within the area of constitutionally protected speech or press.\u201d <em>Roth, </em>354 U.S. at 485, 77 S.Ct. 1304.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">While the service appellate courts previously \u201cwrestled with the problem of indecent and obscene language,\u201d our superior Court first addressed the issue in its 1990 decision in <em>French.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The central issue in <em>French </em>involved the sufficiency of a specification alleging indecent language spoken to a child under age 16, where the accused had asked his 15-year-old stepdaughter \u201c\u2018if he could climb in bed with her.\u2019 \u201d <em>French, </em>31 M.J. at 58.

The Court stated: \u201cEach word individually is chaste, if not innocuous. As a whole, however, the language certainly conveys an indecent message.\u201d <em>French, </em>31 M.J. at 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">In <em>Brinson, </em>our superior Court reaffirmed and elaborated on the totality-of-the-circumstances test it had adopted in <em>French, </em>by defining \u201ccalculated\u201d as generally meaning \u201c 'intend[ed]\u2019 or 'plann[ed]\u2019 to bring about a certain result.\u201d <em>Brinson, </em>49 M.J. at 364. The Court said: \u201cA determination whether language was intended to corrupt morals or excite libidinous thoughts cannot be made in isolation from the other evidence in the record. Instead, we must examine the entire record of trial to determine the precise circumstances under which the charged language was communicated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364. The Court cited to MCM, Part IV, H 89c, as providing the Presidential explanation as to what constitutes \u201cindecent language\u201d for purposes of UCMJ offenses. The Court indicated, however, that the guidance provided in the MCM \u201cdoes not stand alone in explaining what indecent language is for the purposes of Article 134.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">In <em>Brinson, </em>the relevant events took place at 0312, after the accused had returned from a night at the base club. When approached by security personnel, who were in the barracks for an unrelated matter, the accused\u2014 a male Airman Basic, USAF \u2014 was involved in a heated exchange with a female, which included screaming and swearing, about the accused\u2019s relationship with another woman. When directed by law-enforcement personnel to cease and desist, the accused, already angry, channeled his heightened displeasure via a verbal barrage toward the security personnel. Thus, in <em>Brinson, </em>the accused, in a highly-animated and emotional state, continued an already-in-progress \u201cswearing\u201d tirade, which he redirected towards security personnel, who first attempted to calm him down and then, that failing, apprehended him. <em>Id. </em>at 361-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">Applying the <em>French </em>particular-circumstances test, the Court concluded that while the foul language the accused directed toward security personnel might be disorderly conduct, it was not \u201cindecent\u201d language, because \u2014 under the precise circumstances by which the charged language was communicated \u2014 it was not \u201cintended to corrupt morals or excite libidinous thoughts,\u201d but rather to express the accused\u2019s anger. <em>Id. </em>at 364-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">Juxtapose that circumstance with the facts of this case, where Appellant was not faced with an immediate, in-your-face, angry confrontation, which quickly escalated out of control at 0312 after a night at the base club. While Appellant might have us believe that his writing the letter to the credit union in anger should give him the heat-of-anger indecent-language exception afforded the accused in <em>Brinson, </em>we infer deliberation in his conduct, which distinguishes it from the facts and circumstances in <em>Brinson. </em>Rather than being involved in a quick-and-immediate flurry of acrimonious activity, which fueled the excited utterances of anger by the accused in <em>Brinson, </em>the circumstances and stepped-process of Appellant\u2019s offensive conduct provided him with the opportunity to reflect and consider, a circumstance not present in <em>Brinson. </em>In this case, Appellant made a deliberate decision to write a letter to the credit union; found the necessary items, such as a pen, some paper, an envelope, and a stamp; wrote the letter, with conscious thought as to content; got the letter ready to mail; traveled from wherever he actually wrote the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>letter to the United States mailbox located in front of the Camp Hansen Post Office; and physically deposited the letter in that mailbox. Record at 32-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Thus, while a determination of \u201cobscenity\u201d does not turn, in and of itself, on a spontaneity-deliberation distinction, it does factor into the \u201cparticular circumstances\u201d aspect of the inquiry. There is nothing in the circumstances of this case to suggest that Appellant\u2019s intended meaning was anything less than his actual words would indicate to the reader.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Additionally, there is a significant difference in the actual language used by Appellant in this case, and that spoken by the accused in <em>Brinson, </em>in which the \u201cF\u201d word, along with its gerund and other derivations, was the primary expletive expression of choice. As sad and as unwelcome as it may be, as a culture we have become somewhat desensitized to the \u201cF\u201d word, and, regrettably, it seems to be on the fringe of the older, long-established group of recognized and perhaps somewhat more \u201cacceptable\u201d commonly-used expletives, such as \u201chell,\u201d \u201cdamn,\u201d and \u201cs__\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, in a state of agitation, anger, and, more than likely, some degree of intoxication, the accused in <em>Brinson </em>was deemed merely to have been swearing, when he used the perhaps offending, but-not-under-the-circumstances-legally-obscene words.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">The same cannot be said, however, about the words and phrases Appellant used in this case. Applying the appropriate military \u201ccommunity standard,\u201d we do not find that Appellant\u2019s words of choice have reached the same commonly-used-as-an-expletive status as the \u201cF\u201d word. How often, when hitting a thumb with a hammer, or upon spilling hot, greasy gravy on a new shirt or skirt, is one heard to blurt: \u201cOh, <em>[the \u2018B\u2019 word] </em>!\u201d? The words and phrases Appellant used in his offending letter to the credit union are not seen or heard by most people to be just commonly-used expletives reflecting sudden, strong emotion or intensity of feelings.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Rather, Appellant\u2019s explicit and descriptive words invoke the image of the sexual act itself. Not only did Appellant include the common slang word used to identify this sexual act, but in order to make the picture he intended to paint perfectly clear, he also included a phrase that provides a very graphic description of the act itself. In the providence inquiry, Appellant admitted that he \u201cintended to offend them,\u201d by conveying the message that the credit union personnel could commit sodomy on him. Record at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-14\">We agree with Appellant, when he indicates that his word selection was geared to generate maximum shock value.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> What provides a bigger shock than some totally-unsuspecting individual opening what appears to be a routine business letter, only to have, quite unexpectedly, vivid and shocking obscenity leap off the page at them? We find there is both a quantitative and a qualitative difference between the name calling engaged in by the accused in <em>Brinson </em>and the Appellant\u2019s graphic description of a specific sex act in this case. Thus, this Court concludes Appellant\u2019s words violated the military-community-standards aspect of the indecent-language test, as well as more than meeting the <em>French/Brinson </em>test of having been \u201ccalculated to corrupt morals or excite libidinous thoughts.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>French, </em>31 M.J. at 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>We find Appellant\u2019s language \u201cpasses\u201d the legally-obscene test, as he exceeded the \u201ccustomary limits of expression.\u201d MCM, Part IV, II 94c. As now modified and applied, the test for indecent language, as set out in the MCM, is whether the questioned language, which must also violate community standards, \u201ctends reasonably to corrupt morals or incite libidinous thoughts.\u201d MCM, Part IV, 1189c. The Drafter\u2019s Analysis of Punitive Articles indicates that the 1995 MCM Amendment modified the <em>French </em>test by substituting the term \u201ctends reasonably\u201d for the term \u201ccalculated to,\u201d in order \u201cto avoid the misinterpretation that indecent language is a specific intent offense.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> MCM, App. 23, at A23-19. The notion that Appellant would write a letter indicating a desire to have the reader sodomize him cannot be anything other than morally corrupting.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">\u201cMorals\u201d is defined as: \u201cRules or habits of conduct, especially sexual conduct, with reference to standards of right and wrong.\u201d The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 852 (1976). Appellant had no idea who might open and read his letter when it arrived at the credit union.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Nevertheless, Appellant knew or should have known that his letter might have an adverse impact on the morals of that individual recipient. While \u201cthe probable effect of the communication\u201d is a factor to be considered in an indecent-language determination,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> we have no evidence in this guilty-plea record as to the actual reaction of the credit union personnel when they read the contents of Appellant\u2019s letter. However, the mere fact that he was charged with mailing obscene matters via this item of business correspondence creates an inference that the reaction was sufficiently negative that credit union personnel were moved to inform Marine Corps officials of the nature of the letter.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">Thus, it is enough, as in this ease, that Appellant specifically intended to write the questioned words that he included in the letter, which he then consciously mailed to the credit union. The use of \u201cindecent language\u201d not being a specific intent crime, it is sufficient that the language used \u201ctends reasonably to corrupt morals or incite libidinous thoughts.\u201d MCM, Part IV, H 89c. It is important to note that while Appellant now attributes his letter-writing motivation to just being angry, at trial, under oath, he responded affirmatively when specifically asked by the military judge: \u201cDo you believe and admit that this language used in your letter was calculated to corrupt morals or excite lustful thoughts?\u201d Record at 16-17, 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">Both <em>French </em>and <em>Brinson </em>cite to <em>Linyear </em>as providing the appropriate test for measuring whether questioned language is legally indecent. In <em>Linyear, </em>this Court, after stating the \u201ctrue test of verbal obscenity\u201d concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-9\">The necessary attribute of indecency or obscenity can, therefore, be said to be adequately alleged if the language employed by the accused when reasonably construed by community standards, serves to <em>convey </em>a libidinous message whether or not the words themselves are impure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-10\"><em>Linyear, </em>3 M.J. at 1030 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-11\">Clearly Appellant\u2019s letter <em>conveyed a libidinous message, </em>both as to the medium by which it was transmitted to credit union personnel, and through the clear, literal meaning and message of the words themselves. It vividly carried the message Appellant intended to send. Consider the following exchange that took place between the military judge and Appellant during the providency inquiry, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>after Appellant acknowledged that some of the descriptive language he included in the letter is slang terms for sodomy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-5\">MJ: Now, \u201csodomy\u201d means for a person to take into that person\u2019s mouth the sexual organ of another person. Now, is that the message that you were trying to convey? ACC: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-7\">MJ: Okay. So was the message that you were trying to convey to the Marine Corps Federal Credit Union that they were mean people who could kiss your rear and commit sodomy on you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-8\">ACC: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">Record at 36. Based on the relative positions and stature of the two speakers, some may read the above colloquy with a degree of skepticism, in that it reflects an enlisted servicemember responding with \u201cexpected\u201d affirmative responses to the questions addressed to him by a senior officer sitting in judgment of him as a military judge. It should be noted, however, that at the time of his court-martial, Appellant was a 22-year-old Marine Corps noncommissioned officer (NCO) with almost 4 years of military service, and he was well-represented at trial by a Marine Corps Major, who at the time, was the senior Marine Corps defense counsel in Okinawa. Charge Sheet; Record at 3; Staff Judge Advocate\u2019s Recommendation of 17 Nov 2000 at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">Conceptually, this case is different from most of the precedent-setting indecent-language cases, in that in many of those cases the salient issue was one of the following: (a) whether relatively innocuous words can be legally obscene, given the context in which they were used; (b) does the-use-of-coarse-language-among-friends circumstance negate the potential criminality of the words; or (c) while they might be chargeable as some other UCMJ offense, do the circumstances in which the words were spoken \u2014 such as in the midst of an immediate anger-filled confrontation \u2014 eliminate the possibility of pursing a potential \u201cindecent language\u201d offense?<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Attempting to minimize his letter, containing the strong, vivid language that on its face reflects its obscene nature, Appellant tries to shoehorn his ease into this third category. His effort is hampered, however, by the lack of the in-the-heat-of-the-moment factor in his case. While he was angered at the refusal of the credit union management to give him a loan, so that he could camouflage his offense by replacing the funds he had wrongfully appropriated, the circumstance of his anger did not take the immediate, incendiary form inflaming the accused in <em>Brinson, </em>to the extent that the circumstances changed the complexion and effect of the words used.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-13\">While not specifically addressed as an issue in the major precedent-setting cases involving indecent language, the fact that Appellant\u2019s questioned language was in written form vice being spoken is a valid factor to be considered. The limiting concerns expressed by Judge Sullivan and (then) Chief Judge Cox in their majority and concurring opinions, respectively, in <em>Brinson </em>primarily center around not wanting to criminalize as indecent language \u2014 although such words might form the basis of other UCMJ violations\u2014 words spoken either in immediate anger or as mere banter, coarse as it might be, among those who do not consider it as being criminally obscene. <em>Brinson, </em>49 M.J. at 364, 367-68. These concerns, however, are alleviated by the written and \u201cbusiness letter\u201d nature of Appellant\u2019s challenged communication, which he consciously launched to unknown readers. Appellant\u2019s letter paints a vivid word portrayal of a crude expression of sexual deviance. While anger might have been a motivational factor in Appellant writing and mailing the letter, it <em>was intended </em>to disrupt moral values.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-14\">VI. Alternate Offenses</p>\n<p id=\"A6z\">We note that while we conclude herein that the words contained in Appellant\u2019s letter, in fact, do meet the current <em>French/Brinson </em>test for obscenity, if we had concluded otherwise, the facts established in this guilty-plea case would <em>not </em>sustain a conviction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>closely-related offense of disorderly conduct. The case facts and court-martial record, however, do lend themselves to a finding that Appellant\u2019s guilty plea \u2014 as discussed above\u2014 is sufficient to support his conviction for service-discrediting conduct under Article 134, clause 2, UCMJ. In <em>United States v. Sapp, </em>53 M.J. 90, 91-92 (C.A.A.F.2000), the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-4\">Conduct is punishable under Article 134 if it prejudices \u201cgood order and discipline in the armed forces\u201d (clause 1), or if it is \u201cof a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces\u201d (clause 2), or if it is a crime or offense not capital (clause 3). The three clauses do not create separate offenses. Instead, they provide alternative ways of proving the criminal nature of the charged misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-5\">It is clear from reading Article 134 that conduct which violates no specific statute may still be an offense thereunder if it is found to be prejudicial to good order and discipline of if it is of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">Clearly the record in this case would support Appellant\u2019s conviction for a violation of Article 134, clause 2, as the nature of his acknowledged conduct speaks for itself, and he admitted during the providence inquiry that his actions were service discrediting.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">VII. Sentence Appropriateness</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">Even setting aside, for argument\u2019s sake, Appellant\u2019s questioned conviction for depositing obscene matter in the mail, we are still left with his conviction for wrongfully appropriating over $1,500.00 from the post office on divers occasions and for making and uttering a worthless check for $500.00. The fact that at the time of the offenses Appellant was a Marine Corps NCO, standing alone, is a significant sentencing factor.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>22 M.J. 40, 41 (C.M.A. 1986). During the providence inquiry, Appellant stated he was aware that his status as an NCO was significant. Record at 39. The seriousness escalates significantly, however, when Appellant\u2019s special status of trust and confidence within the Marine Corps as an NCO is coupled with the fact he took money \u2014 a total of $1,500.00 \u2014 on several occasions from the very post office fund for which he had been entrusted with a fiduciary responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">This Court has considered the positive character references throughout the Record and Appellant\u2019s almost 4 years of honorable service prior to his court-martial, during which he had service-average marks of 4.5 (Proficiency) and 4.1 (Conduct) and no disciplinary action. Staff Judge Advocate\u2019s Recommendation of 17 Nov 2000 at 3; Prosecution Exhibit 1. Having considered that, we conclude that the approved sentence is not inappropriately severe, given the nature and seriousness of the offense and the character of the offender. <em>United States v. Snelling, </em>14 M.J. 267, 268 (C.M.A.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">VIII. Recommendation</p>\n<p id=\"b898-13\">Although reaching a different ultimate conclusion in deciding the indecent-language issue, the majority opinion in this Court\u2019s original decision in this case, made a direct request to our superior Court when it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJc\">However, we believe that the <em>Brinson </em>dissent is persuasive. Accordingly, we urge our superior Court to reevaluate the restrictive \u201ccalculated to corrupt morals or excite libidinous thoughts\u201d test. If the revolting language used by this Marine cannot be considered legally obscene, we would be hard pressed to imagine what language would pass an objective test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuD\"><em>United States v. Negron, </em>No. 200100844, 2002 WL 436776 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App. 14 Mar 2002)(unpublished op. at 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">While this Court, in this decision, appositely concludes that \u2014 based on the particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>and specific facts and circumstances of this case \u2014 the language Appellant used in his letter to the credit union is legally obscene under current controlling precedent, we echo the request, cited above, that our superior Court reevaluate the restrictive \u201ccalculated to corrupt morals or excite libidinous thoughts\u201d test for obscene language.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">IX. Submission of Appendix A in Support of Request</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Appendix A is offered in support of the above request. While certainly honoring the doctrine of <em>stare decisis, </em>it is respectfully submitted in the belief that this Court should be able to clearly communicate to our superi- or Court its position on an issue of importance and concern within the military-justice system, and it is offered in the spirit of our superior Court\u2019s guidance offered in <em>United States v. Allbery, </em>44 M.J. 226, 228 (C.A.A.F. 1996), that a Court of Criminal Appeals should \u201cexpress [its] viewpoint and urge [ ] our reconsideration of our precedent.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AdQ\">X. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">Accordingly, based on the discussion above, we affirm the findings of guilty and the sentence, as approved on review below.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">Chief Judge LEO concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">BRYANT, Judge, with whom Senior Judge FINNIE, Judge CARVER, and Judge RITTER join (concurring in Parts I-VII and X, and dissenting as to Parts VIII-IX and the Appendix):</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">I concur with the majority\u2019s resolution of this case for the reasons stated by Judge Villemez. I write separately to note my disagreement with the lead opinion in two respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-11\">I disagree with the recommendation to our superior Court contained in Parts VIII, IX, and Appendix A of their opinion. As the lead opinion conclusively establishes, there are distinct factual differences between this ease and the factual events in <em>United States v. Brinson, </em>49 M.J. 360 (C.A.A.F.1998). Under the circumstances of this case, Appellant\u2019s words were obscene. The lead opinion amply demonstrates that the \u201crestrictive\u201d language of <em>Brinson </em>is fully capable of encompassing the reprehensible words akin to that used by Appellant, and yet protects Sailors and Marines from being criminally liable for the mere use of coarse language used under volatile circumstances. <em>Brinson, </em>49 M.J. at 364. While I personally find (now) Chief Judge Crawford\u2019s dissent in <em>Brinson </em>persuasive, I do not believe that this case is an appropriate vehicle for this Court to request reevaluation of the standards established in <em>Brinson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b899-14\">I also disagree with the lead opinion insofar as it could give the impression that this Court now believes that the \u201c \u2018F\u2019 word\u201d has become a commonly used, socially acceptable expletive. I disassociate myself from any such impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-15\">HARRIS, Judge, with whom Senior Judge OLIVER joins (concurring in Parts I, II, VI-IX and the Appendix, and dissenting as to Parts III V and X):</p>\n<p id=\"b899-16\">I concur with the majority\u2019s decision to affirm the findings of guilty of wrongful appropriation and making and uttering a worthless check. As to the majority\u2019s affirmance of the findings of guilty of depositing obscene matter in the mail, I respeetfiilly dissent. I would hold that the evidence in the record is not legally sufficient to support Appellant\u2019s conviction for the offense of placing obscene matter in the mail. I would, however, support a conviction for the lesser included offense of service-discrediting conduct, also a violation of Article 134, UCMJ, and reassess the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-17\">The standard of review to determine whether a guilty plea is provident is whether the record reveals a substantial basis in law and fact for questioning the plea. <em>United States v. Prater, </em>32 M.J. 433, 436 (C.M.A. 1991). In my opinion, there is a substantial basis for questioning Appellant\u2019s plea. The dispositive question in Appellant\u2019s case, as identified by Senior Judge Price in his concurring and dissenting opinion, is whether the language in Appellant\u2019s letter to Marine Corps Federal Credit Union (MCFCU) personnel is \u201cobscene\u201d (indecent) as a matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>military criminal law. As indecency is a question of fact, I would hold that, based on the record in Appellant\u2019s case, the record is insufficient to show the language communicated by Appellant to MCFCU personnel was indecent.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">The military judge explained to Appellant that the word \u201cobscene\u201d means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-5\">[Tjhat form of immorality relating to sexual impurity which is not only grossly vulgar and repugnant to common society, but which tends to excite lust and deprave the morals with respect to sexual relations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-6\">The matter must violate community standards of decency or obscenity and must go beyond customary limits of expression. The communities\u2019 standards of decency or obscenity are to be judged according to the average person in the military community as a whole rather than the most prudish or tolerant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">Record at 16, 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">While it is clear that the language intentionally communicated by Appellant to MCFCU personnel would, when taken in the proper context, normally deprave the morals with respect to sexual relations and went far beyond what would be considered customary limits of expression, the matter must also have violated community standards of decency or obscenity. In my opinion, the record fails to adequately establish that Appellant intended his grossly vulgar and clearly repugnant language to excite lust in those MCFCU personnel who would receive and perceive the communication. More importantly, the record fails to establish that this language would even tend to excite lust in or deprave the morals of any MCFCU personnel who received and perceived Appellant\u2019s communication. Indeed, although not an element of the offense, this language would not tend to excite lust in Appellant at the time he sent the communication to MCFCU personnel. In other words, when taken in its proper context, it cannot be said, \u201cthe particular language was calculated to excite libidinous thoughts.\u201d <em>United States v. French, </em>31 M.J. 57, 60 (C.M.A.1990). Our superior Court more than made it clear that when applying that test, a court should consider all of the relevant facts of the record, not just the language contained in the particular specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">In <em>United States v. Brinson, </em>49 M.J. 360, 363 (C.A.A.F.1998), our superior Court held that the language communicated by the appellant, to wit: \u201cF... you, you white mother f.....\u201cget me the f ... off the ground, it\u2019s cold; take these f....... chains off of me, I\u2019m going to walk to the f...... car\u201d; \u201cwhite mother f.......\u201d; and \u201cyou can\u2019t treat me like niggers,\u201d or words to that effect, was intended by the appellant to express rage, not \u201csexual desire or moral dissolution,\u201d and affirmed only a guilty finding of a lesser-included offense of disorderly conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 364-65. In Appellant\u2019s case, when responding to question\u2019s by the military judge during the providence inquiry, Appellant told the military judge, \u201cI was just angry and I intended to offend them and get back at them for denying me,\u201d and \u201cI wasn\u2019t paying so much attention to the technical definition of what it was, sir, I just threw the word out to offend them.\u201d Record at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-16\">Although, in my opinion, the providence inquiry in Appellant\u2019s case was not sufficient to establish the offense of depositing obscene matter in the mail, I still conclude that it was sufficient to establish the lesser-included offense of service-discrediting conduct. <em>See United States v. Sapp, </em>53 M.J. 90, 92 (C.A.A.F.2000). In making the determination that the providence inquiry in Appellant\u2019s case was sufficient to establish the lesser-included offense of service-discrediting conduct, I had to answer the following three questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-17\">1. May conduct that violates no specific statute still be an offense under Article, 134, UCMJ, if it is found to be prejudicial to good order and discipline?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-18\">2. Was Appellant\u2019s guilty plea sufficient to support his conviction of service-discrediting conduct under Article 134, UCMJ, where he pleaded guilty to depositing certain matter in the mail as a violation of Article 134, UCMJ; and admitted that his conduct was service discrediting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-19\">3. If this Court cannot affirm the findings announced by the military judge, can we modify the military judge\u2019s findings to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>make them consistent with Appellant\u2019s pleas if the record contains a sufficient factual basis to support such findings?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">I answer all three questions in the affirmative. Having been given the elements for the offense of depositing obscene matters in the mail, Appellant recited a sufficient factual basis for that offense during the providence inquiry. The offense of service-discrediting conduct is undoubtedly a lesser-included offense to the offense to which Appellant entered pleas of guilty. <em>See generally Brinson, </em>49 M.J. at 364-65. Further, I see no constitutional infirmities in the conviction in this case based on the technical discrepancy between the pleas and the findings. Based on the foregoing, I conclude that Appellant suffered no prejudice. Art. 59(a), UCMJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Appellant\u2019s abhorrent conduct under the circumstances was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces and, not to mention, prejudicial to good order and discipline in the armed forces. Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2000 ed.), Part IV, HIT 60c (2)(a) and (3); <em>see Sapp, </em>53 M.J. at 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">I would amend the specification of Additional Charge II to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-8\">In that Corporal Wesley B. Negron, U.S. Marine Corps, Headquarters and Service Battalion, Marine Corps Base, Camp Smedley D. Butler, Okinawa, Japan, on active duty, did, at Okinawa Japan, on or about 10 April 2000, communicate in writing by mail to an unknown person or persons, personnel of a Marine Corps Federal Credit Union branch office in North Carolina, certain language, to wit: \u201cOh yeah, by the way y\u2019all can kiss my ass too!! Worthless bastards! I hope y\u2019all rot in hell you scumbags. Maybe when I get back to the states I\u2019ll walk in your bank and apply for a blow job, a nice dick sucking, I bet y\u2019all are good at that, right?\u201d or words to that effect, which conduct was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the aimed forces.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">I would reassess the sentence and approve the adjudged sentence that includes a bad-conduct discharge, reduction to pay grade E-1, forfeitures of all pay and allowances, and 18 months confinement. The reprehensible offenses Appellant, a noncommissioned officer, committed, strike at the heart of good order and discipline and justify the approval of my reassessed sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">Finally, I concur with the final paragraph of Judge Price\u2019s concurring and dissenting opinion urging our superior Court to reevaluate the restrictive \u201ccalculated to corrupt the morals or excite libidinous thoughts\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">PRICE, Senior Judge, (concurring in Parts I, II, VII, and VIII, and dissenting as to Parts III-VI, IX, X, and the Appendix):</p>\n<p id=\"b901-13\">I concur with the majority\u2019s decision to affirm the findings of guilty of wrongful appropriation and making and uttering a worthless check. As to the majority\u2019s affirmance of the findings of guilty of depositing obscene matter in the mail, I respectfully dissent. Given the binding precedents of our superior Court, I reluctantly conclude that there is a substantial basis to question the appellant\u2019s guilty pleas and findings to the offense of placing obscene material in the mail. I would set aside those findings and reassess the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-14\">A military judge may not accept a guilty plea to an offense without inquiring into its factual basis. <em>United States v. Care, </em>18 C.M.A. 535, 541, 40 C.M.R. 247, 253, 1969 WL 6059 (1969); <em>see </em>Art. 45(a), UCMJ. Before accepting a guilty plea, the military judge must explain the elements of the offense and ensure that a factual basis for the plea exists. <em>United States v. Faircloth, </em>45 M.J. 172, 174 (C.A.A.F.1996). Mere conclusions of law recited by the accused are insufficient to provide a factual basis for a guilty plea. <em>United States v. Outhier, </em>45 M.J. 326, 331 (C.A.A.F.1996). The standard of review to determine whether a guilty plea is provident is whether the record reveals a substantial basis in law and fact for questioning the plea. <em>United States v. Prater, </em>32 M.J. 433, 436 (C.M.A.1991). As succinctly stated by the appellant, \u201c[t]he pertinent question in this case is whether the language in Corporal Negron\u2019s letter is \u2018obscene\u2019 as a matter of military criminal law.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief of 18 Sep 2001 at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>The elements of the offense of Depositing Obscene Matters in the Mail are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-4\">1. That the accused deposited or caused to be deposited in the mails certain matter for mailing and delivery;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-5\">2. That the act was done wrongfully and knowingly;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-6\">3. That the matter was obscene; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-7\">4. That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, (2000 ed.), Part IV, H 94b. \u201cWhether something is obscene is a question of fact. \u2018Obscene\u2019 is synonymous with \u2018indecent\u2019 as the latter is defined in paragraph 89c. The matter must violate community standards of decency or obscenity and must go beyond customary limits of expression.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1194c. Under paragraph 89c, which addresses the related offense of Indecent Language, the following explanation is provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-9\">\u2018Indecent\u2019 language is that which is grossly offensive to modesty, decency, or propriety, or shocks the moral sense, because of its vulgar, filthy, or disgusting nature, or its tendency to incite lustful thought. Language is indecent if it tends reasonably to corrupt morals or incite libidinous thoughts. The language must violate community standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">I note that the second sentence of this explanation was inserted by the 1995 Amendment of the Manual for Courts-Martial in view of the new test for indecent language adopted by the Court of Military Appeals in <em>United States v. French, </em>31 M.J. 57 (C.M.A.1990). MCM (1995 ed.), App. 23, at A23-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-11\">In <em>French, </em>our superior Court squarely addressed the test for indecent/obscene language for the first time. After citing various authorities,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Court adopted the following test: \u201cwhether the particular language is calculated to corrupt morals or excite libidinous thoughts.\u201d <em>French, </em>31 M.J. at 60 (emphasis added). The Court also made it clear that, in applying that test, it would consider all of the relevant facts of record, not just the four corners of the specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-14\">Since <em>French, </em>the only decision from our superior Court that is on point is <em>United States v. Brinson, </em>49 M.J. 360 (C.A.A.P. 1998). Airman Basic Brinson was convicted of communicating indecent language, to wit, \u201cF... you, you white mother f.....; \u201cget me the f... off the ground, it\u2019s cold; take these f......chains off of me, I\u2019m going to walk to the f....... car\u201d; \u201cwhite mother f.......\u201d; and \u201cyou can\u2019t treat me like niggers,\u201d or words to that effect. <em>Id. </em>at 363. According to the testimony, Brinson uttered this language as he was being apprehended by a law enforcement officer. After summarizing the findings, sentence, and post-trial review of the case, the Court opened its analysis with this significant statement: \u201cWhen the Government makes speech a crime, the judges on appeal must use an exacting ruler.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 361. With that caution in mind, I note the following elaboration of the <em>French </em>test: \u201c \u2018Calculated\u2019 is generally understood to mean \u2018intend[ed]\u2019 or \u2018plan[ned]\u2019 to bring about a certain result. <em>See Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary </em>196 (1991)\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 364. The Court decided that Brinson\u2019s use of such language was intended to express rage, not \u201csexual desire or moral dissolution\u201d and affirmed only a guilty finding of a lesser included offense of disorderly conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 364-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-21\">I note that then-Judge Crawford, joined by Judge Gierke, dissented from this holding. She said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-22\">Paragraph 89c, Part IV, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.), <em>provides at least two </em>definitions of \u201cindecent language,\u201d either of which can be the basis for a conviction. In addition to the language underscored by the majority, 49 M.J. at 363-64, the Manual also provides that indecent language includes language that \u201cis grossly offensive to modesty, de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>ceney, or propriety, or shocks the moral sense, because of its vulgar, filthy, or disgusting nature, or its tendency to incite lustful thought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Appellant\u2019s words fit this definition. His language was \u201cgrossly offensive\u201d to \u201cpropriety\u201d and was \u201cvulgar, filthy, [and] disgusting.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b903-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">Although the appellant dutifully admitted that the letter was obscene and sexually-oriented, these admissions were one-word answers to leading questions of the military judge. When given the opportunity to explain his intent, in his own words, the appellant clearly stated that he was simply angry and wanted the credit union to know that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_t\">MJ: Now, I \u2014 these words that I\u2019m going to use, Corporal Negron, are not intended to embarrass you. They are just \u2014 I have to make clear in my own mind that you are, in fact, guilty of this offense. Now, the words, \u201ckiss my ass,\u201d might mean that you wanted someone at the Marine Corps Federal Credit Union to kiss your rear end. Is what you intended to convey to the reader?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-7\">ACC: No, sir. I was just angry and I intended to offend them and get back at them for denying me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-8\">MJ: Okay. Did you intend to convey to them the message though that someone there at the Marine Corps Federal Credit Union could kiss your rear end?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-10\">ACC: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-11\">MJ: Now, a \u201cbastard\u201d might define someone of illegitimate birth. Were you describing someone of illegitimate birth in your letter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-12\">ACC: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-13\">MJ: What did you mean by the word \u201cbastard\u201d? You might want to discuss that with Major Woodworth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-15\">\n<em>The accused conferred with his defense counsel.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-16\">ACC: I wasn\u2019t paying so much attention to the technical definition of what it was, sir, I just threw the word out to offend them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b903-20\">Record at 35 (emphasis added). In choosing words like \u201ckiss my ass,\u201d \u201cblowjob,\u201d and \u201cdick sucking,\u201d I believe that the record shows that the appellant did not actually intend to express sexual desire or moral dissolution. Rather, he was looking for the maximum possible shock value in his complaint letter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While I am confident he achieved his objective, based on my review of the record, I cannot find that his language meets the test established by our superior Court. Thus, there is a substantial basis to question the appellant\u2019s guilty pleas to this offense. Being constrained by the precedents of <em>French </em>and <em>Brinson, </em>I have no choice but to vote to set aside the findings of guilty and dismiss the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-21\">However, I believe that the <em>Brinson </em>dissent is persuasive. Accordingly, I urge our superior Court to reevaluate the restrictive \u201ccalculated to corrupt morals or excite libidinous thoughts\u201d test. If the revolting language used by this Marine cannot be considered legally obscene and indecent, I would be hard pressed to imagine what language would pass an objective test.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-22\">Appendix A</p>\n<p id=\"b903-23\">In defining \u201cindecency,\u201d <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law and Procedure, </em>which is the keystone in the evolution of what is now the applicable military-justice test for indecent language, indicates: \u201cAs ordinary understood, it includes anything which is lewd or lascivious, obscene or grossly vulgar, unbecoming, unseemly, unfit to be seen or heard, or which violates the proprieties of language or behavior.\u201d <em>2 </em>Wharton, Criminal Law and Procedure, sec. 782, page 623 (Anderson ed.1957). Additionally, <em>Wharton\u2019s </em>lists various other tests used to identify obscenity, including whether the questioned language <em>\u201cshocks the ordinary and common sense </em>of men as an indecency____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at sec. 780, page 618 (emphasis added). As it is with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>many cases, that simple, basic standard is one of the keys to this case, and it is a sonar by which courts should seek to ensure that they do not run aground amongst the rocks and shoals of unreasonable interpretations and applications. As in most things, there is a danger in the law straying too far from \u201cthe ordinary and common sense of men____\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">If the generally-agreed-to-be revolting language contained in Appellant\u2019s letter, to which an unknowing individual \u2014 perhaps more than one \u2014 was unknowingly subjected in the ordinary course of doing his or her job, cannot be the basis of some obscenity-related offense under the UCMJ, there would appear to be something amiss in the application of the law. This is particularly true, given the clear defining language in Manual foe Couets-Maetial, United States (2000 ed.), Part IV, 1189c.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">While the Court in <em>Brinson, </em>as discussed above, concludes the accused\u2019s verbal profanity spoken in the heat and \u201cfog of war\u201d was not indecent language, it was able to find that the evidence in the case was sufficient to establish the closely-related offense of disorderly conduct. In this case, however, due at least in part to its guilty-plea nature, we cannot so find. Sans any evidence of the circumstances of the actual receipt of Appellant\u2019s letter and the reaction of the reader or readers, this Court cannot conclude this \u201cprivate\u201d piece of correspondence constituted the offense of disorderly conduct. And, scanning the list of other possible UCMJ violations when \u2014 although not legally indecent \u2014 certain language presents a danger to good order and discipline, none are so triggered by the facts and circumstances of this case, with the exception a general Article 134, clause 2 violation, as discussed above.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">While we conclude that, based on the facts and circumstances of this case, the language Appellant used in his letter to the credit union is legally obscene under current controlling precedent, we make the point to lay the foundation for a request to our superior Court that \u2014 at its earliest appropriate opportunity \u2014 it reevaluate the restrictive \u201ccalculated to corrupt morals or excite libidinous thoughts\u201d test, considering the persuasive appeal of then-Judge Crawford\u2019s dissent in <em>Brinson, in </em>which she was joined by Judge Gierke. <em>Brinson, </em>49 M.J. at 368. As Chief Judge Crawford indicates in <em>Brinson, </em>Paragraph 89c, Part IV, MCM, <em>\u201cprovides at least two </em>definitions of \u2018indecent language,\u2019 either of which can be the basis for a conviction\u201d for indecent language. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">Paragraph 89c defines \u201cindecent language\u201d as that \u201cwhich is grossly offensive to modesty, decency, or propriety, or shocks the moral sense, because of its vulgar, filthy, or disgusting nature, or its tendency to incite lustful thoughts.\u201d MCM, Part IV, f 89c (emphasis added). That sentence should be read in the disjunctive, if for no other reason, because it is written in the disjunctive. The provision goes on, in separate sentences, to indicate: <em>\u201cLanguage is indecent if it tends reasonably to corrupt morals or incite libidinous thoughts. </em>The language must violate community standards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-11\">A reasonable interpretation might well be that the penultimate sentence quoted and highlighted immediately above merely provides clarification of <em>one </em>aspect of what may be legally considered to be indecent language, and not that it is the limiting and exclusive definition of \u201cindecent language\u201d within the military justice system. This interpretation would breathe life back to the initial sentence of the MCM provision, which, it may be said, was placed there for a valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>purpose and was put first because of its importance in providing \u2014 in the disjunctive\u2014 several inclusive, not exclusive, aspects of what may be considered as indecent language.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">When combined with an application of \u201cthe precise circumstances under which the charged language was communicated\u201d requirement of the <em>French/Brinson </em>indecent-language test, this interpretation of the message and intent of Paragraph 89c would provide the free-speech protections (then) Chief Judge Cox sought to ensure by his concurring opinion in <em>Brinson, </em>which he indicates was written specifically \u201cto answer some of the questions raised by [then] Judge Crawford\u201d in her dissent. <em>Brinson, </em>49 M.J. at 365. (Then) Chief Judge Cox discusses <em>Linyear </em>basically for the proposition that \u201cinsulting\u201d language will not be considered an indecent communication when it \u201c <em>\u2018cannot reasonably be construed to convey a libidinous message.\u2019\u201d Brinson, </em>49 M.J. at 367 (Cox, C.J. concurring)(quoting <em>United States v. Linyear, </em>3 M.J. 1027, 1030 (N.C.M.R.)). In <em>Linyear, </em>the issue was whether the calling a female servicemember a \u201cswine\u201d was indecent language within the situational context. <em>Linyear, </em>3 M.J. at 1030.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, not fitting in the initial aspects of the Paragraph 89c definition of indecent language, the only possible way the use of the word \u201cswine\u201d said in \u201ca belligerent \u2018smart-alecky\u2019 tone of voice\u201d appropriately could be adjudged to be indecent is if it fit the \u201clibidinous message\u201d part of the Paragraph 89c definition of indecent language. Thus, the approach and result in <em>Linyear </em>is not inconsistent or problematic with the revisions to the indecent-language test suggested by Chief Judge Crawford in her <em>Brinson </em>dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">Likewise, in <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>27 C.M.R. 654 (A.B.R.1959), the case from which the Court in <em>Linyear </em>took the \u201clibidinous message\u201d standard,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the issue was whether sentences that are \u201cinnocuous\u201d standing alone could be considered offensive \u201cif spoken in a context or in a connection that would infuse them with an objectionable significance.\u201d <em>Simmons, </em>27 C.M.R. at 656. Once again, the only possible aspect of Paragraph 89c that could apply to such a circumstances is the \u201clibidinous message\u201d provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-13\">Such is also the case with the circumstances in <em>United States v. Wainwright, </em>42 C.M.R. 997, 1970 WL 7286 (A.F.C.M.R.1970), which also cited by (then) Chief Judge Cox in his concurring opinion in <em>Brinson. </em>In <em>Wainwright, </em>the words used by the accused did not on their face \u201cconvey an indecent message,\u201d and the Court ruled; \u201cWe are not prepared to conclude, however, that expressions <em>otherwise barren of libidinous innuendo, when given their ordinary meaning, </em>can be infused with criminality by the simple expedient of alleging them to be indecent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1000. In our case herein, Appellant\u2019s words and graphic expressions are not \u201cbarren of libidinous innuendo\u201d and nothing need be added to their \u201cordinary meaning\u201d to make them indecent.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-14\">Another concern expressed by (then) Chief Cox in his <em>Brinson </em>concurring opinion is that if the definition of indecent language provided in Paragraph 89c is applied in its entirety \u201cscarcely a day would pass without numerous violations of the Uniform Code if service-members were prosecuted for using the well-known \u2018four letters words.\u2019 Sadly, the lexicon of many servieemembers is replete with such profanity.\u201d <em>Brinson, </em>49 M.J. at 367 (Cox, C.J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-15\">While it is unnecessary in this context to examine the issue fully, one wonders whether the Naval Service\u2019s renewed commitment to its traditional core values, as applied to today\u2019s cultural environment in the Navy and Marines Corps, has changed or challenged the \u201cacceptability\u201d of traditional \u201csailor talk\u201d commonly spiced with profanity, and thus altering, perhaps, the \u201ccommunity standard,\u201d as it applies to the issue of indecent language. Any concern, however, that mere \u201ccoarse language\u201d among \u201cconsenting\u201d servicemembers will be prosecuted <em>per se </em>as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>indecent language appears unfounded, given the circumstances-of-the-communication aspect of the military-justice test for obscenity, even if the Paragraph 89c definition of indecent language is fully applied. <em>See United States v. Prince, </em>14 M.J. 654, 656 (A.C.M.R. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Thus, it is respectfully submitted \u2014 modified by a consideration of the circumstances of the communication within any given case \u2014 that a full application of the Paragraph 89c definition of indecent language may be made, while taking into account and protecting against the manifestations of the concerns expressed by Judge Cox and others as discussed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b888-11\">.
