The convening authority approved the adjudged sentence to a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for five months, and forfeiture of all pay and allowances.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-15\">This case is before the court for mandatory review under Article 66, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866. Under the facts and circumstances of this case, the military judge\u2019s guilty plea inquiry meets the minimal requirements to be legally and factually sufficient and no relief is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-17\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b792-18\">The military judge advised appellant that his guilty plea would admit every element of the charged offenses and that it authorized imposition of the maximum punishment. He also explained to appellant that a guilty plea waived his right against self-incrimination, his right to trial by court-martial on the merits, and his right to confront and cross-examine any witnesses that could be called against him. Appellant was placed under oath. The military judge correctly advised appellant of the four elements of wrongful appropriation, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-19\">MJ: Okay, I\u2019m going to read to you the four elements of wrongful appropriation, okay. The first one is that at or near Fort Hood, Texas, on or about the 10th of March, you wrongfully took, withheld, or obtained certain property, in this case a checkbook, from the possession of Specialist [C.G.]. The second element is that the property belonged to Specialist [C.G.]. The third element is that the property was of a value less than $100. The last element is [that] the taking, withholding, or obtaining by you of this property was with the intent to temporarily deprive or defraud [Specialist C.G.] of the use or benefit of that property, or to temporarily appropriate the property to your own use or the use of someone other than the owner, in this case [Specialist C.G.]. There\u2019s kind of a lot of stuff there, but we can work our way through it one item at a time. Why don\u2019t you tell me what happened in your own words.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-20\"><em>See Manual for Courts-Martial, United States </em>(2000 ed.) [hereinafter <em>MCM, </em>2000], Part IV, para. 46b(2). The military judge failed to follow the usual practice of Army military judges in that he did not read to appellant applicable definitions from the Dep\u2019t of Army, Pam. 27-9, Legal Services: Military Judges\u2019 Benchbook [hereinafter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>Benchbook], para. 3^6-2d (1 Apr. 2001),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-5\">\u201cPossession\u201d means care, custody, management, or control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-6\">\u201cOwner\u201d refers to any person (or entity) who, at the time of the (taking) (obtaining) (withholding) had a greater right to possession than the accused did, in light of all the conflicting interests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-7\">Property \u201cbelongs\u201d to a person or entity having (title to the property) (a greater right to possession of the property than the accused) (or) (possession of the property).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-8\">\u201cTook\u201d means any actual or constructive moving, carrying, leading, riding, or driving away of another\u2019s personal property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-9\"><em>See also MCM, </em>2000, Part IV, para. 46c.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">In connection with the forgery offenses, the military judge correctly described its three elements as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-11\">MJ: ... The first element is that at or near Fort Hood, Texas, on divers occasion, between the dates of 10 March 2001 and 15 April 2001, you falsely altered certain checks as described in the specification, and if you\u2019ve got it in front of you, you can see them all listed. Now does your copy reflect what you [are pleading] guilty to? ACC: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-12\">MJ: In other words, the checks are all similar, they\u2019re just different numbers and different dollar amounts of the checks. ACC: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-13\">MJ: ... The second element is that these checks would, if they were genuine, operate to the legal harm of another person. And, the last element is that the alleged false writings were made with intent to defraud. Okay, do you understand those three elements?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-14\">ACC: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-18\"><em>See MCM, </em>2000, Part IV, para. 48b(l). However, the military judge again failed to provide any of the definitions from the Bench-book, para. 3-48-ld, to wit:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aup\">\u201cFalsely (made) (altered)\u201d means an unauthorized signing of a document or an unauthorized (making) (altering) of the writing which causes it to appear to be different from what it really is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-19\">\u201cIntent to defraud\u201d means an intent to obtain an article or thing of value through a misrepresentation and to apply it to one\u2019s own use and benefit or the use and benefit of another, whether temporarily or permanently.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-20\"><em>See also MCM, </em>2000, Part IV, para. 48c.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-21\">Appellant agreed that his stipulation of fact, which provided sufficient facts to support appellant\u2019s guilty plea, correctly described his conduct and was entered into voluntarily. Appellant also agreed that the stipulation of fact was part of his pretrial agreement, and could be used to determine guilt and an appropriate sentence. Appellant provided a clear factual description of his conduct in support of his guilty plea to wrongful appropriation of Specialist (SPC) C.G.\u2019s checkbook and to his subsequent altering of six of SPC C.G.\u2019s checks in the total amount of $535.88.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-22\">Appellant was neither inexperienced nor immature. He was of below-average intelligence, holding a general technical score of eighty-eight, but there was no evidence of mental disability. Appellant had a high school diploma. At the time of trial, appellant was twenty-three years old and had completed four years of active service. He was married and had two children. He also had some prior experience with the military justice system in that he received nonjudicial punishment on two occasions, one each at company grade and field grade levels. <em>See </em>UCMJ art. 15,10 U.S.C. \u00a7 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>Law</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Our superior court has long required the military judge, in guilty plea cases, to \u201cinquire as to the facts surrounding the accused\u2019s guilty pleas and [to] determine whether an accused is pleading guilty knowingly and voluntarily.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>34 M.J. 270, 272 (C.M.A.1992) (citing <em>United States v. Care, </em>18 U.S.C.M.A. 535, 539, 40 C.M.R. 247, 251, 1969 WL 6059 (1969), and <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>9 M.J. 364 (C.M.A.1980)); <em>see also Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 615, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998) (noting that for a guilty plea to be constitutionally valid it must be voluntary and intelligent and \u201c[a] plea is not intelligent unless a defendant first receives real notice of the nature of the charge against him\u201d). \u201cBefore accepting a plea of guilty, the military judge shall address the accused personally and inform the accused of, and determine that the accused understands ... [t]he nature of the offense to which the plea is offered....\u201d Rule for Courts-Martial [hereinafter R.C.M.] 910(c)(1); <em>see also United States v. Roeseler, </em>55 M.J. 286, 289 (2001) (\u201c[T]he military judge is tasked with ensuring that the military accused understands the nature of the offenses to which guilty pleas are accepted.\u201d (citation omitted)). The military judge\u2019s failure \u201cto explain to the accused every element of the offense charged\u201d is ordinarily error. <em>United States v. Sweet, </em>42 M.J. 183, 184 (1995) (citing <em>Care, </em>18 U.S.C.M.A. at 541, 40 C.M.R. at 253); <em>see </em>R.C.M. 910(e) discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">For the most complex offenses, such as conspiracy or accessory after the fact, \u201cfailure to explain the elements will <em>generally </em>result in reversal.\u201d <em>United States v. Nystrom, </em>39 M.J. 698, 702 (N.M.C.M.R.1993) (emphasis added) (citing <em>United States v. Pretlow, </em>13 M.J. 85 (C.M.A.1982)); <em>see also United States v. Bullman, </em>56 M.J. 377, 383 (2002) (noting that one reason appellant\u2019s guilty plea was improvident was because the military judge failed to define \u201cdishonorable conduct\u201d with respect to a specification alleging dishonorable failure to pay a just debt). For other offenses, such as carnal knowledge,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> aggravated assault,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or for criminal responsibility as an aider and abettor,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> failure to provide all relevant definitions is also error, but not necessarily reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">A guilty plea, however, is not automatically rendered improvident by the military judge\u2019s failure to identify or explain the elements of the offense \u201cif the accused admits facts which establish that all the elements are true.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>45 M.J. 661, 663-64 (Army Ct.Crim.App. 1997) (citing <em>United States v. Jones, </em>34 M.J. 270 (C.M.A.1992)). \u201cRejection of a guilty plea on appellate review requires that the record of trial show a substantial basis in law and fact for questioning the guilty plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>57 M.J. 236 (2002) (citing <em>United States v. Prater, </em>32 M.J. 433, 436 (C.M.A.1991)). \u201cFor simple military offenses whose elements are commonly known and understood by servicemembers, an explanation of the elements of the offense is not required to establish the providence of a guilty plea if the record otherwise makes clear that the accused understood those elements.\u201d <em>Nystrom, </em>39 M.J. at 701 (citing <em>United States v. Kilgore, </em>21 U.S.C.M.A. 35, 44 C.M.R. 89, 1971 WL 12456 (1971)). In any event, a military accused is not entitled to a \u201claw school lecture\u201d on legal concepts applicable to a guilty plea. <em>See Roeseler, </em>55 M.J. at 289 (affirming guilty plea to conspira<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>cy and noting no requirement to explain \u201cdifference between bilateral and unilateral conspiracy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">With regard to the offenses of wrongful appropriation and forgery, the military judge\u2019s failure to define and explain the terms \u201cpossession,\u201d \u201cowner,\u201d \u201cbelongs,\u201d \u201ctook,\u201d \u201cfalsely altered,\u201d and \u201cintent to defraud\u201d in this case reflects a lack of attention to detail. <em>See Ray, </em>44 M.J. at 838; <em>United States v. Hansen, </em>\u2014 M.J.-, slip op. at 4 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App. 14 Jan. 2003). However the three most critical requirements for a provident guilty plea were met. Appellant admitted the facts necessary to establish the charges, he expressed a belief in his own guilt, and there were no inconsistencies between the facts and the pleas. <em>See Jones, </em>34 M.J. at 272 (citing <em>Davenport, </em>9 M.J. at 366-67). Appellant clearly understood the wrongfulness of his actions as evidenced by his guilty plea, his testimony, and the discussion of the stipulation of fact with the military judge. This understanding, along with consideration of the entire record, allows us to be confident that appellant\u2019s guilty pleas were provident and that \u201cthe dictates of Article 45, [UCMJ,] 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 845, R.C.M. 910, and <em>Care </em>and its progeny have been met.\u201d <em>Jordan, </em>57 M.J. at 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">We have reviewed the matters personally raised by appellant under <em>United States v. Grostefon, </em>12 M.J. 431 (C.M.A.1982), and find them to be without merit. The findings of guilty and the sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">Senior Judge HARVEY and Judge BARTO concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b793-15\">. The Benchbook contains nonbinding model instructions for military trial judges. <em>United States v. Carson, </em>57 M.J. 410, 413 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b793-16\">. The means by which \"legal harm\u201d may ensue is obvious in a check forgery case. Therefore, the military judge did not err when he failed to explain \u201clegal harm\u201d to appellant. <em>See </em>Bench-book, para. 3-48-ld, Note 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b793-23\">. Appellant and SPC C.G. were roommates. Specialist C.G. had presigned his checks. Appellant took SPC C.G.\u2019s checkbook and filled in the amounts and payees on six checks while SPC C.G. was deployed. Appellant then conveyed the six checks to either vendors or his wife.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b794-6\">. <em>See United States v. Bates, </em>40 M.J. 362, 362-63 (C.M.A.1994) (holding guilty plea to carnal knowledge was minimally sufficient even though military judge failed to define \"sexual intercourse\u201d or explain that \u201c[ajny penetration, ... however slight, is sufficient to complete the offense\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b794-7\">. <em>United States v. Ray, </em>44 M.J. 835, 838 (Army Ct.Crim.App.1996) (holding failure to define the term \"grievous bodily harm\u201d for offense of assault with intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm was not so deficient as to make the guilty plea improvident (citation omitted)), <em>rev'd in part </em>cy <em>other grounds, </em>49 M.J. 50 (1998) (summary disposition).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b794-11\">. Our superior court has stated, \"It would have been eminently appropriate for the trial judge to have explicitly advised the accused that, to be an aider and abettor, he had to intend to aid the criminal venture of the principals. While no such express advice was provided, in light of the appellant\u2019s admissions of fact, the scope of the <em>Care </em>inquiry was not fatally deficient.\u201d <em>United States v. Crouch, </em>11 M.J. 128, 130 (C.M.A.1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
