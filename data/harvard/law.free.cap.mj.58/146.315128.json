Contrary to his pleas, a general court-martial composed of officer and enlisted members convicted Appellant of an additional specification of violating a lawful order and an additional specification of adultery. The adjudged and approved sentence provided for a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for forty-five (45) days, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and reduction to Private El. With the exception of certain modifications to the forfeiture not relevant to this appeal, the Army Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings and sentence in a memorandum opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">On Appellant\u2019s petition, we granted review of the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-5\">WHETHER THE MILITARY JUDGE ERRED BY INFORMING THE PANEL MEMBERS THAT APPELLANT HAD PLEADED GUILTY TO SOME OFFENSES BUT NOT OTHERS</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the military judge erred and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Appellant was a twenty-four year-old married sergeant with approximately six years of service and, at all times relevant to the charges and specifications in this case, was assigned to the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center at the Presidio of Monterey, California. In his capacity as a training noncommissioned officer, Appellant was tasked with establishing training schedules and events for students.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">In June of 1996, the Commander of the Defense Language Institute issued a policy memorandum on relationships with students, prohibiting staff members involved in training or evaluation from forming nonprofessional relationships with students. Nonprofessional relationships with students were defined as including, but not being limited to, dating, drinking, gambling, borrowing or loaning money and engaging in sexual activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">Appellant was tried in May 1999 for alleged violations of: Article 92 (four specifications) for violating the above-referenced command policy by engaging in nonprofessional relationships with Private First Class (PFC) AC, Private (PVT) SG, PFC MB and Private E-2 (PV2) CA; Article 93, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 893 (2002) (three specifications) for making offensive and sexual overtures to PFC AC and PFC NW; Article 125, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 925 (2002) (two specifications) for consensual sodomy with PV2 CA;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Article 134 (four specifications) for indecent assault upon PFC AC and adultery with PFC AC, PVT E-2 CA and Specialist CB.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">At the commencement of his trial, Appellant entered mixed pleas with respect to the charges. He pleaded guilty to two of the four Article 92 specifications (PFC AC and PFC CB) and two of the three adultery specifications under Article 134 (PFC AC and PFC CB). He pleaded not guilty to the remaining charges and specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-14\">Following her providence inquiry and entry of the guilty findings, the military judge engaged in the following exchange with counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-15\">MJ: Please be seated [The accused and his counsel did as directed.] Captain Bogie, I believe that we have the members called for at 0915?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-16\">TC: That is correct, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-17\">MJ: Okay. Let\u2019s take up some administrative matters right now. Do we have an extra copy of the flyer that we can have marked as an appellate exhibit and has a copy of that been provided to the defense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-18\">DC: No, Your Honor. The defense doesn\u2019t even have a copy of the flyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACR\">MJ: Why don\u2019t we just go ahead and use my copy here. Captain Salerno, please approach. [The defense counsel did as directed.] Take a moment to review that. [The military judge hands the defense counsel a copy of the flyer.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>DC: Your Honor, the copy of the flyer that you just provided to me still contains a list of the specifications to which Sergeant Kaiser just pled guilty. Is it your\u2014 is it that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-4\">MJ: If you take a look at Page 46 of DA Pam 27-9, you\u2019ll note that the members are informed that that has occurred. That\u2019s why those specifications remain on it. Okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">DC: That\u2019s fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">MJ: Captain Salerno, any objection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-7\">DC: No objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-8\">MJ: Okay. Let\u2019s go ahead and have a copy of that marked as an appellate exhibit. We can do that on the break. Just make sure that goes into the record____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">Following preliminary instructions and voir dire of the panel, the military judge advised the members as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-12\">MJ: Please be seated. Court members, at an earlier session, the accused pled guilty to several specifications. I\u2019d like you to take out your flyer, so that you can just place a mark next to those. He pled guilty to Specification 2 of Charge I and Specification \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, Specification 1 of Charge I and Specification 3 of Charge I; if you\u2019d just place a small mark next to those. And then if you\u2019d go down to Charge IV, he pled guilty to Specification 2 of that Charge and guilty to Specification 4 of that Charge. And he pled not guilty to all other specifications and charges. You are advised that findings by the court members will not be required on those specifications to which the accused has already been found guilty pursuant to his plea. I inquired into the providence of his plea of guilty to those specifications and found his plea to be provident, accepted it, and entered findings of guilty on those specifications that I have just gone over with you. Findings will be required, however, as to the charges and specifications to which the accused has pled not guilty. Does any member have a question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-14\">[The members indicated a negative response.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-15\">Are both sides ready to proceed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-16\">TC: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-17\">DC: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-18\">The court-martial proceeded from that point, with Appellant electing to testify in his defense. The members found Appellant guilty of an Article 92 violation and an Article 134 violation with PVT E-2 CA. He was found not guilty of an Article 92 violation with respect to PVT SG, not guilty of the Article 93 specifications involving PFC AC and PFC NW, not guilty of the Article 125 specifications involving PVT E-2 CA and not guilty of the Article 134 indecent assault specification involving PFC AC.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-19\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b208-20\">The military judge openly advised the court members at the commencement of the trial that Appellant had pleaded guilty to some of the charges, but not guilty to others. When defense counsel raised a question about the inclusion on the flyer of the specifications to which Appellant had pleaded guilty, the military judge advised him that those specifications remained because the <em>Military Judges\u2019 Benchbook </em>required that the members be informed of the guilty pleas. <em>See </em>Military Judges\u2019 Benchbook: Legal Services, Dep\u2019t of the Army, Pamphlet 27-9, <em>Military Judges\u2019 Benchbook </em>28, 46 (1996) [hereinafter Benchbook]<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-21\">The <em>Benchbook </em>does not contain such a requirement. The <em>Benchbook </em>provides the following instruction after a plea is accepted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AN\">The MJ should not inform the court members of plea and findings of guilty prior to presentation of the evidence on another specification to which the accused pled not guilty, unless the accused requests it or the guilty plea was to an LIO [Lessor Included Offense] and the prosecution intends to prove the greater offense. Unless one of these two exceptions exist, the flyer should not have any specifieations/eharges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>which reflect provident guilty pleas if other offenses are being contested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-5\"><em>See Benchbook </em>at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Contrary to the military judge\u2019s statement that the <em>Benchbook </em>directs notification of the court members of guilty pleas as a matter of course, such notification is directed only when specifically requested by the accused. In the absence of a specific request by the accused or circumstances involving an LIO, \u201cthe flyer should not have any specifications/charges which reflect provident guilty pleas if other offenses are being contested.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The provisions of the <em>Benchbook </em>are consistent with and reflect the requirements of Rule for Courts-Martial 913(a) [hereinafter R.C.M.]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">(a) <em>Preliminary Instructions. </em>The military judge may give such preliminary instructions as may be appropriate. If mixed pleas have been entered, the military judge should ordinarily defer informing the members of the offenses to which the accused pleaded guilty until after the findings on the remaining contested offenses have been entered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">This same directive to ordinarily defer informing members of guilty pleas in mixed plea cases is also found in the discussion under R.C.M. 910(g), which relates to the entry of findings. Finally, the discussion under R.C.M. 913(a) makes it clear that \u201c[ejxeeptions to the rule requiring the military judge to defer informing the members of an accused\u2019s prior pleas of guilty include cases in which the accused has specifically requested, on the record, that the military judge instruct the members of the prior pleas of guilty\u201d and cases involving guilty pleas to an LIO.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">The current rule is based in part on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>23 M.J. 89 (C.M.A.1986), where we held that the military judge erred in advising the members at the outset of the trial that the accused had earlier pleaded guilty to certain of the charged offenses. <em>See also United States v. Smith, </em>23 M.J. 118 (C.M.A.1986)(in the usual ease, no lawful <em>purpose is </em>served by informing members prior to findings about any charges to which an accused has pleaded guilty); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>26 M.J. 445 (C.M.A.1988)(the practice of informing members of guilty pleas provides a fertile area for assertion of error on appeal and can serve no useful purpose).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-14\">The law in this area is clear \u2014 in a mixed plea case, in the absence of a specific request made by the accused on the record, members of a court-martial should not be informed of any prior pleas of guilty until after findings on the remaining contested offenses are made. This rule is long-standing and embodied in the <em>Benchbook, </em>R.C.M. 910(g), R.C.M. 913(a) and our decisions in <em>Smith, Rivera, </em>and <em>Davis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-15\">The military judge therefore erred in the present case by providing a flyer to the panel that contained the specifications to which Appellant had pleaded guilty. There was no specific request made by Appellant that such advance notification be given to the members.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-16\">As noted in <em>Davis, </em>such an error does not always mandate a reversal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-17\">Where, however, admission of evidence does not violate the accused\u2019s constitutional rights, reversal is not required if we determine that the error was not prejudicial, i.e., if the finder of fact was not influenced by it or if it had only a slight effect on resolution of the case. <em>United States v. Barnes, </em>8 M.J. 115 (C.M.A.1979).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-18\">26 M.J. at 449-50 (footnote omitted). As we further acknowledged in <em>Davis: </em>\u201cError of constitutional dimensions requires either automatic reversal or an inquiry into whether, beyond a reasonable doubt, the error did not contribute to the defendant\u2019s conviction or sentence.\u201d 26 M.J. at 449 n. 4 (citing <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>1 M.J. 890 (C.M.A.1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">The error here directly implicates the presumption of innocence and specifically the effect that advance notification to members of guilty pleas in a mixed plea case has on that presumption. The presumption of innocence is a longstanding feature of both military and civilian law. It is a critical part of our tradition of justice and deeply imbedded in our culture as well as our systems of justice. <em>United States v. Washington, </em>57 M.J. 394, 402 (C.A.A.F.2002)(Baker, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">In strict legal terms, the presumption of innocence flows from the fundamental right to a fair trial: \u201cThe right to a fair trial is a fundamental liberty secured by the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Drope v. Missouri, </em>420 U.S. 162, 172, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975). The presumption of innocence, although not articulated in the Constitution, is a basic component of a fair trial under our system of criminal justice.\u201d <em>Estelle v. Williams, </em>425 U.S. 501, 503, 96 S.Ct. 1691, 48 L.Ed.2d 126 (1976). As reflected in the language of Article 51(c)(1), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(e)(1) (2002), the presumption of innocence is directly related to the requirement that guilt be established by legal and competent evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. Put another way, the presumption of innocence embodies the principle that \u201cone accused of a crime is entitled to have his guilt or innocence determined solely on the basis of the evidence introduced at trial, and not on grounds of official suspicion, indictment, continued custody, or other circumstances not adduced as proof at trial.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Kentucky, </em>436 U.S. 478, 485, 98 S.Ct. 1930, 56 L.Ed.2d 468 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Appellant was entitled to a presumption of innocence throughout his trial. He had a right to have his guilt or innocence of the contested specifications determined by the members solely on the basis of legal and competent evidence introduced at trial and not on other grounds, i.e., his pleas of guilty to other similar specifications. <em>Id.; </em>Article 51(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-13\">In this case, the panel was handed a flyer indicating that Appellant had been charged with thirteen separate specifications of criminal conduct and was then told that Appellant had already pleaded guilty to some of the specifications. They were not advised at that time of the legal effect of those guilty pleas, but instead heard trial counsel intimate that they might serve as a basis for \u201cinferring\u201d something.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-14\">The circumstances under which the members were advised of Appellant\u2019s guilty pleas formed a part of the \u201cfilter\u201d through which they viewed the evidence presented at trial and posed a heightened risk that the members felt invited, consciously or subconsciously, to draw an impermissible inference from Appellant\u2019s guilty pleas. <em>Cf. United States v. Riley, </em>47 M.J. 276, 280 (C.A.A.F.1997)(discussing effect of impermissible comments at outset of trial on right to remain silent).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-15\">Finally, we note that Appellant was found not guilty of all of the \u201cdissimilar\u201d offenses (i.e., the maltreatment, indecent assault and consensual sodomy specifications), but guilty of the \u201csimilar\u201d specifications (i.e., violation of a lawful order and adultery).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-16\">The Government has suggested that any error here is harmless, as the rules of evidence would have permitted introduction of evidence of the misconduct underlying the guilty pleas, independent of any notification to the members of the actual pleas themselves. <em>See Rivera, </em>23 M.J. at 96 (discussing potential admissibility of such evidence under Military Rule of Evidence 404(b) and under cross-examination). While the rules of evidence may well allow for that possibility, we decline to speculate as whether or in-what manner such evidence might have been brought to the attention of the members.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Based on our review of the record and circumstances present in this ease, we conclude that the military judge\u2019s decision to advise the members that Appellant had pleaded guilty to some offenses but not others, in the absence of any specific request to that effect made by Appellant on the record, was not harmless error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Accordingly, the decision of the Army Court of Criminal Appeals is reversed and the findings of guilty on Charge I, Specification 4 and Charge IV, Specification 3 are set aside. The sentence is set aside. The record of trial is returned to the Judge Advocate General for remand to the Court of Criminal Appeals. That court may dismiss the specifications and reassess the sentence or it may order a rehearing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b207-10\">. Private E-2 CA is identified as \u201cPVT E-2 [CA]\u201d under Specification 4 of Charge I (Violation of Order) and Specification 3 of Charge IV (Adultery), but is also identified as \u201cPFC [CA]\u201d in Specifications 1 and 2 of Charge III (Sodomy).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b208-13\">.

The referenced provisions are identical to those in effect at the time of trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b209-11\">. The defense counsel did point out to the military judge that the flyer contained the guilty pleas, but he was cut off with a firm but clearly erroneous assertion that such a disclosure was required by the <em>Benchbook. </em>Given those circumstances and the nature of the military judge\u2019? error (i.e., failure to secure an affirmative request from the accused, on the record, for her actions), we conclude that the error is preserved for our review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b210-7\">. Trial counsel made reference to the guilty pleas in his opening statement, initially asking the members to \"separate that from [their] mind[s]\u201d and indicating that the government was \"proving different charges.\u201d However, trial counsel went on to state: \"[you] may be able to make some inferences, but the fact that [Appellant] pled guilty to those does not alone prove the remainder of the charges.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b211-12\">. We make no determination as to whether the error here is constitutional or non-constitutional in nature. We hold simply that the error was not harmless under either standard. See <em>United States v. Alameda, 57 </em>M.J. 190, 199-200 (C.A.A.F. 2002) <em>(comparing </em>standards).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b211-7\">CRAWFORD, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A6\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Rule for Courts-Martial 913(a) [hereinafter R.C.M.] provides the following guidance regarding preliminary instructions: \u201cThe military judge may give such preliminary instructions as may be appropriate. If mixed pleas have been entered, the military judge should ordinarily defer informing the members of the offenses to which the accused pleaded guilty until after the findings on the remaining contested offenses have been entered.\u201d The nonbinding Discussion following the Rule adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-10\">Exceptions to the rule requiring the military judge to defer informing the members of an accused\u2019s prior pleas of guilty include cases in which the accused has specifically requested, on the record, that the military judge instruct the members of the prior pleas of guilty and cases in which a plea of guilty was to a lesser included offense within the contested offense charged in the specification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">R.C.M. 913(a) discussion. The Majority is correct that the <em>Benchbook </em>reflects the content of the discussion, and that the military judge misinformed counsel regarding the guidance contained in the <em>Benchbook\u2019s </em>advice. <em>See </em>Military Judges\u2019 Benchbook: Legal Services, Dep\u2019t of the Army, Pamphlet 27-9, <em>Military Judges\u2019 Benchbook, </em>29, 47 (2001)[hereinafter Benchbook]</p>\n<p id=\"b211-15\">Nevertheless, the language of R.C.M. 913(a) is clear that to \u201cdefer informing the members of the offenses to which the accused pleaded guilty\u201d is what the judge <em>\u201cordinarily\u201d </em>should do; hence, the Discussion\u2019s mention of two situations \u201cinelude[d]\u201d among exceptions to the rule. The case at hand is precisely one more exception. In short, the judge\u2019s authorization of the flyer permitted the members to consider what was otherwise admissible evidence under Military Rule of Evidence 803(22) and 404(b) [hereinafter M.R.E.].</p>\n<p id=\"b211-16\">Furthermore, in failing to object to the flyer\u2019s content when the opportunity arose at trial, Appellant waived any post-trial objection to the flyer. Even assuming that the military judge erred, the error was not \u201cplain\u201d to the extent that this Court should reverse the decision below.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-17\">For these reasons, discussed at length below, I would affirm the decision of the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-18\">\n<em>The Guilty Pleas Were Admissible Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b211-19\">First, Appellant\u2019s guilty pleas were admissible under M.R.E. 803(22). M.R.E. 803 lists the exceptions to the hearsay rule that are not contingent upon a declarant\u2019s availability. Included among this list is M.R.E. 803(22), pertaining to judgments of prior convictions: \u201cEvidence of a final judgment, entered after a trial or upon a plea of guilty ... adjudging a person guilty of a crime punishable by death, dishonorable discharge, or imprisonment in excess of one year, to prove any fact essential to sustain the judgment ...\u201d is admissible. R.C.M. 910(g) allows that \u201c[findings based on a plea of guilty may be entered immediately upon acceptance of the plea at an Article 39(a) session.\u201d Pursuant to this rule, the military judge noted to Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>pellant that \u201c[o]n your plea alone and without receiving any evidence, this court can find you guilty of the offenses to which you have pled guilty.\u201d After extensive questioning the judge determined Appellant\u2019s pleas to be provident. The guilty pleas listed on the flyer were therefore admissible under this rule, as evidence of a final judgment entered upon a plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Second, Appellant\u2019s admissions during the providency inquiry rendered the guilty pleas admissible under M.R.E. 404(b). This rule addresses the potential prejudice that could result from members\u2019 knowledge of other crimes committed, or allegedly committed, by the accused. M.R.E. 404(b) reads: \u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\u201d The motive behind this rule is the same motive that generates the military\u2019s efforts \u201cto assure that [in trials by courts-martial] an accused will not be found guilty of one offense merely because he is guilty of other crimes.\u201d <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>23 M.J. 89, 95 (C.M.A.1986). This is precisely why Appellant claims that he has been prejudiced by the members\u2019 consideration of his guilty pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Yet, M.R.E. 404(b) provides a significant exception: Such otherwise inadmissible evidence may be admissible \u201cfor other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d Appellant\u2019s admissions during the providency inquiry concerning the four uncontested specifications were so closely factually intertwined with <em>all </em>of the specifications that each admission and corresponding guilty plea was illustrative of Appellant\u2019s motive, opportunity, and intent regarding the contested specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">During the providency inquiry in this case the military judge meticulously narrated the facts related to each uncontested offense and then asked Appellant to confirm that the elements of each offense accurately described what Appellant had done. In replying to the judge, Appellant described having consensual sex in his barracks room with Private First Class (PFC) AC, a woman who was in training at the Presidio, allowing another woman, PFC M.B., to remain in his bed unconscious from extreme intoxication, and having sex with a Specialist (SP4) CB, a Presidio student, in her barracks room after meeting her at a local bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">The information gleaned from these admissions tracked the essential elements of <em>all </em>of the specifications. The plea admissions involved the same type of women (trainees), the same type of acts, and the same general sexual behavior as the contested charges alleged. The specifications concerned a total of six women who had contact with Appellant between December 1997 and July 1998, and included charges of fraternization, maltreatment, sodomy, indecent acts, and adultery. The fraternization charge under Article 92 addresses the failure to obey an order or regulation, in this case a regulation prohibiting nonprofessional relationships with trainees. <em>See </em>Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice [hereinafter UCMJ], 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 892 (2002). The Article 93 maltreatment charge in pertinent part punishes sexual harassment, which includes \u201cdeliberate or repeated offensive comments or gestures of a sexual nature.\u201d Article 93, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 893 (2002). The sodomy charge under Article 125 prohibits \u201cunnatural carnal copulation.\u201d Article 125, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 925 (2002). Finally, the Article 134 charge of indecent acts and adultery alleges appellant\u2019s behavior to have been contrary to good order and discipline. <em>See </em>Article 134, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 934 (2002). The essential elements of these charges, the type of behavior they punish, were clearly the essential elements of Appellant\u2019s guilty pleas and corresponding providency admissions. The guilty pleas were therefore indicative of Appellant\u2019s motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, and/or plan regarding the contested specifications, and as such were admissible under M.R.E. 404(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>In sum, although the judge may have misconstrued the <em>Benchbook, </em>she did so in the context of circumstances exceptional to the \u201cordinary\u201d parameters of R.C.M. 913(a), rightly permitting the members to consider what would otherwise have been admissible evidence under M.R.E. 803(22) and 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\n<em>Appellant Waived Objection to the Flyer</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">R.C.M. 905(e) states that \u201cobjections ... must be raised before the court-martial is adjourned for that case and ... failure to do so shall constitute waiver.\u201d The purpose of this rule is \u201cto eliminate the expense to the parties and the public of rehearing an issue that could have been dealt with by a timely objection or motion at trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Huffman, </em>40 M.J. 225, 229 (C.M.A.1994)(Crawford, J., dissenting in part and concurring in the result). In the present case, defense counsel waived any objection to informing the members about the previous guilty pleas when he stated \u201cthat\u2019s fine\u201d and \u201cno objection\u201d after the military judge\u2019s erroneous summary of the <em>Benchbook. </em>The judge gave defense counsel the opportunity to debate the legality of the flyer\u2019s content, yet counsel had nothing to say. This failure to argue, coupled with counsel\u2019s explicit assertion that he had \u201cno objection,\u201d constitutes waiver, pure and simple. Absent plain error, the issue is therefore not suited for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Furthermore, throughout the court-martial, defense counsel actively put Appellant\u2019s guilty pleas before the members. During his opening statement, defense counsel remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3\">[The Accused] has an absolute right not to say anything. That\u2019s not the kind of soldier [he] is. He came forward this morning and said, \u201cI\u2019ve done wrong, Your Honor. I\u2019m guilty of these offenses. I\u2019m going to tell you about it.\u201d And he did. But, I can\u2019t tell you about these other things for one simple reason: because they did not happen. I can\u2019t tell you about something that did not happen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-12\">In addition, defense counsel repeatedly asked witnesses whether Appellant\u2019s guilty pleas had any bearing on the witnesses\u2019 opinion of Appellant. Finally, in his closing argument defense counsel characterized Appellant\u2019s guilty pleas as acts which \u201chappened off duty hours in the privacy of his barracks room\u201d and, in so doing, reiterated Appellant\u2019s guilty pleas. Thus, not only did defense counsel fail to dispute the flyer\u2019s inclusion of all charges when the opportunity was presented to him, but he also highlighted Appellant\u2019s guilty pleas throughout the court-martial.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-13\">In sum, by failing to formally object to the flyer when given the opportunity at trial, and in repeatedly addressing the guilty pleas on his own initiative during the court-martial, defense counsel waived any post-trial objection to the flyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-14\">\n<em>There was no Plain Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b213-15\">\u201cIf an error is waived, further consideration of its effect is simply estopped unless it qualifies as \u2018plain error\u2019____\u201d <em>United States v. Deachin, </em>22 M.J. 611, 614 (A.C.M.R.1986)(citing <em>United States v. Tyler, 17 </em>M.J. 381, 385-86 (C.M.A.1984)); <em>see also United States v. Causey, </em>37 M.J. 308, 311 (C.M.A.1993). The Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993), and <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997), established a four-prong test to detect plain error. To remedy an error not raised at trial an appellate court must find (1) error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects substantial rights, and that (4) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Johnson, </em>520 U.S. at 466-67, 117 S.Ct. 1544 (quoting <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770; <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 15, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-19\">The Court has defined \u201cerror\u201d as a \u201cdeviation from a legal rule.\u201d <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732-33, 113 S.Ct. 1770; <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938). An error is \u201cplain\u201d when it is \u201cobvious\u201d or \u201cclear under current law,\u201d <em>Ola-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number><em>no, </em>507 U.S. at 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, or \u201c \u2018so egregious and obvious\u2019 that a trial judge and prosecutor would be \u2018derelict\u2019 in permitting it in a trial held today,\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>274 F.3d 655, 667 (2d Cir.2001)(eiting <em>United States v. Gore, </em>154 F.3d 34, 43 (2d Cir.1998)). An error may become \u201cplain\u201d at the time of appellate consideration even if it was not \u201cplain\u201d at the time of the court-martial. <em>Johnson, </em>520 U.S. at 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544. An error that affects substantial rights is one that is materially prejudicial, <em>United States v. Chapa, </em>57 M.J. 140, 143 (C.A.A.F.2002); one that effects the outcome or judgment of the court-martial proceeding; <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770. Appellant has the burden of demonstrating that these first three prongs of the plain error test are met. <em>United States v. Kho, </em>54 M.J. 63, 65 (C.A.A.F.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Assuming under the first prong of the test that the judge erred, it is nonetheless clear that under the second prong the alleged error was not \u201cplain.\u201d The flyer\u2019s errancy was neither \u201cobvious\u201d nor \u201cclear under current law,\u201d as the guilty pleas included on the flyer were admissible under M.R.E. 803(22) and 404(b). <em>See Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770. Furthermore, even if the error were plain, it certainly was not materially prejudicial, and therefore does not satisfy the third prong of the plain error test. Three facets of the ease mitigate any materially prejudicial effect of the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">First, defense counsel\u2019s recurrent explicit references to the guilty pleas \u2014 in the opening statement, during the questioning of witnesses, and then again during closing argument \u2014 provided the same information to the panel that was contained in the flyer and to which Appellant now objects. Given counsel\u2019s own repeated disclosure of the guilty pleas, it is extremely unlikely that the flyer itself effected the trial\u2019s outcome, and therefore clear that any error was not materially prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Moreover, the Government did not rely on Appellant\u2019s guilty pleas to prove its case. By contrast, it plainly distinguished the specifications to which Appellant pleaded guilty from those specifications the Government had yet to prove at trial. During the opening statement, trial counsel told the members:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-8\">Now, [the Accused] has pled guilty to an adulterous affair and nonprofessional conduct with Private First Class [AC]. Please separate that from your mind. We are proving different charges. Now, you\u2019ll [sic] may be able to make some inferences, but the fact that he pled guilty to [some charges] does not alone prove the remainder of the charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">The Government\u2019s efforts to differentiate the guilty pleas from the charges addressed at trial undoubtedly diminished the flyer\u2019s influence on the findings and, in so doing, abated any materially prejudicial effect of the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">Third, and most strikingly, Appellant was charged with 13 specifications, and pleaded guilty to only four. Appellant now argues that the flyer\u2019s inclusion of the guilty pleas tainted the outcome of the trial by inclining the members to find him guilty of other substantially similar offenses. However, the charge and findings chart reproduced below tells a different story.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"AcI\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b215-41\">Of the 13 total specifications, Appellant was found guilty of only <em>six. </em>Of the nine contested specifications, Appellant was found guilty of only <em>two </em>(emphasized above). Far from being detrimental, the judge\u2019s alleged error, if significant at all, actually allowed defense counsel successfully to employ the guilty pleas throughout the proceeding to Appellant\u2019s advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-42\">Finally, the fourth prong of the test requires the court to consider both the quality and quantity of evidence, as well as to determine whether \u201ca timely objection in the trial court could have eliminated, or substantially ameliorated, any error by means well short of the drastic relief \u2014 ordering a new trial\u2014 necessary to remedy the error on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Promise, </em>255 F.3d 150, 194 (4th Cir.2001)(Motz, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part and dissenting in the judgment) (citing <em>Johnson, </em>520 U.S. at 466, 117 S.Ct. 1544; <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 15, 16 n. 13, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985); <em>United States v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152, 163, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982); <em>United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., </em>310 U.S. 150, 238-39, 60 S.Ct. 811, 84 L.Ed. 1129 (1940)). Even assuming that any error survived the first three prongs of the plain error test, the judge\u2019s error certainly failed to jump this final hurdle. Reviewing the quantity and quality of the evidence reveals that defense counsel could have formally objected at trial when given the opportunity, and that such an objection \u201ccould have eliminated, or substantially ameliorated, any error by means well short of the drastic relief \u2014 ordering a new trial \u2014 necessary to remedy the error on appeal.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Pursuant to the fourth prong of the plain error analysis, any error in this case did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-44\">In sum, the military judge\u2019s authorization for the flyer\u2019s inclusion of the uncontested charges may have exceeded the \u201cordinary\u201d instruction advised in R.C.M. 913(a). However, the judge\u2019s authorization of the flyer permitted the members to consider what was otherwise admissible evidence under M.R.E. 803(22) and 404(b). Furthermore, in failing to object to the flyer\u2019s content when the opportunity arose at trial, appellant waived any post-trial objection to the flyer. Finally, even assuming that the military judge did err, the error was not \u201cplain\u201d to the extent that this Court should reverse the decision below.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-45\">For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b212-7\">.
