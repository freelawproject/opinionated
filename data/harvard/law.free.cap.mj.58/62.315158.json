Teffeau, United States Marine Corps, was tried by general court-martial at Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego, California. Contrary to his pleas, he was convicted by officer members of conspiring to violate a general order, failing to obey a lawful general order, dereliction of duty, making false official statements (five specifications), and obstructing justice, in violation of Articles 81, 92, 107, and 134, Uniform Code of Military Justice [hereinafter UCMJ], 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 881, 892, 907, and 934 (2002). Appellant was sentenced to a dishonorable discharge, confinement for six months, and reduction to E-l. The convening authority approved the sentence as adjudged. The Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings and only so much of the sentence as provided for a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for six months, and reduction to E-l. <em>United States v. Teffeau, </em>55 M.J. 756 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">We granted review of the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-12\">I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-13\">WHETHER THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN APPLYING <em>UNITED STATES V.

Czeschin, </em>56 M.J. 346 (C.A.A.F.2002) was dispositive of Issue III, and that issue is therefore answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-19\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b123-20\">At all times pertinent to the offenses in this case, Appellant was a recruiter for the United States Marine Corps. Appellant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>SSgt James Finch were both assigned recruiting duties at the Marine Corps recruiting substation in Wichita, Kansas. The duties of a Marine recruiter included making weekly contact with recruits awaiting entry on active duty under the Delayed Entry Program (DEP). Ms. Jennifer Keely and Ms. Jennifer Toner were two such recruits. They enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and both women had SSgt Finch as a recruiter at some point in their respective enlistment processes. On January 3, 1997, the women were members of the United States Marine Corps, enlisted in the DEP, and awaiting active duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">On January 2, 1997, the two female recruits- contacted Appellant and SSgt Finch. Plans were made for the four of them to meet the following day at 11:00 a.m. at Ms. Toner\u2019s home. The purpose of this gathering was to celebrate Ms. Keely\u2019s impending departure for Marine Corps boot camp.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">On the morning of January 3, Appellant advised his supervisor, Gunnery Sergeant (GySgt) Terrence Quilty, that he and SSgt Finch were proceeding to the nearby town of Winfield, Kansas. Gunnery Sergeant Quilty did not know specifically who the two recruiters were visiting, but he did not give Appellant permission to go to Ms. Toner\u2019s house or authorize him to drink alcohol with either of the DEP recruits.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Appellant and SSgt Finch drove to Win-field in uniform and in a government vehicle. At approximately 10:55 a.m., the two recruiters stopped at a gas station. Staff Sergeant Finch purchased a ease of beer with a $50 dollar bill and Appellant carried the beer to the government vehicle. The recruiters then drove the remaining distance to Ms. Toner\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Ms. Keely arrived at the Toner home after appellant and SSgt Finch. Appellant and SSgt Finch, while still in uniform, each drank a quantity of Jack Daniels whiskey. Ms. Keely drank schnapps that was in the freezer. The drinking continued for almost three hours. Ms. Toner did not drink because she had the flu and because she had to work later that afternoon. When Ms. Toner requested that they move the party because she had to go to work, the two recruiters changed out of their uniforms and departed with Ms. Keely for Winfield Lake to continue the celebration. Appellant drove the government vehicle to the lake, following SSgt Finch and Ms. Keely, who were in Ms. Keely\u2019s red Ford Mustang.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">Upon returning from Winfield Lake, SSgt Finch and Ms. Keely were involved in a single car accident. Ms. Keely\u2019s red Mustang skidded 243 feet and hit a tree. Ms. Keely was killed and SSgt Finch was injured. Ms. Keely\u2019s blood-alcohol content (BAC) was determined to be .07; SSgt Finch had a BAC of .14. An empty Budweiser Light beer can was recovered from Ms. Keely\u2019s car. The beer can had the same lot number as beer cans found at the lake and beer sold at the gas station where Appellant and SSgt Finch bought beer. During a subsequent search of the government vehicle, no beer or beer cans were found.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-14\">\n<em>ISSUE I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AM8\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b124-15\">Charge II alleged a violation of Article 92, failure to obey a lawful general order. In pertinent part, the specification upon which appellant was arraigned read as follows: \u201cdid ... fail to obey a lawful general order, to wit: paragraph 6d, of Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego, Order 1100.4a, dated 21 May 1992 by wrongfully providing alcohol to Jennifer Keely, a person enrolled in the delayed entry program.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Concerning this offense, the members were instructed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">In the specification of Charge II, the accused is charged with the offense of violating a lawful general order. In order to find the accused guilty of this offense, you must be convinced by legal and competent evidence beyond a reasonable doubt: number one, that there was in existence a certain lawful general order in the following terms, that is, Paragraph 6d, of the Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego, Order 1100.4a, dated 21 May 1992 which provides in part that recruiting personnel are forbidden to engage in, encourage, solicit, or otherwise seek nonprofessional relationships with members of the DEP or other prospective recruit applicants. The following conduct is specifically prohibited: Providing alcoholic beverages, either directly or through the use of a third party, for consumption, to any member of the DEP or prospective recruit applicants under any circumstances, unless previously approved by the applicable District Commanding Officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">Two, that the accused had a duty to obey such order; and three, that on or about the 3rd of January 1997 at Winfield, Kansas, the accused failed to obey this lawful general order by wrongfully providing alcohol to Jennifer Keely, a person enrolled in the delayed entry program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Concerning variance or exceptions and substitutions, the military judge instructed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">If you have doubt about the time, place, or manner in which any of the offenses allegedly occurred, but you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or offenses were committed at a time, place, or in a particular manner which differs slightly from the exact time, place, or manner alleged in the specification, you may make minor modifications in reaching your findings by changing the time, place, or manner in which the alleged offenses described in the specification occurred, provided that you do not change the nature or identity of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-14\">Further direction was given with respect to using the findings worksheet to annotate findings by exceptions and substitutions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-15\">... Should the members find that some of that language in the specification doesn\u2019t apply or has not been proved by \u2014 beyond a reasonable doubt, you can use part three in excepting certain language out of the specification. Now when you do that you don't necessarily have to substitute anything in its place either. You just \u2014 you just can delete that language you think has not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt from the specification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-16\">There were no objections to the instructions as given nor was there a request for any additional instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-17\">Findings were announced with respect to Charge II as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-18\">PRES: Of the Specification of Charge II: Guilty, except for the words paragraph 6[d] of Marine Corps Recruit Depot Order 1100.4a. Specifically, \u201cwrongfully providing alcohol to Jennifer Keely.\u201d Substituting therefore the words \u2014 I don\u2019t have the note page with me \u2014 excuse me, sir. That was it, yes \u2014 \u201cwrongfully and engaging in and seeking in a nonprofessional, personal relationship with Jennifer Keely, a person enrolled in the Delayed-Entry Program.\u201d MJ: Of the excepted words: Not guilty. Of the substituted words: Guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-19\">PRES: And the substituted words would be paragraph 6 of Marine Corps Recruit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Depot, San Diego, 1100.4a, dated 21 May 92,\u2019 \u201cby wrongfully engaging in and encouraging and otherwise seeking a nonprofessional, personal relationship with Jennifer Keely, a person enrolled in the Delayed-Entry Program.\u201d It\u2019s the substituted words.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-4\">MJ: All right. Of the excepted words: Not guilty. Of the substituted words: Guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">PRES: Guilty. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">MJ: Okay. Of Charge II?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">PRES: Of Charge II: Guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">In sum, the members found Appellant guilty of a violation of paragraph 6 for engaging in or seeking a nonprofessional personal relationship. The findings by exceptions and substitutions eliminated the specificity of subparagraph \u201cd,\u201d providing alcohol, and acquitted Appellant of that particular alleged conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">Before the Court of Criminal Appeals Appellant argued that these findings by exceptions and substitutions amounted to a material variance requiring that the offense be dismissed. The government responded that \u201cthe members were certainly convinced that [A]ppellant violated the Order [against engaging in, encouraging or otherwise seeking nonprofessional personal relationships with members of the DEP or other prospective recruits] by consuming alcohol with Jennifer Keely and Jennifer Toner, both members of the DEP.\u201d The court below agreed with Appellant that there was a material variance, noting that the Government sought \u201cto anchor the guilty findings on a related, but materially different, incident than the one originally charged in the specification.\u201d <em>Teffeau, </em>55 M.J. at 762. The Court of Criminal Appeals denied relief, however, finding that appellant had not demonstrated substantial prejudice as required by our decision in <em>United States v. Allen, </em>50 M.J. 84, 86 (C.A.A.F.1999). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">\u201cA variance between pleadings and proof exists when evidence at trial establishes the commission of a criminal offense by the accused, but the proof does not conform strictly with the offense alleged in the charge.\u201d <em>Allen, </em>50 M.J. at 86 (citing <em>United States v. Lee, </em>1 M.J. 15, 16 (C.M.A.1975)). The <em>Manual for Courts-Martial, United States </em>(2002 ed.) [hereinafter <em>MCM] </em>anticipates the potential for a variance by authorizing findings by exceptions and substitutions. <em>See </em>Rule for Courts-Martial (RCM) 918(a)(1). Findings by \u201c[e]xceptions and substitutions may not be used to substantially change the nature of the offense or to increase the seriousness of the offense or the maximum punishment for it.\u201d <em>Id.; United States v. Wray, </em>17 M.J. 375, 376 (C.M.A. 1984)(the same prohibition existed in <em>Manual, for Courts-Martial, United States </em>(1969 Rev. ed.) para. 74(b)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-13\">Minor variances, such as the location of the offense or the date upon which an offense is allegedly committed, do not necessarily change the nature of the offense and in turn are not necessarily fatal. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hunt, </em>37 M.J. 344, 347-48 (C.M.A.1993)(date of rape charged as \u201con or about\u201d); <em>United States v. Parker, </em>54 M.J. 700, 711 (Army Ct.Crim.App.2001)(change in the date of an alleged rape not material); <em>United States v. Willis, </em>50 M.J. 841 (Army Ct.Crim.App.1999) (change in language alleged to be false under Article 107 violation not material). Where, however, an appellant can demonstrate that a variance is material and that he or she was prejudiced, the variance is fatal and the findings thereon can not stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-14\">For whatever reason, the members rejected the inferential evidence and trial counsel\u2019s argument that alcohol was provided to Ms. Keely. The government counsel\u2019s argument before the Court of Criminal Appeals sought to base the finding on conduct at Ms. Toner\u2019s home where Appellant and SSgt Finch did not provide the alcohol. Based on the Government\u2019s argument and the record of trial, the Court of Criminal Appeals found that the findings by exceptions and substitutions reflected a \u201cdifferent incident\u201d than that which was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-15\">Because we conclude that this is a finding of fact in this case, and the finding is not clearly erroneous, we accept as binding upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>this Court that the finding by exceptions and substitutions reflected a different incident. <em>See United States v. Tollinchi, </em>54 M.J. 80, 82 (C.A.A.F.2000)(Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces will not overturn findings of fact by a Court of Criminal Appeals unless they are clearly erroneous or unsupported by the record). We also agree with the lower court\u2019s conclusion of law that this variance was material. <em>See Hunt, </em>37 M.J. at 347 (holding that there was no material variance \u201cas a matter of law\u201d). The findings by exceptions and substitutions convicted Appellant of a different offense, involving a different incident than that described in the specification upon which Appellant was arraigned. This was a \u201csubstantial\u201d change in violation of R.C.M. 918(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">We disagree, however, that there is no prejudice in this case. Prejudice can arise from a material variance in a number of ways.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An appellant may show that the variance puts him at risk of another prosecution for the same conduct. <em>Lee, </em>1 M.J. at 16. An appellant may show that his due process protections have been violated where he was \u201cmisled to the extent that he has been unable adequately to prepare for trial,\u201d <em>Lee, </em>1 M.J. at 16, or where the variance at issue changes the nature or identity of the offense and he has been denied the opportunity to defend against the charge. <em>Wray, </em>17 M.J. at 376. It is this latter form of prejudice, a violation of due process, that appellant suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Fundamental due process demands that an accused be afforded the opportunity to defend against a charge before a conviction on the basis of that charge can be sustained. \u201cFew constitutional principles are more firmly established than a defendant\u2019s right to be heard on the specific charges of which he is accused.\u201d <em>Dunn v. United States, </em>442 U.S. 100, 106-07, 99 S.Ct. 2190, 60 L.Ed.2d 743 (1979). Applying this principle, we have held that a conviction for a larceny that was not charged violates due process. <em>Wray, </em>17 M.J. at 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">We believe a similar result is required in Appellant\u2019s case where his conviction is predicated upon a different incident than the one originally alleged in the specification. By virtue of exercising its prosecutorial discretion in the charging decision, the Government alerted Appellant that he was to defend against a claim that he \u201cprovided\u201d alcohol to Ms. Keely in violation of the lawful general order. Appellant\u2019s defense strategy highlighted that he did not provide the alcohol consumed at the Toner home, that he did not arrive at the lake until after the accident, and that he could not be linked beyond a reasonable doubt to beer cans found in Ms. Keely\u2019s Mustang. The findings by exceptions and substitutions acquitted the Appellant of the specific offense of \u201cproviding\u201d alcohol to Ms. Keely and substituted a broader offense that Appellant had not been provided the opportunity to defend against.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-12\">The Court of Criminal Appeals did not err in applying the two-prong test enunciated in Allen. That court did err, however, when it failed to recognize the prejudice flowing from a material variance that changes the very nature of the offense in issue and impacts upon- an accused\u2019s ability to defend against the charge against him. When a material variance deprives an accused of the fundamental right to due process, he has been prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-13\">The findings of guilty of Charge II and its specification must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-14\">\n<em>ISSUE II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ACu\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b127-15\">Due to the fatality and the alcohol-involvement, Winfield police officers conducted an extensive investigation into the circumstances surrounding the accident. The civilian officers were aware of Appellant\u2019s military status at the time they interviewed him. The Commanding Officer of the 8th Marine Corps District directed a command investigation into the accident as well. Appellant made several false statements con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>cerning the circumstances surrounding the accident as the police and command investigators attempted to determine what occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">In three specifications, Appellant was found guilty of making false official statements in violation of Article 10-7 to Winfield police officers. (Charge III, specifications 1, 2, and 5.) Prior to pleas, Appellant moved to dismiss these specifications for failure to state an offense. The motion alleged both that the statements were not official within the meaning of Article 107 because Appellant did not have an independent duty or obligation to speak.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">' In addition to the facial information in the specifications, the Government presented evidence relating to appellant\u2019s duty status at the time of the incident and statements. Specifically, the Government noted that Appellant served as a canvassing recruiter; the evening after the accident, Appellant was in uniform when the Winfield police questioned him; the first time Appellant was interviewed by the Winfield police, Appellant was accompanied to the police department by his military supervisor, GySgt Quilty; and Appellant was not given any direction or order to speak to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">The military judge made findings of fact and conclusions of law. His findings of fact included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-8\">[TJhat at the time that these purported false statements were made, the accused was an active duty service member ... [and that] the contents of these purported statements to the Winfield City Police Department directly pertained to the accused\u2019s performance of his military duties as a canvassing recruiter assigned to the Winfield, Kansas area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">The military judge\u2019s conclusions of law were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-10\">Number one, the accused statements were made in the line of duty because they directly related in the performance of his military duties as a Marine recruiter assigned to the local area wherein the alleged offenses took place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-13\">Two, the Court specifically adopts the legal analysis set forth in the trial counsels\u2019 brief regarding breath [sic] of the term \u201cofficial\u201d as used in Article 107 of the UCMJ. That it is the use of the word \u201cofficial\u201d is the substantial equivalent to the phrase, quote, in any manner [sic] within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States as found in 18 United States Code, Section 1001, unquote.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-14\">Pour [sic], based on the foregoing analysis, the Court concludes that all statements which the accused provided to various members of the Winfield Police Department would fall within the legal definition of an official statement as mandated by Article 107 of the UCMJ; notwithstanding the status of the recipients as private nonmilitary parties and the fact that these statements were in an oral vice written form.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-15\">The military judge denied the motion to dismiss the allegations of false official statements made to civilian officers of the Win-field police.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-16\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b128-17\">Article 107 punishes \u201c[a]ny person subject to this chapter, who, with intent to deceive, ... makes any other false official statement knowing it to be false[.]\u201d A statement is \u201cofficial\u201d if that statement is \u201cmade in the line of duty.\u201d MCM Part IV, para. 31 c(l). This definition of \u201cofficial\u201d does not mean that the President intended to limit \u201cline of duty\u201d in this context to the meaning those words may have in other, non-criminal contexts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-19\">In fact, this Court has recognized that the scope of Article 107 is more expansive than its civilian counterpart, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (2002), because \u201c[t]he primary purpose of military criminal law \u2014 to maintain morale, good order, and discipline \u2014 has no parallel in civilian criminal law.\u201d <em>United States v. Solis, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>46 M.J. 31, 34 (C.A.A.F.1997). <em>See also United States v. Smith, </em>44 M.J. 369, 372 (C.A.A.F.1996)(referencing Article 107\u2019s \u201cunique language\u201d); <em>United States v. Hagee, </em>37 M.J. 484, 485 (C.M.A.1993)(\u201cNothing in the plam language of this statute limits its scope to deceptions in which the United States is the intended or actual direct victim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Examining Appellant\u2019s conduct in light of the language and purposes of Article 107, we find that Appellant\u2019s statements to civilian officers of the Winfield police were official. It is clear that, from the inception of the arrangement to meet the two women through and including Appellant\u2019s statements to both military and civilian officials, tMs entire incident and investigation bore a direct relationship to Appellant\u2019s duties and status as a Marine Corps recruiter.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Appellant knew Staff Sergeant Finch and both women as a result of his official duties. Appellant reported to his supervisor that he was meeting with someone in Winfield on January 3, implying to GySgt Quilty that the meeting was related to Appellant\u2019s recruiting duties. Both the women were newly recruited into the Marine Corps DEP, and both had used SSgt Finch as a recruiter. Appellant and SSgt Finch used an official government vehicle when they went to meet the women. Appellant and SSgt Fmch were in uniform when they went to meet the women. Unquestionably, the entire sequence of events had its origm in Appellant\u2019s duties, responsibilities, and status as a recruiter.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">The Winfield police were aware of Appellant\u2019s duties and status. A military supervisor aecompamed Appellant to the Winfield Police Department the night of the accident. Appellant was in uniform when interviewed by the Winfield police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">The investigation concerned potential criminal misconduct involving a person or persons subject to the UCMJ. There was a parallel military investigation into this incident. The subject matter of the Winfield police investigation was of interest to the military and within the jurisdiction of the courts-martial system. <em>See Solorio v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 435, 107 S.Ct. 2924, 97 L.Ed.2d 364 (1987). Appellant\u2019s conduct and Ms subsequent statements about his conduct could have, and did, subject him to criminal liability in the military justice system for various offenses in addition to his false official statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">We reject any absolute rule that statements to civilian law enforcement officials can never be official within the meaning of Article 107. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Johnson, </em>39 M.J. 1033 (A.C.M.R.1994). Any such construction of Article 107 is unreasonably restrictive in light of the unique purposes of Article 107 and the military criminal law. The circumstances leading up to and surrounding the statements made to the Win-field police bear a clear and direct relationship to Appellant\u2019s duties as a recruiter and reflect a substantial military interest in the investigation. The statements Appellant made to the Winfield police officers were therefore \u201cofficial\u201d within the meaning of Article 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">\n<em>Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">The decision of the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals is reversed. The findings of guilty of Charge II, its specification and the sentence are set aside, and Charge II and its specification are dismissed. The case is returned to the Judge Advocate General of the Navy for remand to the Court of Criminal Appeals.

Paragraph 6 of Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego, Order 1100.4a (21 May 1992), reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-11\">6. Action. Recruiting personnel are forbidden to engage in, encourage, solicit, or otherwise seek nonprofessional personal relationships with members of the DEP [Delayed Entry Program] or other prospective recruit applicants. The following conduct is specifically prohibited:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnM\">a. Encouraging, seeking, soliciting, or engaging in any sexual relations with members of the DEP or other prospective recruit applicants. This is intended to include overt sexual acts as well as using rank or supervisory position to take advantage of a prospective recruit or member of the DEP for personal sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>gratification, regardless of the knowledge or consent of the individual involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7M\">b. Financial dealings of any kind with any member of the DEP or prospective recruit applicant, to include acceptance of services or other gratuities, borrowing or lending money, or commercial solicitation. This does not preclude acceptance of those personal gifts approved by reference (b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyI\">c. Engaging in physical contact with or touching any member of the DEP or prospective recruit applicant other than reasonable physical contact necessary to protect life or prevent serious injury, in self-defense, or as a necessary part of admin activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8E\">d. Providing alcoholic beverages, either directly or through the use of a third party, for consumption, to any member of the DEP or prospective recruit applicants under any circumstances, unless previously approved by the applicable District CO.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b127-7\">. To the extent that our opinion in <em>United States v. Allen, </em>50 M.J. 84 (C.A.A.F.1999) could be read to require that an appellant must show both that he or she was misled and that the variance put the appellant at risk of another prosecution, we take this opportunity to make it clear that a dual showing is not required and that these are alternative forms of demonstrating error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b128-11\">.

Wray, </em>17 M.J. 375 (C.M.A.1984), members convicted the appellant by exceptions and substitutions changing both the date and the amount of the larceny. The Court concluded that this changed the identity of the offense. Therefore, the Court was not prepared to \u201cuphold a conviction on a charge that was neither alleged in an indictment nor presented to a jury at trial____\u201d 7&lt;iat 376. The Court dismissed the charge and its specification \u201cwithout prejudice to another trial being held on the proper charge.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>In this case, the Court dismisses Charge II and its specification because through the members\u2019 exceptions and substitutions, \u201cAppellant\u2019s conviction is predicated upon a different incident than the one originally alleged in the specification.\u201d 58 M.J. 67. However, the Court does not expressly state, as in <em>Wray, </em>that another trial may be held on \u201ca\u201d or \u201cthe\u201d proper charge, or alternatively distinguish the outcome-in <em>Wray </em>from this case so as to preclude retrial on a proper charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">In my view, this silence should not be interpreted as overruling the result in <em>Wray </em>or the general proposition on which it is based. Reversal of a conviction does not prevent retrial for the same offense unless the reversal is based on insufficiency of the evidence. <em>Montana v.

Hall, </em>481 U.S. 400, 402-03, 107 S.Ct. 1825, 95 L.Ed.2d 354 (1987)(per curiam), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-5\">It is a \u201cvenerable principl[e] of double jeopardy jurisprudence\u201d that \u201cthe successful appeal of a judgment of conviction, on any ground other than the insufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict, <em>Burks v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978), poses no bar to further prosecution on- the same charge.\u201d <em>United States v.

Justice Harlan explained the basis for this rule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">\"Corresponding to the right of an accused to be given a fair trial is the societal interest in punishing one whose guilt is clear after he has obtained such a trial. It would be a high price indeed for society to pay were every accused granted immunity from punishment because of any defect sufficient to constitute reversible error in the proceedings leading to conviction. From the standpoint of a defendant, it is at least doubtful that appellate courts would be as zealous as they now are in protecting against the effects of improprieties at the trial or pretrial stage if they knew that reversal of a conviction would put the accused irrevocably beyond the reach of further prosecution. In reality, therefore, the practice of retrial serves defendants\u2019 rights as well as society\u2019s interest.\u201d <em>United States v.
