In a few days, the note of the insured at sixty days was accepted for the premium, which was not paid at maturity, and remained in the hands of the insurer. After this, and within a reasonable time before the loss, the insurer canceled the policy, and notified the parties interested therein of such cancellation, and credited on the note, a sum less than the pro rata proportion of the unearned premium.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b140-9\">The condition of the policy provided, that it was hot to be binding until <em>actual payment </em>of the premium, and that the insurance should be terminated at the request of the insured, in which case the company was to retain only the customary short rates for the time the policy was in force, also that the company might, at its option, terminate the insurance upon giving notice to that effect, and tendering a <em>pro rata </em>proportion of the premium for the unexpired term. <em>Held, 1. </em>That by delivering the policy without actual payment of the premium, and by taking a note of the assured for the same, the company waived the condition that the policy was not binding unless the premium was actually paid. 2. On failure of the assured to pay the note, the company might, on giving rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>sonable notice thereof before the loss, exercise its option to cancel the policy. 3. As the note was past due and in the hands of the company at the time of such cancellation, it was not necessary to tender back the <em>pro rata </em>proportion of the unearned premium in cash, nor to Credit the same on the note.

This credit is some two or three dollars less than the <em>pro rata </em>proportion of the unearned premium, if the fractions o\u00a3 the months of May and September be not counted as a month.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-6\">Yerbal notice of this cancellation was also given to all the parties interested in this policy, and in the property insured, in a short time thereafter, and some two months before the loss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-7\">Upon this state of facts, the court charged the jury : <em>\u201c </em>That, if, after the said insurance was effected, the said William and Robert Carson, instead of paying the premium due therefor, gave their promissory note, payable in sixty days, which was received by the said defendants for and on account of said premium, and was held by them until after it became due, and is now held by them, and was never in any way used by them, and is now brought here into court, and if, after the said note became due, the said William and Robert Carson, and the other parties interested in the said insurance, had notice that the said note had not been paid, and neglected to pay the same, and thereupon, and within a reasonable time before the fire, the defendants elected to cancel the same, and gave the said parties reasonable notice before the fire, that the policy was canceled, then the plaintiff cannot recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-8\">Also, that \u201c in case of non-payment of said note, or for any other reason, defendant elected to end the risk and did so, nothing more was required of them, than to notify the insured within a reasonable time before the fire.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-9\">To reverse a judgment for defendant on the foregoing facts and instructions, is the object of the present petition in error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-10\">It is assumed, for the purposes of this case, that the plaintiff is entitled to be subrogated to the Charter Oak Insurance Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>pany and to recover on this policy, if the same was not legally terminated before the loss.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b143-5\"><em>Hoadl/y, Johnson &amp; Colston </em>and <em>Henry M.

No receipt for return premium or other evidence of credit on the notes, or notice of such credit, was given to anybody. 3. The amount credited was $75, which was less than <em>thq pro rata </em>proportion of premium.

The policy was rightfully canceled before the loss. Now, the premium never was <em>actually paid </em>and there can be none tendered back. So long as the note was not due, the policy was not void on that account, for a temporary credit .was given for the premium. ' But when it fell due and was not paid, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>\u25a0when all the parties interested knew it remainded unpaid, and that the policy was to be canceled if not paid, then the condition as to <em>actual payment </em>applies. The premium had not only never been <em>actually paid, </em>but its payment had been refused, and these defendants had the right to cancel the policy, which they did do at a reasonable time before the loss. Of this cancellation not only. Little, but \u00a5m. Carson <em>&amp; </em>Bro. and Irwin had due notice. Judge Hoadly cites a long list of cases to show that the premium was actually paid. There is not one of them that touches this case ; they are all cases of waiver, or where the good faith of the transaction required that the party should be estopped from denying payment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-5\">II. The non-payment of premium is a cause of forfeiture, under the fifth condition, under the circumstances of this case. If delivering the policy was evidence of waiver of the immediate payment of the premium, certainly when the Carsons had notice that their waiver was withdrawn, they had no right to rely upon it afterwards. The note was given some days after the credit was given. It was, therefore, simply collateral security for the premium, and was no payment, unless the note itself was paid. The Carsons originally agreed to give a cash premium, and Mr. Young relied upon that promise when he issued the policy. It is quite apparent from the various cases, viz.: <em>Sheldon </em>v. <em>Atlantic Ins. Co., 26 </em>N. Y. 460; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Poughkeepsie Ins. Co., </em>32 N. Y. 619; <em>Boehn </em>v. <em>Williamsburgh Ins. Co., </em>35 N. Y. 132; that the reason of holding the premiums waived when the policy is delivered, is to <em>prevent fraud, </em>but not to'enable a party to <em>commit fra/ud. </em>In this case the insured had no right to rely upon the giving the'note as a payment of the premium. \u2022 They had due notice that it was not paid. They were further notified that the insurance company would not waive the premium after September 7. On this subject of non-payment of premium see: <em>Salvin </em>v. <em>James, </em>6 East, 571; <em>Tarleton </em>v. <em>Stansforth, </em>5 Term, 695; <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Atlantic Ins. Co., </em>33 N. H. 9; <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Potomac Ins. Co., </em>32 Md. 109; <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Mutual Fire Ins. Co., </em>34 Md. 280.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-6\">III. The cancellation of the policy under the privilege reserved in the sixth condition. This cancellation was not wantonly done or without good cause. It was a mutual privilege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>and to be construed fairly and not as a forfeiture. -Where no premium had been in fact paid, it was not necessary to tender anything back. <em>Irwin v. National Ins. </em>Co., 2 Dis. 68; <em>Emmott v. The Slater Ins. Co., </em>7 R. I. 565; <em>Fabyan </em>v. <em>U. M. F. Co., </em>33 N. H. 208; <em>Bergen </em>v. <em>Builders' Building Ass., </em>38 Cal. 541. This cancellation was made in good faith and notice was given to all parties who could possibly be interested. This notice was given several months before the fire. The insured knew the defendants were not carrying the risk. They knew the defendants had received no premium and were likely to receive no premium. The mortgagees, by the terms of the mortgage, might have insured the property, and had the premium liens secured by the several mortgages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-5\">Upon the subject of the credit on the note, I desire to say what those familiar with insurance know, that when policies are canceled, the usage is not to divide the months, but where it had run say for three months and twelve days, it is treated as four months, and the jury in their finding probably acted upon this usage, for it is well known here. The court will take judicial notice of such usage. Greenleaf on Ev. \u00a7 5; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Piper, </em>91 U. S. (1 Otto) 43; <em>Hoare </em>v. <em>Silverlock, </em>12 Ad. <em>&amp; </em>El. 633; <em>M. &amp; H. Glue Co. </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>6 Cf. Gaz. 843; <em>Needham </em>v. <em>Washburn, </em>4 Cliff. 259, 260.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b145-6\">Johnson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1M\">This policy was delivered and took effect May 17, and by its terms was good\" for one year unless sooner terminated in accordance with its terms and conditions. On its face, the premium was payable in cash, and one of the conditions was, that, <em>\u201c </em>no insurance shall be considered binding, until the <em>actualpa/y.ment </em>of the premium.\u201d By the delivery of the policy without such payment, and by taking a note of the insurer, nine days thereafter, payable in sixty days, this condition was waived, and the policy w\u00e1s in force, notwithstanding this condition, until lawfully canceled, under this or some other condition contained therein, or under the option reserved in the sixth condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The note not being paid, and its makers being insolvent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>the company, after waiting some forty-five days, canceled the policy, and notified the insured and the Charter Oak Co., and others \u2018 interested, of the fact. This was in September. In December the loss occurred. This policy was good for one year, unless terminated lawfully. The sixth condition provided that the insured might terminate the insurance at any time on request, in which case the company should retain only the customary short rates for the time the policy had been in force. This is an unqualified right, reserved to the insured to terminate the policy at any time during the year for any cause. If the premium had been paid in cash, the insurer would have been compelled to refund the unearned premium after charging for the time the policy was in force at the customary short rates. As a note had been given, and was still in the hands of the payee, the insured could have terminated the policy, by paying or tendering the amount due, at short rates, and demanding a return of the note; but as no payment had been made, no money had to be returned by the insurer, under this clause. This right to terminate the policy, was mutual. The company reserved the option to at any time, put an end to the policy, \u201c on giving notice to that effect, and tendering a <em>pro rata </em>proportion of the premium for the unexpired term thereof.\u201d In case the premium had been actually paid for the year, the <em>pro rata </em>share thereof from September 9, to the end of the year, must have been tendered back, before this option could be exercised. In the present case, no money had actually been paid. The company still held a past-due note, for the premium, on which there was due the amount earned to the date of cancellation. It was claimed, and the evidence tended strongly to support that claim, that this note was not Gollectible. The company credited $Y5 on the note, being the amount of the unearned premium, if the pro-rating is computed by months, and if the fraction of May, M days, and of September, 9 days, are counted as a month, but if the prorating is by days, that amount is too small by two or three dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">On this state of fact, the court in effect charged, that it was not necessary to tender back the cash, for the unearned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>premium, nor was the right to cancel defeated by a failure to credit the exact amount, or indeed any amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">In this we concur. The effect of taking the note, was to give the policy life, notwithstanding the fifth condition, but it did not divest the company of its right reserved in the sixth condition to terminate the insurance at any time on giving notice, and, in case the premium had been paid, tendering back the unearned proportion thereof. As nothing had been paid, nothing was to be tendered back. The only duty imposed on the company, was, when the premium had not been paid, to give notice in reasonable time before the fire. This the jury found was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The contract of insurance is a contract of indemnity upon the terms and conditions specified in the policy. The insurer undertakes, for comparatively small premium, which good faith requires should be paid, to guaranty against loss or damage upon the terms and conditions agreed upon, and upon none other. He may, therefore, justly insist upon the fulfillment of those terms. We cannot make a new contract for the parties. Good faith is the life breath of the contract. The payment of the premiums is an essential element of the contract, to enable the -company to meet its obligations. Whatever may have been the right of the company before the maturity of the note to terminate the insurance for other causes, we think it clear, that after the note became due, and was not paid, this option might be exercised upon giving reasonable notice thereof, before the loss occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Again, it is said, the amount credited on the note was too small. Concede this, the note was past due, and had not been negotiated. In any action brought thereafter for the earned premium, the correct credit could have been computed and allowed. This note was subject to such credit in whosever hands it should be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
