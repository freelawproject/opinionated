In the absence of an express agreement it is the. actual loss sustained; when the value of the property is fixed by the parties the insured is entitled to recover such a portion of the valuation as the insurer has agreed to pay. <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Charleston Ins.

Ins. Co., </em>9 La. 23.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-5\">If the policy contained a reference to the value stated by defendant in his application in such a way as to show that the company adopted the valuation as true, the policy, in the absence of any stipulations to the contrary, would be a valued one. <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Fayette Mut. T. Ins. Co., </em>1 Allen 63; <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Boston Ins. Co., </em>4 Met. 206.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-6\">But the mere reference to the application as a part of the policy, cannot be construed as the agreement of the company to be bound by the defendant\u2019s statement as to the value. Wood on Ins. 102, \u00a7 43, says, that \u201cif the application is made a part of the policy, a valuation therein is as effectual to make the policy a valued one as though stated in the policy itself,\u201d and in support of this cites the case of <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Fayette Mut. Ins. Co., </em>1 Allen, 63; and <em>Phoenix Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>McClean, </em>100 Mass. 415. But if the author intends to be understood as saying that the mere statement by an applicant of the value of the property to be insured, without an agreement of the insurer contained in the application that the valuation is true, then clearly lie is unsupported by authority. In the case of <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Fayette Mut. Ins. Co., </em>the policy recited that \u201c the amount insured is not more than three-fourths of the value of the property as appears by the proposal of the insured.\u201d And in the case of <em>Ph\u0153nix Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Moses, </em>it does not appear that any valuation was made in the application at all, and besides, in that case the policies were in marine insurance, where the valuation is usually adopted by the insurer. See Sedgw. on Dam. 6 ed. 306 ; Parsons on Cont. 6 ed. 453. Where the charters and bylaws of mutual companies become part of the policies, and the companies are forbidden to insure for more than a certain proportion of the value of the buildings, valuations will be held binding on both parties. 2 Parsons on Cont. 6 ed. 455 ; <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Merrimac Mut. Ins. Co., </em>10 Cush. 350; <em>Bordan </em>v. <em>Hingham Mut. Ins. Co., </em>523; <em>Haywood </em>v. <em>N. E. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>10 Cush. 444; <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Boston Ins. Co., </em>4 Met. 206; <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Charleston Ins. Co., </em>10 Met. 211. In all other cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>it must appear clearly in the policy that the insurer intends to value both the risk and the loss. See authorities first cited</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-5\">The policy expressly provides the amount the company should pay in the event of loss, viz : \u201c All such loss or damage, not exceeding in amount\u201d the sum insured as should \u201chappen by fire or lightning\u201d to the property at risk. It is also provided in the event \u201c any difference should arise touching any loss,\u201d etc., the same \u201c shall at the written request of either party, be submitted by them to impartial and disinterested arbitrators.\u201d These provisions clearly indicate, we think, that the company should be held for no more than the loss sustained.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b162-6\"><em>StUwell &amp; Hoogla/nd, </em>for defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-7\">The only question made in this case is, whether this is a valued or an open policy. When the application is referred to as forming a part of the contract, the statements therein contained are held to have the force and effect of warranties. May on Insurance, 164, \u00a7 159; <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Fairfield Mut. Ins. Co., </em>1 Allen, 63, and other authorities cited in Wood on Ins. 102, \u00a7 43, note 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-8\">Where the language of reference is ambiguous, and does not clearly intend to make the application a part of the policy, the doubt will be construed against the company. May on Insurance, 165, par. 160.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-9\">In this case the application is made a part of the policy, by the following language: \u201c And more particularly described in application and survey No. 11,974, which is hereby made a part of this policy, to wit: One dwelling house, $800.\u201d The building insured has been totally destroyed by fire. The amount insured on the dwelling house is $800. The application states that does not exceed two-thirds its actual cash value. The valuation thus agreed upon by the parties is conclusive, in the absence of frand. <em>Luce </em>v. <em>Dorchester Mutual Fire Ins. Co., </em>105 Mass. 297, 396; 7 Ohio, pt. 1, 284; <em>Portsmouth Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Brazee, </em>16 Ohio, 81; Wood on Ins. 93, \u00a7 41, V. N. 4; <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Burton Ins. Co., </em>4 Metc. 206, and authorities cited; also, Wood on Ins. p. 103, note 1, and text same p., Shaw, J.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>A policy having this clause, the amount insured being not more than two-thirds the value of said property, as appears by the application of the said insured, is a valued policy. May on Insurance, 29, par. 31; <em>Ph\u0153nix Ins. Co. </em>v. McLoon, 100 Mass. 475. This policy does not limit the value of the property at the time of loss. If it did, no doubt such a provision would be controlling. May on Insurance, 29, 30, par. 31.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-5\">In this case a total loss, and no occasion for <em>\u201c </em>any difference\u201d to arise \u201ctouching any loss or damage\u201d to be submitted to arbitrators, and if the loss were partial as a damage to dwelling house of $800 or less, then a difference might arise as provided in the policy; but even though the loss were $800 or less, then a difference might arise as provided in the policy; but even though the loss were $900, no more than $800 could be collected, as the policy recites \u201c all such loss or damage, not exceeding in amount the several sums insured.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-6\">In <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>4 La. 239, cited by plaintiff in error, the policy contained these words: \u201c The said loss or damage to be estimated according to the true and actual value of the said property at the time the same shall happen.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-7\">In reply to first citations of plaintiff\u2019s brief, Wood on Insurance, 93, \u00a7 41, 3ays: \u201c So, where the policy recites that the amount insured is not more than one-half, two-thirds, three-fourths, etc., of the value of the property insured, and indeed in all cases, where, from the language used, it is evident that the policy was intended as a valued policy.\u201d It is to be so treated without reference to the words or form of expression employed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b163-8\">McIlvaine, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARB\">Whether the policy of insurance in this suit is valued or open, is the sole question in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">A policy of insurance is essentially a contract for indemnity in case of loss. Wager policies are contrary to public policy. The insured must have an interest in the subject of the insurance \u2014 an interest in its preservation. In case of loss, his contract rightfully entitles him to compensation \u2014 nothing more. The reason upon which this principle rests, is the prevention of fraud and crime, by removing all inducement and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>temptation to commit them, which would naturally arise from the great disparity between the consideration paid and the indemnity received by the insured. This disparity, however, does not amount to inadequacy or even a suspicion of fraud; because of the supposed remoteness of the contingency of loss; nevertheless its existence requires the utmost good faith on the part of the insured. While these considerations do not, in the least, exempt the insurer from liability on his contract, they do show that in the absence of a contract to the contrary, the amount of recovery on a policy of insurance should be limited to the actual loss sustained by the assured on account of the risk against which the policy was taken. In other words, a policy of insurance must be regarded as an open one, unless it appears to have been the intention of the parties to the policy, upon a fair and reasonable construction of its terms, to value the loss, aud thereby fix, by contract, the amount of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Mr. Wood, in his treatise on fire insurance, section 41, says: \u201c Valued policies are those in which both the property insured and the loss are valued, and which bind the insurer to pay the whole sum insured, in case of total loss. They may be said to be policies in which the insurer himself, at the time of making the policy, assesses the damages in case of total loss, unless fraud, inducing an over-valuation on the part of assured, is established.\u201d And further along in the same section, he says : \u201c If there is anything in the policy that clearly indicates an intention on the part of the insurer to value the risk and the loss, in whatever words expressed, the policy is valued, otherwise it is open.\u201d Again, \u201c No particular form of expression is necessary; the <em>intention </em>of the parties, gathered from the whole instrument, must determine the matter.\u201d <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Boston, &amp;c. Ins. Co., </em>18 Pick. 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">It has been decided that a policy of a company whose charter limited its liability to a certain proportion of the actual value of the property insured, which refers to the value of the property as stated in the application of the insured, is a valued policy. 10 Cushing, 551. Other cases go so far as to hold generally, that a policy which refers to the valuation of the property as it appears in the application which is made a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>part of the policy, is a valued one. 1 Allen <em>68; 100 </em>Mass. 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Without expressing an opionion as to the soundness of such construction when nothing further appears in the policy, we are satisfied that the policy before us, which contains the further stipulation, that \u201csaid Farmers\u2019 Insurance Company hereby agrees to make good unto the said assured, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, all such loss or damage, not exceeding in amount the several sums insured, as shall happen by fire or lightning to any of the aforesaid property, from the 28th day of March, 1873, at 12 o\u2019clock at noon, to the 28th day of March 1878, at 12 o\u2019clock at noon, and to be paid ninety days after due notice <em>a/nd proofs </em>of the same shall have been made by the assured and received at this office, with the terms and provisions of this policy,\u201d shows, that it was not intended by the insurer to make the sum assured the measure or value of the damages, although the loss might be total. Proofs of loss or damage here required as a condition precedent to the payment, refer to cases of total as well as partial losses. The amount of liability on the policy was thus left open to inquiry, limited, however, by the amount of insurance named in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The court of common pleas, therefore, erred in rejecting testimony offered by the defendant below as to the amount of actual loss. And the district court erred in affirming the judgment of the common pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">\n<em>Judgments reversed and cause remmded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
