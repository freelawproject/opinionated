Whore a statute, in prescribing the terms and conditions of a recognizance, requires that the accused shall be bound to appear at the <em>next </em>term, a recognizance omitting the word <em>next, </em>but strictly pursuing the statute in ail other respects, will not be deemed invalid for such omission.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b636-9\">3.

He answered, first, that the recognizance was void for uncertainty, the objection being that the accused was not required to appear at the then next term, or any other particular term. Secondly, that the accused \u201cdid afterwards personally appear before said court, on the first day of the term thereof, in compliance, strictly, with the letter of said bond or recognizance, which fully relieved and discharged this defendant from all liability upon the said bond.\u201d Thirdly, that after the signing of the recognizance, the defendant Proseck took the accused, and at a subsequent term of said court surrendered him \u201c to said court, in open court, and requested to be released from the said writing and recognizance, whereby the defendant Proseck became and was and is fully discharged from obligation or liability upon the said writing and recognizance.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b637-6\">A demurrer to the defenses was sustained, judgment was rendered for the amount of the recognizance, that judgment was affirmed in the district court, and this petition in error is prosecuted to reverse the judgments of both courts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b637-7\">The provisions of the act of 1873 on the subject (70 Ohio L.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahm\">1. The statute requiring justices of the peace to recognize the accused to appear at the \u201c next term,\u201d and the word <em>next </em>being omitted from the recognizance, it is insisted that the instrument is a nullity. If the condition in a recognizance be ambiguous or uncertain as to the time or place the accused is to appear, such recognizance is void. <em>The </em>State v. Johnson, 13 Ohio, 176. Such an infirmity cannot be cured by parol evidence. <em>Crippen </em>v. <em>The </em>State, 1 Ohio St. 399. But, while it is the duty of the magistrate in all cases to strictly pursue the statute, it is by no means indispensable to the validity of a recognizance that the language of the act should be literally followed. If the time and place of appearance be shown with reasonable certainty, the statute in those particulars is complied with, and slight omissions and inaccuracies will not, ordinarily, affect the validity of the recognizance. Moreover, persons entering into such obligations are presumed to do so with knowledge of the general statutes relating to the courts, and the orders fixing the commencement of the terms, published with the annual volumes of laws. In this view, the omission of the word <em>next </em>did not render the recognizance invalid, but read in the light of the aids to which I have referred, the obligation to appear at the term commencing September 4, 1876, is sufficiently certain. <em>Kellogg </em>v. <em>The </em>State, 43 Miss. 57; <em>Mooney </em>v. <em>The </em>People, 81 Ill. 134; <em>Brite </em>v. <em>The </em>State, 24 Texas, 219; <em>The State </em>v. Bradley, 1 Blackf. 83; <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Emery, </em>2 Binney, 431; <em>The State </em>v. Wellman, 3 Ohio, 14; <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>1 Ohio St. 190; <em>s. c., </em>9 Ohio St. 24; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Petty, </em>29 Ohio St. 452; <em>R. </em>v. <em>Hodgson, </em>Dears. 14; <em>s. c., </em>7 Ex. 915; 5 Wait\u2019s Act. <em>&amp; </em>Def. 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">There was express authority to continue the cause and the recognizance, forfeit the recognizance at the next term on failure of the accused to appear, and take judgment against him, in pursuance of the statute, on the rendition of a verdict finding the complaint to be true; and, in an action on such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>recognizance, the record of forfeiture is conclusive. It will be seen that the defect which was fatal in <em>Grieve </em>v. Freytag, 31 Ohio St. 147, does not appear in this case; and it is also proper to say that the statute in force when <em>Porter </em>v. <em>The State, </em>23 Ohio St. 320, was decided, has been in some respects changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">2. The defense of surrender of the principal by the surety is wholly insufficient. No compliance with the statute upon that subject is shown, and the answer is evasive. \"Whether the alleged surrender was before the forfeiture, or even before final judgment in the bastardy suit, is not stated, nor is it stated whether the. recognizance was canceled. The answer is not defective in form merely, but insufficient in substance. <em>Whetstone </em>v. Riley, 7 Ohio St. 514 (explained and qualified in <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Coller, </em>35 Ohio St. 131), has been cited, but has no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
