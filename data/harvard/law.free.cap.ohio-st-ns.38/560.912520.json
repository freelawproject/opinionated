The return of the plaintiff in error to the auditor was not false within the meaning of sections 2781 and 2782 Revised Statutes. There was no concealment or intentionally false statements. The returns showed every item on their face. The auditor had full knowledge of their character, and they were made upon blanks furnished by him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-6\">II. What we have claimed and now insist upon, is that this re-insurance fund was provided for by law to meet and provide against an actual, existing and determined liability, which was and is a \u201clegal <em>tona fide </em>debt owing\u201d by these companies within the meaning of section 2730, of the Revised Statu tes, and which they, therefore, had a right to deduct, not from their assets generally, but from \u201c the sum of all claims and demands,\u201d etc., due them in determining the amount of \u201c credits,\u201d as defined by said section on which they should pay taxes; and that this liability exists wholly independent of probable losses on policies. It has nothing to do with anything of the sort. The allegations of the petition show the character'of the liability. And for the purpose of showing the character of this liability, and also to show that the statute law of our state recognizes it as an actual, existing indebtedness we call attention to the provisions of the Revised Statutes contained in sections 274, 3648, 3664, 3665, 3654. We think the words \u201c legal, <em>tona fide </em>\u201d and \u201c owing,\u201d mere surplusage, except in so far as they may show the intention of the legislature. In that respect we think these words important, and, as bearing on the question of intention, we call attention to them. They are of no force in any other sense, for the reason that the word \u201cdebt\u201d alone, would mean a \u201clegal sum,\u201d owing, in good faith. Why then did the legislature use the apparently unnecessary words ? The answer is manifest. It wanted to make sure that only (not debts in the strict legal technical sense of the word) but <em>tona fide </em>should be deducted. The words <em>\u201ctonafide\u201d </em>were more important than the words \u201c debts.\u201d It meant that no room should be left for trumping up false notes, fictitious accounts, and obligations, improvised for the purpose of defrauding the state of its taxes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>That this is what is meant, and that no more was intended, and that no more should now be asked, is evident from the context. The word \u201c debt,\u201d as. here in question, should receive a construction liberal, and broad enough to embrace every kind of an actual, existing obligation which equity and justice would require to be taken into the account in determining \u201c the excess of the sum of all claims and demands,\u201d \u00e9tc., which only, is to be listed as the amount of credits to be taxed. Such a construction is warranted by authority. <em>Franklin Life Ins. Co. </em>v. Plaff, 11 Ins. L. J. 708, <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>49 Barb. 330. Still, if the word \u201c debt\u201d is used in its more technical sense, we are clearly within the terms of of the statute. Walker\u2019s Am. Law. (7th ed.) 577; <em>Stockwell </em>v. <em>United States, </em>13 Wall. 542. And see <em>People </em>ex rel. v. Ferguson, 38 N. Y. 89; <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Lott, </em>54 Ala. 499.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-5\">III. The auditor had no right to correct the deductions and charge up the amounts so deducted, for any year. ' The court below agreed with us in this claim to the extent of holding that he had no such authority, under sections 2781 and 2782, but differed from us as to the amount deducted for 1882, holding that the auditor had the right to do what he was proposing as to this year by virtue of section 1038. We claim that lie had no such power under this section; that if he does not have authority to make the change under sections 2781 and 2782, he does not have it under any section. He does not have it at all. We invite a close reading of section 1038.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-6\">Now, how can this section be said to apply to authorize what the auditor is threatening in this case ? He is not threatening to proceed under this section at all. He threatens to proceed under 2781, for false returns. To do what? To add to the amount of our credits returned for taxation, by disallowing a deduction therefrom, which we have made. In other words, he is proposing to charge us on the tax-duplicate with an amount of credits greater than we returned, and to levy taxes against us on account thereof. Now, can this be said to be the correction of an error in the tax-list or duplicate ? We think not. But if so, it cannot be said to be the correction of an error in the name of the person charged, nor in the descrip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>tion of lands or other property. Nor is it the correction of an error in the taxing of exempted property. All this is clear. If this were the entire provision, then certainly there would be no such authority as claimed. If, therefore, the auditor has the authority at all, it must be by virtue of the last clause we have quoted, viz.: that he may correct errors in the particulars mentioned, \u201cor in the amount of such taxes or assessments.\u201d \u00a5e think it manifest, that no such authority is given by this provision. It is evident that what the legislature aimed to do by this section was to empower the auditor to make coiTeetions of only clerical errors. And not clerical errors generally, but only specified kinds. It is a well settled rule that when powers are enumerated, there is an exclusion as to all matters' not named. Hence, when the legislature said, the auditor might correct errors in names of persons charged with taxes and assessments, and in the description of lands or other property, and in the amount of such taxes or assessments, it excluded the power from him of correcting anything else. We see, therefore, that the power here given is of the most limited character. It is nothing more than clerical in the most simple sense.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b595-5\"><em>George K. Wash, </em>attorney general, and <em>J. T. Holmes, </em>for defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-6\">I. The first question to be determined by the court is, whether the obligation of fire insurance companies, under certain circumstances, to re-insure outstanding risks, or to return, upon proper demand, unearned premiums, is a legal <em>Iona fide </em>debt owing within the meaning of section 2730 of the Revised Statutes. We claim that it is not. A debt owing is a certain \u2022fixed sum, whether due or not, the amount of which does not depend upon the happening of any future event. \u201cThe distinguishing and necessary feature is, that a fixed and specific quantity is owing, and no future valuation is required to settle it.\u201d 3 Black. Comm. <em>154; </em>2 Hill (N. Y.) 220. If A. has a policy of insurance issued by the Amazon Insurance Company, that company does not owe A. anything upon that agreement, so far as premiums may be concerned, until A. has notified it that he desires to have such policy canceled. Whether it will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>ever owe A. anything upon that account depends upon the determination of A. to have his policy canceled. How much it will owe A. depends upon the time when A. reaches this conclusion, if ever. Whether the Amazon Insurance Company-will ever have its policy-holders re-insured, and how much money it will require, depends entirely upon future events. The most that can be said of these obligations is, that they are contingent liabilities \u2014 such liabilities as are incurred by persons who attach their names, as sureties, to official bonds and promissory notes. In section 2730 it is provided that in deducting liabilities from credits, no \u201c greater amount or portion of any liability, as surety, than the person required to make the statement believes that such surety is in equity bound, and will be compelled to pay, or to contribute, in case there be no securities,\u201d shall be considered. There is no fixed liability as surety, until there has been a default on the part of the principal. There is a contingent liability, which may become an actual liability upon the happening of a future event. The above provision, after 'the liability has become a certainty, only permits the jjerson listing his credits to deduct no greater amount .than what he is in equity bound, and will be compelled to pay. Counsel, for the purpose of showing that this thing which they seek to deduct from liabilities is an actual existing indebtedness, quote from section 274 of the Revised Statutes. For their theory we think this reference is unfortunate.' Therein there is a clear-cut distinction between <em>debts </em>\u2014 \u201c actual liabilities,\u201d and <em>\u201c </em>re-insurance fund.\u201d The language is not <em>\u201c </em>actual liabilities,\u201d including a re-insurance fund, or a sum to meet reinsurance liability, or a re-insurance liability. \u201c Actual liabilities \u201d are one thing, \u201c re-insurance liability \u201d is another. But when we look to section 2744, every shadow of doubt or question vanishes. That is the section upon which counsel should have based their argument on the subject of the definition of \u201c credits: \u201d <em>\u201c </em>Every insurance company in Ohio, whether incorporated by any law of this State or not, shall list for taxation .... all the personal property, which shall be held to include all such real estate as is necessary to the daily operations of the company, money and <em>credits </em>of such company or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>corporation within the state, at the actual value in'money.\u201d If we are correct in this point, the argument on the other side touching it must be pointless.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-5\">II. The second question is whether, under sections 2781 and 2782, the auditor of Hamilton county has the power to place the \u201cre-insurance reserve fund\u201d of these companies upon the duplicate for the years 1878, 1879, 1880 and 1881, and a penalty for 1882. A return, to be false within the meaning of section 2781, Revised Statutes, does not necessarily involve any moral turpitude upon the part of the maker thereof. If it is made through ignorance, or under a false construction of the law, it is not a true return, and therefore false. If what the court below held to be law is true, one must conceal his ignorance for but a single year to escape taxation, especially if the assessor or county auditor happens to be as ignorant as the person attempting to list tire property. If this be the law, what a door is opened to fraud ! It would be very easy for one who has willfully gone astray to successfully plead ignorance of the law. This is one of the cases in which ignorance of the law will not excuse. If these companies are now required to pay taxes upon property, unlawfully withheld from the tax-duplicate in the years 1878, 1879, 1880 and 1881, no wrong will be done to them. They will simply be required to pay money which was rightfully due to the government years ago. They will be the gainers, for they have had the use of the money during the time it lias been withheld from the treasury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-6\">We suppose that the word \u201c false,\u201d as used in these sections, has its plain and obvious meaning, \u201c not true.\u201d Section 2744, R. S., provides what the companies shall do in order to make true returns. These companies did not comply with this section in making their returns, therefore they are \u201c not true.\u201d They are false. <em>Genin </em>v. <em>Belmont County, </em>18 Ohio St. 534.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b597-7\">McIlvatne, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIu\">At the time of listing its property for taxation, did any obligation or duty rest on the plaintiff in error, in respect to re-insurance or otherwise, whereby, under the tax laws of the state, it became entitled to deduct from its \u201c claims and demands \u201d a sum equal to 50 per cent, of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>premiums on unexpired policies, and designated as \u201c re-insurance fund\u201d in section 274, and as \u201cunearned premiums\u201d in section 3648 of the Revised Statutes <em>%</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Section 274 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">\u201c When it appears to the Superintendent (of insurance) . . . . that the assets of any joint stock insurance company other than life, . . . after deducting therefrom all actual liabilities and <em>a re-insurance fwid </em>equal to fifty per cent, of the whole amount of the premiums on unexpired risks and policies, are reduced twenty per cent, or more below the capital stock required by law, he shall require the officers thereof to direct the stockholders to pay in the amount of such deficiency, etc.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">Section 3648 is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-10\">\u201cNo insurance company, organized under any law of this state, shall make any dividend except from the surplus profits arising from its business ;

Does such liability-rest upon the plaintiff in error in respect to the sum in controversy, either by virtue of the statute, or its own contracts ?</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">An insurance company is liable to the full extent of all its assets for losses covered by its policies. This liability is fixed by the contract of insurance. The amount of this liability is certain ; and where the loss has occurred, no doubt a legal <em>bona fide </em>debt exist. But where the loss has not happened, and may never happen, there exists no debt within the meaning of this statute. This is conceded, by plaintiff in error, and no claim is made on the ground of such liability.</p>\n<p id=\"Abe\">It is claimed, however, that the company is authorized to re-insure its unexpired risks ; the expense of which would be at least 50 per cent, of all premiums on its unexpired policies, and that the statute requires it to keep in reserve that amount of assets. Let it be granted. Still,' the company is under no obligation to re-insure; nor is it claimed that it has re-insured any of its risks. And until it does re-insure, it is impossible to say that it owes debts on account of re-insurance. True, the statute requires it to keep in reserve assets equal to eighty per cent, of its capital stock over and above all its actual liabilities, and a re-insurance fund equal to fifty per cent, of all premiums on unexpired policies; yet this re-insurance fund is not a debt, or in the nature of a debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">It is also claimed that the company, under certain circumstances, is bound to l\u2019edeem its policies. Section 3664, Revised Statutes, requires insurance companies to insert in their policies an obligation to cancel the same upon the written request of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>the person insured; and section 3665 provides: \u201c When a policy issued on the cash 'plan is cancelled, in accordance with the preceding section, the companies so issuing may retain customary short rates, as now established and charged by companies doing a cash business, for the time the policy has been in force, and return to the insured the unearned premium on the policy for the unexpired time.\u201d Surely, this obligation, before request to cancel by the person insured, is no more \u201c a legal <em>bona fide </em>debt\u201d than is the liability to pay losses covered by the policy before a fire insured against has taken place. Under this provision, a debt may or may not accrue; but, whether any such debt existed at the time of listing, we are not informed. On this point it may be further remarked, that if every policy were cancelled (an improbable event), the amount due policy holders would be less than the amount sought to be withdrawn from taxation, as the company, in such case, is authorized to retain \u201c customary short rates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">It is further claimed, on behalf of the plaintiff in error, that, if neither reinsurance nor cancellation is effected, a duty rests on the company to carry its risks until the expiration of its policies, which is a service of agreed and fixed value, to wit: the amount of unearned premiums; and therefore a legal <em>bona fide </em>debt within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">This claim is based, as we understand it, upon the statutory definition of credits, to wit: \u201c all legal claims and demands, whether for money or other valuable thing, or for labor or <em>service </em>due or to become due,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The theory of the claim is, that for every credit there must be a corresponding debt; and if a <em>claim </em>for service be a credit, the <em>owing </em>of service is a debt. This point is urged with much, ingenuity and ability by counsel, and while we are willing to adopt his theory, we are not ready to adopt his conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Assuming that creditor and debtor are relative terms, we are not now required to determine the full meaning of the phrase, \u201clegal claim or demand for labor or service,\u201d but only, whether a contract for insurance is a contract for \u201clabor or service,\u201d within the meaning of the statute, whereby the relation of debtor and creditor is created. If such relation exists, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>the insurex- becomes the debtor by reason of his obligation to continue the risk until the expiration of the policy, and it is self-evident that the insured is a creditor on the same account. And it follows, if the insurer may deduct from his <em>\u201c </em>claims and demands \u201d the amount of \u201c unearned premiums \u201d as a \u201c legal <em>bona fide </em>debt \u201d on account of <em>\u201c </em>service owing,\u201d that the person insured must list for taxation a like amount, on account of \u201c service due \u201d to him. That every person holding a policy of insurance should list for taxation the value of his right to have the risk carried until the expiration of the policy, is, to say the least, a novel proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">What is the right of the assured under his contract ? To have indemnity in case of loss. Nothing more. What is the obligation of the insurer in his contract ? To indemnify the assured in case of loss. Nothing more. If no loss occurs during- the life of the policy, the assured takes nothing by his contract, arid the insurer loses nothing. It is therefore plain, that until a loss occurs, the relation of creditor and debtor does not exist between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">It is said, that a policy is a <em>\u201c </em>valuable thing,\u201d before a loss covered by it takes place. How so ? Clearly, it does not add to the value of the property insured. It is not a thing valuable in its use. It is not an article valuable in trade. But it is said the holder may, at any time, demand its cancellation and recover the \u201c unearned premium,\u201d so called. True, the statute secures to the holder such a privilege; but he cannot exercise the privilege and hold the indemnity also. The object in obtaining insurance is to secure indemnity against loss \u2014not the investment of money; hence the right to demand cancellation, until exercised, is of no taxable value. After the right to demand cancellation is exercised, and the right to indemnity is thereby abandoned, of course the taxable property of the assured is increased, and that of the insurer diminished, to the extent of the premium returned, or liable to be returned, as above shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Upon full consideration of all the facts and the law, we are of opinion, that a policy of insurance, issued upon a paid-up premium, before condition broken, does not constitute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>contract for service, which can be construed as creating a credit on the part of the assured, or a debt on the part of the insurer, within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">2. The next question is, Did the court below err in restraining the auditor from charging taxes against the plaintiff in error on account of re-insurance deducted from \u201c claims and demands\u201d in the years 1878, 1879, 1880 and 1881, and a penalty on the like deduction in 1882? The solution of this question depends on the extent of power conferred upon the auditor by sections 2781 and 2782 of Devised Statutes. The decision of the court will be apparent by quoting section 2781, which is as follows : \u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">\u201c See. 2781. If any person whose duty it is to list property or make a return thereof for taxation, either to the assessor or to the county auditor, shall make a false return or statement, or shall evade making a return or statement, the county auditor shall ascertain, as near as practicable, the true amount of personal property, moneys, credits, and investments, that such person ought to have returned or listed, to which amount he shall add fifty per centum, and place the same on the tax-list ; and the inquiry and corrections provided for in this and the next sections may go as far back as the same can be traced, not exceeding the four years next prior to the year in which the inquiries and corrections are made, but as to former years, no \u25a0 penalty shall be added, and only simple taxes shall be claimed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">The point is, were these returns or statements false ? They were made upon printed blanks furnished by the auditor, and in conformity thereto. The law required the auditor to furnish blanks for that purpose. The value of all property of the company subject to taxation was truly returned. The amount of re-insurance was also returned among the debts of the company, in conformity to the requirement of the blank form. No doubt the auditor at the time the blank was'furnished, believed that this item, with full knowledge of its character, was a debt which could properly be deducted from the credits of the company ,\u2022 and that the company, when it returned the item, was of the same opinion. But, however <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>that may be, we are of opinion that the returns as made, under the circumstances shown, were not <em>false </em>within the meaning of these sections. This point is further elucidated by the decision upon the next question made in this case, as we do not think that the remedy provided by sections 2781 and 2782 was intended to apply in cases where section 1038 is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">3. Did the superior court err in holding that the auditor had power under section 1038 of Revised Statutes to correct the amount of plaintiffs\u2019 taxes for the year 1882 ?</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">This section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\"><em>\u201c </em>The auditor shall, from time to time, correct all errors which he discovers in the tax-list and duplicate, either in the name or the person charged with taxes or assessments, the description of lands or other property, or when \u00a1oroperty exempt from taxation has been charged with tax, or in the amount of such taxes or assessments.\u201d . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">True, it was held in <em>State </em>v. <em>Com. of Montgomery </em>County, 31 Ohio St. 271, that the corrections which the auditor may make under this section are merely clerical. The error to be corrected in relation to the plaintiff\u2019s taxes was the deduction of the re-insurance item from its credits. No fact is to be inquired into. Every necessary fact appeal\u2019s on the face of the return. Charge the proper rate of taxes upon the amount of credits returned without any deduction on account of the,reinsurance item, and the error in the amount of plaintiff\u2019s taxes will be corrected \u2014 clerical work merely. Corrections authorized by this section are limited, however, to the current tax-list and duplicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
