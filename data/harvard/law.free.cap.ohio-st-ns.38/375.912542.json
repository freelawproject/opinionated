Jones against David H. Ralston, George W. Ralston and Mary Partridge, administratrix of Ebenezer Partridge, deceased, to recover $2,097.16 for the breach of a certain undertaking for a second trial in an action wherein Jones had recovered a judgment against David Ralston, which undertaking was signed by Partridge, and was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-9\">\u201c Know all men by these presents: That David H.

Simington, </em>37 Ohio St. 484, we think the principle of that decision establishes the character of the undertaking now before us. It is enough in any written contract that the intent of the party clearly appear, though it be not fully and particularly expressed. In <em>Kursely </em>v. <em>Shenberger, </em>5 Watts, 193, it was said: \u201c If ever there was a time when courts listened to trivial and verbal inaccuracies in contracts, when the real meaning and intention of the parties was plain, that time has gone by, and the only object of the court is, that, when the meaning and intention of the parties are perfectly plain, no gram<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>matical inaccuracy, or want of the most appropriate words, shall render the instrument unavailing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">In <em>Ahrend </em>v. <em>Ordione, </em>125 Mass. 50, it was held, that when one signs a bond, as a party thereto, it is immaterial that he is not named in the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\u201c A bond was, \u2018 I, William Bush, am held, etc. . . , to which judgment, etc., . . I do bind myself, my heirs, etc., and every of them . . Sealed with my seal, etc.,\u2019 with condition \u2018the said William Bush\u2019 should account for money received as collector of school taxes, etc. The bond was signed and sealed by Bush and four others. Held, that it was the joint and several bond of all.\u201d <em>Leath </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>61 Pa. St. 395. See also <em>Shud v. Leibshultz, </em>51 Ind. 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">It would be a waste of space to attempt to review the cases upon this subject. Their current is uniform. Those instances in which it has been held that the signer was not bound will be found to be cases in which the language of the instrument was such as was thought to exclude the idea of liability, as where a bond recites that: \u201cWe, A. and B. are held,\u201d &amp;e., and is executed by A., B. and C. Here the pronoun \u201c we \u201d is declared to refer to A. and B., and there are said to be no words to indicate any intention that C. shall be bound. Such intention must be gathered from the whole instrument, taken in connection with the circumstances of its execution, and cannot be supplied by parol.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">The language of Brinkerhoif, J., in <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Allmen, </em>19 Ohio St. 485, indicating a contrary rule, has already been commented upon, and disapproved in <em>McLain </em>v. <em>Simington, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
