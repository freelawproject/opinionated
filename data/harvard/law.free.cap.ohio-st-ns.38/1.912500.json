Koch, principal, and Archibald Dawson and others, the plaintiffs in error, sureties, on the official bond of said Koch as treasurer of Wayne county for the term commencing on the first Monday of September, 1872, and continuing for two years, and until his successor was elected and qualified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>Kocli was elected on tbe second Tuesday of October, 1869, and tbe bond sued on was <em>executed on </em>.December 6,1869. The condition of tbe bond was as follows: \u201cNowif the said Jacob B. Koch shall faithfully discharge all the duties of his said office, and shall pay over according to law all money which shall come into his hands as such county treasurer, for state, county, township or other purposes, during his said term of office, then this obligation to be void, otherwise to be and remain in full force and virtue.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-5\">At the date of the execution of the bond, the city of \"Wooster, a city of the second class, with a population of less than 50,000, was the county seat of Wayne county, in which was elected annually a city treasurer, who was <em>ex offieio </em>treasurer of the city school district, and whose duty it was to receive from the county treasurer all moneys belonging to the city and school district, and disburse the same according to law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-6\">Between the date of the bond and the commencement of Koch\u2019s term of office, to wit, on April 2, 1870, the general assembly passed an act (67 Ohio L. 32) providing, among other things, \u201c that in cities of first and second class, having a population of less than 50,000, embracing a county seat, no election for city treasurer shall be held, but the county treasurer shall, in such cases, act as city treasurer,\u201d &amp;c. Hence, it is contended by plaintiffs in error, that as sureties for Koch as treasurer of the county as aforesaid, they are not liable on their bond, for any failure on the part of their principal \u201c to pay over according to law \u201d moneys which .came into his hands for the use of said city or school district:</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-7\"><em>Lynch, Lay &amp; Lynch, </em>for plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-8\">The subsequent legislation so changed the duties of Koch\u2019s office, his powers and his obligations, as to release his sureties from all obligation upon his official bond. <em>Pyrus </em>v. <em>Gibb, </em>38 Eng.

The power of the legislature to modify the duties of the.officer during his term cannot be doubted, and the exercise of such power must have been within the contemplation of the parties at the time the bond was executed. \u201c According to law \u201d embraces statute law in force during the term of office, whether passed before or after the execution of the bond. <em>King, Carey &amp; Howe </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>16 Ohio St. 80, approved and followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
