The trustees have no power under the will to purchase in the annuities, and the mere fact that the annuitants declare that they are willing to x-elease their annuities (but not having done so), upon payment to them of a sum in gross, will not authorize the court to order a distribution of the estate, and to decree the payment of such gross sums out of the funds of the estate.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-7\">Error to the District Court of Lawrence county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-8\">This action was originally brought in the Court of Common Pleas of Lawrence county by Robert R.

All debts had been paid. Of the seven children of the testator, living at the time of his death, his sons James S. and Oliver alone survived ; Thomas died in 1867, unmarried and childless; the others all left children, who have been named as plaintiffs and defendants, and who united in asking for a distribution of the estate under the provisions of item 17 of the will. Clara Creighton and Nancy Rodgers filed answers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>setting up their light to annuities but offering to release the same upon receipt of a sum in gross. The trustee resisted a distribution, claiming that, by the terms of item 18 of the will, it was made his duty to provide for any of the testator\u2019s grandchildren who might at any time become destitute, and that this was a continuing trust. It was shown at the hearing that for many years prior to the testator\u2019s death his sons Henry and Robert had been unsuccessful in business and were in embarrassed circumstances. Upon appeal the district court .decided that neither the plaintiffs nor any of the devisees were entitled to either a general or partial distribution under the will, and that no such distribution could be had until the death of all the annuitants or all of said annuities should be otherwise terminated. We are now asked to review this decision.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b276-5\"><em>W. H. </em>Enochs, for distributees :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-6\">The object sought by all parties is to have a- partial or final distribution of this estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Al\">If the court should find that these annuitants have the right to surrender their annuities, then a final distribution can be made : but if not, then we claim a partial distribution can be made retaining a sufficient amount of the money at interest in the hands of the trustee to pay the annuities and the expenses of the execution of the trust. The intention of the testator should be ascertained and carried out unless contrary to law. This rule is so familiar in Ohio, that I deem it unnecessary to refer the court to authorities. The testator, in using the words <em>\u201c </em>complete determination \u201d and \u201c final cessation \u201d of all the aforementioned annuities, certainly did not intend thereby to fix the time for final distribution of said estate, to be at the death of all said annuitants. Upon the death of the testator, said annuitants or any of them could have sold or otherwise disposed of their annuities, and upon such sale a complete determination and final cessation of such annuity ceased. Suppose Mrs. Clara Rodgers since the death of the testator had sold her annuity and lost or squandered every cent realized therefrom, and her annuity had been for years and is now drawn by an entire stranger to the testator. It is not unreasonable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>claim that the testator fixed the death of said annuitant, with all others as the period and only period at which a distribution of said estate could be made ? I maintain this annuitant or any other created by this will can sell her annuity at any time. If so, upon equitable principles, through, and with the aid of a court of equity, why can she not surrender to this estate her annuity for its value ? If she surrenders it, she is paid from the general fund of the estate. If she retains it she is paid from the s\u00e1me source. If all distributees of this estate were of age, is there any doubt of their right to buy out these annuitants and pay for the same out of the general fund of this estate in proportion to their respective interests therein, thereby terminating said annuities ? The same results are attained by a surrender of these annuities for their value, and the only reason they are not so purchased by the distributees is, there are remaining two minor distributees, and the aid of a court of equity is thus sought to accomplish said surrenders and fully protect the interests of said infants. All the distributees now of age and said minors through their guardians, parents and attorneys, are ashing this court to aid said minors in so purchasing said annuities. The will does not say at the death of the annuitants, but upon the complete determination or final cessation of the annuities, then a final distribution shall be made. The words \u201cfinal distribution\u201d used in this clause would seem to mdicate that partial distributions had been or could be made from time to time according to the necessities of the case. The will creates and classifies distributees and each is independent of the other further than an incumbrance to pay ' annuities. \"Why should the share to any one set of distributees be tied up to pay the annuity to another ? The right to a distribution of the entire estate depends on the vesting of the estates created by the will. There being a distinction between the vesting of estates in real and personal property, the rule governing the latter I claim is to be applied in this ease. The will converts the entire property \u201cout and out\u201d into personal property. 36 Ohio St. 17-23, 506 ; Redfield on Wills, 140, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8, 9, 3d edition ; Ilawhins on Wills, American\u2019 notes, 46; <em>Davour </em>v. <em>Matteux, </em>1 Ves.

For a full discussion of the vesting of estates, the court is referred to 2 Redfield on Wills, 3d edition, from page 213 to 260. Also, Jarman on Wills, last edition, by Randolph &amp; Talcott, vol. 2, pp. 406, 450, 453, 482. If the rights of parties are fixed and the estates vested, then the annuitants have the right to sell or dispose of their annuities as they may elect and a final distribution be made. <em>33 </em>Ohio St. 128, and cases there cited. 36 Ohio St. 506. The language of the will is the <em>\u201c </em>complete determination,\u201d <em>\u201c </em>final cessation,\u201d not the death of the parties if the estate was tied up to keep it from the control of creditors of any of the children ; this has been terminated by their deaths. The - testator certainly did not intend to keep the estate from his grandchildren, for that reason. Another objection to the construction given, it makes the devises remote, indefinite and uncertain. 1 Jarman, 259, 260, 261, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-5\">Another question is, to whom the share of Thomas goes upon distribution \u2014 whether to his brothers of the whole blood, or to his brothers and sisters of the whole and half blood alike, or their \u00abheirs ? The court will see that they are all of equal kin .to \u00abthe .testator, from whom the estate came to Thomas, and the will,gives .the .share of a child dying without heirs of his body to those wflio would inherit it under the statute of Ohio, S. <em>&amp; </em>C. 501, clause 3 ; S. <em>&amp; </em>S. 304, clause 3. Laws in force at death-of testator. I have been unable to find a case where the term brothers, and sisters, in a will is used, it did not include the half as well as the whole bloods, when all are of the same relation to the testator from whom the estate came. Hawkins i on Wills, 86, and cases there cited; 3 Redfield on Wills, 3d edition, 423, <em>\u00a7 </em>7, and cases there cited; <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>8 Ohio St. 501, Without the will the half brothers \u25a0-and -sisters ,of Thomas would inherit his share of the estate. &amp; ,S. \u2018304, clause 3; S, <em>Si </em>C. 105, clause 3. An heir is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>to be disinherited unless the intention of the testator is clear to that effect. 2 Jarman, 5th rule, 525 (old edition) ; <em>Crane </em>v. <em>Doty, </em>1 Ohio St. 248. The presumptions are all against disinheriting an heir, and a clear case must be made to warrant such a construction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-5\">Still another rule of construction gives Thomas\u2019s share to his brothers and sisters and their heirs of the whole and half blood equally. In this regard the will speaks from the death of the testator, and when he refers to classes or fluctuating bodies of persons to whom devises are made, all answering the description at his death, are entitled to take. 1 Redfield on Wills, 3 ed. 385, 386, \u00a7 12; 1 Jarman, old ed. 306, 307; <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Roden, </em>18 N. Y. 412; <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>3 Jones Eq. 167. The language of the will is, the interest which he -syould be entitled to shall go to their brothers and sisters. The class here spoken of by the testator, was brothers and sisters, and, as before claimed, this has uniformly been held to inckide the half bloods.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-6\">As to the claim of the trustee that he is liable to be called upon at any time in- the future to furnish support to the grandchildren of the testator to prevent destitution, we say that to so furnish or not is made clearly a discretionary power- in the trustee, and courts of equity never undertake to compel a trustee to act, when to act or not, is a discretionary power. <em>Greenough </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>10 Cush. 576; <em>Eldridge </em>v. <em>Heard, </em>106 Mass. 582. Besides, the testator*evidently meant minor children or children of tender years.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b279-7\"><em>Taft &amp; Lloyd, </em>for James and Oliver Rodgers:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-8\">1. Since the case has come to this court on a petition in error, the two remaining annuitants have agreed to accept in full satisfaction .of their claims the sums which the Carlisle tables show to be their present value, which is satisfactory to all parties. They therefore agree to an immediate distribution of the whole fund, and there is no opposition to a distribution unless it be on the part of the trustee, who, however, declares that he has no objection to it, if the court holds it to be safe. He does, however, in his answer, express the opinion that it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>necessary that his trust should be continued as long as there shall be any grandchildren who are liable to become destitute; at the same time expressing entire willingness to distribute the estate, if the court shall find that it can be safely done. The construction which Mr. Willard and his counsel \u2014 according to his answer \u2014 gave this clause, would make it necessary for the trustee to hold this property away from, the children and heirs, until the last grandchild of the testator should expire. That would postpone the distribution unreasonably, a construction which the court never favors. Grandchildren might be born more than twenty-one years after the death of the testator, and this construction would require this trust to be preserved throughout the life of the longest liver of them. But the testator did not by this clause in his will, intend any such thing. By the seventeenth item, the testator provides expressly when the distribution is to take place, viz.: \u201cUpon the complete determination of the particular estates herein created, and upon the final cessation of all the aforementioned annuities, I <em>direct and require </em>my said trustees to make a final distribution of my estate then remaining, as follows,\u201d giving specifically the manner of the distribution to be then made. The clause in the eighteenth item did not intend or purport to contradict or change that positive provision which precedes it, in any manner. The two clauses must be construed together. The intention was, that while the trust continued, and before the estate was divided, the trustees should be at liberty to aid prudently any of his grandchildren who should become destitute. This destitution might happen for the want of this very distribution. There is no expression qualifying the direct, definite, and positive requirement, that the distribution shall be made at the time indicated in item seventeen. If this construction needed corroboration, it could be found in the language of the clause on which the objection turns. It \u201c provides, that the annuities granted to any parent of such child shall be no longer payable, if the said trustees shall be of opinion that such destitution arises from the bad conduct of any such annuitant;\u201d showing that the support of destitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>grandchildren was to be given before the annuities were extinguished.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-5\">2. There is one question which will arise in the making of the distribution, to which we must call the attention of the court. Thomas, a son of the second marriage, died without issue, and unmarried, after the death of his father, viz., on the 18th day of April, 1867. The question is, to whom will his share go in the distribution under the will ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-6\">The first clause of item seventeen fixes the <em>time </em>of distribution, as we have seen, positively and irrevocably, viz., \u201c Upon the complete determination of the particular estates herein created, and upon the final cessation of all the annuities.\u201d That is the time when the distribution was to be made, and it was with reference to that <em>time </em>that he designated the distribution. The language is precise, \u201cto eacli of the three sons of the last marriage, and the heirs of their bodies respectively, he gave one-sixth. To the children of each of the children of his fii-st marriage, \u201c and if any of them <em>be </em>deceased, to the heirs of their bodies, one-ninth.\u201d \u201c Be <em>deceased ?\u201d When ? </em>Clearly, at the time of said <em>distribution. </em>All these provisions point to that time, and to no other. \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-7\">Some of the children of the first marriage were living, and some were dead, at the time of the making of the will. But the will clearly gives only to his grandchildren, and not to his children, of the first family. He had his reasons. He knew how much he had already given them, and what prospect there was of their making good use of what should be given them. His meaning was clearly expressed; but, by its language, the particular course of distribution was made to depend upon the question, who was living when the <em>distribution </em>should be made? and not upon the question, who was alive when the will was made and proved ? <em>*</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-8\">He goes on to say that his meaning is, \u201c that the children only of deceased children shall inherit,\u201d \u201c and in case that any of said above-mentioned persons die without heirs of their bodies, then the interest which he would be entitled to shall go to their brothers and sisters.\u201d That is, to the surviving brothers and sisters of the person who shall so die without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>heirs of his or her body. If, for instance, one of the children of Henry should be dead without heirs of his or her body at the time of said distribution, the share of that child would go to its own brothers and sisters, and not to the children of Robert Edwin, or to any other grandchildren of the first marriage; or to James, or to Oliver, of the second marriage, who could not be included among its brothers and sisters. So here, as Thomas is dead without heirs of his body, his share must go to his brothers, as there is no sister surviving.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-5\">No question as to the half-blood arises in the case. If brothers or sisters of the first marriage were alive, the question would arise, whether the share of Thomas, under that clause, would go to the brothers or sisters of the half-blood. But as all the half-brothers and sisters of Thomas will be dead at the time of the distribution, his share goes equally to James and Oliver, his only brothers. This construction is not more literal than it is reasonable, and according to the general plan of division which the testator has laid out in his will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-6\">As to the period of division and the persons to take, see <em>Andrews </em>v. Partington, 3 Bro. C. C. 401, 404; 1 Roper on Legacies, 71; <em>Leake </em>v. Robinson, 2 Merivale, 382, 3; <em>Jenkins </em>v.

Rodgers:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-8\">There remain now but two questions to be considered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>the court: first, whether the estate shall now be distributed; and, second, if so, who shall have the share given to Thomas. As to the first question, we desire to add nothing to the considerations presented by Taft <em>&amp; </em>Lloyd in their brief. The distribution of the share given to Thomas must be in one of three ways: 1st. to his surviving brothers, and to the children of his deceased brothers and sisters. 2d. To the three brothers, Robert Edwin, James S., and Oliver, who were living at the time of his death; or, 3d. To James S. and Oliver who still survive. The estate'is to be treated as personal property. The sixteenth item of the will empowers and directs the trustees to sell the-real estate and invest the proceeds as they shall deem most beneficial for the estate. The avails of the land therefore go, to all intents, in the same direction as if it had never been land. 3 Redfield on Wills, 140. Though the distribution is deferred, that does not prevent the interest vesting at the death of the testator. 1 Redfield on Wills, 414; <em>Kingsbury </em>v. <em>Scovill, </em>26 Conn. 349; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Lawson, </em>3 East, 278; <em>Raynor </em>v. Mowbray, 3 Bro. C. C. 234; <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Harte, </em>1 Cox Ch. Ca. 131; <em>Masters </em>v. <em>Hooper, </em>4 Bro. C. C. 207.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-5\">We claim, therefore, that the interest of the distributees vested at the death of the testator, and that the executors held in trust for them. It results that upon the death of Thomas his interest vested at once in some or all of the remaining distributees. This disposes of the claim that only the brothers now living, James S. and Oliver, are entitled. The remaining question is, whether Thomas\u2019 share, vested upon his death in his three brothers, James S., Oliver, and Robert Edwin, then living, or in them and the children of the then deceased brothers and sisters. Williams on Executors, 6 Am. ed. foot page 1123, top page 1211; <em>Latchwood\u2019s Appeal, </em>30 Pa. St. 175; <em>Brent </em>v. <em>Washington's Adm\u2019rs, </em>18 Gratt. 526. Now, if the devise over to brother and sister, in the eighteenth item of the will, is to the brothers and sisters living at the death of any son or daughter without children, it follows that James S., Oliver, and Robert Edwin became vested with Thomas\u2019 interest upon his death. But we do not think the proper construction of the will leads to this conclusion. Section 56 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>the wills act,- then in force (S. &amp; O. 1627), provides that: \u201cWhen a devise of real or personal estate is made to any child oi other relative of the testator, if such child or other relative shall die, leaving issue surviving the testator, such issue shall take the estate devised, in the same manner as the devisee would have done, if he had survived the testator, unless a different disposition shall be made or required by the will.\u201d This applies as well to the devise over to brother and sisters as to the original devises, and there is nothing in the will making or requiring a different disposition. It is to be borne in mind that every one of the testator\u2019s children was alive when he made his will, and until after his decease. \u00bb</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-5\">The eighteenth item of the will, the one containing the distributive provision, gives four shares out of seven to the children of children, and in the case of every other child directs the\u2019 distribution to him and the heirs of his body. These provisions do not imply an intent to create a limitation against the testator\u2019s grandchildren, but the contrary. Then the testator declares it to be the true intent and meaning of his direction of distribution, \u201c that the children only of deceased children shall inherit,\u201d or paraphrasing, without changing the meaning, \u201c children shall inherit from their deceased parents.\u201d This can have no less meaning than that the grandchildren should take all the interest of their deceased parents. It is impossible to read the eighteenth item of the will and not be impressed that the testator was as mindful of his grandchildren as of children. Finally, he says that if \u201c any of said above-mentioned persons die without heirs of their bodies, then the interest which he would be entitled to shall go to their brothers and sisters.\u201d Were these words, \u201cbrothers and sis.ters,\u201d words of limitation in the mind of the testator, referring to brothers and sisters only who might be living when the contingency should happen, or were they in his mind words of description referring to all his children 2 Cleai\u2019ly the latter. His children were all living; for the three youngest, all minors, he provides directly, for them and the heirs of their bodies. His elder sons, Henry and Robert Edwin, had been unsuccessful in business and were in embarrassed circumstances. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>give to them would be only to give to their creditors ; therefore he gives to their children. His two daughters were married, therefore he gives to their children. To each of the younger children, then minors, and to the children of his youngest daughter, Rosalie Hamilton, he gives on'e sixth. To the elder children he had doubtless made advancements, and in simple justice, equalizing his bounty among all, he gives to the children of each, one-ninth. Then he explains, after first saying that grandchildren shall inherit their parents\u2019 shares, that if any child dies without children, his share shall go to his brothers and sisters, meaning, without the shadow of a doubt, in our opinion, all the brothers and sisters, and not those only who might at some uncertain time in the future be surviving.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b285-5\">Longworth, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqM\">The first question which arises in the construction of this will is whether an estate <em>vested </em>in the distributees at the time of the testator\u2019s death, or not until the happening of the events upon which a distribution was to take place.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Although conceding that in the interpretation of-wills, courts in general favor that construction under which estates will vest at the time of testator\u2019s death, yet this, like every other rule of construction, will be controlled by the intention of the testator as gathered from the whole will. As was said by Scott, J., in <em>Richey </em>v. Johnson, 30 Ohio St. 288-292: <em>\u201cWe </em>are to read the <em>whole </em>will and ascertain not only what the testator has said, but what he has forborne to say ; .and the construction given to any part of the will should conform to its general scope and purpose as collected from the whole document. It is to be observed that the testator gives no interest in the farm in question, or in its proceeds, to his brothers and sisters, or to the children of any of them by way of direct devise or bequest. The gift is to be found only in the direction to distribute the proceeds of its sale and in the designation of the persons among whom distribution is to be made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">These remarks apply with equal force to the case before us. The only words of gift in the will are to be found in the devise of the whole estate to trustees, and in the direction to distribute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>the estate, after the determination of the particular estates and the final cessation of the. annuities, among persons, some of whom, perhaps, were yet to be born. Color is given to a contrary construction by the provision directing the trustees to make certain payments to, or provision for the minor sons, when they should become of age, to be thereafter charged against their distributive shares; but, taking the will as a whole, we are persuaded that the real intention of the testator was that no estate should vest in any of the objects of his bounty until the time for distribution should arrive, and then in those persons only who should answer the description at that time. Speaking for myself only I wish to say that it is after much hesitation, and still not without some embarrassing doubts, that I have arrived at this conclusion. These doubts arise from the vague and uncertain language in which the intention of the testator is expressed, and from which no thoroughly satisfactory conclusion can be drawn. Still I am satisfied that the most reasonable and probable interpretation is that given by my brethren.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Has the time then arrived for a distribution of the estate, either final or partial <em>% </em>Clearly not. No partial distribution could be made until it is ascertained who the parties may be who are entitled to take, and this cannot be ascertained until the time arrives for final distribution. And here we may say that we think it clear that but one distribution was ever contemplated by the testator, and that his object in calling it a <em>\u201c </em>final \u201d distribution, was simply to distinguish it from what might be called the partial distribution of $2,000 each to his minor sons when they should come of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">On the one hand it is contended that the time arrives only upon the <em>death </em>of all of the annuitants ; on the other, that it depends upon the cessation of the annuities as a charge upon the estate by release or otherwise by operation of law. That the latter is the proper interpretation we entertain no doubt. The testator does not speak of the death of the annuitants, but of the <em>\u201cfinal cessation </em>\u201d of the annuities; and surely it is but fair to take him to have intended just what he has said. Had he intended to postpone the division of his estate to such time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>as all of tlie annuitants (one of whom, at least, was at his death little more than a child), should die,- we think he would have taken pains to make such intention appear in plain language. So long as these annuities were outstanding it is evident that no distribution could take place, seeing that these were to be paid only from the <em>income </em>of the estate; but upon their \u201c final cessation,\u201d as charges upon the estate, no valid reason could exist against a final distribution, unless it should appear that the testator intended a further postponement, and such intention is not to be found either in the words used or in the surrounding circumstances of the case. We are unanimously of opinion that upon the \u201c final cessation \u201d of these annuities, either by death or release or surrender to the estate, it will become the duty of the trustee to distribute the estate in accordance with the provisions of the will. True, the trustee alleges in his answer that he knows from conversations held with the deceased that he contemplated a remote period as the time of distribution, but we aye not to regard any such averment. We are to find the intention of the testator in the will itself, and are not at liberty to allow its terms to be varied or contradicted by conversations or parol statements made either before or after its execution. Under neither interpretation, however, has the time for distribution yet arrived; the annuities of Clara Creighton and Nancy Rodgers being still outstanding valid charges upon the income of the whole estate. The widow\u2019s annuity ceased by operation of law when she refused to take under the will, and the others, except the two mentioned, have ceased by the death of their owners; but these two are still in full force. It does not remove this obstacle to say that these ladies are ready and willing to release them to the estate, for they have not yet done so, nor can the court compel them to do so. The trustee clearly has no power under the will to purchase them;' but should their owners see fit to release them to the estate, then, and not until then, will the time arrive for a distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">We regard as wholly untenable the claim of the trustee that no distribution can be made so long as there may be grand-children, now living, or hereafter to be born, who may, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>by possibility, at some time become destitute. Such construction would postpone tbe vesting of tbe estate and its enjoyment beyond tbe lives of all tbe beneficiaries now in being, and for more than twenty-one years thereafter. It is clear to our minds that this provision as to the support of destitute grandchildren was intended to apply only during such time as the estate should remain in the hands of the trustee and pending its distribution, and was not intended to control or limit the time fixed for such distribution by item <em>17 </em>of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\"><em>We </em>are asked to decide to whom shall pass upon distribution the share which Thomas Rodgers would have received had he lived. It is stated in argument, although it is not disclosed in the record, that the testator was twice married, and that his younger sons Janies 8., Thomas and Oliver were children of the second marriage. If this be true we are clearly of opinion that the testator, in providing that if any of the persons mentioned as distributees should die without issue \u201c then the interest which he would be entitled to shall go to theii brothers and sisters,\u201d referred to brothers of the whole bloot, only as respects his own children. This is rendered manifesl from the care taken to exclude his other children from an\\ share whatever in his estate. The sons had been uni or tunal ( in business, and were insolvent, and it is evident that the testator believed that a gift to them would have been a gift to their creditors, from which neither his sons nor their children would reap the benefit. The provision in question could apply only to the grandchildren and to these younger sons, seeing that no share could come to the older sons and daughters. We are therefore of opinion that, at the time of distribution, Thomas\u2019 share will pass to his brothers J ames S. and Oliver if they be then living, and to their children if deceased. This conclusion also follows of necessity from our previous holding concerning the vesting of the estate only in the persons answering the description of the will at the time of distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b288-7\">Johnson, J., did not sit in this case.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
