The end fronting upon Main street consists principally of glass doors and windows, the interior being divided into several rooms by partitions, the said rooms being twelve, thirteen and fifteen feet square respectively. The first and second rooms are occupied as a beer saloon, carried on by defendant and his wife, and where ale, beer and native wines are sold by them, and one or more rooms back of these are used as lunch and dining rooms. A counter runs from the front window on the east side of the front room back into the next room, with a- space between this counter and the east wall of the building, a partition made of boards extending from the west wall to and covering the counter, and is built from the floor to the ceiling, with a door near the center by which to pass from the front to the next room. The beer and other liquors are kept in the front room, behind the counter, and are sold and drank sometimes at the counter in the front room, and sometimes carried to customers in the second and third rooms, where tables and chairs are provided for their use, and where the beer and other liquors provided are drank, and which rooms are more frequently used for that purpose than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>the front room, access being had to said second and thii\u2019d rooms either from the front room or from Walnut street by a door leading into the second room, and there is one in that room facing on Walnut street without a blind; that prior to the passage of said ordinance a lai\u2019ge screen was kept in the front room which obstructed the view from Main street to the place where customers stood in drinking at the counter; and blinds were used at the front windows for the same object, all of which have been removed since its passage. That the partition, running from the west side of the front room to and over the counter, is the partition named in the affidavit under which the prosecution was instituted. That the pavement in front of the building on Main street is much more frequently used by persons passing and repassing than the pavement on Walnut street, and that the defendant has been engaged in selling beer, ale and native wines in said rooms, as herein before described, since-the passage of said ordinance, and'refuses to remove the said partition ; and the defendant, to maintain the issue on his part, offered evidence and testified showing that he and his family have occupied the building described some time prior to the passage of said ordinance, and since and during said time have used portions of the same as a beer saloon and eating house, the beer, etc., being kept in the front room behind the counter and sold and drank there; and also often drank by customers in the second and third rooms where it was carried to them. That the building had formerly been used as a grocery, and when taken possession of by defendant and his wife consisted of one entire room, but was by them divided into separate apartments by partitions, the first and second from the front being made of boards, extending from the floor to the ceiling, but permanently attached to the floor, ceiling and wall. That said first partition, extending from the west wall to and over the counter, was not originally put there for the purpose of obstructing the view from the front, but to divide the room, and as a fixture, as the other partitions were. That he had kept a large screen \u00bfear the front door, and had blinds to the front windows to obstruct the view from Main street, up to the passage of said ordinance, and until he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>notice from the marshal to remove the same; and they were then removed. That persons passing along the pavement on Walnut street can see into the second room through the window, the door leading into that room from Walnut street not having any window or lights in it, and the window not having any blind or anything to obstruct the view.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b693-5\">The mayor, on these facts, found Shultz guilty, and assessed a fine, and ordered him to stand committed until such fine and the costs should be paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b693-6\">The judgment was affirmed in the court of common pleas and district court, and this petition in error is filed to reverse the several judgments.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b693-7\"><em>J.

And general words following particular and specific words, must, ordinarily, be confined to things of the same kind as those specified. Bishop\u2019s Written Laws, \u00a7\u00a7 245, 246 ; Hai\u2019d. Const. Stats. 83 ; Maxw. Int. Stats. 297; <em>Denbow </em>v. <em>The State, </em>18 Ohio, 11. Thus, in <em>R. </em>v. <em>Cleworth, </em>4 B. &amp; S. (116 E. C. L.) 927, Coekburn, C. J., said : \u201c There is a general expression, \u2018 other person whatsoever ;\u2019 but, according to a well established rule in the construction of statutes, general terms following particular ones apply only to such persons or things as are <em>ejusd,em generis </em>with those comprehended in the language of the legislature.\u201d True, this rule is not to be employed in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>case to defeat the plain intent of the general assembly <em>(Woodworth </em>v. <em>The </em>State, 26 Ohio St. 196; <em>R. </em>v. <em>Edmundson, </em>28 L. J. 213, M. C.), but tbe rule seems to be strictly applicable here. And, according to a general rule equally applicable, sucb general words, following particular descriptive words, do not include such a partition, for the further reason that it is of a more permanent and important character than the things specifically mentioned. <em>Ib.; Canterbury's case, </em>2 Coke, 46 <em>b. </em>Obviously, if the partition had been placed in the building at the time it was erected, an attempt to punish Shultz for failing to remove such part of his house, would have been mere usurpation of power; and we are unable to see that the case supposed is materially different from the case presented. We are perfectly clear that the words, \u201cblind, screen, painted or frosted glass, shade, curtain, or other device,\u201d do not embrace such a partition. The further question presented,\u2014 that is, whether the ordinance is reasonable and consistent with the policy of the state as declared in the statutes, \u2014 we need not determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
