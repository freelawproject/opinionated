First, so<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>lution of the instant case on the basis of existing law. Second, resolution of the underlying problem of developing certain and viable guidelines for Bench, Bar and defendants. Such guidelines must define a procedure for plea taking that is just and understandable. At the same time it should reduce the necessity for review or simplify and expedite the process of review. The first problem involves this Court\u2019s judgment-making role; the second problem calls upon the exercise of this Court\u2019s constitutional responsibility for superintending the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">I\u2014The <em>Williams </em>Case</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The application of existing law to <em>Williams </em>is not too difficult as the principle issue is well defined and controlling precedent available, which does justice in the individual case but probably adds little or nothing to the resolution of the second problem of developing certain and viable guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">The question of substantive law involved is whether the guilty plea of defendant Rufus Williams was lawfully taken. The specific question is whether Michigan law on taking guilty pleas requires that under all circumstances the trial judge personally question the defendant for purposes of ascertaining the facts of the crime and defendant\u2019s participation therein.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">I (A)\u2014Facts of the <em>Williams </em>Case</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">Williams was originally charged with first-degree murder. With representation of counsel, he pled guilty to second-degree murder. The plea was ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>eepted and lie was sentenced on October 19, 1959, to life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">Approximately seven years later, defendant petitioned the trial court to withdraw his guilty plea on the ground that the trial judge had failed to personally question him to ascertain whether a crime was committed and his participation therein, and on other grounds not relevant here. The trial court denied the petition. The Court of Appeals affirmed in an opinion by Judge Charles Levin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The facts of the alleged murder and the interrogation of the defendant by the court appear in the following excerpt from the proceedings on the taking of the guilty plea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>What, roughly, are the facts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\"><em>\u201cMr. Kuta:</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The person that was killed Your Honor was apparently a girl friend of the defendant. On the particular day in question he came over to the home where she was living. He had this gun. He was in the apartment while the deceased was in the bathroom taking a bath or something and then as she came out of the bathroom into her apartment, there was another person present, that she saw him,-\u2014-they had trouble before,\u2014 they had an argument and so forth and she started to run and he had a gun in his possession and shot at her. She was struck and lived for about four and a half to five hours I believe and then expired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">\n<em>\u201cThe Court:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>You heard what the Prosecutor said Mr. Williams. Is it your desire to plead guilty to the charge that is included, that is, the charge of murder in the second degree?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-10\"><em>\u201cThe Respondent: </em>Yes sir, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-11\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>You have talked this over with your attorney have you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-12\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number><em>\u201cQ. </em>Do you plead guilty freely and voluntarily?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-4\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">\u201cQ. Have any threats or any promises been made in order to get you to plead guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>You plead guilty because in your own mind you are guilty of the crime of murder in the second degree?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">Eufus Williams was 49 years old, had an extensive history of criminal convictions and incarceration going back over 20 years. In seeking to withdraw the guilty plea he did not claim innocence but rather that he was intoxicated at the time of the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">Because approximately 75 to 85 percent of our criminal cases are disposed of by the non-adversary process of the guilty plea<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *and because of the large number of appeals to the Court of Appeals<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>this Court* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> alleging errors in the plea-taking procedure, we granted leave to hear this case and the companion cases of <em>People </em>v. <em>Taylor, People </em>v. <em>Johnson, People </em>v. <em>Jaworski, </em>and <em>People </em>v. Butler<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in order to formulate clear guidelines for lawfully taking a guilty plea that will comply with our construction of the provisions of the court rule on guilty pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">I (B)\u2014Existing Precedent in <em>Williams</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The leading case in this field is <em>People </em>v. <em>Barrows </em>(1959), 358 Mich 267. It establishes two criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>The first and most important criterion is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-4\">\u201cThe direct questioning of a defendant by the trial judge on plea of guilty is required by the rule [35A] for the purpose of establishing the crime and the participation therein of the person pleading guilty.\u201d 358 Mich 267, 272.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The second criterion is found in the following quotation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">\u201cNor does this record convince us of the truth of the plea.\u201d 358 Mich 267, 273.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Furthermore, <em>Barrows </em>noted that the defendant was only 19 years old and that this was his first appearance in a criminal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Applying these criteria to <em>Williams, </em>the above quoted excerpt from the <em>Williams </em>guilty plea taking begins with the court asking \u201cWhat, roughly, are the facts?\u201d The defendant himself does not answer but the assistant prosecuting attorney in his presence does summarize what defendant did, covering the elements of the crime of which defendant is charged. Such action meets the requirement of \u201cestablishing the crime and participation therein of the person pleading guilty\u201d as required by <em>Bar</em>rows.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>As to the second criterion, being convinced that the defendant was or was not innocent, the facts in <em>Williams </em>are that the defendant did not claim to be innocent but rather he sought to exculpate himself on the grounds of drunkenness. Furthermore, the record beginning with the guilty plea taking proceedings is such as to justify the court in believing that the defendant was not innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">As contrasted to the youth and first offender status of the defendant in <em>Barrows, </em>in <em>Williams </em>the defendant had a 20 year record of criminal convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The requirements of <em>Barrows </em>and the statute and court rule are satisfied by the action in <em>Williams.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>I <em>(C)\u2014Williams </em>Subissue</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Defendant contends that the failure to have counsel at the preliminary examination precludes using the testimony given at the examination to establish a factual basis for his plea conviction. Defendant cites <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(1970), 339 US 1 (90 S Ct 1999, 26 L Ed 2d 387) for the proposition that he was entitled to court appointed counsel at the preliminary examination. The United States Supreme Court in <em>Coleman </em>concluded that under Alabama procedure the preliminary examination constituted a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the prosecution at which indigent defendants were entitled to court appointed counsel. <em>Coleman </em>was decided on June 22, 1970. The preliminary examination of the defendant in the instant case was held on April 29, 1959. We will not attempt to,, anticipate the United States Supreme Court,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and therefore find that <em>Coleman </em>is prospective only. This same conclusion was reached in <em>Kochel </em>v. <em>State of Maryland </em>(1970), 10 Md App 11 (267 A2d 755), and in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1970), 217 Pa Super 190 (269 A2d 383).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Evidence of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s own feeling on this issue is present in <em>Wetzel </em>v. <em>North Carolina </em>(1970), 399 US 934 (90 S Ct 2250, 26 L Ed 2d 805). In <em>Wetzel, </em>the majority of the Court declined to grant certiorari, with three justices dissenting on the ground that they felt <em>Coleman </em>should be retroactive in all cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Since defendant was represented by counsel at the time his plea of guilty was accepted, and since we hold that <em>Coleman </em>applies only prospectively, defendant\u2019s contentions on this issue must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">The trial court and the Court of Appeals are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>II\u2014The Administration of Justice in Taking Guilty Pleas</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">The results of failure to observe proper procedures in the acceptance of guilty pleas are costly in dollars, public safety or public understanding of the judicial process, or most likely in all three. However, while less immediately injurious to public policy and respect for the law, erosion of a certain standard by hard case exceptions, however individually justifiable, creates greater injustice and brings the law into greater disrepute in the long run, because it both slows down the wheels of justice through a proliferation of cases for complicated review and corrupts the very concept of the law as a standard by which men can live.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The problem is first, to write a just <em>and </em>practicable rule; and second, to secure the cooperation of trial judges in following it and third, to enforce the rule strictly.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">II (A)\u2014Brief History of the Underlying Problem</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Prom the beginning there have been efforts to bring some certainty into the law and efforts to work out individual justice where there has been failure to follow the prescribed standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Legislation beginning in 1875 attempted to create some specific standards in taking pleas. The current relevant statute is MOLA \u00a7 768.35 (Stat Ann 1954 Rev \u00a7 28.1058):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">\u201cWhenever any person shall plead guilty to an information filed against him in any court, it shall be the duty of the judge of such court, before pronouncing judgment or sentence upon such plea, to become satisfied after such investigation as he may deem necessary for that purpose respecting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>nature of the case, and the circumstances of such plea, <em>that said plea was made freely, with full knowledge of the nature of the accusation, and without undue influence. </em>And <em>whenever said judge shall have reason to doubt the truth of such plea of guilty, it shall be his duty to vacate the same, </em>direct a plea of not guilty to be entered and order a trial of the issue thus formed.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">This Court entered the field with Court Rule 35A in 1947:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">\u201cSec. 2. Imposing Sentence. If the accused pleads guilty, after such plea and before sentence the court shall inform the accused of the nature of the accusation and the consequence of his plea; and regardless of whether he is represented by counsel, the court shall examine the accused, not necessarily under oath, and as a condition of accepting the plea of guilty and imposing sentence shall ascertain that the plea was freely, understandingly, and voluntarily made, without undue influence, compulsion, or duress, and without promise of leniency. Unless the court determines that the plea of guilty was so made, it shall not be accepted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-10\">\u201cThis rule is mandatory but failure to comply therewith shall not be considered jurisdictional.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">The specificity of the Court Rule was, as we have seen, supported by <em>Barrows </em>in 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">Eight years after <em>Barrows, </em>on May 8, 1968, our Court handed down the four cases of <em>Hobdy, Dunn, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number><em>Winegar </em>and Steams<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in which this Court announced that the standard required of trial judges in following the law on taking of guilty pleas is the standard of substantial compliance. The import of that standard is demonstrated in the following two quotations, the first from <em>Bunn </em>and the second from <em>Winegar:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">\u201cIn conclusion, we cite again the court rule and statute cited in <em>People </em>v. <em>Winegar </em>(1968), 380 Mich 719: GCR 1963, 529.1 and CL 1948, \u00a7 769.26 (Stat Ann 1954 Rev \u00a7 28.1096). The import of both the rule and the statute is that on review courts should be concerned with substance, not with form, that the fundamental inquiry is whether there has been a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Dunn </em>(1968), 380 Mich 693, 701.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">\u201cThird, a plea of guilty should not be set aside after sentence merely because the verbatim record does not affirmatively show compliance <em>in illis verbis </em>with GCR 1963, 785.3(2).\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Winegar </em>(1968), 380 Mich 719, 731.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">In <em>Hobdy </em>we upheld a guilty plea where the record failed to indicate whether the defendant expressly waived counsel but did show he was informed of his right to counsel. In <em>Bunn </em>we upheld a guilty plea where the defendant was not informed of the maximum possible sentence for the charge to which he pled guilty reasoning that length of sentence was not one of the \u201cconsequences of his plea\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">In <em>Winegar, </em>we did not reject a guilty plea where the judge examined the defendant off the record in his judicial chambers to ascertain the factual basis for the plea and to inform the defendant of the nature of the accusation and the consequences of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>the plea<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and spread these facts on the record. We have discussed <em>Stearns </em>above, I (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The next and most recent decision in this area is <em>People </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(1970), 383 Mich 338 outside of <em>People </em>v. <em>Ferguson </em>below.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Defendant alleged in seeking to invalidate his plea of guilty that (1) he was not advised of his right to counsel but that he was interrogated incessantly; (2) \u201cthat his statements were used as a \u2018stick\u2019 to elicit a false plea of guilty;\u201d and (3) he was innocent (p 351). The majority opinion held that, while defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial attacked both the voluntariness and the truth of his plea, the defendant produced nothing before the trial judge which properly challenged his decision (pp 363, 364). The dissenting opinion found no error in the Court of Appeals opinion based on the failure of the trial court to inform the defendant of the maximum sentence possible as required by GrCR 1963, 785.3(2) as part of the determination that the plea was understandingly and voluntarily made (p 375). It also cited with approval the Court of Appeals\u2019 specific principles in accepting a plea of guilty. While the majority opinion is based on a lack of evidence, there is nothing in this opinion to indicate a departure from the substantial compliance rule developed in the previously considered cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>The <em>Taylor </em>case indicates that within the Court itself there was support for both a rule of substantial compliance and strict compliance with procedural requirements. To some extent this was also true in <em>Hobdy, Bunn, Winegar </em>and <em>Stearns. </em>The culmination of this difference of opinion occurred in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ferguson </em>(1970), 383 Mich 645 where the disqualification of one justice resulted in a three to three non-decision. The question involved was whether failure to advise a defendant of the maximum penalty for the offense charged is a violation of the court rule requiring the court to inform the accused of the nature of the accusation and the consequence of his plea. The equally divided Court affirmed the Court of Appeals\u2019 reversal of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">It should be noted that differences on applying the law in reviewing the conduct of the trial judge in his application of the procedures prescribed in GCR 1963, 785.3(2) do not necessarily indicate a difference in view as to what the correct procedure should be but only a difference as to the consequence of failing to specifically carry out that procedure.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Consequently, it may be more feasible to set up guidelines by adopting a new rule than through the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>II (B)\u2014Utility of Buie to Solve Problems as to Workable Guidelines for Guilty Pleas &amp; Effective Administration of Justice</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Tbe problem of the proper taking of guilty pleas was well summed up in <em>People </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>by then Chief Justice T. E. Brennan where he says \u201cDespite several years of debate, countless regional and statewide conferences, and dozens of individual cases, confusion remains, and the demand for definitive guidelines has not subsided.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> That was 1970. In 1971 Chief Judge T. John Lesinski of the Michigan Court of Appeals in <em>People </em>v. <em>Jaworski </em>indicates that the confusion still exists<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and, of course,to help solve this confusion is why the Supreme Court accepted the <em>Williams </em>c\u00e1se. To again quote former Chief Justice T. E. Brennan, \u201cIn this maze, we must choose our own course, if not by the prescience of court rule, then at least by clear hindsight demonstrably incorporated in an understandable body of case law.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Former Chief Justice T. E. Brennan then went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\">\u201cThis appeal of Taylor presents an opportunity to get on with it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">From the flow of incoming cases, it would seem that as brave as this Court\u2019s determination \u201cto get on with it\u201d on a case by case basis, and as normal judicial process as that would be, it does not appear to be comprehensive and compelling enough to meet the problem of confusion and uncertainty confront<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>ing the courts and tantalizing defendants and their attorneys. The alternative then is the development of an effective rule.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Meeting the problem by rule makes sense because it is more logical to attack a complicated problem not susceptible of resolution in a single case by a rule which can comprehend issues that would require many cases and perhaps a long time to develop. But there is a further and persuasive reason and that is that much of the confusion has revolved not around a substantive rule of law but the consequences of a failure to follow a procedural rule, such as whether the trial court must ascertain the truth of a plea by personal interrogation of the accused or through some other presumably equally reliable method.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">II (C)\u2014Development of New Rule &amp; Procedure</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">In order to develop the most individually and socially just, the most simple and workable, the most understandable and acceptable rule, this Court is inviting members of the trial and appellate bench along with members of the Bar to review GrCR 1963, 785.3 to determine whether it best expresses the practical and legal principles for accepting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>plea of guilty, and, if not to recommend a better one. This group will also be asked to consider whether this Court should lay down new procedures for the review of guilty pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">This development is an exercise of this Court\u2019s constitutional responsibility for superintending the administration of justice in this state. Its aim is to facilitate the taking of guilty pleas, which are favored by our criminal jurisprudence for pragmatic, psychological and philosophical reasons.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It is also to facilitate review or reducing the necessity to review the taking of guilty pleas. This latter will permit the courts to do a better job of such review and also have more time to devote to the general task of administering justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The committee development of such a rule and procedures should accomplish four objectives. First it would apply to the formulation of such a rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>and procedures the best talent and most comprehensive and varied experience. Second it would clarify the law. Third it would promote the widest possible understanding among Bench, Bar, and future defendants of the rule and procedures. Fourth, it should produce a result capable of rendering justice and simplifying or reducing appeals, yet workable and acceptable enough to command the understanding and cooperation of all who must work with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Time is, of course, of the essence. Existing law with its confusion and uncertainties must be followed until the new rule has been developed, approved and promulgated for general understanding before becoming effective. It is the Court\u2019s intention that the new rule shall be effective for all guilty pleas taken on and after April 1, 1972.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> As of that time the new rule shall be followed specifically and strictly, and where a judge shall fail to follow the prescribed procedures, it shall be treated as reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The group in developing a new rule for recommendation shall consider all matters it shall deem helpful including existing Michigan statutes and court rules, the Federal court rules and the American Bar' Association Standards. In addition, attached as an appendix is a set of guidelines for consideration.

In the first six months of 1971, this Court heard argument on a total of 37 criminal cases. Of those 37 cases, 6, or 16%, concerned the validity of guilty pleas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b383-12\"> This case is one of the quartette of <em>People </em>v. <em>Rufus Williams </em>(1971), 386 Mich 277, <em>People </em>v. <em>Jaworski </em>(1972), 387 Mich 21, <em>People </em>v. <em>Butler </em>(1972), 387 Mich 1 and <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1971), 396 Mich 305. Together they consider the principal rules of law relating to the taking of guilty pleas. <em>Williams </em>relates more particularly to the requirement that the trial judge ascertain the factual basis of the alleged crime to which the defendant is pleading guilty, especially in light of <em>People </em>v. <em>Barrows </em>(1959), 358 Mich 267. <em>Jaworski </em>deals with whether the plea was <em>understanding </em>made, more specifically with whether the defendant was adequately advised of his rights so that his guilty plea constitutionally waived them. <em>Jaworski </em>also considers the general implications of <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(1969), 395 US 238 (89 S Ct 1709, 23 L Ed 2d 274). <em>Butler </em>is a <em>pre-Boykin </em>case. Its main point is whether substantial compliance requires advising defendant of substantially all of his rights or substantially advising defendant of all his rights. <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>main consideration is whether the guilty plea was <em>voluntarily </em>made, more specifically whether it was made without <em>duress </em>or <em>promise of leniency. </em>It also deals with the <em>Boykin </em>challenge. Procedurally, since <em>Johnson\u2019s main </em>point is not a guilty plea record matter, <em>Johnson </em>also considers how and when such review should be handled.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-13\">These cases also conclude that the state of the law on this subject and the general understanding of the law leaves much to be desired. The Supreme Court is setting up a committee to consider the whole matter and recommend clarifying and definitive rules to be strictly followed after adoption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b384-9\"> <em>Williams </em>relies on the assistant prosecuting attorney at the taking of the guilty plea relating to the court in defendant\u2019s presence the facts of defendant\u2019s participation in the alleged crime. This is to establish the existence of such crime and defendant\u2019s participation therein in satisfaction of Rule 35A. Since the colloquy began with the judge inquiring \u201cWhat, roughly, are the facts,\u201d the judge was in effect personally examining the defendant as per <em>Barrows. </em>(A similar procedure was followed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Butler </em>[1972], 387 Mich 1. See Appendix I. In that case the judge buttoned up the matter by asking \u201cWhat you have told your attorney is the truth.\u201d) Our decision in <em>Williams </em>since it relies on the inquiry at the taking of the guilty plea rather than the testimony at the preliminary examination is distinguishable from <em>People </em>v. <em>Zaleski </em>(1965), 375 Mich 71, 81, where Justice Souris indicates disapproval of the practice \u201cwith regard to the trial judge\u2019s quoted assertions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>that he had read the examination testimony and had no question in his mind concerning defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AKv\">Logically if complete reliance is allowed on the case made at the preliminary examination, there would be little need for Rule 35A\u2019s requirement of the judge examining the defendant \u201cfor the purpose of establishing the crime and the participation therein of the person pleading guilty\u201d because that is substantially what the examining magistrate seeks to establish, although the examining magistrate need only establish probable cause. However, neither operation is a trial of guilt or innocene.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar-\">This Court\u2019s decision, therefore, does not rely, as the Court of Appeals does, on the strong testimony at the preliminary examination but on the testimony at the plea taking.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b385-9\"> The facts in <em>Williams </em>certainly are sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the later case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Stearns </em>(1968), 380 Mich 704.

Mr. Justice White, writing for the majority, summarized the arguments in support of guilty pleas as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-9\">\u201cFor a defendant who sees slight possibility of acquittal, the advantages of pleading guilty and limiting the probable penalty are obvious \u2014his exposure is reduced, the correctional processes can begin immediately, and the practical burdens of a trial are eliminated. For the State there are also advantages\u2014the more promptly imposed punishment after an admission of guilt may more effectively attain the objectives of punishment; and with the avoidance of trial, scarce judicial and prosecutorial resources are conserved for those cases in which there is a substantial issue of the defendant\u2019s guilt or in which there is substantial doubt that the State can sustain its burden of proof. It is this mutuality of advantage that perhaps explains the fact at present over three-fourths of the criminal convictions in this country rest on pleas of guilty, a great many of them no doubt motivated at least in part by the hope or assurance of a lesser penalty that might be imposed if there were a guilty verdict after a trial to judge or jury.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) 397 US 742, 752.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">See also American Bar Assoc.

The defendant in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ferguson </em>(1882), 48 Mich 41, contended that in accepting his plea of guilty the trial judge had not conducted a proper examination. In affirming the conviction, this Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-12\">\u201cNow the validity of a sentence does not require that it should appear of record in what particular manner the judge may have proceeded to satisfy himself that the prisoner acted knowingly and freely in pleading guilty. The record may imply that the sense of the statute was complied with, or it may imply the contrary, and we have had one case where the record was so equivocal that a <em>certiorari </em>was issued to secure a return from the judge relative to his action in reference to the statute. <em>Edwards v.

In affirming the conviction, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">\u201cPER CURIAM. The only error relied upon in this case is that the circuit judge did not, after receiving the respondent\u2019s plea of guilty, make the necessary examination to enable him to determine that the plea was freely and intelligently made. The error is not satisfactorily made out. The respondent first pleaded not guilty, and the record shows that he had counsel, and after three weeks\u2019 delay came into court and by leave of the court withdrew the first plea and pleaded guilty. <em>It affirmatively appears that the judge made inquiry </em>to satisfy himself -that this action expressed the respondent\u2019s real desire, and there can be no assumption under the facts stated that he had acted in ignorance or under compulsion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">\u201cJudgment affirmed.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) 48 Mich 353.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">The trial court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Lepper </em>(1883), 51 Mich 196, made no inquiry of the defendant as to his alleged offense. The trial judge had, however, discussed the defendant\u2019s criminal actions with the under-sheriff and with the defendant\u2019s wife. In affirming the conviction obtained by guilty plea, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">\u201cIn this case it would have been more satisfactory to us had the record furnished more of the particulars of the investigation made by the circuit judge before pronouncing sentence. Still, there appears to have been no undue haste in the matter, and the facts stated in the return, we think, bring the case clearly within the previous rulings of this Court. <em>Henning </em>v. <em>People </em>[1879] 40 Mich 733; <em>Bayliss </em>v. <em>People </em>[1881] 46 Mich 221; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>People </em>[1880] 44 Mich 308; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ferguson </em>[1882] 48 Mich 41.\u201d 51 Mich 196, 199.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">The defendant in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ellsworth </em>(1888), 68 Mich 496, argued on appeal that the record did not indicate a proper examination had been conducted by the trial court when the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty to the crime of larceny was accepted. Though vacating a portion of the defendant\u2019s sentence on other grounds, this Court affirmed the conviction by guilty plea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-11\">\u201cAs to the seeond objection to the sentence, <em>we think the presumption from the record is that the circuit judge performed his duty under the statute. </em>The record shows that the respondent was assigned able counsel of his own choice, and had consultation with him before entering his plea of guilty.

Counsel is in the best position due to his initial contact with the defendant, his duty to advise the defendant and ideally his relationship of trust with the defendant to weigh the merits of defendant\u2019s case and to inform the defendant of his constitutional right to a day in court where his guilt must be proven. It is unrealistic to expect that questions by a judge in open court personally directed to the defendant will alone safeguard the defendant\u2019s constitutional right and deter false pleas of guilty. The trial bench needs the cooperation of the Bar if these objectives of the court rule on the taking of guilty pleas are to be obtained. As officers of the court and advocates for their clients, members of the Bar have a vested interest in maintaining the integrity and fairness of the criminal justice system.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
