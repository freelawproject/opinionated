These dates considered, it is possible that the Sixth Circuit opinion of <em>Bentley </em>v. <em>United States, </em>431 F2d 250, decided September 2,1970, was not brought to the attention of Division 2 prior to release of its cited opinion. <em>Bentley </em>at least is not mentioned either in the majority or minority opinion below.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Since <em>Bentley </em>furnishes what to me is sufficient guidance so far as Mr. Cross\u2019 Federal constitutional rights are concerned, I hold that the majority below erred in ruling as it did (pp 345, 346):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">\u201cAdmittedly, there is no decision of the United States Supreme Court, nor of either appellate court of this state, which specifically deals with the rights of an indigent seeking leave to take a delayed appeal from his conviction under the provisions of GrCR 1963, 803.3, and GrCK. 1963, 806.4(2), or under any like provisions in any other state. This is undoubtedly because the Michigan provision for delayed appeal is <em>sui generis. </em>However, considering the wide range of post-conviction situations in which the United States Supreme Court had held that denial of a transcript constitutes denial of equal protection of the laws, we cannot say that the Michigan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>provision for delayed appeal does not come within the ambit of the <em>Griffin </em>principle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">In the absence of any overriding decision of the United States Supreme Court, this state is free to set as it has done a fair time limit upon each and every constitutionally provided (Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 20) \u201cappeal as a matter of right\u201d. That this state has done. Judge Holbrook was therefore right when he concluded (p 352):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\">\u201cDefendant having not complied with the General Court Rules nor having cited any case in the United States Supreme Court directly in point requiring the state to furnish transcripts and records to a defendant under similar circumstances, I would rule as did the trial court and affirm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Now for <em>Bentley. </em>The opinion commences (p 251):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">\u201cThe sole question posed by this appeal is whether or not appellant is entitled to be furnished a copy of the transcript of his trial in order to search for as yet unasserted grounds for filing a motion for postconviction relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (1964). Appellant relies for an affirmative answer upon <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>351 U.S. 12, 76 S. Ct. 585, 100 L. Ed. 891 (1955), and its progeny.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">It concludes (p 254):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\">\u201cWe conclude that if the Supreme Court desires now to hold that a prior showing of need cannot constitutionally be made a requisite for a free transcript for an indigent who desires to file a \u00a7 2255 petition, this case affords a wholly appropriate vehicle to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-10\">\u201cIf this decision is made affirmatively, Congressional appropriations will be required to finance some considerable expansion of the reportorial and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>stenographic services available to the District Courts. Our Circuit can, of course, decide the right to transcripts. But under the existing shortage of reportorial and secretarial services in this Circuit, we cannot deliver many of them. It seems appropriate to us under these circumstances to adhere to this Circuit\u2019s past decisions until and unless the Supreme Court invalidates on constitutional grounds the existing issue and need requirements of the statute set forth above.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">February 22, 1971 the Supreme Court denied <em>Bentley\u2019s </em>petition for certiorari to review the judgment of the Sixth Circuit, 401 US 920 (91 S Ct 907, 27 L Ed 2d 823). Recognizing that the denial of certiorari \u201cimports no expression of opinion upon the merits of the case, as the bar has been told many times.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Carver </em>[1923], 260 US 482, 490 [43 S Ct 181, 67 L Ed 361]), I conclude that the opinion of the Sixth Circuit with its invitation to employ <em>Bentley </em>as \u201ca wholly appropriate vehicle,\u201d coupled with the Supreme Court\u2019s turn-down of that invitation, leaves the courts of the states free to apply their own wholesome processes to cases of instant nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Until we are told otherwise, there is no good reason why this Court should decree that a procrastinating indigent convict may, without deign of exposition aimed either at the merits or proffer of excuse for delay, receive at public expense the free delivery of copies of records pertaining to his conviction. When the rich must resort to Rule 806.2 <em>et seq. </em>for relief after having failed to review on time, so must the indigent do so. Our only obligation is to see that both are treated alike without regard for the availability of cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The sum of all this is that Mr. Cross has been denied no constitutional right. He, no more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>the dallying millionaire convict, may pnt public officers and employees to work preparing copies solely for his whim. Let both show merit under GCR 1963, 806.3 and no culpable negligence under GCR 1963, 806.4 and each on the basis of repeated judicial assurances may expect equal justice, <em>under law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">I would reverse with remand for entry of judgment upholding the order of the circuit court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b343-7\">T. E. Brennan and Swainson, JJ., concurred with Black, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
