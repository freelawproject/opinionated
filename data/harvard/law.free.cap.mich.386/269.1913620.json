After being bound over, a plea of not guilty was entered for him on July 22, 1965, and a trial date of August 31, 1965, was set. The defendant was free on bond until August 24, 1965, when he was arrested for a separate, unrelated charge of breaking and entering.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">On August 31, 1965, the defendant\u2019s trial on the first charge of breaking and entering, the one involved in this appeal, was adjourned until October 13, 1965, due to the fact that \u201cNo Court available for jury.\u201d On October 13, 1965, the defendant\u2019s attorney was permitted to withdraw, and a new trial date of October 21, 1965, was set. The trial date was again adjourned on October 21, 1965, until December 7, 1965. The reason given for this adjournment was \u201cTry other pending case first.\u201d On December 7, 1965, the case was adjourned until January 24, 1966, with no reason given.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Meanwhile, the defendant was convicted of the second charge of breaking and entering on December 16, 1965, and sentenced to a term of five to ten years imprisonment. Subsequently the trial on the first charge was again adjourned on January 24, 1966, with the reason given as \u201cdef. sentenced in another case\u2014adj. till appeal time expires.\u201d The defendant filed a claim of appeal from his other conviction on March 9, 1966, and on April 15, 1966, the trial of the first charge was adjourned until June 2, 1966, with no reason given for the adjournment. Trial on the first charge finally commenced on June 2, 1966, the defendant was convicted as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>charged, and a sentence of not less than 9, nor more than 10 years imprisonment was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The defendant\u2019s application for leave to file delayed appeal was denied by the Court of Appeals. This Court granted the defendant\u2019s delayed application for leave to appeal on November 24, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The United States and Michigan Constitutions both require that a criminal defendant be given a speedy trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">\u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, * * * \u201d. United States Constitution, Amendment 6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-9\">\u201cSec. 20. In every criminal prosecution, the accused shall have the right to a speedy and public trial <em>* * * \u201d </em>Michigan Constitution, Article 1, \u00a720.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">Michigan statutory provisions require defendants to be given a speedy trial, and allow continuances only when strict necessity is shown on the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-11\">\u201c768.1 <em>Speedy trial; right of parties, duty of public officers. </em>Sec. 1. The people of this state and persons charged with crime are entitled to and shall have a speedy trial and determination of all prosecutions and it is hereby made the duty of all public officers having duties to perform in any criminal case, to bring such case to a final determination without delay except as may be necessary to secure to the accused a fair and impartial trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-12\">\u201c768.2 <em>Criminal cases; precedence, adjournment, continuance. </em>Sec. 2. The trial of criminal cases shall take precedence over all other cases; but this provision shall not be interpreted to mean that trials of civil cases shall not be interspersed between trials of criminal cases triable before a jury at any term of court. <em>No adjournments, continuances or delays of criminal causes shall be granted by any court except for good cause shown </em>in the manner pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>vided by law for adjournments, continuances and delays in the trial of civil causes in courts of record: <em>Provided, That no court shall adjourn, continue or delay the trial of any criminal cause by the consent of the prosecution and accused unless in his discretion it shall clearly appear by a sufficient showing to said court to be entered upon the record, that the reasons for such consent are founded upon strict necessity and that the trial of said cause cannot be then had without a manifest injustice being done.\u201d </em>MCLA \u00a7\u00a7 768.1, 768.2 (Stat Ann 1954 Rev \u00a7\u00a7 28.1024, 28.1025). (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">GrCR 1963, 503.1 also states the grounds for granting a continuance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">\u201cRule 503 <em>Continuances.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">.1 Policy. It is the policy of this rule to encourage the diligent preparation and trial of cases. Continuance for any cause shall not be granted unless a showing is made and the court finds that the grounds for continuance do not arise out of the fault or negligence of the moving party and the court finds that substantial justice more nearly will be obtained.\u201d GrCR 1963, 503.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The right to a speedy trial means right to trial within a reasonable time. As we stated in <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Judge of Recorder\u2019s Court of Detroit </em>(1926), 236 Mich 689, 690:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">\u201cIn view of this constitutional provision it becomes necessary to inquire what a speedy trial means. We apprehend it means such reasonable time under all the attendant circumstances as will give the people an opportunity to present its case in court. 16 C. J. p. 439. A speedy trial does not mean that the defendant is entitled to have his trial commence immediately after being bound over to the trial court. What would be a reasonable time in one case would be perhaps unreasonable in another.\u201d 236 Mich 689, 690.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>In the instant case, 12 months and 9 days elapsed between the date of the defendant\u2019s arraignment and the date that his trial commenced. During that period, his trial date was adjourned on a total of six separate occasions. No reason whatsoever was given for two of those adjournments.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">As noted above, MCLA \u00a7 768.2 (Stat Ann 1954 Rev \u00a7 28.1025) requires that continuances in criminal cases be granted only \u201cfor good cause shown\u201d. In appeals arising from future trials, this Court will view with great concern adjournments which are not supported by good cause shown on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The adjournment of the case on January 24, 1966, is of the greatest concern to this Court. The reason given for that adjournment was \u201cdef. sentenced in another case\u2014adj. till appeal time expires.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Pursuant thereto the defendant in this case was advised by his attorney in a letter that the remaining charge against him of breaking and entering would be dismissed if the defendant did not file an appeal from his other conviction.* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>filed such an appeal, a new trial date was set for him on the other charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">An adjournment of one case with notice it would be dismissed if a defendant did not appeal a second case is not good cause for continuance. Furthermore it is constitutionally obnoxious. Such action serves to chill the exercise of a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to appeal a criminal conviction and will not be tolerated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The people argue that the defendant waived his right to a speedy trial by failing to demand trial or to move to have the charge against him dismissed. This Court has always preserved its right to consider serious errors even in the absence of objection by the party who appeals. Then Justice, now Chief Justice, Thomas M. Kavanagh explained this exercise of supervisory control in <em>People </em>v. <em>Dorrikas </em>(1958), 354 Mich 303, 316:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">\u201cOrdinarily where no timely objection was made to the introduction of such testimony and no re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>quest to charge was made, this Court would not examine the points relied upon for reversal, and except under unusual circumstances we have no disposition to relax this rule. Nevertheless, as in a number of previous cases, this Court, in the exercise of supervisory control over all litigation, has often asserted the right to consider manifest and serious errors although objection was not made by the party who appeals. The inherent power of this Court to prevent fundamental injustice is not limited by what appellant is entitled to as a matter of right. <em>People </em>v. <em>Steeneck </em>[1929], 247 Mich 583; <em>People </em>v. <em>Holmes </em>[1940], 292 Mich 212; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kelsey </em>[1942], 303 Mich 715.\u201d 354 Mich 303, 316.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The instant case is a proper one for our exercise of this supervisory control.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">We also hold today that a motion for speedy trial or for having the charge against him dismissed on the part of the defendant is not necessary when the stated reason for the adjournment of the trial date serves to chill the exercise of a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to appeal a criminal conviction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">In passing, we note that the defendant\u2019s allegation that the trial court had no jurisdiction over him at the time of his conviction is without merit. MCLA \u00a7 780.133 (Stat Ann 1971 Cum Supp \u00a7 28.969 [3]) requires an inmate of the Department of Corrections charged with another offense to be tried on that charge within 180 days. If such trial does not occur within 180 days, the trial court no longer has jurisdiction over the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">The defendant in the instant case was delivered to the Department of Corrections on January 27, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>1966. The 180-day period could not begin to run prior to that time. <em>People </em>v. <em>Castelli </em>(1963), 370 Mich 147. Since the defendant\u2019s trial on the other charge commenced on June 2, 1966, only 129 days had elapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Reversed. New trial granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b377-6\">T. M.

And the very threat inherent in the existence of such a punitive policy would, with respect to those still in prison, serve to \u2018chill the exercise of basic constitutional rights.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 582. See also <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California </em>[1965], 380 US 609 [85 S Ct 1229, 14 L Ed 2d 106]; <em>cf. Johnson </em>v. <em>Avery </em>[1969], 393 US 483 [89 S Ct 747, 21 L Ed 718]. But even if the first conviction has been set aside for nonconstitutional error, the imposition of a penalty upon the defendant for having successfully pursued a statutory right of appeal or collateral remedy would be no less a violation of due process of law. \u2018A new sentence, with enhanced punishment, based upon such a reason, would be a flagrant violation of the rights of the defendant.\u2019 <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>United States </em>[CA8, 1901], 106 F. 672, 679. A court is \u2018without right to * * * put a price on an appeal.
