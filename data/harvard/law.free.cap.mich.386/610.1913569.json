J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALg\">Plaintiff was employed by defendant from November 11, 1935, until July 1, 1966, during which time, as conceded by both parties, plaintiff was exposed to foundry dust. Beginmng as early as 1947, plaintiff periodically received X-ray examinations which in later years revealed that plaintiff had developed silicosis. He was apparently so advised in 1960 by defendant\u2019s clinic. Plaintiff nevertheless continued doing the same type of work.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">In May of 1966, plaintiff requested early retirement and at his retirement interview on May 11, 1966, he cited as his reasons for submitting such request the factors of his age of 62, his known sili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>cosis condition and his desire to add a year or two to his life by leaving the dusty work environment to which he had been subjected. He, however, indicated that otherwise he felt fit to continue working. Plaintiff was thereupon allowed early retirement effective July 1, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">On November 1, 1966 (124 days after plaintiff\u2019s last day of work), the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Department received plaintiff\u2019s application for compensation. Plaintiff therein claimed disablement due to silicosis contracted from years of exposure to foundry dust.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The hearing referee found disablement as of plaintiff\u2019s last day of work (June 30, 1966) and awarded compensation accordingly. Defendant appealed the award, contending plaintiff had not established disability and further that his claim was barred by the provisions of MCLA 417.10; MSA 17.229<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> requiring that notice be given the employer within 120 days after disablement. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board affirmed the hearing referee\u2019s award in a 4r-3 decision, the dissenters discussing principally the issue of timely notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal was denied by the Court of Appeals on May 11, 1970. Appellant is here on leave granted. 384 Mich 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">We now review the one issue raised:</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">Whether plaintiff gave timely \u201cnotice\u201d to his employer of disablement or disability within the meaning of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by advising his employer that he desired early retirement due to his silicosis condition?</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">As we said in <em>Whitley </em>v <em>Chrysler Corp, </em>373 Mich 469, 472 (1964), this right of the employer to timely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>notice is a substantial right, the purpose of which is to provide an opportunity to inquire into the alleged injury while the facts are accessible. See, also, <em>Banks </em>v <em>Packard Motor Car Co, </em>328 Mich 513 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">However, as indicated in <em>Krzewinski </em>v <em>Robert Gage Coal Co, </em>304 Mich 63, 68 (1942), \u201cno niceties of expression are required, provided the employer has actual notice\u201d. Further, in <em>Littleton </em>v <em>Grand Trunk R Co, </em>276 Mich 41 (1936), we held that though such notice may be oral or written, it must reasonably inform the employer of the compensable incident. It is not sufficient that the employee states in casual conversation that he does not feel well and wonders if an injury, vaguely referred to, might be the cause. There must be more. The employer must be informed not only as to the incident (whether injury by accident or disease), but also that disability has resulted therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Defendant maintains that <em>Tomasini </em>v <em>Youngstown Mines Corp, </em>366 Mich 503 (1962), is controlling here. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">In <em>Tomasim </em>we vacated a compensation award because there was no evidence of any notice given the employer within the applicable period of limitations. Thus, mindful of the legislative restraint imposed upon our review of such cases,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we found a clear error of law; there was <em>no </em>factual basis for the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">We have specifically held that a finding of timely notice by the Appeal Board, supported by a factual basis on the record, will be binding upon us even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>our perspective of the facts would lead us to a contrary result. <em>Coates </em>v <em>Continental Motors Corp, </em>373 Mich 461, 466 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">We now reiterate the characterizations of our appellate function in such cases, as set forth in <em>Thornton </em>v <em>Luria-Dumes Co-Venture, </em>347 Mich 160, 162 (1956), initially quoting from <em>Meyers </em>v <em>Michigan Central R Co, </em>199 Mich 134, 137, 138 (1917):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-5\">\u201c\u2018[T]his Court does not review the findings of fact of the hoard, except to determine whether there is any evidence to support the award. The evidence may not he direct; it may be circumstantial. The board not only passes on the credibility of witnesses, but draws its inferences from the circumstances and the facts which it finds established. We may reverse awards for a failure of evidence to support them, hut we are not the triers of the facts. With this view in mind, we approach the consideration of this case.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\">\u201cOur jurisdiction, invoked upon issuance and return of certiorari to the workmen\u2019s compensation department, is markedly limited. The writ brings us questions of law only. It does not permit scale-weight of evidence and inference here, as on appeals from circuit court judgments, to determine whether administrative findings of fact offend rules governing clear weight and preponderance. Our obligation is to accept, without question, findings that are certified here if there he any evidence whatever to sustain those findings, regardless of thought or suggestion addressed to improbability thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">In the instant case, unlike <em>Tomasini, supra, </em>we do find from the facts and circumstances, and permissible inferences drawn therefrom, a basis for the conclusion of the Appeal Board. The factors of premature retirement, knowledge of plaintiff\u2019s medical history, and plaintiff\u2019s explicit citation of silicosis as the basis for his request for premature retirement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>constituted notice to defendant and provided an adequate basis for the Appeal Board\u2019s finding that defendant was timely notified of plaintiff\u2019s disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Having so found, we exhaust our power of review here.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Accordingly, plaintiff\u2019s award is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b716-6\">Adams, T. E. Brennan, T. Gr. Kavanagh, Swain-son, and Williams, JJ., concurred with T. M. Kavanagh, C. J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-11\">Now MCLA 418.441; MSA 17.237(441), which embodies the same provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b713-12\"> 1912 PA (1st Ex Sess) 10, as amended (MOLA 411.1 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 17.141 <em>et </em>seq.).\u2014Reporter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b714-10\">MCLA 418.861; MSA 17.237(861) provides: \u201cThe findings of fact made by the board acting within its powers, in the absence of fraud, shall be conclusive.

Plaintiff was not required to claim compensation at that time but did have to make his claim in six months for it to be valid. Thus he did, well within six months.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">Proof in <em>Tomasini, </em>no counterpart of which appears in this record, was quoted by footnote on page 505 of Tomasini\u2019s report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>\u201cPlaintiff testified:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-3\">\u201c <em>\u2018Q. </em>We have to ask you these questions for the record. During the time before you quit the mine did you ever talk to Mr. Purpich [plaintiff\u2019s foreman] about having these troubles, you yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-4\">\u201c <em>\u2018A. </em>No. I didn\u2019t mention to nobody. I going to quit I tell them, that\u2019s all.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-5\">\u201cThe testimony of Mr. Purpich was to the identical effect; that plaintiff quit without complaint and \u2018told me he was going on pension.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">This is not all. In <em>Tomasim </em>the plaintiff\u2019s medical witness, Dr. Martinetti, did not come through for him on the pivotal issue, that is, the \u201cdate of disablement\u201d. For details, see <em>Tomasim </em>at 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">For these reasons I concur in affirmance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
