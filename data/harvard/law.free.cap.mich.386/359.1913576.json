Kavanagh correctly observes the decision in this case turns on the construction of \u00a7 11 of the municipal housing facilities act, PA 1933 (Ex Sess), No 18, \u00a711 (MCLA \u00a7 125.661; Stat Ann 1969 Rev \u00a7 5.3021); \u00a711 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">\u201cAll deeds, contracts, leases, or purchases entered into by the commission shall be in the name of the city or village and shall be approved by the governing body of said city or village. Contracts for the purchase of necessary materials, leases with tenants and options need not be so approved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">The Flint Housing Commission had been duly authorized and organized pursuant to the municipal housing facilities act. As far as this case goes, the Housing Commission had processed through the Federal Government and had taken other steps with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>respect to a proposal plaintiff had submitted to construct a turn-key project.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The issue engendering this case arose when the Housing Commission submitted to the City Commission certain contracts to help the Housing Commission carry out steps it had to take to be in a position to bring the proposal to fruition and the City Commission voted to drop the project without giving any reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The issue revolves around an interpretation of \u201cshall be approved\u201d. Does this mean, as plaintiff contends, that the city must automatically \u201crubber stamp\u201d the Housing Commission\u2019s desired action? Or does it mean, as the City Commission contends, that the city must exercise its discretion and approve or disapprove?</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The normal meaning of \u201capprove\u201d with relation to government action implies the power to disapprove. For example, the language \u201cshall be approved by the local legislative body\u201d in \u00a7 17 of The Michigan Liquor Control Act, MCLA \u00a7 436.17 (Stat Ann 1971 Rev \u00a7 18.988), is recognized as requiring exercise of discretion. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Grand Rapids </em>(CA6, 1966), 356 F2d 276, 285 <em>et seq.; cert den </em>(1966), 385 US 838 (87 S Ct 84, 17 L Ed 2d 71). See generally 6 CJS 127 \u201cApprove\u201d and \u201cApproved\u201d : discretion not necessarily implied but normally is. ;</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Furthermore, \u00a7 11 of the municipal housing facilities act clearly suggests that with respect to certain lesser transactions it is not going to bother the City Council (\u201cContracts for the purchase of necessary materials, leases with tenants and options need not be so approved\u201d). However, with respect to \u201cAll deeds, contracts, leases, or purchases entered into by the commission\u201d, the Michigan legislature specifies, \u201cshall be in the name of the city or village and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>shall be approved by the governing body of said city or village\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Does this mean the legislature thought the City Commission should rubber stamp the transactions described in the first sentence but did not have to be bothered with the second?</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">We do not think so.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The Michigan municipal housing facilities act is quite different from those in California, Montana and New Jersey concerning which my brother Justice Thomas G. Kavanagh quotes Court decisions. In fact, counsel for the City Commission claims in many respects the Michigan legislation is <em>sui generis. </em>Whether that is true or not, the three jurisdictions relied on by my brother do seem to be part of a pattern from which Michigan is quite distinct.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Michigan is a strong home-rule state. Our constitution recognizes basic local authority. Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 22. Legislation grants liberal powers. MCLA \u00a7 117.4j (Stat Ann 1949 Rev \u00a7 5.2083); <em>Conroy </em>v. <em>Battle Creek, </em>(1946), 314 Mich 210, 221. The dignity and power of a city commission cannot be lightly construed away.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">In addition to leaving the power to approve certain important transactions under the power of the City Commission in \u00a7 11, the legislature also left the power of eminent domain in the City Commission under \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">A significant reason for all of this becomes evident in tying together the first part of the first sentence of \u00a7 11 with other parts of the municipal housing facilities act. The critical words are \u201cAll deeds, contracts, leases or purchases entered into by the commission <em>shall he in the name of the city * * * </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>The purpose behind all this becomes clear when examined in the light of later sections which make clear that revenue bonds to finance the housing projects are issued in the name of the city, not the Housing Commission (\u00a7\u00a716, 17.) The city also has the power to borrow money to develop housing projects. (\u00a7\u00a747, 48.) In other words the legislature wanted to increase the saleability of housing revenue bonds by having them issued in the name of the city and likewise improve the credit of the obligor on the important transaction contracts specified in the first sentence of \u00a7 11 by involving the city itself. This is why the legislature reserved the right to and imposed the duty of approval upon the City Commission. To do otherwise would be to give the Housing Commission a book of blank checks to write against the good name of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">In California, Montana and New Jersey the Housing Commissions have considerably more authority than in Michigan. Por example, in California, Montana, and New Jersey the commissioners can be dismissed only for misconduct after notice and hearing (41A West\u2019s Cal Code Ann \u00a7 34282; 3 RCM 35-108; NJSA 55:14A-6). In Michigan the commissioners may at any time be removed by the appointing authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">More to the point, in California the Housing Authority may contract for services (41A West\u2019s Cal Code Ann \u00a7 34314) and may \u201c(C) Purchase, lease, obtain option upon, acquire by gift, grant, bequest, devise, or otherwise any real or personal property or any interest in property.\u201d <em>(Id, </em>\u00a7 34315.) The same is essentially true in Montana (3 RCM 35-109) and in New Jersey (NJSA 55: 14A-7 [c] and [d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">California, Montana and New Jersey commissioners have the right of eminent domain and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>issue their own bonds (41A West\u2019s Cal Code Ann \u00a7 34325 and \u00a7 34350; 3 RCM 35-109, 35-111 and 35-114; NJSA 55.44A-10 and 5544A-12).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">As already indicated because of difference in statutory authority the cases of <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Los Angeles </em>(1952), 38 Cal 2d 853 (243 P2d 515), <em>State ex rel. Great Falls Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Great Falls </em>(1940), 110 Mont 318 (100 P2d 915), and <em>City of Paterson v. Housing Authority of Paterson </em>(1967), 96 NJ Super 394 (233 A2d 98) are distinguished. In some, other facts as well are different as in the Los Angeles case the city had already approved the contract once.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The legislature by word and intention provided that the City Commission has the authority and responsibility to exercise its discretion in approving transactions of the nature described in the first sentence of \u00a7 11. The Housing Commission was granted by the legislature broad powers to construct, maintain, and operate housing projects without supervision. Sections 27, 44, 44b among others. But the legislature did reserve to the City Commission certain responsibilities, and authority, one segment of which (\u00a7 11) was in question here.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Answering the ringing words of Franklin Delano Roosevelt \u201cI see one-third of the nation ill-housed, ill-clad and ill-nourished\u201d the Michigan legislature in its wisdom provided this method to meet the crying human need of low cost housing. It is clear that they assumed that those elected by the people to represent them would be the most solicitous and most concerned about their welfare, and being nearest the people would exercise their judgment with understanding and compassion. Furthermore, where the representatives of the people in a democracy are untrue to their trust, then the people have the sacred right to substitute those who will.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>The trial court is reversed.

Kavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AR7\"><em>(dissenting). </em>Defendant Flint Housing Commission (hereinafter called Housing Commission) was established by Ordinance No. 1788 passed by the Flint City Commission (hereinafter called City) on July 27, 1964 pursuant to PA 1933 (Ex Sess), No 18 (MCLA \u00a7 125.651 <em>et seq.; </em>Stat Ann 1969 Rev \u00a7 5.3011 <em>et seq.) </em>known as the municipal housing facilities statute. The Ordinance provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">\u201cSaid Flint Housing Commission shall have all the powers and duties vested or permitted to be vested in housing commissions by said Act No. 18, of the Extra Session of 1933, as heretofore or hereafter amended, and any laws heretofore or hereafter enacted which are supplemental thereto, it being the intention of this ordinance to vest in the Flint Housing Commission all powers and duties permitted by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Pursuant to the low-rent housing act, 42 TTSCA \u00a7 1401 <em>et seq. </em>the Housing Commission entered into a cooperation agreement with the City in December of 1967. The resolution said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">\u201cWHEREAS, the Municipality, acting by and through the Commission, shall endeavor to secure one or more contracts with the PHA for loans and annual contributions in connection with the development and administration of such low-rent housing projects, all pursuant to the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended * * * .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>In December of 1968 the Housing Commission, as empowered by state statute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2and authorized ordinance, accepted plaintiff\u2019s proposal to construct a turn-key project for the elderly upon land purchased for that purpose. Plaintiff is a housing developer. The proposal was designated Project 9-11. The proposal was also submitted to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for approval in accordance with their rules. They likewise accepted the proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">In April and May of 1969 the Housing Commission submitted contracts for the hiring of cost estimators, appraisers and architect inspector<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and an annual contributions contract<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to the City for its approval as required under 42 USCA \u00a7 1415(7).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>On July 14, 1969 the City voted to drop Project 9-11 without assigning any reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Plaintiff filed a complaint for mandamus in the Genesee County Circuit Court arguing that the City\u2019s function as to Project 9-11 was limited exclusively to ministerial approval of the Housing Commission\u2019s contracts. The trial judge agreed with plaintiff and granted mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Defendants filed a claim of appeal and a motion for stay of proceedings. The trial court granted the stay. We granted plaintiff\u2019s application for leave to appeal prior to decision of the Court of Appeals pursuant to GGR 1963, 852.1 because of the importance of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The basic question involved may be stated: \u201cIs the City\u2019s approval of housing project contracts entered into by the Housing Commission a ministerial duty requiring no exercise of discretion?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">We hold it is for the reasons hereinafter set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">We are indebted to the Center for Urban Law and Housing, Wayne County Neighborhood Legal Services, for the brief Amicus Curiae which was filed with our permission. It helps set the perspective for determination of this controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">In that brief we are reminded of the public policy behind the state and Federal legislation of alleviating the misery attendant upon inadequate housing of our people. If any be unaware of the extent of the housing crisis, reference to the reports cited in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>the Amicus briefs <em>(The Report of the President\u2019s Committee on Urban Housing, A Decent Home. </em>[1969] ; 2 <em>United States Bureau of the Census, </em>Department of Commerce, <em>Census of Housing </em>[1960]; <em>Michigan\u2019s Housing Conditions, </em>Office of Planning Coordinator, Bureau of Policies and Programs [1970] will be most informative).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Our decision turns on the construction of \u00a7 11 of the housing act which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-7\">\u201cAll deeds, contracts, leases, or purchases entered into by the commission shall be in the name of the city or village and shall be approved by the governing body of said city or village. Contracts for the purchase of necessary materials, leases with tenants and options need not be so approved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">The trial judge read this to require the city commission to approve the contracts here involved as a matter of form\u2014a ministerial duty only, and issued his mandamus to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">The City argues that \u201capproval\u201d normally entails discretion and includes the right to disapprove.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">While this precise question has never been decided in Michigan, the decisions of our sister states that have considered it support the suggestion that we should regard the provisions as a matter of form.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">In <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Los Angeles </em>(1952), 38 Cal 2d 853 (243 P2d 515) the question of the Housing Commission\u2019s authority to effectuate slum clearance was sustained. In this case, the Court, having-found the city by resolution had created the Housing Authority and had entered into a cooperation agreement as required by the Federal act refused to vacate certain streets and deed land acquired for the project, affirmed the grant of mandamus in favor of plaintiff. In its opinion the Court observed the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>\u201cEach functioning body, the city and the housing authority, is a separate body politic vested with specific duties and powers under the Housing Authorities Law and Housing Cooperation Law to effect a state objective. Neither is functioning independently of that state law. In pursuing the state objective each is governed by the state law and neither may exercise powers not vested or recognized by that law. The city and the housing authority function as administrative arms of the state in pursuing the state concern and effecting the legislative objective.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">\u201cThe city acted within its discretion in determining the local need for the functioning of the housing authority created by the state act. All considerations of wisdom, policy and desirability connected with the functioning of a housing authority in the city of Los Angeles became settled and have been resolved adversely to the adherents of the city\u2019s present position by the actions of the state and of the city in declaring the existence of the need. Upon the formation of the housing authority the state laiv thereupon and thereafter controlled the city and the housing authority and no other law concerning the acquisition, operation or disposition of property is applicable to the authority except as specifically provided. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 34320.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">\u201cIn enacting the Housing Authorities Law and the Housing Cooperation Law the Legislature did not take from the city all power to act in connection with housing projects under the statute. <em>The city was given discretionary power to determine initially the need for the housing authority to function and to give approval of a proposed project. </em>The city was also vested with discretionary powers to be exercised pursuant to the cooperation agreement which is required under the federal act. (42 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1415(7)(b).) <em>But having taken the initial discretionary action to bring the housing authority into operation and having approved a project and entered into a cooperation agreement, there was </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number><em>nothing left to he done hy either contracting party hut to perform administratively whatever was necessary to carry the agreement into effect.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Similarly, in <em>State ex rel. Great Falls Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Great Falls </em>(1940), 110 Mont 318 (100 P2d 915) defendant city refused to rezone in conformity with the cooperation agreement entered into with plaintiff. In sustaining the mandamus complaint against defendant city the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">\u201cThe city council of the city of Great Falls, since it regularly authorized the creation of the Great Falls Housing Authority, must comply with the provisions of the Act in so far as their co-operation is required. This is in effect the mandate the legislature addressed to all cities of the state which elect to create a Housing Authority within their jurisdiction. We said in <em>State ex rel. Helena Housing Authority </em>v. <em>City Council of City of Helena, </em>108 Mont. 347, 90 Pac. (2d) 514, 518: \u2018Holding, as we must, that the matter of carrying out the plan contemplated by sections 5309.1 to 5309.36, supra, constitutes a public or governmental function, rather than a proprietary or private one, the state\u2019s right to compel cities to make expenditures therefor cannot be denied. * # * This conclusion is especially true where the city is given the right in the first instance to pass upon the question of the existence or nonexistence of the necessity for the housing project, and has found that such necessity exists and has, by its own affirmative act, created the Authority. Under such circumstances it must follow that the city has given its consent to assume the burdens of the Act as well as to receive benefits therefrom.\u2019 <em>* * *</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">\u201cWe think it well to say that after proceeding with the creation of the Authority, as above mentioned under section 5309.4, whether the contract involved here be found to have been legally executed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>or not, the obligation on the city council to make a new contract, the terms of which have already been agreed to, is no longer a discretionary matter. Drafting and executing the contract is merely the completion of the general obligation the city assumed when it authorized the creation of the Great Falls Housing Authority and its execution was a mere ministerial duty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">New Jersey\u2019s legislation in this area, NJSA 55: 14A-1 <em>et seq., </em>NJSA 55:14B-1 <em>et seq., </em>while similar to our statute, did not grant as much authority to the housing authority. Nevertheless, the Court, in <em>City of Paterson </em>v. <em>Housing Authority of Paterson </em>(1967), 96 NJ Super 394 (233 A2d 98) held that the city could not revoke an existing cooperation agreement but could terminate a proposed project in its preliminary stages.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The powers of housing commissions and their relationship with municipal governing bodies are found in and controlled by the state enabling legislation. <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Los Angeles, supra; </em>7 McQuillin, <em>Municipal Corporations </em>(3rd ed) p 609; <em>Renshaw </em>v. <em>Coldwater Housing Commission </em>(1969), 381 Mich 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The pertinent parts of Michigan\u2019s act are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">\u201cSec. 2. Any city, incorporated village or township of the state of Michigan may purchase, acquire, construct, maintain, operate, improve, extend or repair housing facilities and eliminate housing conditions which are detrimental to the public peace, health, safety, morals or welfare.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-8\">\u201cSec. 3. Any city, incorporated village or township may create by ordinance a commission with power to accomplish the purposes set forth in section 2 of ths act. <em>* * *</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-9\">\u201cSec. 4. Said commission shall consist of 5 members to be appointed by the chief administrative officer of the city or incorporated village.

Members of the first commission existing hereunder shall be appointed for the terms of 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years respectively, and annually thereafter 1 member shall be appointed for the term of 5 years.
