That question is whether the defendants were deprived of their Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to be confronted by absent \u2014from this joint trial\u2014prosecution witnesses Connie Wood and Victor Postic. For the background of facts giving rise to the stated question, see <em>People </em>v. <em>Tees </em>(1970), 23 Mich App 476 and <em>People </em>v. <em>Batten </em>(1967), 9 Mich App 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Defendants wer\u00e9 tried and sentenced in 1962, prior of course to the handing down of <em>Barber </em>and <em>Berger. </em>However, in <em>Berger, </em>the presently applied rule of <em>Barber </em>was held effective retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">The prosecuting attorney concedes that \u201cno showing was made of any attempt to procure the presence of the witness Victor Postic at the trial in the above entitled cause, other than a mere showing that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>was in the Navy and outside the jurisdiction of the State.\u201d He contends however that the transcript of Postic\u2019s testimony shows that such testimony did not incriminate either of the defendants, \u201cand indeed constituted harmless constitutional error,\u201d citing <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967), 386 US 18 (87 S Ct 824, 17 L Ed 2d 705). As for the witness Wood, the prosecutor states candidly that \u201cthe People have never contended that her testimony was harmless.\u201d His position nonetheless is that defendants \u201chave failed to establish any abuse of discretion on behalf of the trial court\u2019s actions in ruling that sufficient effort had been expended to produce Miss Connie Wood for trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">We are convinced that the record made here, as and for justification of nonproduction at the trial of the two named witnesses, and of the evidentiary employment during the trial of testimony given by them at .the preliminary examination, comes within the constitutional ban of <em>Barber </em>and <em>Berger </em>and that it would never pass muster before the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Reversed and remanded for new trial or separate trials, as the trial judge may be advised.</p>\n<judges id=\"b585-6\">T. M. Kavanagh, C. J., and Black, Adams, T. E. Brennan, T. G. Kavanagh, Swainson, and Williams, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
