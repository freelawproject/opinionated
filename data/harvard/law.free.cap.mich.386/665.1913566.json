There was contradictory testimony as to the purpose of the Settles in going to the Traffic Jam. The Settles contended that they merely wanted a beer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>and other witnesses testified that the Settles attempted to secure the services of a prostitute.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">The complainants testified that as they left the building someone invited them to the rear'of the bar. Amado testified that one person held his arms while others hit him in the face. His wallet, containing $142, was taken from his pocket and the money removed. The empty wallet was then returned to him. He testified that there were six males and a female involved in the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Tom Settles testified that he and his son were led behind the bar where someone grabbed him by the neck and choked him while a female removed money from his pocket and someone else removed his hat, which had $57 concealed inside the headband. The hat was returned without the money. Both complainants were told to leave the area, and they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">At the trial, neither complainant was able to identify defendant as one of the participants in the crime, nor could either complainant remember if he had seen the defendant in the bar prior to the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Defendant testified that he was present at the bar when the incident occurred, but that he ran from the scene when the commotion started. Defendant further testified that he found a $50 bill on the sidewalk after the fight was over, picked it up, and began looking for money. Charles Grarrett, who had previously been convicted for his participation in the crime, testified that the defendant was present at the scene of the crime and had participated in the actual commission of the crime. He testified that he saw defendant take money from Amado Settles during the fight. Carolyn Page, another admitted participant, testified that she saw defendant in the scuffle. Jacob Hood testified that after the robbery he, Hood, took money from defendant\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Defendant was convicted of unarmed robbery by a jury.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> A majority of the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant participated in the crime. Judge Churchill dissented from the majority opinion. 29 Mich App 285. We granted leave to appeal. 384 Mich 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The issue in this case is whether there was sufficient evidence to sustain defendant\u2019s conviction for unarmed robbery. The limited function of an appellate court in reviewing a jury verdict is well settled by numerous decisions of our Court. In <em>People </em>v <em>Miller, </em>301 Mich 93, 100 (1942), the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-7\">\u201cJurors are the sole judges of the facts and neither the trial court nor this court can interfere with their exercise of that right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">In <em>People </em>v <em>Inman, </em>315 Mich 456, 473 (1946), the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-9\">\u201cIn view of the dispute in the testimony the questions at issue were for the determination of the Jury ^ ^ ^ ??</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">See, also, <em>People </em>v <em>Anschutz, </em>335 Mich 375 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-11\">Thus, we must look at all of the evidence to determine whether there were facts from which the jury could have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeals, in its majority opinion, stated (pp 287, 289):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-12\">\u201cThe only testimony that directly implicated defendant in the crime was that of Charles Garrett, an admitted participant in the crime. Mr. Garrett\u2019s testimony was replete with contradictions, as evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>denced by the following portions of the transcript: * * * [Testimony quoted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-5\">\u201cAn exhaustive review of the record establishes only that the defendant was present at the scene of the crime, yet neither his direct nor indirect participation in it was established. Thus, the jury was asked to infer from the defendant\u2019s presence at the bar and his flight from it that he was a participant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">We do not reach the question of whether the Court of Appeals acted properly in disregarding Garrett\u2019s testimony, because there was other evidence of defendant\u2019s direct participation in this crime sufficient to sustain the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Jacob Hood, one of the males involved, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-8\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Did you see the defendant there ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-9\">\u201cA. Yes, he was back there at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-10\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Did you see him doing anything in particular that you remember?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-11\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Not in particular. I can\u2019t really say what I saw, you know, because it was just a bunch of people back there and there was a bunch of fighting going on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-12\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>I see. But the defendant was back there while the fight was going on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-13\"><em>\u201cA. </em>At one time. When I left from back there he was standing half way between the bar. He had some money in his hand and I took some money out of his hand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-14\">Thus, there was direct evidence that defendant was involved in the fight that took place and did have some of the money stolen from the complainant. The testimony of Carolyn Page, the lone female involved in the incident, was also sufficient, if believed, to sustain defendant\u2019s conviction. She testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number><em>\u201cQ. </em>When did yon first see Booker Hudson, then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I saw Booker Hudson\u2014I really don\u2019t remember where he came from. I remember seeing him back there. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-7\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Did you see him participate in this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I remember seeing him around the young Mexican and it was all a big scuffle because everybody was beating on him, you know. Well, you know, they was all tangled in together.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-9\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>I see. Did you see anybody hit the younger Mexican.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, I saw Elliott James hit him and I saw him being pushed around a lot and hit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-11\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Booker Hudson was back there, was he not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-12\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, he was back there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-13\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Did you do anything to participate in this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-14\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-15\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>What did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-16\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Charles Garrett hollered to me and told me to take the money out of the left pocket of the older Mexican and I took the money out and as I took it out Elliott James came and took everything I had out of my hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-17\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>I see.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-18\"><em>\u201cA. </em>And during that time I don\u2019t remember seeing too much going on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-19\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>But during\u2014this time you have identified that Booker T. Hudson was back there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-20\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yeah, he was back there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-21\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>You didn\u2019t see\u2014was he involved in this general scuffle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-22\"><em>\u201cA. </em>That\u2019s where I saw him when I did see him. Then I saw him later walking\u2014I don\u2019t know where he was walking\u2014he was back there, and you know they was all moving around, but I remember seeing him in the scuffle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-23\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>With the older Mexican?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-24\"><em>\u201cA. </em>With the younger Mexican. Around him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number><em>\u201cQ. </em>Is it your testimony that when you were walking back to the back of the bar Booker Hudson was not there that you could remember?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>No, he wasn\u2019t back there. I don\u2019t remember seeing him back there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-7\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Is it your testimony that later on you saw him back there when the fight was going on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>M-m.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-9\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>And he was participating in the general scuffle, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yeah. I saw him when the young Mexican was being beaten up and he was around then. I remember seeing him then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-11\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Now, it\u2019s pretty dark in back of the Traffic Jam, is it not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-12\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, pretty dark.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-13\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>But you know that Booker Hudson was back there and you can identify him as being back there, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-14\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, I remember him being back there. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-15\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>And you didn\u2019t see Booker Hudson then until sometime during the incident itself, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-16\"><em>\u201cA. </em>No. I don\u2019t remember seeing him at any time until actually everything got started and then I remember seeing him in the scuffle with the younger Mexican.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-17\">In addition, Charles Garrett also directly implicated defendant in the crime and, while his testimony may have been contradictory, the quality and credence of the testimony was for the jury to determine. The testimony of Charles Garrett, Carolyn Page, and Jacob Hood, was sufficient, if believed, to support a jury verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-18\">The Court of Appeals erred in setting aside the jury\u2019s verdict. The Court of Appeals is reversed and the verdict of the jury is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b772-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>T. M. Kavanagh, C.
