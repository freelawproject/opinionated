Appeals and errors\u2014facls recited in decree presumed proven in the absence of certificate of evidence.

Gore against Patrick H. Heffron to settle and adjust their partnership interests in certain property, part of which was Gore\u2019s Hotel in Chicago and the furniture therein. The petitioners, who are the appellees here, had furnished coal and groceries to the receiver, who was managing said hotel under an order of court. The petition alleges, that the receiver in charge of the hotel had refused to pay petitioners for the supplies so furnished by them. The prayer of the petition is, that the receiver may be required to sell and dispose of so much of the furniture and fixtures of the hotel, as may be necessary to realize sufficient money to pay them their claims. Answers were filed to the intervening petition by the receiver and by the appellants, executors of the will of the deceased complainant in the original suit, and by Hefiron the original defendant. Replications were filed to such answers.. Upon the issue thus made the decree here appealed from was entered. That decree finds and adjudges as follows:</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-3\" pgmap=\"537(301) 538(88)\">\u201cThat on January 9, 1889, James J. Gore and Patrick H. Heffron were partners, and as such owned and conducted a hotel known as \u2018Gore\u2019s European Fire-proof Hotel,\u2019 in the city of Chicago; that on said day said Gore filed the bill of complaint in this suit, against said Heffron, and therein prayed for an accounting and a dissolution of said partnership; that on January 29, 1889, upon agreement of the parties to said suit, an order was entered herein, appointing one James H. Rice receiver of the partnership property, and by said order said receiver was directed to operate said hotel and continue the said business; that thereupon said Rice qualified and entered upon the discharge of his duties as such receiver, and continued as such until on or about July 16, 1889, when he resigned, and thereupon, on motion of said Gore, one Nicholas D. Laughlin was appointed receiver of said partnership property, and by said order of appointment said Laughlin was directed to continue the conduct and operation of said hotel; that on or about October 22, 1891, the death of said Gore was suggested to the court, and thereupon an order was entered herein substituting John J. Knickerbocker, George G. Newbury and Ellis Hagenbuck, executors'and trustees under the last will and testament of said Gore, as complainants in the cause; that upon the date of his appointment said Laughlin qualified and gave bond as such receiver, and entered upon his duties as such, and continued to conduct said hotel, as such receiver, from the date of his appointment until December 6,1894, and continued to act as receiver herein until January 1, 1895, at which time he resigned, and thereupon an order was entered herein appointing one William M. Tabor receiver in said suit; that said Tabor qualified and gave bond as such receiver, and entered upon the discharge of his duties, and continued to act as such receiver until February 20, 1895, when he departed this life, and thereupon an order was entered herein appointing one Walter W. Edsall receiver in said suit; that said Edsall qualified and gave bond as such receiver, and entered upon the discharge of his duties as such, and has since continued and now continues to act as such receiver.</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-3\" pgmap=\"538(269) 539(252)\">\u201cThe court further finds that, prior to the filing of the bill of complaint in this suit, the said Gore and Heffron had become indebted, and in order to secure said indebtedness had executed a trust deed, which covered, among other property, the furniture and fixtures in said hotel; that thereafter suit was commenced to foreclose said trust deed, and thereafter a decree of foreclosure was entered in said suit, and thereunder, on March 15, 1894, said hotel building was sold to complainants for the sum of $95,000.00, and said furniture and fixtures were sold to complainants in this suit for the sum of $9250.00; that thereafter said sale was confirmed, and on March 28,1894, an order was entered in this cause directing said receiver to turn said furniture and fixtures over to said complainants; that from the said order Heffron appealed to the Appellate Court of Illinois for the First District, where, on January 28,1895, said order was affirmed; that, pending said appeal, said furniture and fixtures were left in the possession of said receiver, and by the consent of complainants and said defendants said receiver continued to operate and conduct said hotel; that in November, 1894, complainants, desiring to lease said hotel building to Messrs. Summerfield and Bedard, petitioned this court for an order directing the receiver to include said furniture and fixtures in said lease, and such order was entered and such lease was made to take effect from the 6th day of December, 1894, at which time the receiver ceased to operate said hotel; that on the 6th, 13th, 20th, 27th and 30th of November, 1894, and on the 3d of December, 1894, said receiver purchased and received from intervenor the McKindley Coal and Mining Company,' coal for use and consumption in the conduct of said hotel to the amount of \u00a7737.83; that said coal was necessary to enable said receiver to conduct said hotel, and was so used by said receiver, and the purchase thereof was proper, and was authorized by and was in pursuance of the order appointing said receiver; that no part of said coal has been paid for, and that there is now due for said coal to said intervenor the McKindley Coal and Mining Company, from the said receiver, the sum of \u00a7737.83, with legal interest thereon after December 3,1894; that on the 5th, 9th, 14th, 17th, 19th, 23d and 28th of November, 1894, and on December 3, 1894, said receiver purchased and received from intervenor the Steele-Wed\u00e9les Company, groceries to the amount of \u00a7212.38; that said groceries were necessary to enable said receiver to conduct said hotel, and were so used by said receiver, and the purchase thereof was proper, and was authorized by and was in pursuance of the order appointing said receiver and was in discharge of his duties as such; that no part of said groceries has been paid for, and there is now due to said intervenor the Steele-Wedeles Company for said groceries, from said receiver, the sum of \u00a7212.38, together with legal interest thereon from and after December 3, 1894.</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-3\" pgmap=\"539\">\u201cThe court further finds that said sums so found due from said receiver to said interveners became and were, and have since continued to be, a charge and lien upon said furniture and fixtures; that on July 3, 1895, the said Summerfield and Bedard surrendered their possession of said hotel and said furniture and fixtures, under the said lease, to the receiver, and thereupon said complainants John J. Knickerbocker, George G.

The record in the case contains no certificate of evidence. It must, therefore, be assumed that the findings of the decree were sustained by sufficient evidence upon the hearing below. \u201cWhere the evidence is not preserved in the record, either by a bill of'exceptions or by a certificate of evidence, the facts recited in the decree must be taken to have been found upon sufficient evidence.\u201d (Schuler v. Hogan, 168 Ill. 369).</p> <p id=\"b543-8\" pgmap=\"543(21) 544(152)\">Among the facts recited in the decree are the following: Before Gore filed the bill in this case against Heffron for an accounting, and to dissolve their partnership, Gore and Heffron had executed a trust deed to secure a large indebtedness of more than $100,000.00 upon said hotel and the furniture and fixtures therein. Under proceedings to foreclose said trust deed a decree of foreclosure was entered, and thereunder on March 15, 1894, said hotel building' was sold to appellants for $95,000.00, and said furniture and fixtures were sold to appellants for $9250.00. This sale was afterwards confirmed. Prior thereto, the first receiver, appointed in the suit between the partners, was appointed by agreement of both parties. The second receiver appointed in the cause was appointed upon the motion of the complainant, Gore. The receiver, thus appointed on the motion of complainant, acted as such from about October 1, 1891, until January 1, 1895, and was acting as such when appellees furnished the supplies in question.</p> <p id=\"b544-3\" pgmap=\"544(186) 545(53)\">On March 28, 1894, after the sale to the appellants under the foreclosure of the trust deed, an order was entered, directing the receiver to turn the furniture and fixtures over to the complainants. From this order thus entered on March 28, 1894, Heffron appealed to the Appellate Court, where the order was affirmed, but not until January 28,1895. While this appeal of Heffron was pending, the furniture and fixtures were left in the possession of the receiver, and by the consent of the appellants and of Heffron the receiver continued to operate and conduct the hotel. It was while the receiver was thus, with the consent of the appellants, operating and conducting the hotel, and while the furniture and, fixtures were in his possession, as receiver, that the appellees furnished to said receiver the supplies in question. The appellee, the McKindley Coal and Mining Company, furnished coal to said receiver between November 6 and December 3, 1894. The appellee, the Steele-Wedeles Company, furnished groceries to said receiver between November 5 and December 3, 1894. The receiver did not cease to operate the hotel until December 6,1894. The decree finds, that the coal and groceries, furnished by the appellees, were necessary to enable the receiver to conduct the hotel, and were so used by.liim, and that the purchase thereof was proper, and was authorized by, and was in pursuance of, an order appointing the receiver.</p> <p id=\"b545-3\" pgmap=\"545\">Under the facts thus stated and thus found in the decree, we are of the opinion, that the court below decided correctly in ordering the claims of the appellees to be paid by the sale of the furniture and fixtures, in default of the payment thereof by the appellants.</p> <p id=\"b545-4\" pgmap=\"545(261) 546(180)\">It is contended by the appellants, that, by the sale of the furniture and fixtures to them in March, 1894, the property was placed beyond the reach of any charge for the receiver\u2019s expenses. Appellees did not become creditors of the receiver before the sale to the appellants, but after such sale. The purchasers of the property at the sale made in March, 1894, were not third persons, but wTere the executors of Gore, who was a party to the present suit. The indebtedness secured by the trust deed, under which the sale ivas made, was the indebtedness of Gore and Hefiron. The receiver appointed in the case was appointed by agreement between Gore and Heffron. The question then is not whether the court has the power to make the expenses'of the receivership a charge, superior to prior liens owned by persons not parties to the suit, in which the receiver was appointed. Gore was responsible for the creation of the indebtedness secured by the trust deed, and for expenses of the receiver. Therefore, the purchase at the foreclosure sale by the appellants, who stand in the place and stead of Gore, amounted merely to a payment, and left the property in the hands of the appellants, subject to the charge of the receivership expenses, if there was any charge for such expenses at that time. Where the owner of the equity of redemption of property purchases the same at a judicial sale under a mortgage created by himself, he does not thereby acquire a new title, divested of liens prior to the lien under which he purchases. His purchase is nothing more than a payment of the debt, and merely relieves the property from the encumbrance thereon. \u201cThe payment by a judgment debtor of the judgment, after a sheriff\u2019s sale, extinguishes the lien; .and the fact that he takes a transfer of the certificate and the sheriff\u2019s deed, instead of a certificate of redemption, cannot divest the lien of a subsequent judgment.\u201d (McCarthy v. Christie, 13 Cal. 80). \u201cIf the redemption is made by the judgment debtor, who continues to hold the 'estate, of course it is subject to a subsequent judgment.\u201d (McLagan v. Brown, 11 Ill. 519). When Gore, whom appellants represent, procured the appointment of a receiver over the property, he created a charge thereon for the expenses of. the receivership. Hence, the appellants cannot relieve the property of that charge by purchasing it at a foreclosure sale under an encumbrance created by Gore, and for the payment of which he and his representatives are liable.</p> <p id=\"b546-3\" pgmap=\"546(177) 547(54)\">But, independently of these considerations, it must be remembered that the claims of these appellees accrued after the sale to appellants in March, 1894. It is true that, at that sale, the appellants purchased the furniture and fixtures for $9250.00 and that on March 28, 1894, an order was entered, directing the receiver to turn the same over to appellants. But, pending an appeal from this order, the appellants themselves consented that the furniture and fixtures should remain in the possession pf the receiver, and that the receiver should continue to operate and conduct the hotel. Not only so, but the appellants, on the 7th or 8th of November, themselves filed a petition before the court for an order, directing the receiver to include the said furniture and fixtures in a lease to be thereafter made, which lease was to take effect on December 6, 1894. This was a recognition of the right of the receiver at that time to dispose of the furniture and the fixtures by a lease. The appellants are estopped from saying, that appellees should not be paid for the coal and groceries, furnished by them to the receiver, when the receiver was running the hotel with their consent and with their furniture and fixtures. It is impossible to conceive how a hotel can be operated properly without coal and without groceries.</p> <p id=\"b547-3\" pgmap=\"547\">Such being the facts, what is the law applicable to them? \u201cWhen it becomes the duty of a court of equity to take property under its own charge, through a receiver, the property becomes chargeable with the necessary expenses incurred in taking care of and saving it, including the allowance to the receiver for his services. He is the officer and agent of the court, and not of the parties; and it is a right of the court, essential to its own efficiency in the protection of things so situated, to keep them under its control, until such expenses and allowances are paid or secured to be paid.\u201d (Beckwith v. Carroll, 56 Ala. 12; Beach on Receivers, sec. 771; High on Receivers, sec. 796). Mr. High, in his work on Receivers, at section 796, after stating the doctrine that, when a court of equity takes property under its charge by appointing a receiver, the property itself is chargeable with the necessary expenses of the receivership, says: \u201cAnd, in such case, the person, who, under the final decree of the court, acquires the property, or its proceeds, acquires it cum onere and chargeable with the amounts due to the receiver for services and advances.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b547-4\" pgmap=\"547(100) 548(93)\">The object of appointing a receiver is to preserve the property for the benefit of all parties interested. Sometimes this object is best attained by continuing a business. When this is done, the court has the right, although it should exercise such right with great caution, to make the expenses of such business chargeable upon the corpus of the property, if the income is not sufficient to pay the same. Of course, such expenses must be charged first upon the net income, but, when that is not sufficient, they may be charged upon the property itself, or upon its proceeds after sale. It has been held that, although this authority, of a receiver to incur indebtedness, in order to keep the business a tgoing concern\u201d until the rights of the parties are adjusted and a sale is effected, ordinarily arises only in cases of railroad companies; yet the same rules may be applied in other cases under like circumstances. (Hopfensack v. Hopfensack, 61 How. Pr. 498; Ellis v. Vernon Ice, Light and Water Co. 86 Tex. 109; Espuella Land and Cattle Co. v. Bindle, 11 Tex. Civ.
