Hutchinson, county clerk of said Will county, commanding him to receive and file a certificate of nomination of the relator for the office of State Senator from the twenty-fifth Senatorial district. The petition alleges that relator has been duly nominated by a convention held at Joliet, in said county, March 12, 1898, as the candidate of the democratic party for Senator from said Senatorial district, consisting of said county of Will, as created by the act of the legislature approved June 15, 1893, in force July 1, 1893, apportioning the State into Senatorial districts; that a certificate of said nomination has been duly made and presented to said defendant, and that defendant refuses to receive and file the same for the reason that said Senatorial district has been changed by the addition of DuPage county, by an act of the legislature approved January 11, 1898, entitled \u201cAn act to amend sections 1 and 2 of an act entitled \u2018An act to apportion the State of Illinois into Senatorial districts and to repeal certain acts therein named,\u2019 approved June 15, 1893, in force July 1, 1893,\u201d and that defendant claims that by virtue of said act of January 11, 1898, said twenty-fifth Senatorial district now consists of Will and DuPage counties. The defendant has' entered his appearance waiving service of process, and the parties have each waived all formalities and submit the cause for decision upon a stipulation that the facts stated in the petition are true. The question thus raised is, whether the election for Senators and Representatives to be held in November, 1898, is to be held in the districts as created by the law approved June 15, 1893, in force July 1, 1893, or in the districts as fixed by said amendatory act approved January 11, 1898, and which, if valid, will g*o into effect July 1, 1898. The latter act was passed with all the formalities required by law and was duly approved, and the decision depends upon the question whether fits enactment was within the power of the legislature. It is agreed that we shall make a final order dismissing the petition or granting a peremptory writ of mandamus, according as we shall find the one or the other of these acts in force.</p> <p id=\"b494-5\" pgmap=\"494(28) 495(359) 496(73)\">The duty of passing upon the constitutionality of an act of the legislature has always been regarded as a delicate one, to be entered upon with hesitation and caution, and to call for most deliberate and careful attention. The legislative, and executive branches of the government have necessarily construed the constitution and determined that they may rightfully exercise the power assumed by the passage of the act, and their decision is entitled to the highest respect. In the consideration of the question involved the presumption is in favor of the constitutionality of the act, and it will only be set aside in case of a clear infringement'of the constitution. It is to be assumed that the legislature has not only considered the question of power, but has also acted from patriotic motives, and that in this case the amendatory act was prompted by a sense of duty and justice toward the people, in an attempt to secure for them a nearer approach to equality of representation in making the laws by which they are governed. It so happens that this twenty-fifth district selected for the settlement of the controversy was one of those used in the case of People v. Thompson, 155 Ill. 451, to illustrate the difference of population of different districts and the want of equality under the act of June 15, 1893. This district was made to consist of Will county alone, with a population 24,376 less than the adjoining twenty-ninth district, composed of the four counties of Lee, DeKalb, Kendall and Grundy. The presumption is that it was for the purpose of a better adjustment of rights of representation that DuPage county was added, and that the amendatory act was passed with a view to make the legislative branch of the government more nearly representative of the people in their sovereign capacity. This, however, can not influence the determination of the case if there was a want of power to make the change, for it has always been held, as it was in People v. Thompson, supra, that the court cannot declare a statute unconstitutional and void on the ground of unjust differences not prohibited by the constitution and within the legislative discretion, and neither can the court sustain a law where there is a want of power to enact it, merely because it is wise in policy or just in its provisions. The parties have properly raised and presented the question of the validity of the act of 1898, and however grave we may regard the responsibility we cannot decline the duty imposed upon us, and if the act is found to be in conflict with the provisions of the constitution we cannot hesitate to so declare.</p> <p id=\"b496-5\" pgmap=\"496\">The constitution divides the powers of the government into three distinct departments, and for the exercise of legislative power creates a legislative department, to be elected by the people in Senatorial districts. The provision authorizing the apportionment of the State into such Senatorial districts is section 6 of article 4, which provides as follows: \u201cThe General Assembly shall apportion the State every ten years, beginning with the year 1871, by dividing the population of the State, as ascertained by the Federal census, by the number 51, and the quotient shall be the ratio of representation in the Senate. The State'shall be divided into fifty-one Senatorial districts,\u201d etc. Acting under the provisions of said section, the legislature, by the act of June 15, 1893, divided the State, according to the last Federal census, into fifty-one Senatorial districts, and by that act the county of Will was made the twenty-fifth district. The act of January 11,1898, was in form an amendment, which remodeled and changed forty-three of these Senatorial districts, and in the case of the twenty-fifth district added to Will county the county of DuPag\u2019e. Section 1 of the same article of the constitution is as follows: \u201cThe legislative power shall be vested in a General Assembly, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives, both to be elected by the people;\u201d and there are further provisions of the constitution that three Representatives and one Senator shall be elected in each district, and they constitute the two houses.</p> <p id=\"b496-8\" pgmap=\"496(21) 497(354) 498(110)\">The passage of an apportionment act is the exercise of a legislative power, (State v. Wrightson, 56 N. J. L. 126; State v. Cunningham, 81 Wis. 440;) and if there were no other provisions relating to apportionment than the general legislative authority conferred by section 1, the legislature might apportion the State at its pleasure, at any time. There is no express denial in the constitution of the right to exercise this power whenever the legislature may see fit, and it is therefore argued, for the defendant, that it may be exercised at any time and that the legislature may make an apportionment whenever it chooses. This does not follow, however, and it is not essential, in order that the constitution may operate as a prohibition, that it shall contain a specific provision that apportionments shall not be made otherwise than according to its provisions. The general principles governing the construction of constitutions are the same as those that apply to statutes. (Potter\u2019s Dwarris on Statutes and Constitutions, 654; 6 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law,\u20142d ed.\u2014 921.) The use of negative words would be conclusive of an intent to impose a limitation, and they are used in some instances in the constitution, but their absence is not conclusive of the opposite. Where there are provisions inserted by the people as to the time when a power shall be exercised, there is at least a strong presumption that they designed it should be exercised at that time and in the designated mode only, and such provisions must be regarded as limitations upon the power. (Cooley\u2019s Const. Lim.'\u20146th ed.\u201494.) If legislative power is given in general terms, and is not regulated, it may be exercised in any manner chosen by the legislature; but where the constitution fixes the time and mode of exercising a particular power it contains a necessary implication against anything contrary to it, and by setting a particular time for its exercise it also sets a boundary to the legislative power. If a power is given and the mode of its exercise is prescribed, all other modes are excluded. (Sedgwick on Construe, of Stat. and Constitutions, 31.) The legislature must keep within the legislative powers granted to it, and observe the directions of the constitution. (Sutherland on Stat. Const, sec. 26.) This doctrine was applied in State v. Wrightson, supra, where an apportionment of assembly districts inNew Jersey was in question, and it was said: \u201cIn the construction of statutes it is a cardinal rule, which applies as well to constitutional provisions, that when the law is in the affirmative that a thing shall be done by certain persons or in a certain manner, this affirmative matter contains a negative that it shall not be done by other persons or in another manner, upon the maxim expressio unius cst exelusio alterius.\u201d</p> <p id=\"AbF\" pgmap=\"498(254) 499(261)\">In Page v. Allen, 68 Pa. 338, which involved the constitutionality of the registry law of that State, it was held that the inhibitions of the constitution as to legislation are to be regarded as well when they arise by implication as by expression, and that the expression of one thing in the constitution is the exclusion of things not expressed. It is here admitted, as it necessarily must be, that the provisions for apportionment are all exclusive except the particular one as to time. It is not denied that the basis for apportionment must be the population of the State as ascertained by the last Federal census; that the population can only be divided by the number 51, and that the quotient must be the ratio of representation in the Senate. The only claim is, that the provision as to time is not exclusive, and we cannot see any substantial ground for establishing a different rule respecting the time than the mode of doing the act. In Wisconsin the constitution provided for an apportionment and organization of assembly districts once in five years, but contained no express prohibition against their alteration between the 'periods fixed for apportionment, and in Slausen v. City of Racine, 13 Wis. 398, it was said, that whatever limitation existed upon the power of the legislature in that respect was to be derived from the general scope and object of the provisions of the constitution concerning the apportionment of Senators and Representatives, but that it might well be said that this furnished such limitation, and it was held that the provision implied that apportionments should not be made at any other time than that fixed by the constitution. The constitution of Indiana fixes the time once in six years when an enumeration of the voters of the State shall be taken and an apportionment shall be made by law. In Denney v. State, 144 Ind. 503, an apportionment act passed in 1895 was in question, and the main dispute was whether, under the constitution, any apportionment act could be passed at that time. It was insisted in support of the act, that the constitution committed to the legislative department, by a general grant of legislative power, the authority to make apportionments, and that the provision requiring the enactment of an apportionment law at the beginning of each period of six years was not intended as a prohibition upon the legislature from making- other apportionments whenever that body might think best. This question was determined against the claim made, and it was held that if there were no particular provisions in regard to the subject of legislative apportionment, the legislature might, under the full and unrestricted vesting of legislative power, enact apportionment laws at their pleasure, but that the fixing by the constitution of a time and mode for the doing of such act was by necessary implication a forbidding of any other time or mode and a prohibition of the exercise of the power in any other way.</p> <p id=\"b499-5\" pgmap=\"499(93) 500(133)\">The eminent counsel who have argued this case for the defendant with great learning and ability, have failed to find any decisions contrary to the foregoing- or any authorities conflicting with those given, but insist that there is a difference between the constitutions of Indiana and this State, which makes the decision in Denney v. State, supra, inapplicable here. The distinction attempted to be shown we are compelled to regard as unsubstantial, and cannot consider it a ground of difference that the enumeration which was made the basis of the apportionment in Indiana is taken b;r the State once in six years,\" while the census which is made a like basis in this State is taken by the United States and once in ten years. The Federal constitution, which was adopted in 1787, provides in section 2 of article 1 for an enumeration within three years after the first meeting of Congress, and within every subsequent term of ten years, as a basis for the apportionment of Representatives and direct taxes. Under that constitution a census has been taken in every period of ten years, commencing with 1790, and under it there will be, at every period of ten years provided for by the constitution of this\u2019State, a census taken as a basis for division of the State into Senatorial districts.</p> <p id=\"b500-5\" pgmap=\"500(228) 501(147)\">The decisions are also criticised by counsel for defendant under the rule that what is expressed is exclusive only where it is creative, and that the maxim applies only to a provision which grants originally a power but does not limit or destroy a pre-existing right. It is contended that the power to apportion does not originate with the provision of the constitution, but is a pre-existing right independent of the provision, and that therefore the rule is not to be applied. To this we qannot assent. The legislature is the creature of the constitution, and the provisions in respect to the two houses, the division of the State into Senatorial districts by a particular plan and the membership of each of the houses, are creative in their nature. They relate to the framework, the membership and the organization of the legislative department of the government created by the constitution for the exercise of legislative powers. They prescribe the manner in which districts shall be created, that a Senator and three Representatives shall be elected in each district, and provide for the constitution and organization of the department which shall exercise legislative power. The conditions for the exercise of this power of apportionment are particularly prescribed, and we think that those acting under it cannot vary the conditions. (Endlich on Int. of Statutes, 533.) Another rule is, that where there is a general provision which would include a particular subject and there is a special provision relating to that subject, the special provision controls and the particular subject is not governed by the general provision. In this rule we found, as we conceived, a substantial ground for holding the Judicial Apportionment act of 1897 in force from its passage, and not included in the general provision as to when laws shall take effect. (People v. Rose, 166 Ill. 422.) Here there is a general delegation of legislative power, with subsequent provisions giving specific and precise directions to make the apportionment at a particular time and in a designated way, and these, we think, manifest an intention to impose a negative upon the exercise of the power at any other time.</p> <p id=\"b501-3\" pgmap=\"501(188) 502(170)\">We have already said that if there were no further provision than the general grant of legislative power the legislature might apportion the State at its will,\u2014 and this was the situation under the constitution of 1818, which contained no restriction except the single one in section 8 of the schedule to that instrument, fixing\" the apportionment until the first enumeration directed to be taken in 1820 and every five years thereafter. The apportionment after the first census was not made to depend upon any subsequent enumeration or event, and after the first enumeration the legislature not only apportioned the State every five years, but made changes during intervals. A change in the practice commenced with the adoption of the constitution in force April 1, 1848. In that constitution was first introduced a provision for re-apportionment at particular times, according to the number of white inhabitants at the first regular session after returns were made. Under that constitution the legislature made its first re-apportionment in 1854, based on the census of 1850. This apportionment continued in force until the Federal census was taken in 1860, and then a new apportionment was made in 1861. The present constitution was adopted in 1870, containing a similar provision, now under consideration. After that time the legislature apportioned the State in the years 1872, 1882 and 1893. Prom the time of the adoption of the constitution of 1848 for a period of fifty years, up to the act of January 11, 1898, apportionments were made at the intervals stated, based upon the census taken by the United States, and there was no change made between such periods. This practical construction of the constitution re-enforces the conclusion at which we have arrived . Such a legislative interpretation, long established and acquiesced in, is regarded as of great force in determining the true construction, and raises a strong pr\u00e9sumption that it is correct. Bruce v. Schuyler, 4 Gilm. 221; Matthews v. Shores, 24 Ill. 28; People v. Morgan, 90 id. 558; Cooley\u2019s Const. Lim. (6th ed.) 82; Sedgwick on Construe, of Stat. and Const. Law, 412.</p> <p id=\"b502-5\" pgmap=\"502(190) 503(18)\">Attention has been called by counsel to the fact that the legislature of 1893 passed an apportionment act which was approved May 16, 1893, and also passed the subsequent act of June 15, 1893, repealing the same and apportioning the State. This act of May 16, 1893, is conceded to have been an unconstitutional and void act, which never became a law for the reason that it omitted the town of Riverside, a populous town in Cook county, which was not included in any of the Senatorial districts and was deprived of representation. The validity of the act of June 15, 1893, was therefore not affected \u2018by it, since the power to apportion the State was not thereby exercised. The validity of the act of June 15 passed beyond the field of controversy by the decision in People v. Thompson, supra, and is now conceded. The act of May 16, 1893, has no force, as affecting the question of construction by the legislative body of the legislative power, because it was incomplete and void. Its passage and repeal do not in any manner weaken the force of the construction of the constitution given by the legislature and acquiesced in for a period of about fifty years.</p> <p id=\"b503-5\" pgmap=\"503(336) 504(245)\">It is also argued that a fair construction of the provision in question is, that it was to secure to the people a re-apportionment at least once in ten years, rather than to fix the time for the exercise of the power or to operate as an exclusion of apportionments at other times. The same argument was insisted upon in Denney v. State, supra, but did not prevail, and it was held that the apportionment could only be made after the taking of an enumeration, and that when a valid apportionment was once made it must stand until after the making of the next enumeration. If the purpose had been as contended, it is probable that the constitution would have expressed that intent which is lacking. Furthermore, it does not seem, from the history of legislative apportionments prior to the adoption of the provision, that there was any occasion to provide for securing apportionments as often as such periods, or that a neglect to apportion was regarded as an evil to be provided against. The legislatures during' the thirty years under the constitution of 1818 had been in the habit of making frequent apportionments. The courts may always look to ascertain the evil intended to be remedied; but this provision could not have been aimed at an evil which did not exist, and it would rather seem that the object was to establish definite periods for re-apportionments. When the legislature of 1893 made the apportionment of that year the conditions existed which authorized the exercise of the power, and the legislative discretion was exercised based upon the Federal census of 1890,\u2014a division of the population by 51 and the resulting quotient as the ratio of representation. That power and discretion, when fully exercised, were exhausted, and the power will not again arise until the conditions provided for in the constitution shall again exist. The power and discretion are to be exercised at stated intervals and in certain modes, and that legislature, upon a consideration of the facts, exercised the power and the discretion. A subsequent reapportionment based upon the same census, the same division and the same quotient, which it is admitted must be used, would be nothing but reversing the judgment and discretion of that legislature, exercised upon the same facts at the time expressly authorized by the constitution; and we cannot think that it was in the contemplation of those who adopted the constitution that succeeding legislatures should set aside the action of the first by changing and remodeling districts, where no new condition contemplated by the constitution exists. The power to make apportionments has not always been exercised at exact periods of ten years, but the power conferred by the constitution is a continuing one from the time it is constitutionally devolved upon the legislature until it is performed. (People v. Thompson, supra; State v. Cunningham, supra.) Twelve States, having a general plan of apportionment similar to our own, have by their constitutions forbidden a change between the periods fixed in such constitutions. These prohibitions are conclusive of that which, in our case, must be the subject of construction, and which has been practically construed by the legislature for a long period of time, as we have already seen. The absence of such an express prohibition in our constitution is not, as before stated, at all conclusive that the prohibition was not intended.</p> <p id=\"b504-5\" pgmap=\"504(89) 505(33)\">Plausible reasons may be given for sustaining the power,-\u2014and especially in this particular instance,\u2014 which would naturally appeal with force to those who believe that the apportionment of 1893 was prompted by some other motive than the public good or a desire to secure to the people, as nearly as possible, equality of representation; but this consideration cannot have force as against the provisions of the constitution, and it is to be remembered that the same rule which would permit a correction of inequality would also permit the setting aside of a just and fair apportionment made at the time fixed by the constitution, and the substitution of unjust and oppressive conditions within the latitude allowed by the constitution to the legislature.</p> <p id=\"b505-3\" pgmap=\"505\">We are convinced that the construction we have given to the constitution is the correct one, and we feel ourselves under the necessity of declaring the apportionment act of 1898 unconstitutional and invalid. A peremptory writ of mandamus is awarded, according to the prayer of the petition. Wrii aivarded.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b505-4\" pgmap=\"505\">Mr. Justice Wilkin,</author> <p id=\"AYY\" pgmap=\"505\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b505-5\" pgmap=\"505\">In the limited time at my disposal I can only state in a general way why I think the foregoing opinion and .conclusion unsound.</p> <p id=\"b505-6\" pgmap=\"505(223) 506(111)\">The proposition, \u201cthe provision authorizing the apportionment of the State into such Senatorial districts is section 6 of article 4,\u201d is, in my opinion, a misconception, and forms the basis of the wrong conclusion reached. That section does not empower the General Assembly to make apportionment laws, nor does its language purport to do so. It only declares how the power already existing in the legislature shall be exercised. Nor can I see how the fact that the legislative body of the State is provided for in the constitution,\u2014\u201cis the creature of the constitution,\u201d \u2014in any way gives support to the assertion that section 6 is creative of the power in that body to apportion the State. It is admitted that the power to pass such laws is a legislative power. It is inherent in the General Assembly, and can be exercised by it at such times and in such manner as it may deem wise and proper, except in so far as it is limited by the constitution. It has often been said by this court: \u201cNo proposition is better settled than that a State constitution is a limitation upon the power of the legislature, and that the legislature possesses every power not delegated to some other department or expressly denied to it by the constitution.\u201d The rule is nowhere more clearly stated than by Judge Cooley in his work on Constitutional Limitations, quoted with approval in People v. Thompson, 155 Ill. 451, as follows: \u201cWhatever the people might do the courts cannot prevent their representatives from doing, unless the people have positively and expressly forbidden it. Such restrictions and limitations ought to be clear and explicit. Where the power which is exercised is legislative in its character the courts can enforce only those limitations which the constitution imposes, and not those implied restrictions which, resting in theory only, the people have been satisfied to leave to the judgment, patriotism and sense of justice of their representatives.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b506-5\" pgmap=\"506(242) 507(73)\">The question here is, does the language, \u201cthe General Assembly shall apportion the State every ten years, be? ginning with the year 1871, by dividing the population,\u201d etc., prohibit the passage of such statutes oftener than once in each period of ten years. The language as to when an apportionment shall be made, it will be seen, is very general and indefinite, and does not warrant the assumption throughout the majority opinion that it fixes the time when it shall be done. It does not require the first apportionment to be made in the year 1871, or at the first session after the Federal census of 1870, and every ten years thereafter, and in this respect is peculiar. It is unlike our constitution of 1848, or that of the States of Indiana and Wisconsin, ref\u00e9rred to in the cases cited from those States. They expressly provide for apportionments at fixed intervals, but no such requirement is found in our present constitution. It does no more than fix decennial periods, beginning with the year 1871, and requires an apportionment to be made within each of those periods. Any session of the legislature during the period can lawfully divid\u00e9 the State into Senatorial districts, if it has not been done at a prior session in the period, \u2014and this, not because it was the duty of a prior session to do so and the duty a continuing one, but because the duty devolves upon one session as much as another. It could not be claimed that the act in question is unconstitutional because passed in the year 1898. The contention must be that power is only given to make one apportionment in the period beginning\" with the year 1891 and ending with the year 1901, and that the legislature of 1893, by the passage of the act at that session, had exhausted that power.</p> <p id=\"b507-4\" pgmap=\"507(291) 508(206)\">Is it true that the authority of the General Assembly is by this indefinite language limited to the passage of a single act during each ten years ? That there is no express language to that effect is admitted, but the theory of the foregoing opinion is that the prohibition arises by necessary implication. I do not so understand the language. The power to apportion the State every ten years is not, in my opinion, so incompatible or inconsistent with the right to do so oftener as to amount to an implied prohibition. The assertion that there is no substantial ground for establishing a different rule respecting the time when apportionments may be made than that which applies to the mode of doing the act is certainly unwarranted. It is conceded by the respondent that an apportionment must be made every ten years; but the insistence is that, consistently with that duty, it may be done oftener,-\u2014and this raises the question of construction. It is impossible, however, that a mode other than that prescribed could be followed consistently with the provision in question,\u2014that is, the population must be divided by 51, the quotient to be the ratio of representation. Certainly the ratio cannot be obtained, consistently with that express requirement, by using any other number as a divisor, and hence there is no room whatever for construction in that regard. And so as to the other requirements in the mode prescribed. The holding here is, that because the constitution says the General Assembly shall apportion the State every ten years it cannot do so more than once in any period of ten years, no matter what may be the emergency therefor. It seems to me no such conclusion can be reasonably drawn, much less arise by necessary implication. It is the duty of courts to so construe constitutional provisions and acts of the -legislature as to harmonize the two, and sustain the law if it is possible to do so. The rule is: \u201cLanguage restricting the legislative power of the General Assembly must be construed strictly, (People ex rel. v. Wilson, 15 Ill. 388,) and unless it shall then clearly appear that the legislation in question is within the terms of the restriction it must be sustained. If it only be doubtful whether it is or not, the doubt must be in favor of the validity of the action of the General Assembly.\u201d (Wilson v. Board of Trustees, 133 Ill. 443.) \u201cIf doubt exists as to the constitutionality of the statute, the benefit of the doubt is to be given to the law. The doubt upon which the court is to act may arise either from an endeavor to arrive at a true interpretation of the constitution, or from a consideration of the law after the meaning of the constitution has been judicially determined.\u201d 23 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 351, and cases cited in note.</p> <p id=\"b508-5\" pgmap=\"508(170) 509(68)\">The constitution, considered as a whole, shows that its framers did not intend the effect given to the language of section 6 by this decision. If the purpose had been to prohibit apportionments oftener than once every ten years, it is reasonable to suppose that language would have been used clearly expressing that intention, as is done in section 9 of article 4, fixing the sessions of the General Assembly at the time named \u201cand at no other time;\" and in section 5 of article 6, providing for the division of the State into districts for the election of Supreme judges, wherein it is said \u201cthe boundaries of the districts may be changed at the sessions of the General Assembly next preceding the election for judges therein, and at no other time;\u201d and ag'ain in section 13 of the same article, authorizing the apportionment of the State into judicial circuits, the language being\", \u201cnew circuits may be formed and the boundaries of the circuits changed by the General Assembly at its session next preceding the election for circuit judges, but at no other time\u201d It is also a significant fact that no less than twelve other States of the Union, in the frame of their constitutions, have deemed it necessary, by the use of different terms of expression, to provide that apportionments should be made at fixed periods and at no other time.</p> <p id=\"b509-5\" pgmap=\"509(301) 510(46)\">There is to my mind no force in the argument attempted to be drawn from what is said to be the construction placed upon the constitution by the legislature in making apportionments of the State every ten years, and not oftener. In dividing the State into Senatorial districts once in each period of ten years the legislature did so not under a construction of the constitution thereby placed upon it, but by simply following its plain requirement. That it did not do so oftener cannot be said to amount to a construction by it that no power existed to do so. It cannot be assumed that it refrained from exercising the power because it understood it did not possess it, rather than because it found no occasion for its exercise. The only necessity for a re-apportionment more than once in a decennial period, which is here shown, arose at the session of 1893, as stated in the foregoing majority opinion, and that legislature did not hesitate to make it. The attempt to weaken the force of that action as indicating the construction placed upon the constitution by the legislature, upon the ground that the first act was unconstitutional, is, I think, futile. Without reference to the question as to the power of the legislature to pass upon the constitutionality of statutes enacted by it, it is illogical to say that the legislature could review its own acts by repealing the former statute at the same session, or, as I suppose would be admitted, at the next session of the legislature, on the ground that it was unconstitutional because some small part of the territory was attached to no district, but would have no power to do so upon a discovery that the apportionment was grossly unjust to the people of one or many portions of the State by reason of a disregard of the requirement that the districts shall be formed of compact and contiguous territory, etc., and as nearly as practicable containing an equal number of inhabitants.</p> <p id=\"b510-5\" pgmap=\"510\">No good purpose will be served by a review of the authorities cited in the majority opinion. Unless it must be held that the power of the General Assembly to apportion the State is derived from section 6, supra, of the constitution, or, rather, unless there is no reasonable ground for holding otherwise, none of them, properly understood, support the conclusion announced. The Wisconsin case does not decide the question here involved nor purport to do so, and the Indiana decision does so only incidentally, the question not being of controlling importance in that case. But as already said, the constitutional provisions of these States and those of our own are materially different, and the decisions for that reason should not be given the force of authority here. The fact that counsel for the defendant have been able to cite no decisions in conflict with them signifies nothing. As already said, the language of our constitution is peculiar, and, so far as I have been able to discover, is found in no other State constitution. It is before this court for the first time to be construed, and it is not strange that decided cases are not to be found bearing on the issue here. It is not for the defendant to show that the act in question is constitutional, but for those who challenge its validity to point out and make clear its invalidity.</p> <p id=\"b510-6\" pgmap=\"510(67) 511(62)\">For the reason already stated, that the power to make apportionments is inherent in the legislature and not created by the constitution, the maxim \u201cexpressio unius est exclusio alterius\u201d is not properly applicable in the construction of section 6. It is a rule only to be applied where-the intention of the law-maker is not otherwise manifest, and as said by Mr. Sutherland in his work on Statutory Construction, (sec. 325,) \u201cunder these conditions it leads to sufficient and satisfactory conclusions, but otherwise the expression of one or more things is not a negation or exclusion of other things;\u201d and he adds: \u201cWhat is expressed is exclusive only when it is creative, or in derogation of some existing law or of some provision in the particular act.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b511-5\" pgmap=\"511\">In my opinion the Apportionment act of January 11, 1898, entitled \u201cAn act to amend sections 1 and 2 of an act to apportion the State of Illinois into Senatorial districts, and to repeal certain acts therein named, approved June 15, 1893,\u201d is a valid and constitutional enactment, and that the writ in this case should be denied.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
