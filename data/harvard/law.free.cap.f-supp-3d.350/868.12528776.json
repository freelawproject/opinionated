After resolution of the Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (Filing No. 31), the remaining claims in this suit are: (1) a false-arrest claim against the Defendant police officers in their individual capacities; (2) an excessive-force claim against the Defendant police officers in their individual capacities; and (3) a negligence claim against the City of Lincoln.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In four separate motions, Defendants move for summary judgment, arguing that (1) the Defendant police officers are entitled to qualified immunity and to judgment on the merits as to Plaintiff's false-arrest and excessive-force claims (Filing Nos. 73, 74, 75); and (2) the City of Lincoln is entitled to sovereign immunity and to judgment on the merits as to Plaintiff's negligence claim (Filing No. 72).

Plaintiff Barine Deezia was a resident of Lincoln, Nebraska, on March 20, 2016, the date of the incident giving rise to this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   2. City of Lincoln is a political subdivision of the State of Nebraska that provides law enforcement through police officers employed at the Lincoln Police Department (\"LPD\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   3. Defendants Gregory Graham, Aaron Peth, Trey Wayne, Andrew Winkler, Mark Moore, Patrick Murphy, and Jason Drager (collectively \"Defendants\") were police officers with LPD who were acting in the scope of their employment during the incident giving rise to this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   4. On Saturday, March 19, 2016, Nyakiam Domach (\"Domach\"), Barine Deezia (\"Plaintiff\"), Elizabeth Grayer (\"Grayer\") and another male were at a housewarming party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   5. Domach and Plaintiff[ ] had been drinking alcohol that evening.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   6. On Sunday, March 20, 2016, at approximately 12:30 a.m. Domach, Plaintiff,\n   Grayer, and the other male went to \"Main Street Caf\u00e9,\" a bar in downtown Lincoln, Nebraska, near 14th and O Streets.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   7. On Sunday, March 20, 2016, shortly after the close of the bars in downtown Lincoln, Nebraska, at approximately 2:00 a.m. several LPD officers, including Defendants, were monitoring the area of 14th and O Streets.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   8. At the same time, Domach, Plaintiff, Grayer, and the other male left \"Main Street Caf\u00e9.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   9. Nearby the other Defendants were positioned in that area as follows: Officers Graham, Peth, Winkler, and Moore, were on the southwest corner of 14th and O Streets. Officer Wayne was standing on the southeast corner of 14th and O Streets. Officers Murphy and Drager were on the northeast corner of 14th and O Streets.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   10. At that time, each Defendant was in his LPD uniform with his police badge displayed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   11. Officers Graham, Winkler, Murphy, and Drager were wearing body cameras on March 20, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   12. Around 2:04 a.m. Officer Moore saw Domach, Plaintiff, Grayer, and the other male near the southwest corner of 14th and O Streets and commented to Officer Graham, Officer Peth, and Officer Winkler about how drunk Domach appeared.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   13. Officer Moore attempted to talk to the group, but they refused to answer and walked away.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   14. Moments later the Officers saw Ms. Domach being carried across the street northbound by Plaintiff, Ms. Grayer, and the other male. Ms. Domach appeared to be highly intoxicated and nearly unconscious.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   15. Officer Graham and Officer Peth walked across the street northbound in the crosswalk to attempt to contact the group. At the same time, Officer Winkler trailed behind both groups with Juan Ramirez (\"Ramirez\"), who was a civilian ride-along with Officer Winkler that evening.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   16. As the two groups walked across the street, Officer Graham attempted to talk to Plaintiff's group to ensure the wellbeing of Domach and to see if medical attention was required.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   17. Plaintiff began to act in an overagitated manner and was confrontational. Plaintiff stated that \"she is fine, she is 21, she is not driving.\" Officer Graham explained that the group was not in trouble and that the Officers simply wanted to make sure the Domach was okay, whether she knew the individuals carrying her, if medical attention was required, and what establishment they were coming from.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   18. Once they reached the northwest corner, Officer Graham asked the group to sit Ms. Domach in a patio chair in the Jimmy John's outdoor patio area. At that point, Officer Graham attempted to talk to Grayer who appeared to be the calmest and most cooperative.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   19. As this was going on, Officer Winkler and Ramirez stood back approximately 15-20 feet away, but within eyesight.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   20. As Officer Graham attempted to talk to Ms. Grayer, Plaintiff became verbally aggressive and got in Officer Graham's face and began screaming \"do not talk to her\" and then yelled at Grayer telling her \"you will not talk to them\" and \"do not talk to them.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   21. Officer Graham asked Plaintiff several times to be quiet and to step away. Graham also asked Plaintiff to calm down, that they would not be in any trouble if he could simply determine if Domach was safe, knew the group, and where they were coming from.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   22. The Officers told Deezia that they did not want to talk to him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   23. While Plaintiff continued to be belligerent towards Officer Graham, Domach remained unresponsive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   24. Because Plaintiff was making it impossible for Officer Graham to get any information from Grayer, Officer Peth attempted to redirect Plaintiff by asking Plaintiff to step away from the group.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   25. Officer Peth placed his hand on Plaintiff's torso to guide him towards the building to separate him from the group.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   26. Plaintiff was immediately resistive to this and refused to walk with Officer Peth by planting his feet and then pushing Officer Peth in the chest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   27. After being pushed, Officer Peth grabbed Plaintiff's hand and told him to put his hands behind his back. Plaintiff ignored this order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   28. Officer Winkler then approached Plaintiff and Officer Peth. He told Plaintiff to put his hands behind his back as he grabbed one of Plaintiff's hands. Plaintiff did not put his hands behind his back and resisted Officer Peth's and Officer Winkler's attempts to force them behind his back.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   29. While Officer Peth and Officer Winkler were doing this, Officer Graham stayed next to Grayer, Domach and the other male to ensure everyone's safety and make sure no other individuals interfered with Officer Peth or Officer Winkler.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   30. Plaintiff continued to pull and push away from Officer Peth and Officer Winkler, so Officer Peth and Officer Winkler attempted to place Plaintiff on the ground in an effort to gain better control.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   31. Once Plaintiff was on the ground, he continued to struggle and was able to stand back up.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   32. During this time, Officer Moore, who was still over on the southwest corner, heard his name being called. When he turned around, he saw Plaintiff fighting with Officer Peth and Officer Winkler. Officer Moore then ran across the street and began assisting Officer Graham with crowd control.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   33. Officer Peth and Officer Winkler then attempted to back Plaintiff up into the window of Jimmy John's to gain better control of Plaintiff. At the same time, Officer Peth and Officer Winkler told Plaintiff to stop resisting and put his hands behind his back. Plaintiff ignored these commands and continued to pull away from the Officers and actively resisted efforts to be handcuffed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   34. Officer Winkler then attempted to strike Plaintiff's right leg with a closed fist to distract Plaintiff and get him to comply; however, this attempt was unsuccessful and Plaintiff became even more aggressive with Officer Peth and Officer Winkler.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   35. Officer Peth then performed a balance displacement technique to place Plaintiff on the ground a second time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   36. Once on the ground, Plaintiff continued to resist and struggle with Officer Peth and Officer Winkler and was able to return to his feet.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   37. Plaintiff actively tried to get away from the Officers and pulled his arms away.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   38. At this time, from his position across the street, Officer Wayne saw Officer Peth and Officer Winkler physically struggling with Plaintiff and ran across the street to assist.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   39. As Officer Wayne approached the scene, Officer Peth performed a knee strike to Plaintiff's left common peroneal with no effect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   40. Seeing that the knee strike had no effect, Officer Wayne then announced\n   his presence and ordered Plaintiff to \"stop fighting.\" Wayne repeated a second time \"Police stop fighting.\" When those orders were ignored and Plaintiff continued to pull away and fight with the Officers, Officer Wayne grabbed Plaintiff's left wrist and arm above the elbow.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   41. At that time, Officer Wayne, who was at the eastern most outside edge of the patio, pulled out his Taser and ordered that Plaintiff stop or be tased.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   42. Realizing that the Taser would not work in such close quarters, Officer Wayne put away the Taser. As this happened, Officer Murphy and Officer Drager saw what was going on and ran across the street to help.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   43. As Officer Drager and Officer Murphy reach[ed] the patio area, Plaintiff moved towards the outside of the patio towards Officer Wayne and the approaching officers. Upon reaching the patio, Plaintiff moved to the east edge of the patio near Officer Murphy, so Officer Murphy reached for Plaintiff's arm, but was unable to grab ahold of it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   44. Plaintiff continued to move towards the patio's exit, towards Officer Drager, so Officer Drager grabbed Plaintiff's head to pull him forward towards the ground, but Plaintiff pushed and pulled away from Officer Drager.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   45. Breaking through to outside the gated patio, Plaintiff went towards Officer Wayne and wrapped him up around his waist. Faced with the option of either falling backwards on his back and being in an extremely dangerous position, or counter Plaintiff's forward momentum, Officer Wayne took advantage of Plaintiff's forward moment[um] and performed an inside takedown to displace Plaintiff and get him to the ground.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   46. Plaintiff landed on the sidewalk hitting his head as he landed. As Officer Winkler and Officer Murphy applied handcuffs, they realized Plaintiff was unconscious due to hitting his head when he landed. Officer Wayne and Officer Graham immediately called for medical personnel while Officer Murphy and Officer Wayne moved Plaintiff to his side in the recovery position.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   47. Medical personnel were dispatched to the scene at 2:05 a.m.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   48. Medical personnel arrived and Plaintiff was ultimately transported to Bryan West Medical Center by Lincoln Fire and Rescue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   49. Upon arrival at [the] hospital, Plaintiff continued to be very combative, screaming and yelling.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   50. While at the hospital Plaintiff was uncooperative and noncompliant with the nurse and initially refused treatment. Medical personnel did not allow Plaintiff to refuse treatment unless he tested .000 for breath alcohol content. Plaintiff attempted to calculate the amount of time since his last drink to decide if he was going to allow testing of his alcohol level and ultimately refused the test. After doing this and repeated ongoing discussions with the medical providers, Plaintiff eventually relented and allowed hospital personnel to evaluate and treat him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   51. While at the hospital, Plaintiff told Officer Murphy and medical personnel that he was at home when he got a telephone call from a friend who was having issues with his girlfriend and needed help with a ride from Main Street. Plaintiff explained he was only at Main Street for a few minutes and did not drink there. He also initially denied drinking at all that evening.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   52. Plaintiff was ultimately treated at the hospital for a fractured left scapula and discharged from the hospital at approximately 5:30 a.m.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   53. From the hospital, Officer Wayne and Officer Peth then transported Plaintiff to the Lancaster County Department of Corrections.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   54. While being booked into jail, Plaintiff was given a preliminary breath test which showed that Plaintiff had a breath alcohol content of 0.114.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   (Filing Nos. 77-80, Defs.' Briefs Supp. Motions Summ J. (Statements of Material Facts) (citations to pleadings and evidence omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Plaintiff's \"Statement of Additional Material Facts\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   1. In the evening of Saturday, March 19, 2016, Plaintiff Barine Deezia (\"Mr. Deezia\") was at a housewarming party for two of his friends, Nyakiam Domach (\"Ms. Domach\") and Meelubari Maaloo (\"Mr. Maaloo\"), with another friend, Elizabeth Grayer (\"Ms. Grayer\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   2. Shortly after midnight, Ms. Domach, Mr. Maaloo, Ms. Grayer and Mr. Deezia went to Main Street Bar (\"Main Street\") on O Street, Lincoln, Nebraska where they stayed until a few minutes before 2:00 a.m.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   3. While at Main Street, none of the individuals in Mr. Deezia's party drank any alcohol as they had gone to the bar to enjoy the music.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   4. As soon as the four individuals exited Main Street, they were confronted by Lincoln Police Officers who asked Ms. Grayer and Mr. Deezia if Ms. Domach was okay, to which they replied that she was.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   5. As the group walked down O Street toward North 14th Street, another Lincoln Police Officer apparently thought Ms. Domach appeared drunk and asked the group which bar made Ms. Domach so drunk, to which the group responded that Ms. Domach did not have any alcohol at a bar and that the group was going home.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   6. At the intersection of O Street and North 14th Street, the group of friends stopped to wait for a cross-walk signal to cross the street to the north.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   7. By the time the group reached the intersection, there were four Lincoln Police Officers following them, including one of the officers that had questioned them outside Main Street.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   8. While they were waiting for the cross-walk signal at O Street and North 14th Street, an officer again asked if Ms. Domach was okay. For a third time, the group explained that Ms. Domach was okay and that they were going home. They also explained that Ms. Grayer was the designated driver.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   9. Mr. Maaloo and Ms. Grayer helped Ms. Domach cross O Street and the officers followed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   10. In the middle of the intersection, the officers again asked at what bar the group had been.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   11. Again, individuals in the group explained that Ms. Domach was fine and that they were going home.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   12. After they crossed O Street, they helped Ms. Domach sit down in a chair in the outside dining area of Jimmy John's Restaurant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   13. None of the officers told the group to sit Ms. Domach down.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   14. At the time when Ms. Domach sat down outside Jimmy John's, the group was under no obligation to speak to the officers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   15. The outside dining area of Jimmy John's has a metal fence around it with a small opening opposite the restaurant's front entrance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   16. Mr. Maaloo, Ms. Domach, Ms. Grayer and Mr. Deezia were all inside the enclosed area.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   17. Defendants Officer Gregory Graham and Officer Aaron Peth stopped to talk to the group again.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   18. Officer Graham stood in the opening of the metal fence. At the criminal trial, Officer Peth testified that at least two officers blocked the entryway of the outside patio and that Mr. Deezia would have to walk through the officers to leave. Officer Peth never told Mr. Deezia that he was free to leave.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   19. Officer Graham continued to ask the same questions to which Mr. Deezia replied, \"She's fine. We are going home.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   20. Officer Graham said he did not want to talk to Mr. Deezia and that he wanted to talk to Ms. Grayer so Mr. Deezia stopped talking and took a step back to let the officers talk to Ms. Grayer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   21. Officer Graham asked Ms. Grayer the same questions to which Ms. Grayer responded, \"We are going home. We are taking her home. I am the designated driver.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   22. During this conversation, Mr. Deezia did not interrupt Ms. Grayer, move toward either officer, nor push or touch either officer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   23. Officer Graham again asked Ms. Grayer the same questions that had been answered many times since the friends left Main Street.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   24. Officer Graham admitted at the criminal trial that the officers had been informed multiple times that Ms. Domach was okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   25. After Officer Graham asked the same questions, Ms. Grayer looked over at Mr. Deezia and Mr. Deezia told her, \"You don't have to answer the question if you don't want to.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   26. Officer Peth responded, \"What did you say?\" Mr. Deezia repeated, \"She doesn't have to answer if she doesn't want to.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   27. Officer Peth grabbed Mr. Deezia's arm and repeated, \"What did you say?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   28. Mr. Deezia told Officer Peth not to touch him and tried to move back, but Officer Peth began to push Mr. Deezia.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   29. Before Officer Peth initiated physical contact, Mr. Deezia was not physically aggressive, did not try to punch Officer Peth, and did not make any direct threats toward Officer Peth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   30. Mr. Deezia was never physically aggressive with Officer Graham.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   31. Officer Peth, Officer Andrew Winkler and one other officer shoved Mr. Deezia against the front window of Jimmy John's, causing him to lose his balance and stumble.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   32. As Mr. Deezia tried to regain his balance, Officer Trey Wayne used a maneuver called an \"inside takedown\", which caused Mr. Deezia to be thrown to the ground and strike his head on the sidewalk.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   33. When performing the inside takedown, Officer Wayne's body weight of 250 pounds fell on top of Mr. Deezia's head.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   34. When using an inside takedown, an officer is supposed to go on his knees and not fall full weight on the other individual.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   35. Mr. Deezia lost consciousness when his head struck the sidewalk. When he regained consciousness, he was laying face down with an officer's knee in his back.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   36. Officer Wayne did not know Mr. Deezia had lost consciousness until after Mr. Deezia was already in handcuffs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   37. From the time he was thrown against the restaurant's window, Mr. Deezia was repeatedly struck by the officers' fists, elbows, and knees, which continued after Mr. Deezia had already been handcuffed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   38. During the entire incident, none of the individual defendants told Mr. Deezia that he was under arrest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   39. During the entire incident, Mr. Deezia did not hear any officer say, \"Put your hands behind your back.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   40. During the entire incident, Mr. Deezia did not hear any officer say \"stop fighting\" or \"stop resisting\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   41. Along with the loss of consciousness, Mr. Deezia suffered a fracture of the coracoid[ ] process of his left shoulder, cuts, bruises, scrapes, and contusions as a result of being thrown against the window, thrown against the sidewalk, and struck by the officers' hands, elbows, and knees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   42. Mr. Deezia was arrested and charged with resisting arrest and obstructing a peace officer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   43. On November 10, 2016, after a three day trial, a jury returned a unanimous verdict of \"not guilty\" to these charges within an hour.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   (Filing Nos. 82-85, Pl.'s Briefs Opp'n Motions Summ.
