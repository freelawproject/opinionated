The Court does not believe that \"contrary to law\" accurately reflects the deferential standard of review that the Court intends to use when there is no objection. Finding that a Magistrate Judge's recommendation is contrary to law would require the Court to analyze the Magistrate Judge's application of law to the facts or the Magistrate Judge's delineation of the facts -- in other words performing a de novo review, which is required only when a party objects to the recommendations. The Court believes adding \"obviously\" better reflects that the Court is not performing a de novo review of the Magistrate Judges' recommendations. Going forward, therefore, the Court will, as it has done for some time now, review Magistrate Judges' recommendations to which there are no objections for whether the recommendations are clearly erroneous, arbitrary, <em>obviously</em> contrary to law, or an abuse of discretion.</attorneys>\n</footnote>\n<opinion type=\"majority\"><p id=\"p-6\"><strong><em>MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER ADOPTING THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE'S PROPOSED FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDED DISPOSITION</em></strong></p><p id=\"p-7\"><strong>THIS MATTER</strong> comes before the Court on the Magistrate Judge's Proposed Findings and Recommended Disposition, filed October 10, 2018 (Doc. 16)(\"PFRD\"). The PFRD notifies Plaintiff Benjamin Archuleta of his ability to file objections within fourteen days and that failure to do so waives appellate review. <em>See</em> PFRD at 4. To date, Archuleta has not filed any objections, and there is nothing in the record indicating that the proposed findings were not delivered. The Court concludes that the Honorable Laura Fashing, United States Magistrate Judge for the District of New Mexico's conclusions are not clearly <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"1125\" href=\"#p1125\" id=\"p1125\">*1125</a>erroneous, arbitrary, obviously contrary to law, or an abuse of discretion, and the Court therefore adopts them.

The district judge may accept, reject, or modify the recommended disposition; receive further evidence; or return the matter to the magistrate judge with instructions.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3).

The Supreme Court of the United States of America -- in the course of approving the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit's use of the waiver rule -- has noted:</p><p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-15\">It does not appear that Congress intended to require district court review of a magistrate's factual or legal conclusions, under a de novo or any other standard, when neither party objects to those findings. The House and Senate Reports accompanying the 1976 amendments do not expressly consider what sort of review the district court should perform when no party objects to the magistrate's report. <em>See</em> S. Rep. No. 94-625, pp. 9-10 (1976) (hereinafter Senate Report); H.R. Rep. No. 94-1609, p. 11 (1976), U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1976, p. 6162 (hereinafter House Report). There is nothing in those Reports, however, that demonstrates an intent to require the district court to give any more consideration to the magistrate's report than the court considers appropriate. Moreover, the Subcommittee that drafted and held hearings on the 1976 amendments had before it the guidelines of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts concerning the efficient use of magistrates. Those guidelines recommended to the district courts that \"[w]here a magistrate makes a finding or ruling on a motion or an issue, his determination should become that of the district court, unless specific objection is filed within a reasonable time.\" <em>See</em> Jurisdiction of United States Magistrates, Hearings on S. 1283 before the Subcommittee on Improvements in Judicial Machinery of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 94th Cong., 1st Sess., 24 (1975)(emphasis added)(hereinafter Senate Hearings). The Committee also heard Judge Metzner of the Southern District of New York, the chairman of a Judicial Conference Committee on the administration of the magistrate system, testify that he personally followed that practice. See id., at 11 (\"If <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"1127\" href=\"#p1127\" id=\"p1127\">*1127</a>any objections come in, ... I review [the record] and decide it. If no objections come in, I merely sign the magistrate's order.\"). The Judicial Conference of the United States, which supported the de novo standard of review eventually incorporated in 636(b)(1)(C), opined that in most instances no party would object to the magistrate's recommendation, and the litigation would terminate with the judge's adoption of the magistrate's report. <em>See</em> Senate Hearings, at 35, 37. Congress apparently assumed, therefore, that any party who was dissatisfied for any reason with the magistrate's report would file objections, and those objections would trigger district court review. There is no indication that Congress, in enacting \u00a7 636(b)(1)(C) ), intended to require a district judge to review a magistrate's report to which no objections are filed. It did not preclude treating the failure to object as a procedural default, waiving the right to further consideration of any sort. We thus find nothing in the statute or the legislative history that convinces us that Congress intended to forbid a rule such as the one adopted by the Sixth Circuit.</p><p id=\"p-17\">The Tenth Circuit has also noted, \"however, that '[t]he waiver rule as a procedural bar need not be applied when the interests of justice so dictate.' \" <em>One Parcel</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414162\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/73/1057/#p1059\">73 F.3d at 1060</extracted-citation> (quoting <em>Moore v.

In <em>One Parcel</em>, the Tenth Circuit noted that the district judge had decided sua sponte to conduct a de novo review despite the lack of specificity in the objections, but the Tenth Circuit held that it would deem the issues waived on appeal because it would advance the interests underlying the waiver rule. <em>See</em> <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414162\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/73/1057/#p1059\">73 F.3d at </extracted-citation>1060-61 (citing cases from other Courts of Appeals where district courts elected to address merits despite potential application of waiver rule, but Courts of Appeals opted to enforce waiver rule).</p><p id=\"p-18\">Where a party files timely and specific objections to the Magistrate Judge's proposed findings and recommendation, \"on ... dispositive motions, the statute calls for a de novo determination, not a de novo hearing.\" <em>United States v.
