These categories include, among others, felons, fugitives, illegal drug users and addicts, illegal aliens, and those convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. Also included in this list are those who have \"been adjudicated as a mental defective or ... been committed to a mental institution.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(4). Defendant Mark Andrew McMichael is a gun collector. He has numerous firearms in his collection and, as recently as February 2016, Mr. McMichael has regularly renewed his Federal Firearms License from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. According to the government, he is also an individual who has been committed to a mental institution, and so he has violated federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The government centers its argument on Mr. McMichael's approximately twelve-day hospitalization during May 2014 at the\n   Munson Medical Center in Traverse City. During this time two doctors completed certificates that stated Mr. McMichael required mental health treatment. But no court, committee, board, or other authoritative body ever determined Mr. McMichael needed to be committed to a mental institution. Rather, after the physicians completed their certifications, Mr. McMichael elected to defer a hearing and to cooperate with treatment. He completed the treatment and was discharged from the hospital without any court order putting him there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Believing the hospitalization was enough to satisfy the predicate of being \"committed to a mental institution\" the government has charged Mr. McMichael in the Indictment with being a committed person in possession of firearms and ammunition, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(4). The government has also charged Mr. McMichael with making a false statement in a firearms license application, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A), for failing to affirmatively state on his subsequent renewal application that he had been committed to a mental institution. Mr. McMichael moves to dismiss both charges because, as a matter of law, he had never been committed to a mental institution or, in the alternative, he received insufficient process to deny him his Second Amendment rights. In the Court's view, Mr. McMichael's hospitalization does not amount to a commitment under the statute, and he did not make false statements when renewing his firearms license, as a matter of law. Therefore, the motion to dismiss must be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mr. McMichael brings the instant motion under FED. R. CRIM. P. 12(b)(3)(B)(v) as a motion to dismiss the indictment for failure to state an offense.

Nicole described several changes that she had observed in her husband's behavior, and she wrote that\n   her husband needed treatment. The same day, Mr. McMichael was admitted to the Munson Medical Center, though he asserts his admission was voluntary and that he did not know his wife had completed the petition. It is clear that no court ordered the admission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Between May 10 and May 12, Mr. McMichael was treated at the medical center. Then, on May 12, 2014, Dr. Douglas Gentry, M.D., completed a Grand Traverse County Probate Court form entitled \"Clinical Certificate.\" On the form, Dr. Gentry diagnosed Mr. McMichael with \"acute paranoia / schizophrenia\" (ECF No. 18-1, PageID.49) and he reported that Mr. McMichael was a person requiring treatment. Dr. Gentry recommended that Mr. McMichael be hospitalized. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.50). Thereafter, Mr. McMichael was transferred to the medical center's behavioral health services program. On May 13, 2014, Mr. McMichael was examined by a psychiatrist, Dr. Thomas Harding, M.D. After the examination, Dr. Harding completed a second certificate that was identical to the one completed by Dr. Gentry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.51). Dr. Harding diagnosed Mr. McMichael with psychosis, and further concluded that Mr. McMichael required treatment. He too recommended hospitalization. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.51-52). These certificates were filed with the probate court, and Mr. McMichael was appointed counsel. The next step was a court hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   However, on May 15, 2014 and before any hearing took place, Mr. McMichael signed a completed probate court form entitled \"Request to Defer Hearing on Commitment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.56). On the form, Mr. McMichael checked a box indicating that he agreed to a combined hospitalization and alternative treatment program for up to 90 days, with hospitalization not to exceed 60 days. Mr. McMichael further requested that his court hearing be deferred, and he affirmed that he understood he could refuse subsequent treatment and demand a court hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. McMichael was then treated by Munson's behavioral health services and discharged on May 21, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Throughout the following years, Mr. McMichael maintained his firearm collection and regularly renewed his firearms license. The applications he completed contained the following statement: \"Under penalties imposed by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , I certify that the statements contained in this renewal application, and any attached statements, are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\" One of the questions in the renewal application asked Mr. McMichael \"have you ever been committed to any mental institution?\" The government states Mr. McMichael answered in the negative, and at least for purposes of this motion, Mr. McMichael does not aver otherwise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 1, 2017, acting on a tip, ATF agents executed a search warrant at Mr. McMichael's residence and recovered the firearms and ammunition listed in the indictment. On May 8, 2018, the grand jury returned the Indictment in this case. (ECF No. 1). Mr. McMichael filed his motion to dismiss on August 1, 2018 (ECF No. 18) and the Court heard oral argument on September 13, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Under \u00a7 922(g), \"the government must prove three elements: (1) the defendant falls within one of the categories listed in the \u00a7 922(g) subdivisions ('the status element'); (2) the defendant possessed a firearm or ammunition ('the possession element'); and (3) the possession was 'in or affecting [interstate or foreign] commerce.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Rehaif\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516639\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/1138/#p1143\">\n    888 F.3d 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1143 (11th Cir. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Mr. McMichael is charged under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(4). The status element in that section is that of a person \"who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or who has been committed to a mental institution[.]\" Read in total, Section 922(g)(4) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   It shall be unlawful for any person-(4) who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution, to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The possession and interstate commerce elements of the statute are not at issue in this motion. And the government does not contend that Mr. McMichael has been adjudicated as a mental defective. But the government does argue that Mr. McMichael was committed to a mental institution and, therefore, is prohibited from possessing firearms and ammunition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Section 922(g)(4) does not define \"committed\" and both sides offer competing\n   constructions. The government, relying on\n   <em>\n    United States v. Vertz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"933131\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/40/69/#p70\">\n    40 F. App'x 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2002), an unpublished split decision by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, argues it is enough that two physicians provided certifications affirming the necessity of the commitment. On the other hand, Mr. McMichael contends that a temporary and ex parte hospitalization is not enough for a commitment under the statute, and some formal action by an authoritative body is required to satisfy the statute (as well as due process). Accordingly, the dispositive question presented by both sides is whether Mr. McMichael's May 2014 hospitalization-one that all agree was not triggered by an adversary proceeding or adjudicative decision-amounts to a commitment to a mental institution under Section 922(g)(4). The Court concludes it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Interpreting the Statute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court begins by looking at the statute itself. \"The language of the statute is the starting point for interpretation, and it should also be the ending point if the plain meaning of that language is clear.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Jackson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4029690\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/635/205/#p209\">\n    635 F.3d 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 209 (6th Cir. 2011) (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Language Itself\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court finds that to be \"committed\" for purposes of this statute means more than that an individual spent time in a mental institution. This conclusion is based, first of all, on the word itself. To \"commit\" means \"to place officially in confinement or custody\"\n   <em>\n    American Heritage College Dictionary\n   </em>\n   280 (3d ed. 1997); or \"[t]o send (a person) to prison or to a mental-health facility, esp. by court order\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   329 (10th ed. 2004); or \"to place in or send officially to confinement ... to consign legally to a mental institution.\"\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary\n   </em>\n   457 (1976). Notably, at least for the sources available to the Court, all the definitions contemplate to some degree an official or authoritative act. And this interpretation is further bolstered by the specific context in which the language was used. Section 922(g)(4) contains two separate status elements: (1) adjudicated as a mental defective; or (2) committed to a mental institution. Clearly, the former element requires some sort of authoritative decision. And in putting the two together in the same section, it makes sense that Congress contemplated that both status elements required an official act, which is consistent with the definitions laid out above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    B. The Context of the State Process\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A look at context logically invites an examination of the state commitment process in Michigan-the state where Mr. McMichael was hospitalized. The government objects that the question here is one of federal law and urges the Court not to rely on the state terminology. (ECF No. 24, PageID.122). The government also points the Court to language from the Sixth Circuit suggesting that to do otherwise would be to \"sacrifice any hope of\n   uniform application of the federal statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Vertz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"933131\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/40/69/#p70\">\n    40 F. App'x at 74-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Of course, whether a person has been committed to a mental institution for purposes of the statute is a question of federal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Giardina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537344\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/861/1334/#p1335\">\n    861 F.2d 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1335 (5th Cir. 1988). The Court agrees that the labels a state chooses to use in its statutes are not controlling. But the State process is still a natural, appropriate, and correct place to understand the adjudicative or committal process. Federal courts already look to state law to determine whether certain predicate convictions count as disqualifying felonies under Section 922(g)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Zellars\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3974352\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/334/742/#p744\">\n    334 F.

The same principle applies here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This is also consistent with the decisions of several circuit courts that have been tasked with interpreting Section 922(g)(4) and have uniformly concluded that it is permissible to look to state commitment procedures for guidance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Giardina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537344\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/861/1334/#p1335\">\n    861 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1335 ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Accordingly, the Court turns to the framework of the commitment process in Michigan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Mr. McMichael was hospitalized under Chapter Four of Michigan's mental health code, and specifically under the procedures for admission by medical certification, set out at MICH.

Thereafter, \"as soon after hospitalization as is practicable\" which usually must be no more than 24 hours after hospitalization, an individual hospitalized under Section 1423 must be examined by a separate psychiatrist.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the psychiatrist does not certify that the individual requires treatment, then the individual must be released. However, if the psychiatrist does certify that the individual requires treatment, then the individual's \"hospitalization may continue pending hearings convened\" under later sections of the mental health code. MICH. COMP. LAWS \u00a7 330.1430. The hospital is required to provide a notice of hospitalization, along with the petition and two clinical certificates to the probate court. MICH. COMP. LAWS \u00a7 330.1431(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The second step of admission by the medical certification process is a court hearing. This process is set out in Sections 1451 through 1468 of the mental health code. Section 1452 begins by requiring that after a court receives the petition and two certificates, a hearing must \"be convened promptly,\" that is, no more than seven days after the court receives the documents. The court is further required to appoint counsel if the individual is not represented. MICH. COMP. LAWS \u00a7 330.1454. Section 1458, in turn, provides that an individual may demand that a jury decide whether the individual requires treatment, or is legally incompetent. And Section 1461 requires, in most cases, that a physician or licensed psychologist who has personally examined the individual must testify in person or by written deposition at the hearing. Furthermore, Section 1465 states that the court or jury may not find that an individual is a person requiring treatment unless it has been established by clear and convincing evidence. Section 1468 then provides that at the conclusion of the hearing, if an individual is found not to be a person requiring treatment, the court is required to order that the individual be discharged. However, if the individual is found to be a person requiring treatment, the court is required to order that the individual be hospitalized, order that the individual undergo an alternative program, order a combination of hospitalization and alternative treatment, or order assisted outpatient treatment. MICH. COMP. LAWS \u00a7 330.1468.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   An individual temporarily hospitalized under a medical certification, however, may not always proceed to a court hearing. This is because Section 1455 of the mental health code states that an individual may defer a hearing and elect to be treated on\n   a voluntary basis. Specifically, under Section 1455(6) an individual who otherwise would be set to appear for a hearing to determine whether he or she is a person requiring treatment \"may file with the court a request to temporarily defer the hearing[.]\" MICH. COMP. LAWS \u00a7 330.1455(6). The section further provides that \"[t]he request shall include a stipulation that the individual agrees to remain hospitalized and to accept treatment as may be prescribed\" and that \"[t]he request to temporarily defer the hearing shall be on a form provided by the department [of mental health] and signed by the individual in the presence of his or her legal counsel and shall be filed with the court by legal counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"933131\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/40/69/#p70\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Once the deferral request and stipulation have been received by the court, the court is required to defer the hearing. During this time, the petition and clinical certificates remain valid, and the court retains jurisdiction. Furthermore, after the deferral request and stipulation have been received by the hospital, the hospital is required to \"treat the individual as a formal voluntary patient without requiring the individual to sign formal voluntary admission forms.\" If an individual subsequently refuses treatment or requests a hearing, the court is required to be notified, which will then convene a hearing. MICH. COMP. LAWS \u00a7 330.1455(7) - (8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    C. The Construction of \"Committed\" in Section 922(g)(4)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   After a look at the language itself as well as the context in which that language is used, which includes a look at the state process, the Court holds that the plain meaning of \"committed\" for purposes of Section 922(g)(4) is not broad enough to cover what happened to Mr. McMichael. Rather the term requires that a third party direct that the individual be treated by a mental institution, and that the third party be some official or authoritative body making the decision on an evidentiary record. In other words, under the statute, a commitment does not occur until the completion of an adversary process that results in an adjudicative decision in favor of hospitalization.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The text of Section 922(g)(4) drives this result, but the interpretation is consistent with the definition of \"committed\" as found in the text of the Federal Firearm Regulations. Under the applicable regulation, \"committed to a mental institution\" means:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   A formal commitment of a person to a mental institution by a court, board, commission, or other lawful authority. The term includes a commitment to a mental institution involuntarily. The term includes commitment for mental defectiveness or mental illness. It also includes commitments for other reasons, such as for drug use. The term does not include a person in a mental institution for observation or a voluntary admission to a mental institution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20478.11\">\n    27 C.F.R. \u00a7 478.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The regulation makes clear, therefore, that a voluntary hospitalization or a hospitalization for observation does not amount being \"committed to a mental institution\" and, furthermore, that an affirmative commitment decision by some authoritative body is also required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The result the Court reaches is also consistent with how the Department of Justice, in a 2014 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, understood the term:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Persons are not considered to have been \"committed to a mental institution\" as a result of a voluntary admission to a mental institution or a temporary admission for observation unless the temporary admission for observation turns into a qualifying commitment as a result of a formal commitment by a court, board, commission, or other lawful authority.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Amended Definition of \"Adjudicated as a Mental Defective\" and \"Committed to a Mental Institution\" (2010R-21P),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%20774\">\n    79 Fed.

Instead, he received a hearing five days after being hospitalized. At the hearing, the probate court concluded that Mr. Vertz was a person requiring treatment. \"This probate court order did not, however, result in a hospital commitment.

True, both the district court and the Sixth Circuit found that the requirements of a commitment under Section 922(g)(4) were met once the second certification had been completed, and distinguished two other circuit decisions on this basis. But a review of the Sixth Circuit's entire decision demonstrates that it was also important that Mr. Vertz had been declared mentally ill by a court-something that never happened for Mr. McMichael. In distinguishing the other cases, the Sixth Circuit relied on the probate court's determination that Mr. Vertz was mentally ill.\n   <em>\n    Vertz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"933131\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/40/69/#p70\">\n    40 F.

In\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Baum\n   </em>\n   , the court held that in the context of school discipline, the opportunity to confront and cross examine an accuser-one key component of an adversary process-is required by the Constitution when the school must \"choose between competing narratives to resolve a case.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Baum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518564\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/903/575/#p578\">\n    903 F.3d 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 578-79 (6th Cir. 2018). If such an adversary process is necessary to remove an individual from a public school, it follows that there is at least a fair due process question whether the same type of proceeding is required before there is a permanent deprivation of an individuals' right to possess a firearm. And as we have already seen, similar concerns led the Court in\n   <em>\n    Rehlander\n   </em>\n   to hold that a temporary ex parte hospitalization does not amount to a commitment under Section 922(g)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Without some type of adversary process, the risk of an erroneous (and permanent) deprivation of Mr. McMichael's Second Amendment rights, and others like him, is particularly high. Hospitalization for mental health reasons often arises in times of family turbulence or other emotionally charged settings. The competing narratives in this case illustrate the risks. According to Mr. McMichael, he voluntarily admitted himself to Munson Healthcare after experiencing several stressful events in his life. He suggests that at the time his wife was cheating on him with Michigan State Police Lieutenant Scott Woodward, the individual she married after her divorce from Mr. McMichael. It is not hard to imagine a spouse in a marital conflict with motive to embellish the extent of her husband's symptoms, which in turn could have tainted the examinations of Dr. Gentry and Dr. Harding. Yet this was all there was to support hospitalization without an adversary hearing. Then, after Mr. McMichael and his wife divorced, the court awarded Mr. McMichael custody of his children. After Mr. McMichael's ex-wife married Lieutenant Woodward, the new couple asked that Mr. McMichael agree to changing the terms of the custody arrangement. When Mr. McMichael refused, Lieutenant Woodward threatened to tip off ATF agents about Mr. McMichael's stay at Munson Medical Center. Lieutenant Woodward ultimately went through with the threat, leading to the instant charges against Mr. McMichael.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The government does not accept this narrative, and a fact-finder may not either. But the story is certainly plausible, and capable of repetition in other cases, illustrating the risk of an erroneous deprivation of Second Amendment rights in a process that does not incorporate adversary\n   protections. An adversary hearing would provide an opportunity for an individual to present such arguments to an authoritative body, and question the physicians who recommended the individual be hospitalized. A statutory construction of \"committed\" that requires an adversary process avoids the constitutional questions that would arise if\n   <em>\n    Vertz\n   </em>\n   is extended beyond its facts to apply in a case like this, where no court ever made a finding mandating commitment. As\n   <em>\n    Rehlander\n   </em>\n   persuasively demonstrates, an ex parte hearing is not enough to fall within the Section 922(g)(4) prohibition; some adversary process is necessary for a \"commit[ment]\" under Section 922(g)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    E. Waiver / Deferral\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The government argues that even if an adversary process is required to trigger the Section 922(g)(4) prohibition, it was available to Mr. McMichael under the Michigan statute. Rather than proceed with the hearing, Mr. McMichael elected to defer the hearing and proceed with treatment. According to the government, Mr. McMichael cannot use the deferral process both as a sword and a shield, and this Court should find that Mr. McMichael voluntarily waived his right to an adversary hearing, eliminating any statutory or constitutional problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court disagrees. The parties all agree that no adversary process actually happened at any time before or during Mr. McMichael's stay at the Munson Medical Center. Under the state law process, Munson was required to treat Mr. McMichael as a formal voluntary patient. MICH. COMP. LAWS \u00a7 330.1455(8). The available record suggests that Mr. Michael made multiple comments expressing a desire to go home, but neither party suggests that Mr. McMichael ever refused to continue his treatment or demanded a court hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \"A waiver is ordinarily an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Zerbst,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10805\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/304/458/#p464\">\n    304 U.S. 458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 464,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10805\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/304/458/#p464\">\n    58 S.Ct. 1019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10805\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/304/458/#p464\">\n    82 L.Ed. 1461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1938) ; accord\n   <em>\n    United States v. Riddle,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11098541\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/249/529/#p534\">\n    249 F.3d 529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 534 (6th Cir. 2001). Here, the government has not shown that Mr. McMichael intentionally relinquished or abandoned his right under the Michigan statutory framework to a hearing in front of the probate court. In fact the form Mr. McMichael signed that requested a deferral of his hearing confirms that Mr. McMichael retained the right to have a hearing. In other words, Mr. McMichael relinquished nothing. Choosing to defer an opportunity to have a hearing is not the same thing as waiving a right to have the hearing. Accordingly, the Court finds this argument to be unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Section 924(a)(1)(A) Count\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The government charges Defendant not only with possession of a firearm after commitment to a mental institution under Section 922(g)(4) -a charge that cannot be legally sustained on the admitted facts-but also with lying on his firearm collector license renewal form. Under Section 924(a)(1)(A), it is a crime to \"knowingly make[ ] any false statement or representation\" on such a form. Following his stay at Munson Medical Center in 2014, Mr. McMichael submitted collector renewal forms in which he answered \"no\" to the question of whether he had ever been committed to any mental institution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Court has just held that a temporary, ex parte hospitalization with no adjudication does not amount to having been \"committed to a mental institution\" under Section 922(g)(4). Since all agree Mr. McMichael was only temporarily hospitalized under ex parte procedures, he was never committed to a mental institution for purposes of Section 922(g)(4). And\n   accordingly, he did not make any false statement-knowingly or otherwise-on the renewal forms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The government insists this charge must stand independently of Section 924(g)(4) because Mr. McMichael's statement was false when he made it, at least under an extension of\n   <em>\n    Vertz\n   </em>\n   . A contrary finding, it says, would permit license seekers to \"guess\" on what the law might be in the future and escape the consequences of an incomplete disclosure. The Court disagrees. The only hospitalization at issue is the 2014 stay at Munson, which does not qualify as a \"commitment\" because it was never the result of an adversary hearing. Mr. McMichael did not, therefore, make a false statement on the ATF form when he renewed his firearms license and reported honestly that he had never been committed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Spring\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317361\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/886/37/#p39\">\n    886 F.Supp.2d 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 39 (D. Me. 2012) (granting a defense motion for acquittal of a similar charge after the\n   <em>\n    Rehlander\n   </em>\n   decision). If the form had asked Mr. McMichael to list all hospitalizations, whether by commitment or otherwise, perhaps the outcome would be different. But that is not what the form asked.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Count 2 of the Indictment, the only other charge in this case, must also be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   For all these reasons, the Indictment is dismissed in its entirety. The Court is making no judgment on policy grounds about whether Mr. McMichael should, or should not, be permitted to possess firearms and ammunition.
