The Motion requires the court to decide whether it has subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiff's claim and, if so, whether Plaintiff has stated a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), 12(b)(6). The court concludes the answer to both is yes. Thus, as more fully explained below, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Verby Burton is the widow of a deceased coal miner, Allan Burton, who Defendant Drummond Company employed to work in its coal mines in Alabama. (Doc. # 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 8-12). Allan Burton died in 2015 from coal workers' pneumoconiosis, commonly known as black lung disease. (Doc. # 15 at 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Prior to his death, Allan Burton filed a claim for benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act (\"BLBA\") with the Department of Labor (\"DOL\"). (Doc. # 1 at \u00b6 13; Doc. # 15 at 4-7). After his death, Verby Burton filed an additional and separate claim for survivor's benefits under the Act. (Doc. # 1 at \u00b6 14; Doc. # 15 at 11-12). The DOL granted both Allan and Verby Burton's claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 15-22; Doc. # 15 at 24-55, 91-100). On Allan's claim, the DOL ordered Drummond to (1) pay $12,197.90 in retroactive benefits to Verby (on behalf of Allan) and (2) reimburse the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund $18,897.70 for interim benefits paid to Allan prior to his death. (Doc. # 15 at 54). On Verby's claim, the DOL ordered Drummond to (1) begin paying Verby monthly benefits of $644.50 per month and (2) reimburse the Trust Fund $12,832.40 for interim benefits paid to Verby beginning in April 2015, when the DOL initially determined she was eligible for benefits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 99). In its compensation orders, the DOL informed Drummond that \"by failing to initiate benefits ... within 10 days of the date payment is due, [Drummond] may be subject to payments of additional compensation of up to 20% of the amount due,\" pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20914\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20725.607\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Doc. # 15 at 55, 100). The orders also explained that \"failure to pay benefits as ordered may result in enforcement of the final award in Federal District Court\" and that \"[a]n appeal does not stay this penalty unless an Order staying payments has been issued by the Board or Court.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Drummond declined to pay the benefits and instead appealed the decisions of the administrative law judges (\"ALJs\") to the Benefits Review Board.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ; (Docs. # 1 at \u00b6 26; 5-1 at 2-4). Drummond did not obtain an order staying payment of the benefits from the Board (Doc. # 1 at \u00b6 24), so the compensation orders became effective, and payment became due, after the orders issued.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20725.502\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Because Drummond failed to pay the benefits it owed Verby Burton during the pendency of its appeals, the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund began paying Verby Burton's benefits as provided for by statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209501\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 9501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A), and the BLBA's implementing regulations,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20725.522\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). (Doc. # 1 at \u00b6 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Benefits Review Board eventually affirmed in part and vacated in part the ALJ's decision on Allan Burton's claim and remanded the claim to the ALJ. (Doc. # 15 at 106-12). On remand, the ALJ considered additional medical evidence as required by the Board's decision but again awarded benefits on behalf of Allan Burton. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 127-37). Drummond then withdrew its appeal of Verby Burton's claim based on its earlier concession that Verby would be automatically entitled to benefits if Allan's claim succeeded. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 139; Doc. # 5-1 at 3). The DOL's compensation order awarding benefits on Verby Burton's claim (Doc. # 15 at 99-100) became final after Drummond withdrew its appeal. The DOL also issued a new compensation order following the ALJ's decision on remand regarding Allan Burton's claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 142). That compensation order awarded the same benefits as the DOL's first compensation order on Allan Burton's claim-$12,197.90 in retroactive benefits to Verby Burton (on behalf of Allan) and a reimbursement of $18,897.70 to the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund for interim benefits paid to Allan prior to his death. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Once the compensation orders became final, Drummond paid all of the benefits listed in the final compensation orders and reimbursed the Trust Fund for compensation it had paid Verby Burton during the pendency of Drummond's appeals. (Doc. # 5-1 at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 24, 2018, Verby Burton filed this action against Drummond seeking additional compensation and interest she claims Drummond owes her under the DOL's final compensation orders, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20914\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20725.607\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Federal Black Lung Program Statutory Framework\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The federal black lung program derives from several related statutes.

The second is whether a BLBA beneficiary has a right to additional compensation under \u00a7 914(f) where a responsible operator failed to timely pay compensation owed under the terms of an award but the Trust Fund timely paid the compensation in the operator's stead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Drummond argues Ms. Burton's claim should be dismissed because this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over it and because Ms. Burton has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), 12(b)(6). For the reasons explained below, the court concludes both that it has subject matter jurisdiction and that Ms. Burton has stated a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Court Has Subject Matter Jurisdiction Over Ms. Burton's Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Drummond makes three arguments to support its Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss: that Ms. Burton lacks Article III standing, that no federal statute confers subject matter jurisdiction over Ms. Burton's claim, and that Department of Labor regulations deprive this court of jurisdiction over Ms. Burton's claim. The court disagrees, and addresses each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Ms. Burton Has Article III Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Drummond argues Ms. Burton lacks Article III standing because she was timely paid all benefits owed to her under the BLBA, either by Drummond or the Trust Fund, and thus has suffered no injury in fact. But that is obviously wrong. Ms.\n   Burton's claimed injury in this lawsuit is not that she failed to receive the benefits she was initially awarded by the DOL but that she has failed to receive the 20 percent additional compensation she has a right to under \u00a7 914(f). Assuming Ms. Burton has a right to additional compensation under \u00a7 914(f) (an issue the court will return to below), there is no doubt that Drummond's failure to pay her that additional compensation creates Article III standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Via Mat Int'l S.

Here the DOL has not issued any order awarding Ms. Burton the 20 percent additional compensation she seeks under \u00a7 914(f), let alone one that has become final. Thus, Drummond argues Ms. Burton must first obtain a supplemental order from the DOL awarding her additional compensation under \u00a7 914(f) before seeking to enforce her right to such compensation via a \u00a7 921(d) action in federal district court. This is an issue of first impression in the Eleventh Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Drummond is correct that \u00a7 921(d) only authorizes district courts to enforce existing final compensation orders issued by the DOL; it does not authorize district courts to make their own independent awards of benefits under the BLBA.

(Doc. # 15 at 99-100, 142).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   However, it does not follow from these premises that Ms. Burton may not collect any additional compensation owed to her under \u00a7 914(f) through a \u00a7 921(d) action in federal court. To understand why this is so, one must pay careful attention \u00a7 914(f)'s text. Section 914(f) does not give a beneficiary the right to an\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   award of benefits equal to 20 percent of the compensation that was not timely paid under a previous award. (Were that the case, a BLBA beneficiary\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   be required to seek a supplemental order from the DOL granting it that additional award before seeking to enforce the award through a \u00a7 921(d) action in federal court.) Rather, \u00a7 914(f) simply increases the amount of compensation owed under an\n   <em>\n    existing\n   </em>\n   award of benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20914\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) (\"If any\n   <em>\n    compensation\n   </em>\n   , payable under the terms of\n   <em>\n    an award\n   </em>\n   , is not paid within ten days after it becomes due, there shall be\n   <em>\n    added to\n   </em>\n   such unpaid compensation an amount equal to 20 per centum thereof, which shall be paid\n   <em>\n    at the same time as\n   </em>\n   , but\n   <em>\n    in addition to\n   </em>\n   , such compensation.\") (emphasis added). In this action, Ms. Burton seeks to enforce two final compensation orders pursuant to \u00a7 921(d). Thus, if the compensation Drummond was ordered to pay in the DOL's final compensation orders was compensation \"payable under the terms of an award,\" and if Drummond failed to pay that compensation \"within ten days after it [became] due,\" then \u00a7 914(f) automatically \"added to\" such compensation \"an amount equal to 20 [percent] thereof.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20914\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   By virtue of Drummond's failure to timely comply with the two orders and the effect of \u00a7 914(f), the amount of compensation Drummond owes Ms. Burton under the final compensation orders is 20 percent more than the amounts listed on the face of the orders. It is for this reason that some courts have referred to \u00a7 914(f) as \"self-executing\" or \"automatic.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Combs v. Elkay Min.

The DOL issued its final compensation order on Ms. Burton's claim on December 15, 2016 and ordered Drummond to pay Ms. Burton monthly compensation in a specified amount and to reimburse the Trust Fund for interim payments it made to Ms. Burton. (Doc. # 15 at 99). That compensation was \"payable under the terms of an award,\"-namely, the December 15, 2016 final compensation order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20914\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f).

Similarly, the DOL issued its final compensation order on Mr. Burton's claim on October 5, 2017 and ordered Drummond to pay Ms. Burton retroactive benefits on behalf of Mr. Burton and to reimburse the Trust Fund for interim payments it made to Mr. Burton. (Doc. # 15 at 142). That compensation was likewise \"payable under the terms of an award,\"-namely, the earlier December 29, 2015 compensation order (Doc. # 15 at 54-55) that initially granted Mr. Burton's claim, which Drummond then (unsuccessfully) appealed. Yet again, Drummond failed to timely pay the compensation due under the December 29, 2015 compensation order and instead chose to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Thus, once Drummond was late in paying Ms. Burton the compensation it owed her under the December 29, 2015 and December\n   5, 2016 compensation orders, the language of \u00a7 914(f) operated to add 20 percent additional compensation to the amount Drummond owed. This was purely by operation of law, and it is of no consequence that the DOL's final orders do not themselves award Ms. Burton additional compensation under \u00a7 914(f). Indeed, \u00a7 914(f) does not by its terms require any action by the Secretary to make its increase in the amount of compensation owed effective. Rather, the statute simply \"add[s] to\" an operator's outstanding debt 20 percent additional compensation as soon as the debt is ten days past due.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20914\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f).

Specifically, Drummond points to the regulation codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20725.601\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), which states: \"In all cases payments of additional compensation ... will be sought by the Director or awarded by the district director.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The court notes that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20725.601\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) does not by its terms prohibit a beneficiary from seeking \u00a7 914(f) additional compensation in federal court. Rather, it simply states the DOL's policy that, in cases of additional compensation, the agency itself will seek or award the compensation. Because \u00a7 921(d) permits either a \"beneficiary\" or \"the deputy commissioner\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   to enforce a final compensation order,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20725.601\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) likely was not meant to foreclose a beneficiary from seeking additional compensation in a \u00a7 921(d) action if the agency fail to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   But whatever the import of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20725.601\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), an administrative agency's regulations cannot deprive a district court of jurisdiction that Congress has vested in it by statute. Congress has vested district courts with jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the laws of the United States,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and it has created a cause of action by which BLBA beneficiaries may enforce final compensation orders in federal court,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20932\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). If Ms. Burton's claim for additional compensation under \u00a7 914(f) falls within the scope of \u00a7 921(d) (and, as explained above, the court concludes it does), then the court has jurisdiction over Ms. Burton's claim. Because Congress has vested this court with jurisdiction over Ms. Burton's claim by statute, the DOL's regulations cannot divest it of jurisdiction, even assuming the agency intended that result. The court thus concludes it has subject matter jurisdiction over Ms. Burton's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Ms. Burton Has Stated a Claim for Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Drummond also argues this case should be dismissed because Ms. Burton has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Specifically, Drummond claims Ms. Burton has no right to additional compensation under \u00a7 914(f) because she was timely paid all of the compensation owed\n   to her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again, this is an issue of first impression in the Eleventh Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Section 914(f) provides for additional compensation \"[i]f any compensation, payable under the terms of an award,\n   <em>\n    is not paid\n   </em>\n   within ten days after it becomes due.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20914\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) (emphasis added). It is undisputed that Drummond did not pay the compensation it owed Ms. Burton within ten days after it became due. But Drummond argues that, because the Trust Fund\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   pay Ms. Burton's benefits during the pendency of Drummond's appeals, the compensation\n   <em>\n    was paid\n   </em>\n   within ten days after it became due (even if not by Drummond), and Ms. Burton therefore has no right to additional compensation under the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Section 914(f)'s use of the passive-voice phrase \"is not paid\" complicates what would otherwise be a straightforward exercise in statutory interpretation. As the inimitable grammarian Bryan Garner has explained, the passive voice often \"fails to say squarely who has done what\" making it \"a prime source of unclarity.\" Bryan A. Garner,\n   <em>\n    Garner's Modern American Usage\n   </em>\n   592 (2d ed. 2003). Here, \u00a7 914(f)'s passive-voice phrase \"is not paid\" invites the question, not paid\n   <em>\n    by whom\n   </em>\n   ? Does \u00a7 914(f) mandate additional compensation when \"compensation, payable under the terms of an award\" is not paid\n   <em>\n    by anyone\n   </em>\n   ? Or does it require additional compensation whenever an award is not paid\n   <em>\n    by the responsible operator\n   </em>\n   , even if some other entity (like the Trust Fund) does pay the benefits? The statute does not expressly say one way or the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   A passive-voice construction like \"is not paid\"\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   mean that the actor -- here, the one who does the paying -- is either unimportant or unknown.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Garner,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 593. But the passive voice need not and does not always mean that the identity of the relevant actor is indeterminate or unimportant. \"To the contrary, despite the passive voice, [a text's] grammatical and structural logic often point to particular, identifiable ... actors.\" Nicholas Quinn Rosenkranz,\n   <em>\n    The Objects of the Constitution\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=63%20Stan.%20L.%20Rev.%201005\">\n    63 Stan. L. Rev. 1005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1012 (2011). Consider, for example, Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution, which provides that \"No Bill of Attainder ...\n   <em>\n    shall be passed.\n   </em>\n   \" U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 3 (emphasis added). Like \u00a7 914(f), Article I, Section 9 invites the question, shall be passed\n   <em>\n    by whom\n   </em>\n   ? Does that constitutional provision only forbid the\n   <em>\n    federal\n   </em>\n   government from passing bills of attainder, or does its passive-voice phrasing mean it also prohibits\n   <em>\n    state\n   </em>\n   governments from passing bills of attainder? The text does not say expressly, but that does not mean the question is hopelessly indeterminable. Chief Justice Marshall tackled this very question in\n   <em>\n    Barron v. Baltimore\n   </em>\n   , 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 243,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1436167\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/32/243/\">\n    8 L.Ed. 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1833) in the course of resolving a dispute about another passive-voice constitutional\n   provision, the Takings Clause. He began by looking to grammatical and contextual clues in other provisions of the Constitution that could shed light on Article I, Section 9's passive-voice prohibition on bills of attainder. As it turns out, \"the very next section of the Constitution includes a clause identical in subject matter but different in\n   <em>\n    subject\n   </em>\n   : 'No\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   shall ... pass any Bill of Attainder, [or] ex post facto Law....' \" Rosenkranz,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 1013 (quoting U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1 ) (emphasis, omissions, and alteration in original). Chief Justice Marshall thus \"reasoned that the passive-voice version of this clause must not restrict states, because otherwise the active, 'No State shall' version would be superfluous.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   , 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) at 248-49 ). As Marshall's careful reasoning demonstrates, a text's internal grammar, structure, and logic can meaningfully resolve ambiguities created by the passive voice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Just as a nearby constitutional provision clarified the meaning of Article I, Section 9's passive-voice prohibition on bills of attainder in\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 914(f)'s surrounding statutory context similarly clarifies its meaning. That context reveals that \u00a7 914(f) supplies additional compensation whenever compensation due under an award is not timely paid\n   <em>\n    by the responsible operator\n   </em>\n   , even if some other entity (like the Trust Fund) does in fact timely pay the benefits. Several features of \u00a7 914(f)'s statutory context dictate this conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   First, the text of \u00a7 914(f) itself suggests that additional compensation is available whenever a responsible operator fails to timely pay an award of benefits. The statute speaks of compensation that is \"payable under the terms of an award\" and \"is not paid within ten days after it becomes due.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20914\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). The most natural reading of the text is that the person responsible for paying compensation \"within ten days after it becomes due\" is the person identified by the \"terms of [the] award,\" not some other person who is not even mentioned in the award's terms.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20914\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, the terms of the two awards Ms. Burton received expressly instructed Drummond (not the Trust Fund) to pay Ms. Burton's benefits. (Doc. # 15 at 54, 99). Because Drummond failed to pay Ms. Burton's benefits while it appealed the ALJs' decisions, the compensation \"payable under the terms\" of the awards against Drummond was \"not paid\" within the meaning of \u00a7 914(f), even though Ms. Burton received compensation from the Trust Fund while Drummond's appeals were pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Second, it is important to remember that \u00a7 914(f) was originally enacted as part of the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (\"LHWCA\") in 1927, and only some forty years later (in 1969) incorporated by reference into Title IV of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub.

In the LHWCA context, the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   potential payer of benefits is the responsible employer. At least in the LHWCA context, then, \u00a7 914(f)'s phrase \"[i]f any compensation ... is not paid\"\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   mean \"if any compensation is not paid\n   <em>\n    by the responsible employer\n   </em>\n   \"-the only entity conceivably responsible for paying compensation under the LHWCA. To give \u00a7 914(f) a different interpretation in the BLBA context, one would have to conclude that Congress, by incorporating \u00a7 914(f) into the BLBA, changed the meaning of the statute without changing its words. The court concludes that Congress did no such thing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Had Congress simultaneously incorporated \u00a7 914(f) into the BLBA and created the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, there might be an argument that Congress changed the meaning of \u00a7 914(f) without changing its words. Such an argument would go as follows: By creating the Trust Fund, which compensates BLBA beneficiaries when responsible operators fail to do so, Congress established another entity potentially responsible for paying BLBA benefits that simply was not present under the LHWCA. Under the LHWCA, it was perfectly reasonable to read \u00a7 914(f)'s phrase \"[i]f any compensation ... is not paid\" to mean \"if any compensation is not paid\n   <em>\n    by the responsible employer\n   </em>\n   \"-since the responsible employer was the only entity that had any business paying compensation under the LHWCA. But since Congress has now established another entity potentially responsible for paying BLBA benefits (the Trust Fund), \u00a7 914(f)'s phrase \"[i]f any compensation ... is not paid\" should arguably (in the BLBA context) be understood to mean \"if any compensation is not paid by the responsible employer\n   <em>\n    or the Trust Fund.\n   </em>\n   \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   But this is all merely academic because Congress\n   <em>\n    did not\n   </em>\n   simultaneously incorporate \u00a7 914(f) into the BLBA and create the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. To be sure, those two events were separated by some eight years. Congress incorporated \u00a7 14(f) of the LHWCA (codified as amended at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20914\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) ) into Title IV of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act in 1969.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub. L. No. 91-173, \u00a7 422(a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Stat.%20742\">\n    83 Stat. 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 796 (1969) (incorporating by reference Pub. L. No. 69-803, \u00a7 14(f),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20Stat.%201424\">\n    44 Stat. 1424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1433 (1927) ). Eight years later, Congress passed the Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977, creating the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub. L. No. 95-227, \u00a7 3(a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20Stat.%2011\">\n    92 Stat. 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 12 (1978) (creating the fund). Thus, when Congress incorporated \u00a7 914(f) into the BLBA, the provision was doubtless understood to have the same meaning it bore under the LHWCA. Accordingly, there can be no argument that Congress silently changed the meaning of \u00a7 914(f) when it incorporated the provision into Title IV of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, as the Trust Fund was not created until more than eight years later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Nor can there be any argument that the creation of the Trust Fund in 1977 silently changed the meaning of \u00a7 914(f) in BLBA cases. On this silent-amendment theory, the creation of the Trust Fund would have relieved operators of significant liability under \u00a7 914(f), since they would never be liable for additional compensation so long as the Trust Fund timely paid benefits in their stead. But the statute creating the Trust Fund refutes that theory by providing that \"nothing in this section shall affect the rights, duties, or\n   <em>\n    liabilities\n   </em>\n   , of any operator in proceedings under [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20932\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   ].\" Pub.

In short, the phrase \"is not paid\" in \u00a7 914(f) means the same thing under the BLBA that it meant under the LHWCA: not paid\n   <em>\n    by the responsible operator.\n   </em>\n   Unless a responsible operator appeals an award of benefits and obtains an order staying payment of the benefits, beneficiaries are entitled to 20 percent additional compensation whenever the operator fails to pay compensation \"payable under the terms of an award\" \"within ten days after it becomes due.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20914\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f).
