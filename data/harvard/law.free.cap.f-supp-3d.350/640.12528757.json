LAWSON, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The question presented by the defendant's motion for partial summary judgment is whether the plaintiffs, as personal representatives of the estates of the deceaseds, may recover damages for lost wages and earning capacity of their decedents. The defendant contends that answer is \"no,\" arguing that Michigan's Wrongful Death Act limits recovery solely to damages for \"loss of support,\" upon proof that they had a reasonable expectation of receiving support from the deceased. Because current Michigan statutory and decisional law compels the opposite answer, the Court will deny the defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The sad facts of the case were discussed at length in the Court's previous opinion and order denying the defendant's motion to dismiss. The case arises from a November 2014 automobile collision in which the plaintiffs' decedents Kayla White and her unborn child were burned to death inside White's 2003 Jeep Liberty, after the vehicle was struck from behind by another driver. The amended complaint pleads claims against defendant FCA US, LLC for (1) product liability under Michigan Compiled Laws \u00a7 600.2947(3) (Count I); (2) defective design under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20600.2946\">\n    Mich.

It also includes a claim for ordinary negligence against Clarence Heath, who was the driver of the car that struck White's Jeep (Count VII).

Citing\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

And reasoning that the list of those who may recover is qualified by the requirement that the individual must \"suffer damages,\" FCA believes that the deceased's survivors may recover economic damages only if they prove a \"loss of financial support.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Michigan Supreme Court has not conclusively settled this issue.

Specifically, lost earnings are damages that the decedent could have sought on his own behalf had he lived, whereas damages for lost financial support would be sought by one who depended on the decedent for financial support.
