For the reasons identified below, the motion will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Tamaira Ridge was an employee of defendant Indiana University Health Arnett, Inc. (\"IUHA\") from September 1999 until her termination in August 2015. (DE # 1 at 1; DE # 22-7 at 3.) IUHA includes a hospital and several specialty physician practices that are administratively managed by practice managers. (DE # 22-7 at 2.) In 2008, plaintiff was promoted to practice manager. (DE # 22-2 at 70.) The following undisputed factual allegations form the basis of plaintiff's present claims of sex discrimination and hostile work environment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    1.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dr. Desy's Comment on Plaintiff's Shoes\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2011, Dr. Alain Desy told plaintiff, in reference to her high heeled shoes, \"I see you've got your fuck-me shoes on today.\" (DE # 22-1 at 38.) Plaintiff informed her supervisor, William Waggoner, of the comment and Waggoner told her that he would follow-up. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39-40.) After this incident, Dr. Desy never made any similar comments to plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    2.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leffew's Comments on Plaintiff's Clothes\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Between August 2012 and September 2013, Theresa Leffew supervised plaintiff. (DE # 22-7 at 3.) During this period, Leffew observed plaintiff wearing very tight, low-cut clothing. (DE # 22-4 at 4.) Leffew also received complaints from other practice managers that plaintiff was not dressed appropriately for the workplace. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) In plaintiff's 2012 performance evaluation, Leffew noted that plaintiff \"[m]ay also want to ensure professional attire is always exhibited in the workplace.\" (DE # 22-2 at 49.) When plaintiff\n   asked Leffew what was wrong with her clothing choices, Leffew told her that she is \"quite busty\" and \"curvy.\" (DE # 22-1 at 12.) Leffew told plaintiff that she needed to be known for her brains and not her beauty, and needed to dress appropriately for the workplace. (DE # 22-1 at 14; DE # 22-4 at 5.) Plaintiff admits that Leffew did not provide this feedback in a mean-spirited way, but in her role as plaintiff's manager. (DE # 22-1 at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    3.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lehe Asks Plaintiff Not to Attend Recruitment Dinners\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In February or March 2014, Lori Lehe, an IUHA physician recruiter, asked plaintiff not to attend any recruitment dinner where a recruited physician's wife would be present because plaintiff was single and attractive and the wife might feel uncomfortable knowing that there was going to be a single woman managing her husband on a day-to-day basis. (DE # 22-1 at 42-44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    4.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff is Not Promoted to Administrative Director\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Between November 2014 and January 2015, Brian Shockney supervised plaintiff. (DE # 22-7 at 3.) In December 2014, plaintiff applied for a position as administrative director. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) This position required a Masters of Business Administration (\"MBA\"), which plaintiff did not possess. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) During a department meeting discussing recruitment for the position, Shockney stated that, given the orthopedic doctors' behavioral problems, a man could better manage the group because the doctors were more likely to follow a man's direction. (DE # 22-1 at 28.) The Vice President of Human Resources Koreen Kyhnell was present at the time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.) Despite this comment, plaintiff still believed that the decisionmakers for the position would consider her application evenhandedly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29.) The position was later filled by James Parsons, a male physical therapist with an MBA. (DE # 22-7 at 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    5.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wells Refers to Plaintiff as a \"Work Wife\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2014, when Human Resources Consultant Rebecca Wells checked in with plaintiff to see how she was doing, plaintiff told Wells that doctors in the orthopedic practice group were being abusive to staff and management. (DE # 22-1 at 34.) Plaintiff told Wells that she did not understand why these doctors believed it was okay to treat her or other staff this way. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Wells told plaintiff, \"Well, you're a work wife. They come in, you're a sounding board. They can vent. They give it to you and then you make it all better, you know. And then they go about their day.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, Wells relayed concerns about the temper of one of the orthopedic doctors, Dr. Orenstein, to her supervisor. (DE # 22-6 at 2.) IUHA sent Dr. Orenstein and Dr. Hubbard, another orthopedic doctor, to an anger management course as a result of concerns expressed regarding their angry outbursts at work. (DE # 22-8 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    6.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Wage Discrimination Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 2009, Patrick Adsit began working as a licensed physical therapist at IUHA. (DE # 22-7 at 7.) In 2010, Adsit was promoted to the position of rehabilitation supervisor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) While Adsit was a rehabilitation supervisor, plaintiff asked Leffew why Adsit was paid more than her. (DE # 22-1 at 63-64; DE # 22-6 at 4.) Leffew told her that Adsit was hired as a physical therapist, a revenue-generating role, and the market pay for a physical therapist is higher than for a practice manager. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    7.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Termination\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In May 2015, plaintiff attended a non-work related charity event. (DE # 22-1 at 49, 53.) During the auction portion of the event, plaintiff \"became part of the auction,\" took off her dress and undergarments,\n   and threw them out to the audience. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50; DE # 22-3.) She later learned that her dress sold for $1,000. (DE # 22-1 at 53.) She also later learned that this incident had been recorded on video. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53-54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The video was eventually shared with IUHA employees. On August 3, 2015, Vice President of Human Resources Koreen Kyhnell received an email from Human Resources Consultant Bobbie Shackleferd stating that she had received reports that IUHA employees had been sent text messages containing the video, and titled \"Tammy Ridge stripping.\" (DE # 22-7 at 4.) The video was sent to physicians, managers, and others who worked with, or reported to, plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Kyhnell showed the video to Wells. (DE # 28-4 at 9.) Additionally, a practice manager who reported to Leffew showed Leffew a copy of the video. (DE # 22-4 at 3.) The practice manager informed Leffew that the video was \"going viral\" in the General Surgery department, and employees were asking what was going to be done about plaintiff's \"inappropriate behavior.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.) Leffew directed the practice manager to send the video to James Parsons, plaintiff's supervisor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3; DE # 22-7 at 3.) After learning of the existence of the video, Brian Shockney, the chief operating office for IUHA, instructed a supervisor in plaintiff's practice group that any mention or viewing of the video must stop immediately. (DE # 22-5 at 5; DE # 22-8 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After discussing the video and its dissemination, Kyhnell and Shockney determined that plaintiff's conduct was not in line with IUHA's expectations of its leaders and they no longer had confidence in plaintiff's ability to carry out her managerial duties effectively.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (DE # 22-7 at 5; DE # 22-8 at 3.) They believed plaintiff's conduct was unacceptable for an IUHA leader. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) They considered whether their opinions would be different if plaintiff was a man, and determined that they would have reached the same decision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Kyhnell and Shockney contacted plaintiff's supervisor James Parsons and the Chief Executive Officer of IUHA regarding their recommendation that plaintiff's employment be terminated. (DE # 22-5 at 3-4.) Both agreed that termination was appropriate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Kyhnell and Shockney offered plaintiff the choice between termination and resignation with a severance package, and also told her that she could apply for a non-management position with IUHA. (DE # 22-1 at 57; DE # 22-7 at 6.) Plaintiff did not elect the severance, and did not apply for another position within IUHA. (DE # 22-7 at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") on December 15, 2015. (DE # 22-2 at 76.) On January 1, 2017, she filed the present federal action. (DE # 1.) In her complaint, plaintiff alleges violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal Pay Act of 1963. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) However, plaintiff subsequently conceded that her claims under the Equal Pay Act are untimely. (DE # 27 at 20.) Plaintiff's remaining claims, all under Title VII, are for: (1) hostile work environment; (2) wage discrimination; (3) failure to promote; and (4) discriminatory termination. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE # 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant has moved for summary judgment on all of plaintiff's claims.

(DE # 21 at 15, 17, 19.) Plaintiff responds that these incidents were part of a continuing violation, and thus even though they occurred more than 300 days prior to her filing the EEOC Charge, they are nevertheless timely. (DE # 27 at 20-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In Indiana, a Title VII plaintiff must file a charge with the EEOC within 300 days of the occurrence of the challenged employment action.\n   <em>\n    Adams v.

Her claim relies on both the general circulation of the video by various, unidentified co-workers, as well as the circulation of the video by Leffew and Kyhnell specifically. (DE # 27 at 8-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The circulation of the video fails to meet any of the elements necessary to establish a hostile work environment claim. Leffew, part of IUHA leadership, directed the employee who showed her the video to forward the video to plaintiff's supervisor, James Parsons. (DE # 22-4 at 3; DE # 22-7 at 3.) Kyhnell, the vice president of human resources, showed the video to Rebecca Wells, the human resources consultant who supported plaintiff's practice group. (DE # 28-4 at 9.) No reasonable jury could determine that these managers' circulation of information related to a personnel matter that had \"gone viral\" throughout IUHA amounted to unlawful harassment. Leffew and Kyhnell's involvement was not objectively offensive, severe or pervasive harassment, or harassment based on plaintiff's sex. The circulation of the video also did not alter the conditions of plaintiff's employment; plaintiff testified that she was \"perfectly fine coming in to work\" despite the circulation of the video. (DE # 22-1 at 47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Finally, the circulation of the video fails to establish a hostile work environment claim because there is no basis for employer liability. \"[E]mployers are strictly liable for the discriminatory acts perpetrated by supervisors and they are liable for the discriminatory acts of others - coworkers, independent contractors, customers, inmates etc. - only if they are negligent either in discovering or remedying the harassment.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

To the contrary, IUHA's Chief Operating Officer, Brain Shockney, and plaintiff's closest supervisor at the time that the video began circulating,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   immediately instructed employees to stop viewing or mentioning the video. (DE # 22-5 at 5). While plaintiff argues that Shockney's admonition \"did nothing to prevent Ridge from being sexually harassed in other ways not directly related to (but still arising out of) the mentioning and viewing of the video\" (DE # 27 at 9), she does not explain what she means and at this stage, conclusory allegations are insufficient to survive summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    2.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miscellaneous Harassment Allegations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   It is not clear from plaintiff's brief whether she intended to pursue a hostile work environment claim based on the other, miscellaneous comments identified in her brief - or whether she presents those comments solely to provide evidence for her termination claim. Out of an abundance of caution, the court will interpret her brief as doing both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiff identifies four incidents of harassment at the hands of various IUHA employees. The incidents are as follows: (1) in 2011, Dr. Desy told plaintiff, \"I see you've got your fuck-me shoes on today; (2) during her 2012 performance evaluation, Leffew told plaintiff that she \"[m]ay also want to ensure professional attire is always exhibited in the workplace\" because she is \"quiet busty\" and \"curvy\" and should aim to be known for her brains and not her beauty; (3) in 2014, an IUHA physician recruiter asked plaintiff not to attend any recruitment dinners where a\n   physician's wife was in attendance because the wife might feel uncomfortable knowing that there was an attractive, single woman managing her husband on a day-to-day basis; and (4) in 2014, when plaintiff asked Wells why Drs. Orenstein and Hubbard believed it was appropriate to lash out at her and other staff members, Wells told plaintiff \"you're a work wife. They come in, you're a sounding board. They can vent. They give it to you and then you make it all better, you know. And then they go about their day.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   No reasonable jury could determine that these comments created a hostile work environment. First, there is no evidence that plaintiff ever relayed the recruiter's comments to anyone in a management position. Thus, there can be no employer liability for this comment. This leaves three comments made over the course of three years - a far cry from pervasive harassment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3873340\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/678/470/#p472\">\n    678 F.3d at 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A] few incidents at the rate of one every four to six months ... cannot be called pervasive.\"). In fact, plaintiff argues that she was not even aware of the harassment or discrimination until after her termination (DE # 27 at 21), thus emphasizing the sporadic nature of the incidents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The remaining comments were not sufficiently severe to establish a hostile work environment claim. While plaintiff may have found the comments offensive, they were not so severe as to alter the terms of her employment, were not physically threatening, and did not unreasonably interfere with her work performance.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scruggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5681154\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/587/832/#p840\">\n    587 F.3d at 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plaintiff's supervisor's occasional inappropriate comments, including that she was \"made for the backseat of a car,\" looked like a \"dyke,\" and that he hated \"pushy, aggressive women\" like plaintiff, were insufficient to establish an objectively hostile work environment). Moreover, plaintiff admits that Leffew did not provide her with feedback regarding her clothing in a meanspirited way, but rather in her capacity as her manager - thus no jury could find the comment to be subjectively offensive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Finally, there is no evidence that IUHA negligently permitted the harassment to continue. When plaintiff complained to her supervisor William Waggoner about Dr. Desy's comment, Waggoner told her that he would look into the matter. (DE # 22-1 at 39-40.) Plaintiff admits that Dr. Desy never made a similar comment to her again. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40.) Furthermore, despite Well's comment that the orthopedic doctors treated plaintiff as a sounding board and \"work-wife,\" Wells relayed the concerns to her supervisor and IUHA sent both doctors to anger management classes. (DE # 22-6 at 2; DE # 22-8 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   For all of the foregoing reasons, IUHA is entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's hostile work environment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    C.

IUHA argues that it has high standards for its leaders and expects them to avoid conduct that would hurt the reputation of the company or that could create a situation where leaders could not effectively lead because their peers no longer respect them. (DE # 22-5 at 9-10.) Plaintiff argues that IUHA used her behavior as a pretext for terminating her, and points to other employees who acted unprofessionally, but were not terminated. (DE # 27 at 17-18.) Because IUHA has offered a legitimate, non-discriminatory explanation for terminating plaintiff, and because plaintiff challenges that explanation as pretext, the court will move on to the pretext analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Khowaja\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517300\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/893/1010/#p1015\">\n    893 F.3d at 1015\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The similarly situated and pretext analysis often overlap, as comparator evidence and selective enforcement of an employer's rules are relevant to both inquiries.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \"[A] pretext analysis evaluates the honesty of the employer's explanation, not its validity or reasonableness.\"\n   <em>\n    Seymour-Reed v.

(DE # 27 at 13.) In support of this argument, she points to the comments by Desy, Leffew,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lehe, and Wells. Yet, these comments\n   are not evidence that Kyhnell or Shockney were motivated by plaintiff's sex. The comments occurred years prior to her termination, thus there is no temporal connection that could permit a jury to infer discriminatory intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Seymour-Reed\n   </em>\n   , --- Fed.Appx. at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204944826\">\n    2018 WL 4944826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (discriminatory comment by non-decisionmaker a year and a half before plaintiff's discharge was not evidence that employer's reason for discharge was pretext). Moreover, neither decisionmaker made these comments, and there is no evidence that they were aware of the comments.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204944826\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\" '[S]tray remarks' do not support an inference of discrimination unless the decisionmaker or someone with influence over the decision made the comment around the time of, or about, the adverse action.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Plaintiff next argues that IUHA's true motivation for terminating her was to replace her with a man in order to cater to the orthopedic doctors' prejudicial and sexist attitudes toward women. (DE # 27 at 13.) However, the only doctors plaintiff identifies as holding such views are Orenstein and Hubbard, and plaintiff testified that these doctors were equally abusive to men and women. (DE # 22-1 at 41, 73.) Moreover, the statements plaintiff relies on are not evidence that Kyhnell or Shockney terminated plaintiff in order to cater to the views of these doctors. Plaintiff points to: (1) a statement Leffew made to James Parsons that a man might do better as practice manager over the orthopedics group (DE # 28-2 at 5-6); and (2) a conversation Wells overheard, suggesting that plaintiff's position should be filled by a man. (DE # 28-4 at 5.) However, both of these statements occurred\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   plaintiff's termination. (DE # 28-2 at 7; DE # 28-4 at 5). Additionally, Parsons did not make the decision to terminate plaintiff; he was on vacation when Kyhnell and Shockney made this decision. Plaintiff does not identify who participated in, or was present during, the conversation Wells overheard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Finally, plaintiff argues that a jury could infer discriminatory intent because IUHA terminated her for unprofessional conduct, but did not terminate Drs. Desy, Orenstein, or Hubbard for their unprofessional conduct. (DE # 27 at 17-18.) \"In cases in which the employer allegedly enforces job expectations in a disparate manner, we have noted that the 'expectations themselves may be tainted with discrimination,' so the plaintiff needs to show only that he was 'singled out for worse treatment' than similarly situated employees.\"\n   <em>\n    Seymour-Reed\n   </em>\n   , --- Fed.Appx. at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204944826\">\n    2018 WL 4944826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (internal citations omitted). Where a plaintiff takes this approach, he or she must produce evidence that the defendant enforced one set of expectations upon the protected class and another for members outside of the protected class.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204944826\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"Similarly situated means 'directly comparable' in all material respects....

While there is no set formula for determining whether a comparator is similarly situated, some examples of evidence that would be required in the usual case include: \"whether the employees being compared (1) were supervised by the same person, (2) were subject to the same standards, and (3) 'engaged in similar conduct without such differentiating or mitigating circumstances as would distinguish their conduct or the employer's treatment of them.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517279\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/887/#p904\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Here, plaintiff's situation is not sufficiently comparable to that of Drs. Desy,\n   Orenstein, or Hubbard to allow a jury to infer that IUHA applied its job expectations in a discriminatory manner. The conduct itself is too different to allow for an inference of discriminatory intent. Plaintiff also does not identify who supervised these doctors, or what the expectations for the doctors were. Thus, it is unclear whether the same members of leadership enforced job expectations in a disparate manner. Finally, IUHA contends that it terminated plaintiff because her behavior impaired her ability to carry out her managerial duties effectively; yet, it is unclear whether these doctors were in a management position at the time of their unprofessional conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Examining the evidence as a whole, plaintiff presents no evidence that would permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that she was terminated because she is a woman. She has presented no evidence of sex-based animus by any of the persons involved in her termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Seymour-Reed\n   </em>\n   , --- Fed.Appx. at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204944826\">\n    2018 WL 4944826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (plaintiff's evidence did not suggest that his employer used performance reasons to cover its discrimination, but merely that he disagreed with his employer's decision). Plaintiff has provided little more than her own suspicions that the reason stated for her termination was not genuinely believed by IUHA's employees, and her own suspicions are not good enough.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Uhl v. Zalk Josephs Fabricators, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285046\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/121/1133/#p1137\">\n    121 F.3d 1133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1137 (7th Cir. 1997) (\"Facts, not an employee's perceptions and feelings, are required to support a discrimination claim.\"). Thus, IUHA is entitled to summary judgment on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    2.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wage Discrimination\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Plaintiff's final claim is that IUHA violated Title VII when it paid her less - because of her sex - than one of her male counterparts, Patrick Adsit. (DE # 27 at 20.) IUHA contends that Adsit was compensated differently than plaintiff because: (1) the market rate for licensed clinical employees is different than that for practice managers; (2) Adsit was able to do additional tasks and duties that plaintiff was not qualified to do because he was a licensed clinician; (3) if a practice manager is managing a clinical area, knowledge of the particular speciality practice is particularly valuable; and (4) IUHA does not reduce clinically licensed employees' pay when they move into an administrative role. (DE # 21 at 12; DE # 22-1 at 63-64; DE # 22-6 at 4; DE # 22-7 at 7.) Plaintiff does nothing to challenge these proffered reasons for the pay differential, or otherwise demonstrate that she and Adsit were similarly situated in all material respects. \"In the employment discrimination context, the requirement to find a similarly situated comparator is really just the same requirement that any case demands-the requirement to submit relevant evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517279\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/887/#p904\">\n    892 F.3d at 895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff has failed to submit relevant evidence that would suggest prohibited discrimination. Thus, IUHA is entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's wage discrimination claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   For these reasons, the court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   defendant's motion for summary judgment (DE # 20) and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   plaintiff's motion to seal (DE # 29).

(DE # 27 at 11, 17.) This argument fails to establish a discrimination claim because: (1) it is time-barred; and (2) there is no evidence that the comment constitutes an adverse employment action. \"[N]ot every criticism or disciplinary measure is an 'adverse employment action' for Title VII purposes.\"\n    <em>\n     Pantoja v.
