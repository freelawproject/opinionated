No. 37,\n   <em>\n    passim\n   </em>\n   . Presently before the Court is Defendants' motion pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    a. DFS Investigation into the Carry Guard Insurance Program\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In October 2017, DFS initiated an investigation of the NRA's affinity Carry Guard insurance program,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   focusing on two insurance companies, Chubb Ltd. (\"Chubb\") and Lockton Affinity, LLC (\"Lockton\"), for underwriting and administering this program. Dkt. Nos. 37-4; 37-5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Carry Guard program provided, among other policy coverages, (1) liability insurance to gun owners for acts of intentional wrongdoing, and (2) legal services insurance for any costs and expenses incurred in connection with a criminal proceeding resulting from acts of self-defense with a legally possessed firearm, in violation of New York Insurance Law. Dkt. Nos. 37-4; 37-5. The policies issued through the Carry Guard program were underwritten by Chubb and offered by Lockton through New York's excess line market. Dkt. Nos. 37-4 at p. 4; 37-5 at \u00b6 13. As part of its investigation, DFS learned that, although it did not have an insurance producer license from DFS, the NRA engaged in marketing of, and solicitation for, the Carry Guard program. Dkt. Nos. 37-4 at pp. 4-6; 37-5 at pp. 3-5. DFS also found that Lockton and the NRA together offered at least eleven additional insurance programs (collectively \"additional NRA programs\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to new and existing NRA members in New York and elsewhere. Dkt. No. 37-4 at pp. 6-7. Pursuant to written agreements with Lloyd's of London (\"Lloyd's\") and the NRA, Lockton served as the administrator for these additional NRA programs, carrying out such functions as marketing the insurance, binding the insurance, collecting and distributing premiums, and delivering policies to insureds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. Lloyd's and Alea London Ltd. (\"Alea\") served as the underwriters for these additional NRA programs, which Lockton placed through New York's excess line market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following initiation of the DFS investigation, Lockton suspended the Carry Guard program on November 17, 2017 and is no longer making Carry Guard policies available to New York residents to purchase.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. DFS's investigation revealed that Lockton and Chubb violated numerous provisions of the New York Insurance\n   Law in connection with the Carry Guard program and the additional NRA programs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 37-4, \u00b6\u00b6 34-40; 375, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19 (discussed below).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The NRA alleges that throughout the investigation, DFS communicated \"backchannel threats\" to banks and insurers with ties to the NRA that they would face regulatory action if they failed to terminate their relationships with the NRA. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 38, 45. According to the NRA, the Chairman of Lockton called the NRA on February 25, 2018 and confided that Lockton would need to \"drop\" the NRA entirely for fear of losing its license to operate in New York, and the next day Lockton tweeted it would discontinue providing brokerage services for all NRA-endorsed insurance programs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42-43. The NRA alleges that, days later, its corporate insurance carrier severed ties with it and said it would not renew coverage at any price.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44. The NRA alleges that the corporate carrier severed its ties with the NRA \"because it learned of Defendants' threats directed at Lockton, and feared it would be subject to similar reprisals.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Cuomo Press Release\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 19, 2018, Gov. Cuomo issued a press release indicating that he was directing DFS to communicate with insurance companies and financial institutions licensed or doing business in New York and urge them to review their relationships with the NRA and similar gun promotion organizations, and consider whether such relationships \"harm their corporate reputations and jeopardize public safety.\" Dkt. No. 37-1 (\"Cuomo Press Release\"). Gov. Cuomo is quoted as stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   New York may have the strongest gun laws in the country, but we must push further to ensure that gun safety is a top priority for every individual, company, and organization that does business across the state. I am directing the Department of Financial Services to urge insurers and bankers statewide to determine whether any relationship they may have with the NRA or similar organizations sends the wrong message to their clients and their communities who often look to them for guidance and support. This is not just a matter of reputation, it is a matter of public safety, and working together, we can put an end to gun violence in New York once and for all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9391316\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/185/169/#p174\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The press release states that \"DFS is encouraging regulated entities to consider reputational risk and promote corporate responsibility in an effort to encourage strong markets and protect consumers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Then, following a statement that \"[a] number of businesses have ended relationships with the NRA following the Parkland, Florida school shooting in order to realign their company's values,\" Supt.

Guidance Letters\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Also on April 19, 2018, Supt. Vullo issued \"Guidance[s] on Risk Management Relating to the NRA and Similar Gun Promotion Organizations\" (\"Guidance Letters\"), which encouraged financial institutions and insurance companies to consider\n   their relationships with the NRA. Dkt. Nos. 37-2 (Guidance Letter to all insurers doing business in New York); 37-3 (Guidance Letter to the chief executive officers of all New York state chartered or licensed financial institutions). The Guidance Letter to all insurers doing business in New York is prefaced with reference to gun violence tragedies occurring at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Columbine High School, Sandy Hook, Pulse night club, and the Las Vegas music festival, and indicates that there is a social backlash against the NRA and similar organizations \"that promote guns that lead to senseless violence\" and that \"[o]ur insurers are, and have been, vital to the communities they serve for generations and are guided by their commitment to corporate social responsibility, including public safety and health.\" Dkt. No. 37-2, at 1. This Guidance Letter further indicates:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Insurers' engagement in communities they serve is closely tied to the business they do with their clients and customers and its impact on such communities. Often insurers report to their stakeholders that their performance is based on both their strategic business vision as well as on a commitment to society as a whole. There is a fair amount of precedent in the business world where firms have implemented measures in areas such as the environment, caring for the sick, and civil rights in fulfilling their corporate social responsibility. The recent actions of a number of financial institutions that severed their ties with the NRA after the AR-15 style rifle killed 17 people in the school in Parkland, Florida is an example of such a precedent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The tragic devastation caused by gun violence that we have regrettably been increasingly witnessing is a public safety and health issue that should no longer be tolerated by the public and there will undoubtedly be increasing public backlash against the NRA and like organizations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Our insurers are key players in maintaining and improving public health and safety in the communities they serve. They are also in the business of managing risks, including their own reputational risks, by making risk management decisions on a regular basis regarding if and how they will do business with certain sectors or entities. In light of the above, and subject to compliance with applicable laws, the Department encourages its insurers to continue evaluating and managing their risks, including reputational risks, that may arise from their dealings with the NRA or similar gun promotion organizations, if any, as well as continued assessment of compliance with their own codes of social responsibility. The Department encourages regulated institutions to review any relationships they have with the NRA or similar gun promotion organizations, and to take prompt actions to managing these risks and promote public health and safety.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9391316\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/185/169/#p174\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 1-2.

No. 37-4 at pp. 12-15. The Lockton Consent Order expressly allowed Lockton to assist the NRA in procuring insurance for the NRA's own corporate operations. Dkt. No. 37-4 at p. 14, \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that \"DFS and Vullo have no legal basis to restrict Lockton's involvement with insurance programs that do not violate New York's Insurance Law;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   nor do they have authority to regulate insurance transactions outside of New York. Nevertheless, DFS mandated that Lockton never enter into any future agreements with the NRA for legitimate and fully Complaint insurance programs in New York.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 56. Plaintiff maintains that Lockton would violate the Lockton Consent Order \"if it markets an ordinary property, casualty, or life insurance policy in the State of New York that was accompanied by an NRA logo or endorsement -notwithstanding that a comparable logo or endorsement referencing any other affinity or common-cause organization is permissible,\" and contends that \"[t]his provision ... is deliberate and intended to impair the NRA's ability to negotiate insurance benefits for its members, damage the NRA's goodwill among its membership, and unconstitutionally restrict the NRA's speech on the basis of political animus.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57. The NRA further maintains that several of the violations assessed in the Lockton Consent Order \"concern programs commonly engaged in by numerous additional affinity associations that do not publicly advocate for Second Amendment rights\" but that were \"not targets of Defendants' unconstitutional conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58 (citing similar actions by Lockton related to affinity programs by organizations that do not advocate Second Amendment rights). The NRA asserts that even if Lockton's conduct identified in the Consent Order \"does violate insurance law, DFS's selective enforcement of such offenses as to NRA-endorsed policies-but not as to other policies marketed by Lockton in an identical fashion-constitutes impermissible viewpoint discrimination and a denial of equal protection under the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Chubb agreed to,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , pay a monetary fine of $1,300,000; not participate in the future in any Carry Guard, or similar programs that violate the New York Insurance Law; and not to \"enter into any agreement or program with the NRA to underwrite or participate in any affinity-type insurance program involving any line of insurance.\" Dkt.

Based on Gov. Cuomo's press release wherein he indicates he is directing DFS to issue the Guidance Letters, it is a reasonable inference that he has the power to direct DFS take other official action, including the commencement of enforcement investigations against regulated institutions. Thus, there is a reasonable basis to conclude that he has the power to effectuate regulatory action against entities doing business with the NRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   DFS actually exercised regulatory authority over Chubb and Lockton, two regulated entities that fall within the same scope of DFS's authority as the entities addressed in the Guidance Letters and Cuomo Press Release. But this fact, by itself, does not help Plaintiff's claims because Chubb and Lockton admitted violations of New York insurance laws. There are also no allegations that DFS exercised regulatory authority over entities other than Chubb and Lockton. Nevertheless, the Amended Complaint asserts that, during the course of the DFS investigations into Chubb and Lockton, \"DFS communicated\n   to banks and insurers ... that they would face regulatory action if they failed to terminate their relationships with the NRA, ... indicating that any business relationship whatsoever with the NRA would invite adverse action.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 38. This is a powerful factual allegation linking the recommendations in the Guidance Letters and Cuomo Press Release that regulated entities consider (and possibly end) their associations with the NRA, and the enforcement actions carried out by DFS against Chubb and Lockton. At this stage of the litigation, the Court must accept this factual allegation as true. Further, the NRA notes that the Chubb and Lockton Consent Orders, which imposed several million dollars in monetary penalties and permanently prohibited those entities from participating in any NRA-endorsed insurance program in New York State, were announced just two weeks after the Cuomo Press Release and Guidance Letters were issued.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. Viewing the allegations in the light most favorable to the NRA, and drawing reasonable inferences in its favor, the temporal proximity between the Cuomo Press Release, the Guidance Letters, and the Consent Orders plausibly suggests that the timing was intended to reinforce the message that insurers and financial institutions that do not sever ties with the NRA will be subject to retaliatory action by the state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wrobel v.

While the Court accepts, at it must, that many insurance carriers and banks have refused to offer services to the NRA, and that insurance coverage and banking services are necessary for the NRA to continue its advocacy activities, Plaintiff has not asserted that it is unable to obtain any insurance coverage or any banking services so it can continue its operations. Moreover, even accepting the allegations that multiple insurers and banking institutions have expressed an unwillingness to offer services to the NRA due to Defendants' actions, there are no allegations plausibly supporting the conclusion that Defendants' actions directly and substantially, or significantly, interfered with the NRA's associational rights. Rather, the Amended Complaint alleges that the Guidance Letters, Consent Orders, press releases, and \"backchannel threats\" affect insurers and banking institutions' willingness to offer services to the NRA which, in turn, creates a \"risk\" that the NRA might not be able to offer associational activities such as (1) media coverage through NRATV, (2) circulation of publications and magazines, (3) meetings, rallies, conventions and assemblies, (4) educational programs, Am.

Similarly, there are no plausible allegations that the Defendants imposed a penalty upon the NRA for associating with its members for Second Amendment advocacy purposes. While the NRA argues that the Consent Orders were the result of speech-motivated regulatory decisions, the Consent Orders indicate that Chubb and Stockton agreed that their conduct related to NRA insurance programs violated New York insurance law. The fact that these insurance companies agreed that\n   <em>\n    their\n   </em>\n   conduct violated New York law does not support a plausible claim that the Defendants imposed a penalty upon the NRA for associating with its members.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arcara v.

Compl. \u00b6 113.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff fails to allege facts clearly demonstrating a sufficient likelihood that it will again be wronged in a manner similar to the way it was harmed by entry of the Lockton and Chubb Consent Orders. The Consent Orders were entered following a DFS investigation yielding admissions from Lockton and Chubb that they were involved in numerous illegal insurance activities related to NRA programs. The NRA has not alleged that these activities were legal under New York law, or that the applicable New York insurance laws are unconstitutional or were improperly applied. Thus, there are insufficient allegations supporting a plausible contention that all of the NRA's past damages will be, or could be, repeated. To the extent the NRA alleges that it was harmed by provisions of the Consent Orders that prohibit Lockton and Chubb from participating with the NRA to offer legal affinity insurance programs, Plaintiff fails to allege facts plausibly indicating that, if the injunction was granted, either Lockton or Chubb would agree to participate in these programs in the future. Further, nothing in the Lockton or Chubb Consent Orders prohibits other insurance companies from participating in these services, yet Plaintiff has not alleged that another insurance company is planning to participate in NRA-endorsed affinity insurance programs. Thus, the \"threatened injury\" occasioned by the Consent Orders is not \"\n   <em>\n    certainly impending\n   </em>\n   ,\" but rather is, at most, \"a\n   <em>\n    possible\n   </em>\n   future injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Clapper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p409\">\n    568 U.S. at 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p409\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is insufficient to confer constitutional standing for the injunction sough in paragraph 113.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Further, Plaintiff fails to satisfy prudential standing for this relief, which seeks to enjoin Defendants from enforcing the Lockton and Chubb Consent Orders. This requested injunctive relief is, essentially, a third-party challenge to the stipulated settlements contained in those Consent Orders. It relies upon the rights and interests of Lockton and Chubb to resolve claims against those parties. Lockton and Chubb may not desire to vacate their consent agreements and/or do business with the NRA related to affinity insurance programs, and even if they wanted to do both, those are matters that should be advocated by Stockton and Chubb - not the NRA. Moreover, Plaintiff has not alleged facts plausibly indicting that either Lockton or Chubb are hindered in some manner in\n   asserting their rights affected by the Consent Orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The cases cited by Plaintiff for the proposition that \"a plaintiff has standing to challenge laws enforced against another party where the plaintiff is injured by such enforcement,\" Pl.

While these cases stand for the cited proposition, they do reach the issue raised by the injunction sought in paragraph 113 - that is, whether a plaintiff can vacate an agreement reached by a third party following enforcement of a challenged law.

Injury incurred indirectly, such as through an agency relationship, may still impart standing.

There is also no plausible basis to conclude that enforcement of the New York insurance laws identified in the Chubb and Lockton Consent Orders would prevent another insurer from offering NRA lawful affinity insurance programs. Thus, unlike the Consent Order in\n   <em>\n    Safelite\n   </em>\n   , the Consent Orders here do not prevent the NRA from offering lawful affinity insurance programs to its members. While Defendants indicate that the NRA is under investigation for its unlicensed insurance activities, Def. Mem.

These stigmatizing statements are false and capable of being proved false.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 127. In support of these claims, Plaintiff argues that \"Defendants publicly branded the NRA a 'reputational risk' to the safety and soundness of financial institutions, warned those financial institutions that having the NRA as a customer may send the 'wrong message to their clients and their communities,' insinuated that having 'ties' to the NRA 'jeopardize[s] public safety,' stated that the NRA has 'caused carnage in this nation,' and urged them to drop the NRA in order to 'promote public health and safety.' \" Pl. Mem. L. at 29 (citing Dkt. 37-1 (Cuomo Press Release); Am. Compl. at \u00b6 45 (referencing the Guidance Letters); Gase Decl., Ex. D). These statements fail to satisfy the \"stigma\" component of the stigma-plus claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The statements in the Cuomo Press Release and the Guidance Letters are purely government speech relaying New York's opinions about public safety, gun regulation, and the role that insurance companies and financial institutions play in shaping public opinion in this public debate. Whether the NRA represents a potential reputational risk to insurance companies and financial institutions is clearly a matter of opinion. Further, the Guidance Letters do not state that the NRA is responsible for senseless violence. Rather, they state that there is a \"social backlash against [the NRA] and similar organizations that promote guns that lead to senseless violence,\" and then go on to state that \"the nature and the intensity of the voices now speaking out ... is a strong reminder that such voices can no longer be ignored and that society, as a whole, has a responsibility to act and is no longer willing to stand by and wait and witness more tragedies caused by gun violence, but instead is demanding change now.\" Dkt. # 37-2;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 37-3 (same). These statements express New York's opinion of societal views related to the availability of guns, of organizations that promote access to guns, and whether the availability of guns leads to senseless violence. No statement is made that the NRA directly causes violence, and any inference that the Guidance Letters imply that the NRA's gun promotion advocacy leads to violence is based on opinions articulated in the documents. Similarly, the Guidance Letters do not state that the NRA is a threat to public health and safety. Rather, they reference public health and safety in the context of the perceived role that insurance companies and financial institutions play in shaping public opinion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 37-2;\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. # 37-3,\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   and encourage these entities \"to continue evaluating and managing their risks, including reputational risks, that may arise from their dealings with the NRA or similar gun promotion organizations, if any, as well as continued assessment of compliance with their own codes of social responsibility.\" Dkt. # 37-2; Dkt. # 37-3. While the Guidance Letters encourage insurance companies and financial institutions \"to review any relationships they have with the NRA or similar gun promotion organizations, and to take prompt actions to managing [their reputational risks] and promote public health and safety,\" Dkt. # 37-2; Dkt. # 37-3, they do not state that the NRA is a threat to the public health and safety. Any inference that the Guidance Letters imply that the NRA's gun promotion advocacy is contrary the public health and safety is based on the opinions expressed in these two documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Likewise, the Cuomo Press Release is government speech relaying opinions about public safety, gun regulation, and the role that insurance companies and financial institutions play in shaping public opinion in this public debate. While the\n   press release encourages insurers and bankers \"to consider whether [their ties to the NRA or other similar organizations] harm their corporate reputations and jeopardize public safety,\" Dkt. # 37-1, it does not state that the NRA is responsible for violence, or that it jeopardizes public health and safety. Again, the statements are made in the context of a statement about gun violence in general, and asks the targeted entities to examine their connections to the NRA and other gun promotion organizations to determine for themselves whether continued association with gun promotion organizations harms their reputations and benefits the communities they serve. Any inference that the press release implies that the NRA promotes gun violence or is harmful to public safety is based only on the opinions expressed in the press release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Thus, the statements in the Guidance Letters and Cuomo Press Release are not actionable on the stigma-plus claims because, as opinions, they are not \"capable of being proved false.\"\n   <em>\n    Vega\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4219274\" index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/596/77/#p81\">\n    596 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   81 ;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Paterno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203632526\">\n    2018 WL 3632526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (\"The first two statements-referencing 'a terrible chapter' and 'fundamental principles'-are not actionable because they are opinions, which are not 'capable of being proved false.' \")(citing\n   <em>\n    Vega\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4219274\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/596/77/#p81\">\n    596 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   81 ;\n   <em>\n    Sharpe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%202356063\">\n    2013 WL 2356063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (\"a statement of opinion, rather than fact ... is not actionable as a stigmatizing remark.\");\n   <em>\n    Wiese v.

Cuomo's April 20, 2018 tweet in support of the stigma-plus claim. Nonetheless, Gov. Cuomo's statement that the \"[t]he NRA is an extremist organization\" is clearly an expression of his opinion and, therefore, is insufficient to support the first element of the stigma-plus claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Plaintiff's reference to a statement that the NRA has \"caused carnage in this nation\" is from a transcript of Gov. Cuomo's August 6, 2018 guest appearance on CNN's\n   <em>\n    New Day with Allisyn Camerota and John Berman\n   </em>\n   . Gase Decl., Ex. D. Because the transcript is not attached to the Amended Complaint or referenced therein, and because the matter is before the Court on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, Gov. Cuomo's statements while on CNN cannot properly be considered in determining whether Plaintiff states a plausible stigma-plus claim. Nevertheless, because Plaintiff requests leave to amend if a claim is dismissed, the Court reviews the transcript to determine whether adding the \"caused carnage\" statement would provide an actionable stigmatizing statement. In the transcript, Gov. Cuomo is quoted as stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   [The NRA is] making a different point, which is, I have been a longtime opponent of the NRA, I plead guilty. I believe the NRA represents an extremist group. I believe they've been counterproductive for gun owners in this country.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   I believe their politics seeks them [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] to stop any common sense gun reform because then, John, they would be out of business. Most gun owners support some type of reasonable gun control. 90 percent of Americans support background checks. The NRA has always been against any progress whatsoever. They're oblivious to the facts. They've caused carnage in this nation. They've done gun owners a disservice because there is a common sense compromise if the NRA wasn't always threatening politicians who went anywhere near reasonableness. If you remember President Trump after the Parkland shooting, spoke in the White House conference room and asked reasonable questions. He seemed reasonable. \"Why can't we raise the purchase age? Why can't we raise the age for assault weapons?\" He met with the NRA and did a total 180 the next day and was absolutely against any reform, and this nation still has done nothing on guns.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Gase Decl., Ex. D, p. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Read in context, Gov. Cuomo's \"caused carnage\" statement is clearly an expression of his, or New York's, opinion as to the connection between the NRA's political positions and the numerous incidents of mass shootings in the Country. For the reasons just discussed, such an opinion does not support a plausible stigma-plus claim. Therefore, leave to amend to add this statement is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Plaintiff also does not point to the alleged \"backroom exhortations [made] during the DFS Investigation\" to support its stigma-plus claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.
