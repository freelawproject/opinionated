S. Granade SENIOR UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter is before the Court on Defendant's motion for summary judgment (Doc. 37), Plaintiff's opposition thereto (Doc. 46), and Defendant's reply (Doc. 47). For the reasons explained below, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not supported a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of racial discrimination and also has not shown that Defendant's legitimate, non-discriminatory, reason for terminating Plaintiff was pretextual. Accordingly, summary judgment will be granted in favor of Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Plaintiff in this case is a black male who alleges he was discriminated against on the basis of his race by his employer, Defendant AM/NS Calvert. (Doc. 9). Defendant manufactures steel in the form of heavy coils that are then transported to\n   one of the storage areas, ST1, ST2, ST3, or ST4, where they are evaluated for any defects before being transported out. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 9). Plaintiff was hired in April 2011 as an Operator and was promoted to Packaging Coordinator in ST4 in 2013. (Doc. 41-2, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 17). Plaintiff understood from going through orientation when he was hired that Defendant had in effect an Equal Employment Opportunity Policy that prohibited discrimination. (Doc. 39-1, p. 13; Doc. 41-1, pp. 20-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Shipping and Packaging Coordinators in ST4 manage a crew of Team Members working under their supervision. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 9). A Coordinator's primary responsibility is \"vigilance of safety with Cranes and Team Members.\" (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 10; Doc. 40-2, p. 8). The Coordinator's responsibilities include ensuring safety of all Team Members, as well as evaluating the receiving coils for any defects that violate customers' coil specifications, packaging coils once that are confirmed in specification, and transporting the packaged coils to the required method of hauling. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 9). A Coordinator is responsible for ensuring the crew is adhering to all Personal Protective Equipment (\"PPE\") requirements, including gloves, sleeves, eye protection and other required items. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 11). A Coordinator is responsible for overseeing the crew's completion of all required computer-based trainings (\"CBTs\"), some of which pertain to safety awareness and PPE. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 11). A Coordinator is to address and correct all safety concerns the moment they come up and is responsible for filling out \"Yellow Near Miss cards if necessary.\" (Doc. 40-2, p. 8). Team Members are required to fill out Near Miss cards whenever they see a potential hazard - to help prevent future safety incidents and to create an awareness by all Team Members in safety-sensitive positions to be vigilant in noticing and resolving potential hazards. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 12). The cards require the Team Member to identify the hazard and also identify what steps the employee took to resolve the hazard. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 13). Plaintiff testified that Coordinators were expected to complete two Near Miss cards per month and Operators were to complete Near Miss cards too. (Doc. 45-2, pp. 69-70).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In March 2015, Tim York became Team Manager of ST4. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 2). As the Team Manager over ST4, York was familiar with Plaintiff's job performance and the job performance of other Packaging and Shipping Coordinators in that area. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 8). York obtained the approval of Stephanie Davis, the Team Member Relations Specialist, prior to disciplining employees. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 18). York reported to and worked closely with the Area Manager of ST4, Nick Kirkland. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 8). York was not required to secure Kirkland's approval to discipline employees with letters of reprimand or suspensions but was required to obtain Kirkland's approval, as well as the approval of Stephanie Davis and the HR Director, Dale Laidlaw, before terminating an employee. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 8; Doc. 41-1, \u00b6 7; Doc. 41-3, p. 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 6, 2015, a Team Member on Plaintiff's crew, Damien Fountain, sustained a laceration due to failure to wear proper PPE - gloves. (Doc.39-1, pp. 71-72; Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 20). York issued Plaintiff a letter of reprimand for the incident because he had often noticed Plaintiff's failure to reprimand his crew for failing to wear proper PPE and York had to continually remind Plaintiff to tell his crew to wear proper PPE. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 21). Plaintiff admits that York had come to him on occasion and said that he had seen guys without their gloves on \"or something to that effect.\" (Doc. 39-1, pp. 72-73). However, Plaintiff does not feel it was fair to reprimand him because Plaintiff was in another building when the incident happened, they had just had their safety meeting\n   for ST4, and Plaintiff had each of the Team Members sign a form saying they had been counseled that morning. (Doc. 39-1, pp. 71-74).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 22, 2015, York issued Plaintiff a second letter of reprimand. (Doc. 39-1, p. 75; Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 23). The second letter of reprimand was because Plaintiff was delinquent in completing his computer-based training modules (\"CBTs\") - he was 53 days late completing one module and was similarly delinquent for seven other CBTs. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 23). Plaintiff says he was overdue because the computer that was available for him to complete the CBTs was in a noisy area where he could not concentrate. (Doc. 39-1, p. 77). Plaintiff never asked if he could take the CBTs somewhere else because he did not think York would listen to him. (Doc. 39-1, p. 77). Plaintiff admits that it was reasonable that he was expected to complete his trainings. (Doc. 39-1, p. 78).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   York had observed other problems with Plaintiff's job performance while York was Team Manager. York sent Plaintiff numerous emails asking Plaintiff about incomplete, inaccurate or missing reports, his failure to complete CBTs and other duties and his failure to properly maintain his work area or perform housekeeping duties on shift. (Doc. 39-1, pp. 45-55; Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 27). According to York, Plaintiff's productivity as a Team Coordinator was substandard. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 25). York created charts every month that compared the productivity of the four shifts and for October and November 2015 Plaintiff's shift was outperformed by two of the other three shifts, for December 2015 Plaintiff's shift was outperformed by all three of the other shifts, and for January 2016, Plaintiff's shift was outperformed by one of the other shifts. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 25; Doc. 40-3, pp. 15-18). Plaintiff disagrees with York's assessment of the production data. (Doc. 40-3, p. 6, \u00b6 54).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 1, 2015, York emailed Plaintiff complaining that Plaintiff had failed to put an issue reporting form on quarantined coils or log the quarantined coils in the spreadsheet that morning, resulting in the quarantined coils not being recorded in the computer system. (Doc. 39-1, pp. 78-79). Plaintiff asserts that the issue reporting form could have gotten knocked off because they were double stacking coils in the quarantine area and there were big fans that could have blown it off. (Doc. 39-1, pp. 58-59, 81). According to York, it was Plaintiff's responsibility to place issue reporting forms on the coils and to check the quarantine bay before the end of shift to confirm that no coils were left without issue reporting forms for the next shift. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 30). York reports that he had experienced similar issues with Plaintiff on September 28 and September 29. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 30). Josh Abel, a Coordinator who would relieve Plaintiff's shift, brought to York's attention multiple times that Plaintiff had failed to properly label or move coils. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 32; Doc. 41-4, \u00b6 19). In the Oct. 1 email, York notified Plaintiff that he was going to draw up a Performance Improvement Plan (\"PIP\") for Plaintiff. (Doc. 39-1, p. 79).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   York decided to place Plaintiff on a Performance Improvement Plan (\"PIP\") after consulting with Ms. Davis. (Doc. 41-2, \u00b6 20). Davis drafted the PIP memorandum which was signed by Plaintiff on October 15, 2015, with York's input. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 34; Doc. 41-2. \u00b6 22; Doc. 41-3, pp. 42-43, Doc. 39-3, pp. 19-20). A memorandum addressed to Plaintiff and signed by Plaintiff on October 15, 2015 stated that the PIP is \"a written set of expectations designed to assist you in understanding your performance expectations and how that relates to the overall success of the organization.\" (Doc. 39-3, p. 15). The memorandum listed the following areas of performance expectations that Plaintiff needed \"to focus on to\n   ensure [his] success as a Shift Coordinator:\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Create an environment where Team members know that standing around waiting is not acceptable. Also, encourage them to communicate with the cranes to stock their areas.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 Regardless of what is passed down, it is your responsibility once your shift starts to make sure all information is correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Above all safety is first and foremost. Kenard needs to enforce this on his team. When a safety rule is broken, progressive discipline must be administered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 This job requires multi tasking. Develop time management skills in order for tasks to be completed as expected.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Kenard needs to manage all aspects of this Team. He needs to be more active in the overall state of the business during his shift. He needs to spend more time on the mill floor interacting and coaching other Team Members. (Manage By Walking Around) He is expected to keep a weekly report that documents this activity. Kenard needs to manage his Team's CBT's, as well as his own to ensure compliance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (Doc. 39-3, pp. 15-16). The memorandum stated that Plaintiff's \"[f]ailure to meet these performance expectations may result in termination.\" (Doc. 39-3, p. 16). The PIP memorandum also stated that they \"would meet formally every 4 weeks for 90 days to assess how you are progressing towards these goals.\" (Doc. 39-3, p. 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   During the 30-day period after Plaintiff's PIP was implemented, York observed numerous performance issues by Plaintiff, including: Plaintiff's failure to submit any Near Miss cards, a serious quality failure on Plaintiff's shift, Plaintiff's failure to follow York's instruction to move a particular coil to quarantine during his shift, Plaintiff's failure to send York a requested status report, Plaintiff's failure to pack up a list of coils during his shift as directed, Plaintiff's Team Members' failure to properly communicate with the crane operator, Plaintiff's Team Members were observed standing around idly instead of attending to needed tasks and Plaintiff's failure to complete his CBTs as directed. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6\u00b6 40-47). York and Davis met with Plaintiff for the 30-day review of his PIP on November 17, 2015. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 39). York prepared a spreadsheet that listed the five areas the PIP stated he needed improvement in and also included a few additional specific performance issues to be addressed, including in relation to the third listed performance area involving safety, that Plaintiff \"does not participate as often as he should in the Near Miss Program.\" (Doc. 39-3, pp. 18-20; Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 39; (Doc. 41-2, \u00b6 24). At the 30-day review York told Plaintiff that he had not seen any improvement in his performance in the areas identified in the PIP and in fact, his performance was worse in some of the areas. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 39; Doc. 41-2, \u00b6 24). Plaintiff reports that he \"had a comment\" for each of the performance issues York identified. (Doc. 45-3, p. 40-41). York asked Plaintiff how he could help Plaintiff improve, but Plaintiff denied any assistance. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 39; Doc. 41-2, \u00b6 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   York and Davis met with Plaintiff for his 60-day review of the PIP on December 17, 2015. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 48). Prior to the meeting York reports that he had become quite frustrated with Plaintiff and his failure to improve. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 48). Plaintiff had still not submitted a single Near Miss card. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 48). York emailed Plaintiff numerous times between his 30-day review and his 60-day review regarding quality issues with coils Plaintiff was responsible for, Plaintiff's failure to follow instructions or complete tasks assigned, and his failure\n   to accurately complete reports and other necessary logs. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6\u00b6 49-54). Plaintiff had explanations for some of his failures, but York found the explanations to be unsatisfactory excuses. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6\u00b6 52, 54). During the 60-day review, York told Plaintiff he had seen no improvement in the identified areas and specifically discussed Plaintiff's failure to submit any Near Miss Cards over the course of his PIP. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 55). According to York and Davis, Plaintiff responded that he did not think the Near Miss Card program was worthwhile and that he had no interest or intention of participating in it. (Doc. 39-4, pp. 80-81; 40-1, \u00b6 55; Doc. 41-2, \u00b6 25). Plaintiff testified at his deposition that he does not think the Near Miss cards were worthwhile because \"a lot of time, the problem never gets fixed.\" (Doc. 39-1, pp. 98-99). After Plaintiff indicated he would not participate in the Near Miss Card program, York, with Davis' approval, decided to suspend Plaintiff and they informed Plaintiff that he was suspended pending further review. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6\u00b6 55, 56; Doc. 41-2, \u00b6 25). According to Davis, they knew when they did the 60-day review that it was not working out with Plaintiff and they had plans to terminate him before the meeting occurred. (Doc. 45-1, p. 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Following Plaintiff's suspension, York discussed the circumstances with the Area Manager, Nick Kirkland, and Kirkland decided that Plaintiff should be terminated for his failure to improve in the PIP and his insubordination and rejection of the Near Miss program. (Doc. 39-4, pp. 82-84; Doc. 41-1, \u00b6\u00b6 28, 29). On January 11, 2016, Davis and York called Plaintiff to tell him he was terminated. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 62). No one was hired to replace Plaintiff, instead the shipping coordinator for that shift, Shannon Scruggs, who is white, took over Plaintiff's packaging duties as the company transitioned from using two coordinators (one for shipping and one for packaging) to using one Logistics Coordinator per shift. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 63; Doc. 39-4, p. 77). In 2017, Elston Walker, who is African-American, was hired to replace Scruggs as the Coordinator on A shift for ST4. (Doc. 39-4, p. 79).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   From 2015 to 2016, there were four Shipping Coordinators and four Packaging Coordinators in ST4 under Tim York's management, Josh Abell, Josh Goodell, John Johnston, Greg Kunkel, Jay Langley, Chad Larimore, Shannon Scruggs, and Plaintiff. These coordinators received discipline while under York's supervision but, according to York, none of the conduct of the other coordinators warranted termination or ever culminated to the level of conduct exhibited by Plaintiff. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 64).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Johnston was reprimanded for being twenty days overdue on completion of his CBTs in August 2015 and because of continued performance and attendance problems was placed on a PIP in September 2015. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 65). At Johnston's 30-day review, York and Davis noted improvements in Johnston's communication with other Coordinators and improvement in his attendance. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 67). At the 60-day review York noted that Johnston had continued to improve in those areas as well as in creating and fostering an environment of teamwork and empowering his team. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 67). York noted Johnson had particularly improved his productivity in November and December 2015. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 67). Johnston asked York to help him identify ways he could improve further. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 67). By the 120-day review meeting, Johnston had improved in each of the identified performance issues and Davis and York agreed that he had successfully completed his PIP. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 67). Johnston completed one Near Miss card in July 2015, one in September 2015, three in October 2015, and one in December\n   2015. (Doc. 45-4, pp. 44-47). Johnston received a letter of reprimand April 2016 for failure to complete housekeeping and other assigned tasks. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 69). The letter of reprimand noted the previous PIP and included the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   You should consider this Letter of Reprimand a last and final warning. Any further violations of AM/NS policies, procedures or performance expectations will result in further corrective action up to an including termination of employment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (Doc. 40-6, p. 23). Johnston voluntarily resigned in 2017 for medical reasons. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 29). Plaintiff contends that Johnston \"was a failure since day one\" and was written up numerous times but he was not terminated. (Doc. 39-1, p. 129). Plaintiff does not know how many times Johnston was written up, what areas Johnston was asked to improve in, how far behind his CBTs were, or whether he showed any improvement. (Doc. 39-1, pp. 129-130).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On March 10, 2015, One of Chad Larrimore's team members received a laceration due to his failure to wear required PPE and on March 27, 2015 Larrimore failed to wear proper PPE while banding a coil. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 71). York issued Larrimore a Letter of Reprimand on April 2, 2105 for failure to promote safety. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 71). York requested that Larrimore receive a one-day suspension, but Davis suggested he issue the Letter of Reprimand. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 71). In September 2015, York issued Larrimore a Letter of Reprimand for failing to catch a serious quality issue. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 71). In June 2016, Larrimore received a Letter of Reprimand and was demoted for failing to properly manage his Team Members on shift which caused overcapacity and delay in ST4. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 71). Plaintiff asserts that Larrimore \"walked off the job\" and still was not terminated. (Doc. 39-1, p. 127). Plaintiff reports that Larrimore told Plaintiff he walked out because York got in Larrimore's face and dogged him in front of his peers and he walked out \"to keep from hitting him.\" (Doc. 39-1, p. 128). According to York, Larrimore did not walk off the job. (Doc. 39-1, \u00b6 72). York reports that during a discussion with Larrimore, Larrimore became upset, said he needed to take a minute to cool down, and left the discussion, which was continued later. (Doc. 39-1, \u00b6 72). Plaintiff also contends that Larrimore \"was the one that actually put the coil in the quarantine area the morning that [Plaintiff] was suspended\" and that Plaintiff was blamed for. (Doc. 39-1, p. 132). However, Plaintiff admits that even if the coil was put in quarantine during Larrimore's shift, when Plaintiff came on shift and found the coil it was his responsibility to add it into the system. (Doc. 39-1, pp. 97-98).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff reports he heard that Josh Goodell cursed York out, but he did not work with Goodell a lot and had never talked to Goodell about that and was not sure how Goodell was treated. (Doc. 39-1, pp. 128, 131). York reports that Goodell never cursed at him. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 75). Plaintiff also points out that Greg Kunkel turned over a forklift and was not terminated. (Doc. 39-1, pp. 127, 130). According to York, the forklift incident was not Mr. Kunkel's fault, but was caused by the weight of the object, not negligence or a violation of a safety rule. (Doc. 40-1, \u00b6 74). Plaintiff testified that Josh Abell's numbers were not any better than Plaintiff's, but Plaintiff does not know how his CBT numbers were. (Doc. 39-1, p. 131). Plaintiff testified that he knows Jay Langley was written up on several occasions and was not terminated, but he does not know what he was written up for. (Doc 39-1, p. 133).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Shannon Scruggs was issued a letter of reprimand in November 2016, after Plaintiff's termination, for three instances of failing to properly scan Quality Summary\n   Sheets in Sharepoint. Plaintiff says he did not have any problem working with Scruggs. (Doc. 39-1, p. 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff testified that York would refer to Plaintiff as \"you peoples\" all the time. (Doc. 39-1, pp. 75-76). Plaintiff reports that when York talked to him he would say \"You peoples, I don't understand you peoples.\" (Doc. 39-1, p. 76). Plaintiff testified that he asked York \"What the hell is you people?\" and York said he was not referring to Plaintiff as a black man, but \"to you as the north and the south.\" (Doc. 39-1, p. 76). Plaintiff testified that he never heard York say that to anyone else. (Doc. 39-1, p. 76).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Defendant argues that the cases cited by Plaintiff to support such a presumption are age discrimination cases under the ADEA, rather than Title VII race discrimination cases. (Doc. 47, p. 9). Defendant points to a Title VII case from this Court which listed the four prongs a plaintiff must show to make out a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case and included the second prong requiring that the plaintiff show she \"was qualified to do the job.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

However, in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the defendant did not contend that the plaintiff was not qualified and this Court made no pronouncement about whether or not it could be inferred that the second prong was satisfied because the plaintiff had worked in the position for a period of time. The\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   case merely listed the four standard prongs of a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   discrimination case just as the\n   <em>\n    Damon\n   </em>\n   case listed four prongs (including that the plaintiff was qualified to do the job) of a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   age discrimination case before it determined that it could be inferred from the plaintiff's long tenure at the position that she was qualified.\n   <em>\n    Damon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11560386\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/196/1354/#p1360\">\n    196 F.3d at 1359-1360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant has cited no cases that have held that this inference or presumption should not apply to Title VII discrimination cases and has offered no other explanation why Title VII race discrimination cases should be treated differently in this regard than age discrimination cases under the ADEA. Allowing the inference does not really eliminated the second prong from the requirements of a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case, but rather satisfies the prong by presumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Where the evidence demonstrates that an employee did not meet the objective requirements of the position, the employee's qualification may not be inferred from the fact that he held the position for an extended period of time.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dudley v.

In the instant case, Plaintiff's reported poor performance issues are subjective judgments regarding specific incidents that involve Plaintiff's attention to safety needs or how well he performed his duties. Plaintiff's reported outright refusal to participate in the Near Miss program might qualify as not meeting an objective requirement, but Plaintiff disputes that he completely refused to participate and reports that he merely expressed his opinion that he does not think the Near Miss cards were worthwhile. Although York was not happy with Plaintiff's performance regarding the Near Miss cards, the stated requirements of Plaintiff's position only required that Plaintiff fill out Near Miss cards\n   <em>\n    when he saw a potential hazard\n   </em>\n   . Although there was evidence that Coordinators were expected to fill out two Near Miss cards per month there was no company rule that required a specific quota. Looking at the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court finds that Defendant has not shown that Plaintiff did not meet an objective requirement of the job. The Court finds that, in this case, Plaintiff's continued employment in the position for more than two years is sufficient to support the second prong of a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Defendant contends that Plaintiff cannot satisfy the fourth prong because he was neither replaced by a person outside his protected class, nor treated less favorably than a similarly-situated individual outside his protected class.

Plaintiff points to the fact that John Johnston was not terminated even though he was behind in his Near Miss program participation and was deficient in his Computer Based Training. However, unlike Plaintiff, Johnston completed some Near Miss cards during the time period in question - he completed one Near Miss card in July 2015, one in September 2015, three in October 2015, and one in December 2015. Johnston was reprimanded and placed on a PIP the month before Plaintiff was placed on a PIP. However, unlike Plaintiff, Johnston showed improvement at both his 30-day and 60-day review. Also, unlike Plaintiff, Johnston did not refuse help and was not believed to have completely refused to perform any duties. In fact, Johnston asked York to help him identify ways he could improve further. By the 120-day review meeting Johnston had improved in each of the identified performance issues and was adjudged by Davis and York to have successfully completed his PIP. A few months after Plaintiff's termination, in April 2016, Johnston was reprimanded again and given a written warning that any further violations would result in his termination. This uncontroverted evidence indicates that Johnston was treated the same as\n   Plaintiff for similar conduct and that Defendant had legitimate reasons for treating Johnston differently by not terminating him. Johnston worked towards completing his duties and improving his performance and was successful in doing so, whereas Plaintiff was not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   After reviewing the evidence regarding Defendant's treatment of the other Coordinators under York's management, Josh Abell, Josh Goodell, Greg Kunkel, John Johnston, Jay Langley, Chad Larimore, and Shannon Scruggs, the Court finds that they were not treated preferentially. Most of the other Coordinators did not comply with the expectation that they submit two Near Miss cards per month, but none of the other Coordinators refused to participate at all or failed to submit any after being put on a PIP. The other Coordinators received discipline for certain incidents or poor performance, but their bad conduct did not culminate to the level of conduct exhibited by Plaintiff. Plaintiff has not shown that he was treated less favorably than the other coordinators. Looking at the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, as the non-movant, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not supported the fourth prong of a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Even if Plaintiff could support a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case, the Court finds that Defendant has proffered a legitimate, non-discriminatory, reason for terminating Plaintiff and that Plaintiff has failed to show pretext. Once a plaintiff establishes a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of discrimination, the burden shifts to the Defendant, who must \"proffer a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.

Whether their meeting with Plaintiff was to give him one last chance to explain himself and promise to do better or was just a formality before they suspended him and sought formal approval to terminate him, the timing of their decision does not show bias. Nor is bias shown by the fact that York then went to Kirkland to obtain the final decision from Kirkland. York was required to secure Kirkland's approval before terminating an employee. York was simply following company policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   As explained above, the Court is not here to judge whether employment decisions are prudent or fair but whether the decisions were motivated by unlawful discriminatory animus.\n   <em>\n    Damon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11560386\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/196/1354/#p1360\">\n    196 F.3d at 1361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
