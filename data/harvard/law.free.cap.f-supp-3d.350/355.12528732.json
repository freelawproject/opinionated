Circuit Court Order 1, Mot. to Dismiss Ex. 1, ECF 45-1. He has neither U.S. citizenship nor lawful permanent resident status. However, since February 24, 2017, he has enjoyed a range of privileges and protections accompanying his status as a \"special immigrant juvenile\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(27)(J).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Granados-Alvarado is presently under indictment on two federal criminal charges: (1) being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(5), and (2) possession of a firearm in a school zone,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 922(q)(2)(A). Here, I address his Motion to Dismiss Count I of the Indictment. Mot. to Dismiss, ECF 45. That count requires the Government to prove, among other things, that Granados-Alvarado was \"illegally or unlawfully in the United States\" at the time of the alleged firearms offenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(5)(A). The defense's argument is that Granados-Alvarado's status as a \"special immigrant juvenile\" (SIJ) shields him\n   from prosecution under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I reject Granados-Alvarado's argument.

It bases this assertion on a provision within Chapter 5 of the Immigration &amp; Nationality Act (\"INA\"), which states that aliens with SIJ status \"shall be deemed, for purposes of [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201255\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ], to have been paroled into the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201255\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h). The defense argues that, as a result of this provision, Granados-Alvarado was effectively \"paroled\" when he received SIJ status in February 2017. Consequently, the defense contends, Granados-Alvarado was lawfully present in the United States at the time of his offense and was therefore beyond the reach of the federal alien-in-possession-of-a-firearm statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The defense's argument raises a question that neither party's filings address at length.

Def.'s Reply 10, ECF No. 63. This argument, though, is not supported by the express language of \u00a7 1255(h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The limited applicability of \u00a7 1255(h) is plain to see. First, the subsection addresses itself to the authorities charged with adjudicating applications for an adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255, directing officials to abide by the dictates of subsection (h) \"[i]n applying this section to\" aliens with SIJ status.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201255\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h). The phrase \"this section\" plainly refers to \u00a7 1255, the section governing adjustments of status. This language strongly indicates that \u00a7 1255(h) is decidedly narrow, both in its purpose and in its effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The subsection goes on to state, in no uncertain terms, that its effect of \"deem[ing]\" a special immigrant juvenile \"to have been paroled into the United States\" applies only \"for purposes of subsection (a).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That is, a special immigrant juvenile is deemed to have been paroled only for purposes of seeking an adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The defense argues Congress inserted the parole designation in \u00a7 1255(h)\"as a means of protecting SIJs from abuse, abandonment, and neglect.\" Def.'s Reply 11. This Court notes, though, that \u00a7 1255(h) does not stand alone. Subsection (g), which immediately precedes it, contains\n   identical language deeming another class of special immigrants - those who \"served honorably on active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(27)(K) - to \"have been paroled\" into the United States \"for purposes of [adjustment of status],\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1255(g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   These provisions serve a practical function. An alien who is already present in the United States and wishes to become a lawful permanent resident has two primary options: he can apply for an adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255, or he can leave the United States and submit to consular processing. It would seem evident that Congress sought to permit certain special immigrants - specifically, those who have served in the U.S. armed forces, \u00a7 1101(a)(27)(k), and juveniles at risk of abuse, neglect, or abandonment, \u00a7 1101(a)(27)(J) - to remain in the United States while seeking an adjustment of status. To do so, though, Congress would have to grapple with the express terms of \u00a7 1255(a), which make adjustment of status available only to aliens who (1) have been inspected and admitted, (2) have been paroled, or (3) have been classified as a Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) self-petitioner.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201255\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). These restrictions might well have excluded many, if not most, of the special immigrants Congress aimed to protect. By declaring that these special immigrants \"shall be deemed, for purposes of subsection (a), to have been paroled into the United States,\" Congress cleared the path for these immigrants to begin the process of legalizing their status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   All of this is to say that, in this Court's view, \u00a7 1255(h) does not accord Granados-Alvarado parolee status for any purposes other than for his application for adjustment of status.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cruz-Gonzalez ex rel.

The court concluded that the precedential case\n   had created \"at least enough ambiguity that the rule of lenity should apply.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9009881\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/405/360/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   court's rationale does not apply here. As far as this Court is aware, there are no precedents in this circuit that might create an ambiguity of the kind that compelled the Fifth Circuit to apply the rule of lenity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   I do not deny \u00a7 922(g)(5) could be clearer. Virtually any statute that draws meaning from U.S. immigration laws cannot help but be complex. As outlined above, though, I have examined the statutory text and the nature of the SIJ program. Having done so, I do not find the phrase \"illegally or unlawfully in the United States\" to be so grievously ambiguous or uncertain that I can do no better than guess at its meaning. Congress has authorized the Government to prosecute the unlawful possession of firearms by an alien. The rule of lenity, in my view, does not empower this Court to bar the prosecution from proceeding in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The statute at issue in this case is a criminal statute. It invokes the language of immigration law, but it remains, at bottom, a public safety statute. In enacting \u00a7 922(g)(5), Congress gave law enforcement an additional tool to crack down on gun trafficking and prevent gun violence. While Congress undoubtedly intended for the SIJ program to help certain young immigrants legalize their status, it is highly unlikely Congress also intended to permit those immigrants to arm themselves with lethal weapons during the process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The defense's motion to dismiss Count I of the indictment is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    The parties fully briefed these issues.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mot. to Dismiss; Resp., ECF No. 57; Reply, ECF No. 63.
