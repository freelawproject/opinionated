Over the past several decades, Olin has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to remediate environmental damage at numerous sites across North America. During the same period, Olin has sought coverage from a host of insurers under policies of general and excess liability insurance, giving rise to a variety of disputes, the great majority of which have now been resolved. In this latest action, Olin seeks coverage from defendants Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's, London and London Market Insurance Companies (together, \"London\"), for expenditures incurred at an Olin-owned manufacturing facility in Morgan Hill, California. ECF No. 12. London has now moved for summary judgment, and Olin has moved for partial summary judgment. The dispositive issue is whether Olin can hold London jointly and severally liable for all expenditures incurred at Morgan Hill, or whether Olin can recover only the pro rata amount of expenditures allocated to each London policy period. ECF Nos. 14, 18. For the reasons stated below, London's motion is granted, and Olin's motion is denied. Furthermore, because Olin's damages do not reach the attachment points of London's policies when allocated on a pro rata basis, Olin's complaint is dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"The background of this interminable litigation has been recounted in countless orders, memoranda, and opinions issued over the past several decades, familiarity with all of which is here, of course, presumed.\"\n   <em>\n    Olin Corp. v.

At issue in the instant litigation are excess insurance policies that cover periods between 1953 and 1970. Unredacted Complaint Ex. A (\"Compl.\"), ECF No. 12. Some, but not all, of these policies contain the following provision, referred to as \"Condition C\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   It is agreed that if any loss covered hereunder is also covered in whole or in part under any other excess Policy issued to the Assured prior to the inception date hereof the limit of liability hereon ... shall be reduced by any amounts due to the Assured on account of such loss under such prior insurance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Subject to the foregoing paragraph and to all the other terms and conditions of this Policy in the event that personal injury or property damage arising out of an occurrence covered hereunder is continuing at the time of termination of this Policy [London] will continue to protect the Assured for liability in respect of such personal injury or property damage without payment of additional premium.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 21, Ex. 2, at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In assessing this provision, it must be remembered that one of the central issues in Olin's litigation with its various insurers has been the appropriate method for allocating liability for property damage that is ongoing and progressive over a number of years. The Second Circuit first addressed this issue in\n   <em>\n    Olin Corp. v.

Under the former approach - which Olin argued was mandated by certain language in its policies - each policy would be liable up to its limits for the entirety of progressive property damage, as long as some property damage took place during the period covered by the policy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11244121\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/221/307/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11244121\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/221/307/\">\n    at 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Both parties assumed that an allocation approach should apply, but they disagreed about the length of the period over which the allocation should be made. This question is significant because the shorter the period, the fewer policies are triggered, and the greater share of remediation costs is allocated to each triggered policy. Olin accordingly argued that property damage continued only until full remediation was required, which was a shorter period that generally ended when active pollution stopped.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8452828\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/468/120/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8452828\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/468/120/\">\n    at 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . London, by contrast, argued that property damage took place over a longer period of passive migration, possibly until Olin began remediation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8452828\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/468/120/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8452828\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/468/120/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Second Circuit purported to adopt \"an intermediate approach,\" but largely sided with London, holding that \"property damage occurs as long as contamination continues to increase or spread, whether or not the contamination is based on active pollution or the passive migration of contamination into the soil and groundwater.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8452828\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/468/120/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8452828\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/468/120/\">\n    at 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Notably, the\n   <em>\n    Olin II\n   </em>\n   court left open whether remediation costs should be allocated equally to each year, or proportionally based on the amount of damage that actually occurred in each policy period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8452828\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/468/120/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8452828\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/468/120/\">\n    at 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   With these rulings in the background, Olin and London entered into a settlement agreement on July 31, 2009 (the \"Settlement Agreement\" or \"Agreement\").

Second, before seeking coverage from London, Olin would deduct from its remediation expenditures any payments made prior to the execution of the Agreement, as well as an additional $10 million from each claim.

ECF No. 17, Ex. F, at 4. According to London, Olin was required to deduct $10 million from the $18.9 million it had incurred after the execution date, and then - pursuant to Paragraph D of the Settlement Agreement - allocate the remaining $8.9 million pro rata equally over the entire period that operations took place at Morgan Hill.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275665\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/130/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Since that period was approximately 40 years, the damages allocated to each of London's policies did not meet the $1.3 million points at which those policies attached.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275665\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/130/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In a letter dated September 18, 2017, Olin made clear its disagreement with London's position.

Of particular relevance to the Court's analysis are London's arguments regarding the text of Paragraph D and its place within the parties' litigation history.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   With respect to the text, London argues that \"the express terms of the Settlement Agreement provide that property damages are to be allocated using a specific\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   allocation formulae.\" London SJ Mem. 7. Indeed, London observes, \"if Olin could recover 'all sums' from any London excess policy containing [Condition C], there would be no reason for the parties to include a\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   [provision] in the Settlement Agreement to begin with.\" London SJ Opp. 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As to litigation history, London contends that pro rata allocation is consistent with prior disputes between London and Olin. London SJ Mem. 11-13. Citing\n   <em>\n    Olin I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Olin II\n   </em>\n   , London argues that a major point of disagreement between the parties was whether property damage should be allocated over a longer or shorter period, and whether it should be allocated equally or by a different method.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6777435\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/27/244/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 11-12 &amp; n.3. By choosing in Paragraph D to allocate property damage equally across the years of operation at Olin-owned sites (and across the years of disposal at non-Olin-owned sites), London argues that the parties resolved their dispute as to both the period over which damage occurred and the method of allocation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Olin responds with several arguments of its own. On Olin's view, the text of the Settlement Agreement makes clear that \"the terms and conditions of\" London's policies \"shall apply as written except as provided in Section VII, Paragraphs C, D and E.\" Given that Paragraph D makes no mention of Condition C, Olin argues, \"London is reduced to arguing that there was some type of repeal by implication.\" Olin SJ Mem. 9. Far from imposing a pro rata allocation regime, Olin continues, Paragraph D defines when property damage begins and ends, as well as the amount of property damage in each period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. Once the period and amounts are defined, Olin argues, \"it becomes clear which of the London Policies are implicated,\" and one need only \"consult the policy terms 'as written' to assess the liability under each policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Olin contends that its view is further bolstered by the parties' litigation history, and by the amount of expert trial testimony devoted to fighting about allocation of property damage across policy years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. Whereas\n   <em>\n    Olin II\n   </em>\n   left the parties to prove when contamination stopped spreading, Olin explains, Paragraph D simplifies the inquiry by requiring the parties to prove only when operations at a site stopped (or, in the case of non-Olin-owned sites, when Olin stopped disposing of waste).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Olin also argues that Paragraph D applies equally to policies that do\n   not contain Condition C, \"a fact that further indicates [Paragraph D] operates independently of Condition C.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   After carefully reviewing each party's arguments, the Court concludes that London is clearly correct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Beginning with the disputed language in the Settlement Agreement - quoted at greater length above - Paragraph D states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Provided that it is agreed between the Parties or otherwise determined that there is coverage under the London Policies, Olin and London Market Insurers agree that with respect to any future third-party Pollution Claim relating to property damage that is not the subject of a release in this Agreement the following allocation methods shall be used:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (i) For property damage losses relating to Pollution at real property owned at any time by Olin, the property damage relating to any Pollution Claim shall be allocated pro rata equally over the entire period of time that any operations took place on any part or parts of the real property Olin owned.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   ECF No. 17, Ex. B, at 21-22. As relevant here, \"Pollution Claim\" is defined as \"any and all Claims relating to Pollution,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, \"Pollution\" is defined as \"actual, alleged or threatened pollution, contamination, damage, injury or harm to any land, soil, watercourse, surface water, ground water, aquifer, body of water, the air and atmosphere and any other tangible thing,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , and \"Claim\" is defined as \"any claim, manner of action, cause of action, suit, debt, or account,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Read most naturally, Paragraph D and its defined terms contemplate the following scheme: Olin incurs losses arising from third-party claims for property damage caused by Olin's polluting activities. If the property damage takes place at a site for which London has not been released, Olin may seek coverage under London's policies for the losses that Olin incurs. These losses, in turn, are allocated on an equal pro rata basis over the period (for sites owned by Olin) during which operations at the site took place. For any given policy period, London must provide coverage for the allocated pro rata loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Olin appears to agree that this is how Paragraph D operates when the underlying London policies do not contain Condition C. In its motion for partial summary judgment, for instance, Olin gives the example of \"London policies covering the years 1956 and 1957 that respond to the first $5 million of coverage in excess of the primary insurance as long as there is property damage during those policy years.\" Olin SJ Mem. 12. Under Paragraph D, Olin argues, \"[i]f Olin makes a claim for Morgan Hill under those policies ... those policies are clearly triggered because Morgan Hill operated during that time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, Olin argues, \"because those policies do not contain Condition C ..., the policies only cover the property damage allocated to those years.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   When the underlying London policies\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   contain Condition C, however, Olin argues that Paragraph D serves \"only to streamline the process of determining which policies were impacted by a particular claim\n   by providing, for example, a defined period of property damage at Olin's sites.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. In such cases, Olin contends, \"the only question that needs to be answered ... is, simply, when operations took place at the Morgan Hill Site. Once the period of operations is known, it becomes clear which of the London Policies are implicated.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. And \"[o]nce there is a determination that those policies are impacted, then one needs to consult the policy terms 'as written' to assess the liability under each policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Olin's interpretation of Paragraph D is problematic for several reasons. First, as just illustrated, Olin's position requires different constructions of Paragraph D depending on whether the underlying London policy contains Condition C. Second, and relatedly, Olin's position renders the words \"pro rata equally\" entirely superfluous when the underlying policy contains Condition C. If Paragraph D simply defined the period of damages in cases where the underlying policy contained Condition C - and if all policies with Condition C imposed joint and several liability - then the effect of Paragraph D would be unchanged if it said only that \"the property damage relating to any Pollution Claim shall be allocated ... over the entire period of time that any operations took place\" (or, in the case of non-Olin-owned sites, \"over the entire period of time that any waste was disposed of or arranged to be disposed of\"). The words \"pro rata equally\" would be left \"without force and effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752011\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/21/139/\">\n    969 N.Y.S.2d 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752011\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/21/139/\">\n    991 N.E.2d at 671-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The problems with Olin's reading deepen when one tries to reconcile the text of Paragraph D with the text of Condition C, which is quoted above, and which provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   It is agreed that if any loss covered hereunder is also covered in whole or in part under any other excess Policy issued to the Assured prior to the inception date hereof the limit of liability hereon ... shall be reduced by any amounts due to the Assured on account of such loss under such prior insurance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Subject to the foregoing paragraph and to all the other terms and conditions of this Policy in the event that personal injury or property damage arising out of an occurrence covered hereunder is continuing at the time of termination of this Policy [London] will continue to protect the Assured for liability in respect of such personal injury or property damage without payment of additional premium.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 21, Ex. 2, at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   As just discussed, Paragraph D is most naturally read as allocating Olin's losses to each policy period on an equal pro rata basis. But this means that no \"loss covered\" under one policy will \"also [be] covered in whole or in part under any other ... Policy,\" thereby rendering the first paragraph of Condition C inapplicable. As the New York Court of Appeals held in\n   <em>\n    Viking Pump\n   </em>\n   , \"it would be inconsistent with the language of [Condition C] to use\n   pro rata allocation,\" because Condition C \"plainly contemplate[s] that multiple successive insurance policies can indemnify the insured for the same loss or occurrence,\" whereas \"the very essence of pro rata allocation is that the insurance policy language limits indemnification to losses and occurrences during the policy period - meaning that no two insurance policies, unless containing overlapping or concurrent policy periods, would indemnify the same loss or occurrence.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6777435\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/27/244/\">\n    33 N.Y.S.3d 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6777435\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/27/244/\">\n    52 N.E.3d at 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Similarly, if property damage is allocated to each policy period on an equal pro rata basis, then no \"property damage arising out of an occurrence covered\" under a policy will be \"continuing at the time of termination of\" the policy, thereby rendering the second paragraph of Condition C inapplicable as well. The\n   <em>\n    Viking Pump\n   </em>\n   court addressed this issue too, writing that, \"under a pro rata allocation, no policy covers a loss that began during a particular policy period and continued after termination of that period.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6777435\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/27/244/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6777435\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/27/244/\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6777435\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/27/244/\">\n    33 N.Y.S.3d 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6777435\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/27/244/\">\n    52 N.E.3d at 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At bottom, the most natural reading of Condition C - in the view of this Court and the\n   <em>\n    Viking Pump\n   </em>\n   court - makes clear that the provision \"cannot logically be applied in a pro rata allocation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6777435\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/27/244/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And since Paragraph D imposes a pro rata allocation, Condition C must give way.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In addition to providing the most plausible textual reading, London's interpretation of Paragraph D makes significantly more sense than Olin's when viewed in the context of the parties' litigation history.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   As discussed above, Olin and its insurers spent the first decade of the 2000s fighting about the appropriate method for allocating liability for progressive property damage.

Olin argued that liability should be allocated over a shorter timeline, so that the amount allocated to each policy period would be\n   greater. London argued the opposite, and the Second Circuit largely agreed with London, holding that liability should be allocated over the period during which contamination continued to spread, whether through active pollution or passive migration.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8452828\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/468/120/\">\n    468 F.3d at 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Second, how much damage should be allocated to each policy period? Paragraph D provides simple answers to both of these questions: First, property damage stops when operations stop (for Olin-owned sites), or when disposal of waste stops (at non-owned sites). Second, an equal amount of damage should be allocated to each year. Even Olin concedes that these two concerns drove the adoption of Paragraph D.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, it is hard to understand what the parties could have thought they were doing other than enacting a pro rata allocation regime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Given these textual and historical considerations, the Court has no difficulty concluding that the Settlement Agreement imposes a pro rata allocation regime, even on London policies that contain Condition C.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, the Court hereby grants London's motion for summary judgment, and it denies Olin's motion for partial summary judgment.

This is incorrect, however, because even if Paragraph D defined only the period over which damages occurred (and thus defined only which policies were triggered), different ranges of policies would be triggered depending on whether the period of damages was defined in terms of when operations took place at an Olin-owned site, or in terms of when Olin disposed of waste at a non-owned site.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Olin Reply 7-9.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    For similar reasons, Olin is incorrect in arguing that Paragraph D could not have overridden Condition C without referencing it explicitly.
