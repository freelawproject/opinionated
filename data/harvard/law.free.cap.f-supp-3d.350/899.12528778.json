Doc. 83-1 at 52-53. In 2008, Garfield moved his research to Dignity Health in Phoenix, Arizona, and invited Maner to join his team there. Doc. 83-1 at 53-54. Maner agreed, and Dignity Health hired Maner as a Bio Med Design Engineer in its Research Grants Department, where Garfield remained Maner's supervisor. Doc. 83-1 at 53; Doc. 81-1 at 52. Garfield also invited researchers Leili Shi and Dr. Yuan L. Dong to continue working with him in Phoenix. Doc. 83-1 at 54. Shi and Garfield had been in a romantic relationship for about 22 years (Doc. 81-2 at 4), and Maner was aware of their relationship (Doc. 83-1 at 55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Due to space constraints in Garfield's Phoenix lab, Maner worked at Dignity Health's facility several miles away with two other researchers. Doc. 83-1 at 59-60, 64. Maner's job duties included providing \"technical biomedical engineering support ... in the design and applications of\" equipment, monitoring research subjects, working with Garfield on \"design and experimental protocols,\" and \"[i]nteract[ing] with clinical colleagues, postdoctoral fellows, students and other faculty.\" Doc. 81-1 at 55. Maner agrees his job duties included interactions with others, but disputes he was required to be \"at the hospital\" for those interactions and states that he \"regularly interacted with colleagues remotely.\" Doc. 83 \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Between July 2008 and July 2009, Garfield rated Maner's performance at Dignity Health as \"outstanding\" and gave him the highest rank in every category. Docs. 83-1 at 76-77, 79; 81-1 at 56-68. Garfield's comments included:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Overall an outstanding performance. It would be very difficult to function at our present level without Mr. Maner. He does an excellent job in assisting in all aspects of our work .... He gets along very well with everyone and strives to achieve the highest levels of accomplishments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Doc. 81-1 at 68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Maner received a salary increase based on Garfield's July 2009 review (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20, 71), and a further increase in September 2010 after another favorable review (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 73-78, 80). In August 2010, a Texas court put Maner on probation. Doc. 83-1 at 93-94. Maner learned he would need to serve his probation in Texas unless he received permission to work outside the state.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202000\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202000\">\n    at 95-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Maner asked Garfield if he could work remotely in Texas. Docs. 83-1 at 92; 81-1 at 82. Garfield agreed, saying: \"I will help you any way I can. We will work this out even if you have to stay in Galveston for some time.\" Docs. 83-1 at 96; 81-1 at 82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Maner admits he was an at-will employee at Dignity Health and that Garfield could have terminated him rather than permit remote work. Doc. 83-1 at 97. But Maner disputes that \"working physically (as opposed to remotely) in Garfield's lab was a condition of his employment.\" Docs. 83 \u00b6 25; 83-1 at 96-97. Maner could have sought permission from the Texas probation department to work in Phoenix and commute to Texas to report to his probation officer (Doc. 83-1 at 93), but he did not make the request because it was \"absolutely\n   impractical\" financially and temporally (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 92, 95).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Maner began working in Texas in late 2010. Doc. 83-1 at 128-29. In August 2011, Garfield gave him an unfavorable review, stating that he \"Needs Improvement\" in almost every review category. Doc. 81-1 at 86-90. Garfield's comments included:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [Maner] has helped occasionally on analysis of data but it is essential that he be here to fulfill all our needs and it [is] obvious that this can not be done completely when he is in Texas.

Maner listed several projects he worked on in Texas, asserted that he had frequent and documented contact with colleagues, and stated that he was informed on multiple occasions that his work was successful.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202000\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As evidence that Garfield was happy with his work, Maner pointed to an email shortly before the review in which Garfield wrote that the lab was running out of funds and needed to develop a strategy to pay Maner. Doc. 83-8 at 4; Doc. 83 \u00b6\u00b6 82-85. The Review Response asserted that limited funding, not Maner's performance, prompted the \"inaccurate\" review. Doc. 83-1 at 144.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Maner also wrote a letter to a Dignity Health doctor (the \"Lukas letter\"), regarding his arrangement to work in Texas, his performance, and funding for his position. Doc. 81-1 at 93. In a letter to Dignity Health Senior Vice President on October 11, 2011 (\"the Vallier letter\"), Maner addressed his work performance and the availability of funds for his position.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202000\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202000\">\n    at 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Dignity Health claims to have terminated Maner on October 1, 2011.

A plaintiff can establish an inference of discrimination \"by satisfying the prima facie elements from\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   : (1) the plaintiff belongs to a protected class, (2) he was performing according to his employer's legitimate expectations, (3) he suffered an adverse employment action, and (4) similarly situated employees were treated more favorably, or other circumstances surrounding the adverse employment action give rise to an inference of discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Reynaga\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188225\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/678/#p690\">\n    847 F.3d at 690-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Once a plaintiff satisfies this prima facie case, \"the burden shifts to the defendant to provide a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.

Doc. 80 at 5. Even if he does allege sex discrimination, Dignity Health argues that Maner cannot satisfy the fourth element of his prima facie case - that similarly situated employees were treated more favorably.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Maner's Sex Discrimination Claim.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Maner argues that Dignity Health mischaracterizes his claim, but Maner's own statements repeatedly show that his claim of disparate treatment is based not on the fact that he is male, but on Garfield's favoritism of a romantic partner. Maner complains that he was \"treated less favorably than Shi because Garfield preferred his female employee and romantic live-in partner for the purposes of travelling to conferences.\" Doc. 30 \u00b6 34. Maner claims he was terminated because Garfield \"needed to terminate another male employee in order to free up the funds to keep his girlfriend employed.\" Doc. 83-1 at 142. Maner asserts: \"She's a female. He's terminating a male to keep her employed. Of course it's sex discrimination.\" Doc. 83-1 at 146. And: \"If I were a woman that was sleeping with him, I would have probably got a glowing review in 2011.\" Doc. 83-1 at 161. Maner responded similarly throughout his deposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 83-1 at 163-68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Maner's response to the motion for summary judgment makes the same argument: Garfield \"unlawfully favored his romantic partner Leili Shi (female) over the course of several years, and protected her from termination on two separate instances.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Doc. 82 at 1-2. Garfield \"gave work preferences to his female partner, Leili Shi, as compared to the male workers,\" and showed \"continued, unwavering, favoritism towards his female romantic partner.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9. In short, Maner's claim rests on Garfield's favoritism of Shi because of their romantic relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The \"Paramour Theory.\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Maner asserts a Title VII claim that has been called the \"paramour theory.\" This name describes \"claims of discrimination where a supervisor's preference for a paramour ... results in an adverse employment action against the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Nygren v.
