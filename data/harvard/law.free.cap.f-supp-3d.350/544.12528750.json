For the reasons that follow, the plaintiff's motion to strike is GRANTED, and the defendant's motion to dismiss is GRANTED in part, as to the plaintiff's \"class of one\" Equal Protection claim under the Fourteenth Amendment, and DENIED in part, as to the plaintiff's pled claim that the City's Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance, \u00a7 21.6.V, constitutes an unconstitutional content-based regulation and prior restraint of speech in violation of the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This civil rights lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of the City's murals-permit scheme, which regulates the installation of artwork on all private property throughout the City of New Orleans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Neal Morris lives in Orleans Parish, where he owns residential and commercial properties. In late 2017, seeking information concerning the City's murals permit process and the criteria used to determine approval, Morris visited New Orleans City Hall. No City employee gave him the information he requested. Nevertheless, on November 4, 2017, Morris commissioned a local artist to paint a mural on a commercial property he owns at 3521 South Liberty Street. The mural quotes a comment made by President Donald Trump, recorded in a 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" segment; the mural replaces with pictograms two vulgar words used by Trump.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Just a few days after the mural was painted, a local news outlet publicized a story about the mural and noted that murals \"are typically regulated by the Historic District Landmarks Commission and the City Council.\" The same day the news story was published, on November 8, 2017, the City of New Orleans Department of Safety and Permits sent Morris a letter advising him that the mural violated a zoning ordinance. Specifically, Jennifer Cecil, the purported director of the City's \"One Stop for Permits and Licenses,\" wrote that an inspection of the property on November 8 revealed a violation of Section 12.2.4(8) of the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance, which, according to the letter, concerns \"Prohibited Signs-Historic District.\" Ms. Cecil described the violation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The mural on the building on this property is not allowed in that the property is zoned residentially and murals shall not be permitted in any residentially zoned historic district.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Morris was told to remove the mural, and warned that his failure to do so by November 22, 2017\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   will cause the Department of Safety and Permits to initiate appropriate legal action to secure compliance. The penalty for failure to comply is a maximum fine or jail for each and every day the violation continues plus court cost as prescribed by law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Ms. Cecil said Morris should contact her once the mural was removed so that she could re-inspect the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Morris discovered several inaccuracies in the November 8 letter: Section 12.2.4(8) does not exist; there is no section titled \"Prohibited Signs-Historic District\" in the CZO; nor does the CZO contain a blanket prohibition on murals in residentially zoned historic districts. On November 17, 2017, Morris wrote to the City requesting clarification in light of his discovery of the inaccuracies in Ms. Cecil's letter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City did not respond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Fearing prosecution, Morris sued the City on March 13, 2018, alleging that the \"murals-permit scheme (Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance \u00a7 216.V et seq. and Municipal Code \u00a7 134-78A et seq.)\" violate his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   His complaint alleges that: (1) the City's requirement that property owners obtain advance government approval before receiving a mural permit, or face criminal punishment, subjects him and other property owners to an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech where approval or denial of a permit is left to the unfettered discretion of City officials; (2) the City's murals-permit process is an unconstitutional, content-based restriction on speech insofar as an applicant must pay a $500 fee and must submit a drawing, which will be subject to the City's \"acceptability\" review before a mural is approved;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (3) the City's murals-permit process violates Morris' and other property owners' due process rights by subjecting their artistic expression to prior review, indefinite in duration, by unspecified officials using vague, overbroad, or nonexistent standards;\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (4) the City\n   engages in selective enforcement of its mural regulations in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Morris' complaint requests:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 A preliminary (and ultimately permanent) injunction barring the City from enforcing the murals-permit scheme, Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance \u00a7 21.6.V et seq. and Municipal Code \u00a7 134-78A et seq.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 A declaratory judgment that the City's actions, policies, and procedures embodied in the murals-permit scheme are unconstitutional violations of the plaintiff's rights under the First Amendment, as well as the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Reasonable attorney's fees, expenses, and costs under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   About two months after Morris filed suit, on May 24, 2018, the New Orleans City Council enacted M.C.S., Ordinance No. 27783, which removed Sections 134-78A and 134-78B from the Municipal Code. As a result, the City's murals-permitting scheme is now found only at CZO Section 21.6.V.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, the City agreed that it would not enforce its murals-permitting scheme against Mr. Morris for existing murals on his property, or any additional murals painted on any of his properties, during the pendency of this lawsuit. In light of the City's non-enforcement pledge, this Court, in its Order and Reasons dated May 31, 2018, denied as moot Mr. Morris' motion for preliminary injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Then, on June 6, 2018, the City moved to dismiss the plaintiff's claims under Rule 12(b)(6) on the grounds that its murals-permitting scheme, now located only at CZO Section 21.6.V, is facially constitutional as a valid time, place, and manner restriction, and that the plaintiff's due process and equal protection claims are without merit. Morris filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss on June 19, 2018, and the City was granted leave to file a reply on June 27, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   About a month later, on August 2, 2018, the City was granted leave to file a supplemental memorandum in support of its motion to dismiss. In this paper, the City informs the Court that Morris \"appears\" to have violated his agreement with the City.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, Morris moved to strike the City's supplemental memorandum under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f)(2), contending that this pleading was untimely filed, is legally irrelevant to the pending motion, and was submitted solely to prejudice him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows a party to move for dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

This challenged pleading contains extraneous allegations regarding Morris' purported violation of his \"agreement\" with the City. In particular, the City informs the Court that Morris agreed to give the City notice prior to erecting any new\n   mural and that he has erected additional murals without providing such notice. The City also relates that Morris has formed the \"Nola Mural Project\" in an effort to \"defy New Orleans ordinances.\" While such conduct might seem to some as contemptuous and immature, the Court may only rely on factual allegations contained within the plaintiff's complaint when deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, so it may not consider this submission.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the plaintiff's motion to strike the City's supplemental memorandum is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court next considers whether the plaintiff has standing to prosecute this lawsuit. In its motion to dismiss, the City contends that the plaintiff lacks standing because he has failed to establish that he has suffered an injury-in-fact. The City submits that the plaintiff has paid no \"fees,\" did not even apply for a permit, and will not have to take down his murals or pay a fine for failing to do so, in light of the City's pledge to stay enforcement against his murals during the pendency of this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"Article III of the Constitution limits federal courts' jurisdiction to certain 'Cases' and 'Controversies.' \"\n   <em>\n    Clapper v.

Section 21.6.V.2(b) provides in full: \"General drawing and written description of the type of mural (painted, mosaic, etc).\" The City declares that it is simply attempting to determine the type of mural insofar as the medium used and that the contents of a mural are not reviewed. It further submits that the standards of approval do not even contemplate the contents of a mural, but rather, seek to ensure that the historic fabric of the City remains intact and that the health, safety, and welfare of the public are maintained.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court turns to the provisions of the CZO regarding murals to determine whether their plain language allows for content review. Section 21.6.V.1(a), entitled \"Application,\" provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   No person, firm, or corporation may commence a mural installation on a site without development plan and design review approval by the Executive Director of the City Planning Commission and the Design Advisory Committee in accordance with Section 4.5. A separate application is required for each mural on a site.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   According to \u00a7 21.6.V.1(a), the process for approving murals permits is located in\n   \u00a7 4.5, entitled \"Development Plan and Design Review.\" Two subsections of \u00a7 4.5 - namely, those discussing its purpose and approval standards - are relevant in determining whether the content of murals is considered in the review process. First, \u00a7 4.5A sets forth the \"purpose\" of the development plan and design review process as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   The development plan and design review process is intended to promote orderly development and redevelopment in the City and to assure that such development or redevelopment occurs in a manner that is harmonious with surrounding properties and neighborhoods, is consistent with the Master Plan, and promotes the general welfare of the City. This section provides standards by which to determine and control the physical layout and design to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   1. Ensure compatibility of land uses and structures.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   2. Protect and enhance community property values.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   3. Ensure the efficient use of land.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   4. Minimize traffic and safety hazards.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   5. Ensure efficient parking layout.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   6. Minimize environmental impacts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   7. Incorporate proper stormwater management and sustainable design techniques.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In addition, \u00a7 4.5E contains \"approval standards\" designed to guide City Officials during the review process. Section 4.5E provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   In reviewing site plan and design review applications, the relationship of the development plan to adopted land use policies and the goals and objectives of the Master Plan shall be evaluated. In addition, the following characteristics shall be considered:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   1. Degree of conformity with the regulations of this Ordinance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   2. Degree of conformity with all applicable regulations within the City Code, and the goals and policies of the Master Plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   3. The location, arrangement, size, design, and general site compatibility of buildings, lighting, and signs, including:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   a. Compatibility with, and mitigation of, any potential impact upon, adjacent property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   b. Site illumination designed and installed to minimize adverse impact on adjacent properties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   c. Signs in accordance with Article 24.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   6. Building design that enhances the design quality and character of the surrounding community through strategies such as:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   a. Maintaining existing development patterns reflected in the intent of the Master Plan or other adopted plans, or reflecting changes proposed within the Master Plan or other adopted plans.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   b. Providing a visible transition in height and bulk between higher and lower density development.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   c. Reinforcing the prevailing orientation to the street.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   d. Strengthening the character of walkable streets, intact residential neighborhoods, and other environments for which this prevailing character reflects the urban design goals of the Master Plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   e. Respecting historic design context.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Returning to \u00a7 21.6.V of the CZO, which contains provisions devoted exclusively to murals, \u00a7 21.6.V.2 sets forth \"required submittals\" for a murals permit application as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   a. Building elevation drawn to scale that identifies:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   i. The fa\u00e7ade on which the mural is proposed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   ii. The location of existing and proposed murals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   iii. The mural dimensions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   iv. The height of the mural above grade.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   v. The building eave/cornice and roofline.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   b. General drawing and written description of the type of mural (painted, mosaic, etc).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   c. If the mural is not painted directly on a wall surface, details showing how the mural is affixed to the wall surface.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Finally, \"standards\" for murals are located in \u00a7 21.6.V.3, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   a. Murals are considered public art. Murals are not permitted to advertise any product, service or brand. No off-premise advertising is permitted. Non-commercial messages are permitted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   b. Mural areas will not be painted on or obscure architectural features such as windows, doors (other than egress-only), pilasters, cornices, signs required by the City Code, or other building trim, feature bands, and other recessed or projecting features.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   c. Murals with any element that weighs more than seven (7) pounds per square foot, or in total weighs more than four-hundred (400) pounds require structural review and approval from the Director of the Department of Safety and Permits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   d. Building owners are responsible for ensuring that a permitted mural is maintained in good condition and is repaired in the case of vandalism or accidental destruction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   e. Muralists and building owners are encouraged to use protective clear top coatings, cleanable surfaces, and/or other measures that will discourage vandalism or facilitate easier and cheaper repair of the mural if needed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   When these provisions are read together, the CZO requires an applicant to submit a general drawing of his mural for development plan and design review approval by the Executive Director of the City Planning Commission and the Design Advisory Committee. The purpose of the review process is to assure that the proposed development is \"harmonious with surrounding properties and neighborhoods\" and \"promotes the general welfare of the City.\" In reviewing an application, City officials must consider whether the proposed design is compatible with adjacent property and \"enhances the design quality and character of the surrounding community,\" such as by \"strengthening the character\" of streets and neighborhoods and \"respecting historic design context.\" Finally, the CZO designates \"standards\" for murals, indicating that murals may only include non-commercial messages, may not be painted on or obscure architectural features like windows or doors, may not weigh more than a certain amount without structural review and approval, and must be maintained in good condition by the building owner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Accordingly, a plain reading of the CZO reveals that the \"development plan and design review approval\" process involves a review of the content of proposed murals. Because applicants are required to submit a general drawing of their proposal mural for \"development plan and design review approval,\" it cannot reasonably be said that City officials do not consider content when determining whether to approve or deny a permit. The stated purpose of the design review and approval process and standards for approval further lend support to this conclusion. Indeed, City officials\n   cannot determine whether a mural's design \"enhances the quality and character of the surrounding community,\" \"strengthen[s] the character\" of streets and neighborhoods, or \"respect[s] historical design context\" without evaluating the content of the proposed mural. Although the CZO sets forth \"standards\" for murals regarding placement, weight, and condition, these standards do not eliminate City officials' ability to review content. Moreover, notably absent from the CZO is a disclaimer that content shall\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be considered. Ultimately, because the drawing submittal requirement cannot be justified by a purpose other than intended content review, the Court finds that the plaintiff has plausibly alleged that the murals permit application process constitutes a content-based regulation of speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   This determination implicates strict scrutiny, which requires the City \"to prove that the restriction furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/#p2226\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In his complaint, the plaintiff alleges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   The City has no compelling interest in preventing Plaintiff and other property owners from commissioning, painting, or installing murals on their own properties. Even if the City had a compelling interest in regulating murals on private property, its regulatory scheme is not so narrowly tailored that no less restrictive measure would satisfy that purported interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   As indicated by the stated \"purpose\" for the City's development plan and design review process, the regulation primarily is intended to preserve the City's aesthetic appeal and advance traffic safety. The plaintiff contends in his opposition papers that these interests are not compelling. He further submits that the regulation is not narrowly tailored because it is overinclusive, as it applies throughout the City and is not limited to historically designated homes or neighborhoods. Finally, the plaintiff contends that the City could protect its interests through less restrictive means, such as by citing property owners with zoning violations after they occur, rather than engaging in advanced review coupled with extensive paperwork and submission requirements.

The City directs the Court to a Notice located on the City's website, indicating that the Historic District Landmarks Commission approved the mural located on the side of the Ogden Museum.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the plaintiff correctly notes in his opposition that, pursuant to \u00a7 21.6.V.1(b) of the CZO, Commission approval is only part of the permit scheme, as the Design Advisory Committee must also review the mural.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff submits that he has alleged that the Ogden Museum's mural did not obtain such a permit, and the City has not shown otherwise. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The City also contends in its motion to dismiss that the mural located on the Girod fire station obtained approval in accordance with the CZO, appealing and receiving ultimate approval from the City Planning Commission after the Executive Director initially denied the request. In an attempt to corroborate this contention, the City directs the Court to a City Planning Commission Staff Report located on a different City website. However, Morris correctly notes in his opposition paper that this Report only indicates that the Executive Director denied the fire station's mural application and that, on appeal to the City Planning Commission, the Commission also recommended denial. In response, the City contends in its reply paper that because the fire station is government property, the mural located thereon constitutes government speech, which is not subject to scrutiny under the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pleasant Grove City, Utah v.
