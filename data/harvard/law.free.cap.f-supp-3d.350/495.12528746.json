ECF No. 1-1 at 1. The defendants, Garret Pugh, Doug Howell, and the City of Wheeling, removed the civil action to this Court on June 27, 2016. ECF No. 1. On February 15, 2017, this Court approved the parties' stipulation of dismissal of defendant Doug Howell. ECF No. 19. Therefore, Garret Pugh (\"Officer Pugh\") and the City of Wheeling (\"City\") are the only remaining defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises out of the alleged actions of a police officer during a traffic stop in or around Wheeling, West Virginia. The parties agree that on June 23, 2014, the plaintiff was pulled over while traveling on I-470. ECF Nos. 1-1 at 2-3 and 5 at 4-5. In the course of the traffic stop, the police officers searched the plaintiff's vehicle and forcibly removed the plaintiff from his vehicle, including the use of a taser. ECF No. 1-1 at 5-6. The plaintiff was arrested, but all charges were eventually dropped.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9. The plaintiff initially brought claims for deprivation of civil rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , intentional infliction of emotional distress (\"IIED\"), battery, assault, negligent retention and hiring, civil conspiracy, and negligent training and supervision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 12-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 14, 2018, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. ECF No. 24. The defendants argue that Officer Pugh, a Wheeling police officer, is immune from both the \u00a7 1983 claim and the state law claims, and that the plaintiff has failed to provide supporting evidence for the state law claims. ECF No. 25 at 5, 16, and 20-25. First, the defendants argue that Officer Pugh is immune for purposes of \u00a7 1983 because qualified immunity protects public officials for actions made in the course of their employment as long as they acted reasonably.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendants argue that throughout the traffic stop, arrest, and search of the vehicle, Officer Pugh's actions were reasonable and legal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 7-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Second, the defendants assert that Officer Pugh is immune from liability for the claims of IIED, battery, and assault.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under West Virginia Code \u00a7 29-12A-5(b), the Governmental Tort Claims and Insurance Reform Act:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   An employee of a political subdivision is immune from liability unless one of the following applies: (1) His or her acts or omissions were manifestly outside the scope of employment or official responsibilities; (2) His or her acts or omissions were with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner; or (3) Liability is expressly imposed upon the employee by a provision of this code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2029\">\n    W. Va. Code \u00a7 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -12A-5. The defendants contend that Officer Pugh was acting within the scope of his employment and that the plaintiff has offered no evidence that Officer Pugh acted maliciously. ECF No. 25 at 16. Thus, the defendants contend Officer Pugh is immune from liability.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2029\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Third, the defendants argue that the City cannot be held liable for the claims of IIED, battery, and assault, because \"[state] law does not allow political subdivisions to be held liable for 'intentional malfeasance' on the part of their employees.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Fourth, the defendants argue that the plaintiff has provided no evidence to support the negligent retention and hiring claim; they contend this is merely a \"boilerplate assertion\" without any specific evidence of a negligent hiring decision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2029\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2029\">\n    at 17-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendants similarly argue that the negligent training and supervision claim, the supervisor liability claims, the municipal liability claims, and the deliberate indifference claim likewise must fail because the plaintiff has either merely asserted the claims without offering supporting\n   evidence or failed to fully plead the claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2029\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2029\">\n    at 20-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Fifth, the defendants argue that the civil conspiracy claim must fail because the plaintiffs have not alleged any facts to show that there was an agreement or understanding among the defendants.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2029\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2029\">\n    at 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

ECF No. 28. In it, the plaintiff first waives and concedes judgment on the claims of negligent retention and hiring, assault, negligent training and supervision, and deliberate indifference.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff then argues that the remaining claims are inappropriate for summary judgment because they all rest on a disputed material fact-namely, whether Officer Pugh was within his jurisdictional limits when he observed the plaintiff's driving.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Along the portion of I-470 in question, the interstate passes through the city limits in such a way that the interstate is within the city limits of Wheeling, then proceeds into city limits of the Village of Bethlehem, and then back into the city limits of Wheeling. ECF No. 28-1. Relying on the deposition of Officer Pugh, the plaintiff contends that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Officer Pugh observed the plaintiff driving too closely to the vehicle ahead of him in Wheeling or Bethlehem. ECF No. 28 at 1-2. Because Officer Pugh's observation of plaintiff following too closely was the probable cause by which he pulled over the plaintiff, the plaintiff contends that the subsequent stop, search, and arrest were unlawful if this observation occurred outside his jurisdiction in Bethlehem. ECF No. 28 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The plaintiff then claims that Officer Pugh violated the plaintiff's clearly established rights under the First and Fourth Amendments because the stop was illegal and \"a jury might reasonably conclude that [d]efendant Pugh summoned 'back up' because of Mr. Byndon and his front seat passenger [sic] spirited criticism of [d]efendant Pugh's stated basis for stopping him.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 18-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff claims that this jurisdictional issue is one of material fact for the claims of civil conspiracy, IIED, battery, and the \u00a7 1983 claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The defendants filed a reply.

Thus, the defendants argue that the plaintiff's claims must fail because the plaintiff's argument is \"entirely dependent upon his proposition that the traffic stop was illegal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Next, they contend that even if the Court assumes that Officer Pugh did not realize he was outside the city limits when he activated the light bar on his police cruiser, it was reasonable for him to believe he was still within Wheeling's city limits.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 5-6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendants therefore argue that qualified immunity applies because \"[d]efendant Pugh's actions were reasonable under the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Further, the defendants contend that the plaintiff's First Amendment argument is \"senseless\" because rather than Officer Pugh calling for backup in response to plaintiff's criticism, the plaintiff himself called the police department to demand a supervisor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In addition to the jurisdictional issue, the defendants note that there are additional reasons the plaintiff's state law claims must be dismissed.

First, plaintiff Byndon does not deny that Officer Pugh had reasonable suspicion to pull him over; rather, he contends that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Officer Pugh had \"probable cause to pull over plaintiff within the jurisdictional limits of the city.\" ECF No. 28 at 1-2. Second, Officer Pugh testified that he saw Byndon was \"following too closely,\" in violation of West Virginia Code \u00a7 17C-7-10(a). ECF No. 25 at 7-8. This provided Officer Pugh with probable cause to believe that Byndon had violated the West Virginia traffic code. As the Fourth Circuit has recognized, pulling over a vehicle and citing a driver for such a traffic violation is permissible under the Fourth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

It is undisputed that under West Virginia \u00a7 17C-7-10(a), officers have authority to ensure that an operator of a motor vehicle does not follow another vehicle more closely than reasonably necessary. However, \"[i]n order to arrest for the violation of municipal ordinances and as to all matters arising within the corporate limits and coming within the scope of his official duties, the powers of any chief, policeman or sergeant shall extend anywhere within the county or counties in which the municipality is located, and any such chief, policeman or sergeant shall have the same authority of pursuit and arrest beyond his normal jurisdiction as has a sheriff.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%208-14-3\">\n    W.

While the Fourth Circuit has provided general guidance, the Court has yet to address this specific issue, namely-whether an officer violates the Fourth Amendment when he observes a traffic violation outside of his jurisdiction, unauthorized by state law, and then conducts a stop and arrest based on that extra-jurisdictional conduct. However, other Circuit Courts of Appeal have provided some guidance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has addressed a similar issue finding that compliance with state law may be relevant for analyzing reasonableness under a Fourth Amendment analysis, but such a violation does not mean\n   there is a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   violation of the plaintiff's constitutional rights.\n   <em>\n    Swanson v.

Specifically, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Swanson\n   </em>\n   concluded that a traffic stop outside the officers' home jurisdiction, even if unauthorized by state law, does not constitute an unlawful seizure under the Fourth Amendment. The Court also found that a reasonable police officer would not have known that the extra-jurisdictional, but within the same state, traffic stop constituted clearly established Fourth Amendment law, when no dispute exists that the officer observed the traffic violation before effectuating the stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Moreover, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has addressed a similar issue when the plaintiff brought a \u00a7 1983 action against a county forest preserve district, individual district police officers, and witnesses, asserting,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , claims based on the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Court found that despite the forest preserve officers' violation of state statutes governing their jurisdiction with respect to arrests outside a preserve, the arrest itself does not give rise to a \u00a7 1983 action for violation of the Fourth Amendment, without a showing that it was made in \"blatant disregard of state law and thus unreasonable; federal government was not enforcer of state law.\"\n   <em>\n    Pasiewicz v.

Importantly, the Court noted that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   There is significant distinction between police action which is unlawful because violative of constitutional provisions and police action which merely fails to accord with statute, rule or some other nonconstitutional mandate. The protection against arrest without probable cause, as well as that against unreasonable searches and seizures, stems directly from the Fourth Amendment.

Further in light of the other factors, especially factor 1, the weight falls in favor of the reasonableness of the arrest, regardless of whether or not Officer Pugh first saw the alleged traffic infraction in Wheeling or Bethlehem, and regardless of where Officer Pugh seized Plaintiff Byndon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   iii)\n   <em>\n    Factor 3\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Analysis under the third factor also suggests no constitutional violation because Officer Pugh was acting between two political subdivisions within the State of West Virginia. In fact, there is no dispute that Officer Pugh stopped and arrested plaintiff Byndon within the State; rather, the main contention is with respect to whether Officer Pugh was within his jurisdictional limits when he observed plaintiff's alleged traffic infraction that provided justification for Officer Pugh to stop plaintiff Byndon's vehicle.

As mentioned above, there is sufficient evidence demonstrating that Officer Pugh witnessed the alleged traffic infraction within his jurisdiction (factor 5). Moreover, there is no evidence to indicate that Officer Pugh intended to act outside of his territorial jurisdiction or that he was in blatant disregard of the law (factor 7). Lastly, Officer Pugh saw what seemed to be an emergency situation with the defendant allegedly traveling dangerously close to another vehicle (ECF No. 28 at 9) (factor 4), in violation of the purpose behind the creation of West Virginia Code \u00a7 17C-7-10(a) (factor 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   All these factors speak to the reasonableness of Officer Pugh's conduct. Therefore, Officer Pugh is entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Even assuming Officer Pugh committed a constitutional violation, such violation was not clearly established at the time of the stop and arrest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   As a starting point, the plaintiff relies on basic Fourth Amendment search and seizure jurisprudence. The plaintiff also asserts that Officer Pugh, by observing plaintiff's wrongful driving outside of his jurisdictional limits and effectuating a stop based on those observations, violated West Virginia Code \u00a7 8-14-3 that defines the powers of a municipal officer. ECF No. 28 at 1-11. However, without addressing whether Officer Pugh violated West Virginia law, such a violation does not necessarily mean the defendants violated the plaintiff's federal constitutional rights. Moreover, the plaintiff has failed to provide precedent to support his conclusion that the officers have committed a constitutional violation. As indicated, the Fourth Circuit holds that \"there is significant distinction between police action which is unlawful because violative of constitutional provisions and police action which merely fails to accord with statute, rule or some other nonconstitutional mandate.\"\n   <em>\n    Surdyka\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"474856\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/492/368/#p371\">\n    492 F.2d at 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the context of traffic stops,\n   <em>\n    Atwell\n   </em>\n   demonstrates that compliance with state law is only one factor that may be relevant in the overall analysis. In short, relevant precedent does not establish that a traffic stop that was based on observing an alleged traffic infraction outside an officer's home jurisdiction, even if unauthorized by state law, constitutes an unlawful seizure under the Fourth Amendment. A reasonable police officer would not have known at the time of this incident that extra-jurisdictional, but within the same state, observations that establish probable cause or reasonable suspicion to stop a vehicle would constitute a violation of clearly established Fourth Amendment law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   (2)\n   <em>\n    Officer Pugh lawfully arrested plaintiff Byndon\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The second issue is whether Officer Pugh had probable cause to arrest plaintiff Byndon.

Regarding the first factor, Officer Pugh allegedly witnessed plaintiff Byndon violate a traffic law and after lawfully stopping plaintiff Byndon's vehicle, plaintiff Byndon failed to provide any standard and requisite information to Officer Pugh while actively resisting his orders. The second factor likewise weighs in favor of Officer Pugh, as Officer Pugh had reason to believe that plaintiff Byndon could react violently and be confrontational. As for the third factor, resistance from plaintiff Byndon was not merely instinctive, but rather the evidence demonstrates that Officer Pugh attempted to reason with plaintiff Byndon and that plaintiff Byndon continuously refused to cooperate and retaliated, only feet away from a highway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   (b)\n   <em>\n    First Amendment Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The plaintiff asserts, for the first time in his response to the defendants' motion for\n   summary judgment, that \"a jury might reasonably conclude that [d]efendant Pugh summoned 'back up' because of plaintiff Byndon and his front seat passenger spirited criticism of [d]efendant Pugh's stated basis for stopping him.\" ECF No. 28 at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The First Amendment does not provide a right to be free from a retaliatory arrest that is supported by probable cause.\n   <em>\n    Reichle v.

Moreover, the evidence demonstrates that the plaintiff repeatedly refused to produce his license, registration, and proof of insurance. He also refused to step out of his vehicle after Officer Pugh lawfully requested him to do so. For these reasons, the defendant had probable cause to arrest the plaintiff for obstruction of a law enforcement officer. Therefore, this claim cannot be the reason Officer Pugh is not entitled to qualified immunity. Moreover, the plaintiff has failed to allege that a particular right has been violated; rather, the defendant simply makes broad general propositions without identifying any particular right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   (c)\n   <em>\n    Right to interstate travel and moving interstate\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The plaintiff, for the first time during this litigation, has made an argument based on the constitutionally protected right of interstate travel and movement, solely alleging that this right was \"impaired by [d]efendant's actions unlawfully stopping him.\" ECF No. 28 at 20-21. This Court finds this argument to be without merit.

This claim is insufficiently supported by facts and must be dismissed. The only support that plaintiff Byndon provides for this claim in opposing summary judgment is in a brief paragraph which states that the defendants' contention is \"mere\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   argument, not a factual one. Certainly, initiating a false arrest and battering an arrestee can rise to the level of outrageous conduct.\" ECF No. 28 at 22-23. However, the plaintiff fails to provide any facts to support the claim that emotional distress actually occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Intentional infliction of emotional distress claims require that a plaintiff provide evidence that he suffered \"severe emotional distress\" in order to be successful.\n   <em>\n    Marlin v.

Plaintiff Byndon has not even attempted to make such a factual showing in this case. Simply stating that \"initiating a false arrest and battering an arrestee can rise to the level of outrageous conduct\" is insufficient and is not supported by any facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Price v.

Therefore, Officer Pugh is immune from liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Moreover, this intentional tort claim against the City should be dismissed since the law does not allow political subdivisions to be held liable for \"intentional malfeasance\" on the part of their employees.\n   <em>\n    Poe v.

However, even if the plaintiff did argue that Officer Pugh committed a battery against plaintiff Byndon, it would fail. Although plaintiff Byndon did indeed engage in physical contact with plaintiff Byndon, the contact with plaintiff Byndon was not unlawful and there is no evidence that plaintiff Byndon was actually harmed by the contact. Further, such contact was not offensive as Officer Pugh did not use excessive force in this action. Thus, this claim must also fail. Moreover, the plaintiff has already waived\n   his claim for assault, and since battery and assault go hand in hand, the plaintiff's waiver of his assault claim supports dismissal of the battery claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Also, as mentioned under the analysis for Count II, even if the plaintiff properly alleged a claim for battery, Officer Pugh would be immune from liability due to West Virginia Code \u00a7 29-12A-5(b) of the Governmental Tort Claims and Insurance Reform Act. The plaintiff has not provided any evidence that Officer Pugh acted maliciously and there is no dispute that Officer Pugh was acting within the scope of his employment or official responsibilities at the time of the incident.
