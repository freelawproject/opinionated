(\"Morgan\"), and Ohio Corporation; and Geiger Engineers, P.C. (\"Geiger\"), a New York professional corporation (collectively, \"Defendants\"). (See ECF No. 1, Complaint (\"Compl.\").)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42-84.)

The Amended\n   Complaint alleges eight separate causes of action against the named defendants except where stated: Count I - infringement of the Retention Mechanism patent at Arthur Ashe Stadium; Count II - Infringement of the Lateral Release patent at Arthur Ashe Stadium; Count III - infringement of the Lateral Release patent at Louis Armstrong Stadium, against USTA, Hunt, Rossetti, Morgan and Geiger; Count IV - federal misappropriation of trade secrets under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201836\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , against Hardesty &amp; Hanover and Hunt; Count V - New York misappropriation of trade secrets, against Hardesty &amp; Hanover and Hunt; Count VI New York unfair competition, against Hardesty &amp; Hanover &amp; Hunt; Count VII breach of contract against Hunt for breach of the Subcontract regarding the Arizona Cardinals Stadium Retractable Roof and Count VIII breach of contract against Hardesty &amp; Hanover for breach of the confidentiality agreement for the Florida Marlins Stadium peer review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Amended Complaint pleads three additional claims for relief based on the additional facts discovered by plaintiff during discovery:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   (1) a claim for patent infringement of the Lateral Release patent at the new Louis Armstrong Stadium, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 152-169); (2) a claim for breach of the Subcontract Agreement between Hunt and Uni-Systems at Cardinals Stadium, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 205-214); and (3) a claim for breach of the Confidentiality Agreement governing Hardesty &amp; Hanover's peer review of the Marlins Ballpark retractable roof, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 215-223).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (ECF No. 151-1, Pl. Mem. Supp. Mot. to Amend Compl. at 10.) The Amended Complaint also adds three new parties: Matthew L. Rossetti Architect, P.C. (\"Matthew Rossetti P.C.\"), a New York professional corporation and an entity related to existing Defendant Rossetti, Inc., as well as Morgan Kinetic Structures, Inc. (\"Morgan Kinetic\") and Morgan Automation, Inc. (\"Morgan Automation\"), both Ohio corporations and divisions of Defendant Morgan. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 3, 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 24, 2018, the court held a pre-motion conference where the parties agreed that plaintiff's Motion to Amend the Complaint would be evaluated using the Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) standard for a motion to dismiss. On November 17, 2017, defendants opposed plaintiff's Motion to Amend and moved to dismiss the existing and proposed First Amended Complaint (\"Amended Complaint\" or \"FAC\"). Briefing on plaintiff's motion to amend and defendants' motions to dismiss was completed on January 19, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The well-pleaded factual allegations in the proposed First Amended Complaint are taken as true for purposes of deciding defendants' motions pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), and determining whether plaintiff, Uni-Systems, shall be granted leave to amend the Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roth v. Jennings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3484671\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/489/499/#p501\">\n    489 F.3d 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 501 (2d Cir. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Uni-Systems describes itself as the, \"leading designer of retractable roof systems in the United States\" and has designed and implemented retractable roof systems for major stadiums including Minute Maid Ballpark and Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas; Marlins Ballpark in Miami, Florida; Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana; Cowboys Stadium near Dallas, Texas; and University of Phoenix (Cardinals) Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. (FAC \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In connection with its retractable roof designs, Uni-Systems developed valuable intellectual property including \" U.S. Patent Nos. 6,789,360 (\"the Retention Mechanism patent\") and\n   7,594,360 (\"the Lateral Release patent\"), and trade secrets in at least nine categories that were incorporated in the Arthur Ashe and Louis Armstrong retractable roofs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 13-30.) Uni-Systems made a significant investment of money and time for the research, development and testing of systems for the retractable roofs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In January 2015, Hunt retained Uni-Systems to \"design, fabricate, and install\" the retractable roof at the Arizona Cardinals Stadium, and the Arizona Cardinals retained Uni-Systems to maintain and repair the retractable roof, once it was installed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.) For the duration of the project, Uni-Systems took careful measures to protect the confidentiality of its \"software, mechanization design principles and criteria, methods for implementing the same using engineered solutions, and other information.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 198.) Uni-Systems did this by limiting access to confidential information and requiring its customers and clients to sign confidentiality agreements that prohibited \"unauthorized access, use, and disclosure\" of the confidential information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Hunt was the general contractor on a number of projects Uni-Systems worked on as the \"sole supplier of retractable roof services,\" but after years of working together, Hunt informed Uni-Systems that it was seeking to establish a second supplier. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-34, 52-55.) In order to establish Hardesty &amp; Hanover as a viable competitor with Uni-Systems, beginning in or around 2009, Hardesty &amp; Hanover allegedly conspired with Hunt to misappropriate Uni-Systems' \"trade secret and confidential and proprietary software, mechanization design principles and criteria.\" Hardesty &amp; Hanover was retained to conduct a peer review for the Florida Marlins Ballpark roof, and to provide maintenance services for the Cardinals Retractable Roof, in order to obtain plaintiff's highly valuable trade secrets and proprietary information in violation of state and federal law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-71, 170-204.) Hardesty &amp; Hanover was inexperienced in designing retractable roofs for stadiums at the time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) Hunt and Hardesty &amp; Hanover's misappropriation also constituted breaches of their respective contracts with Uni-Systems. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 205-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In or around 2011, Uni-Systems discovered that USTA intended to construct a retractable roof for Arthur Ashe Stadium and had hired Hunt to serve as the designer-builder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 72-73.) Hunt contracted with Matthew Rossetti P.C., for the design and to serve as the official project architect for the Ashe Retractable Roof. Hunt also contracted with Morgan Kinetic to supply roof mechanization design and construction services for the Ashe Retractable Roof. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 72-75.) Morgan Kinetic was a division of Morgan Engineering, and Morgan Engineering also worked as a Hunt subcontractor, \"provid[ing] design build services to engineer and fabricate the Ashe Retractable Roof.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75.) Geiger was the mechanization engineer for Matthew Rossetti P.C., a role in which it assisted with the engineering development, prepared performance criteria for the retractable roof panels, and developed documentation, drawings, and specifications for use in the bidding process for the Ashe Retractable Roof. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76.) In 2012, USTA, Hunt, and Rossetti provided a specification for the Ashe Retractable Roof to Uni-Systems and requested an initial design proposal from competitors, including Hardesty &amp; Hanover and Uni-Systems. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79.) Uni-Systems delivered a proposed a design and a price, and defendants asked Uni-Systems to complete the design, but for a fraction of Uni-Systems' typical fee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Hunt and Hardesty &amp; Hanover misappropriated Uni-Systems trade secrets and\n   infringed Uni-Systems patents to facilitate the design and building of the Ashe Retractable Roof, which was completed in August 2016, months after Uni-Systems had first notified the defendants of its intellectual property claims. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 82-90, 125, 166.) Uni-Systems alleges, \"the Ashe Retractable Roof infringes Uni-Systems' Retention Mechanism patent and its Lateral Release patent, and each of the defendants has committed infringing acts related to the Ashe Retractable Roof.\" (ECF No. 192-1, Uni-Systems Sealed Omnibus Reply at 18\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"Omnibus Reply\") (citing FAC \u00b6\u00b6 86-90, 106-51).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In addition to the Ashe Retractable Roof, a retractable roof was built on the Louis Armstrong Stadium on the USTA campus with the participation of the named defendants except for Hardesty &amp; Hanover. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 91-97.) Plaintiff alleges that the Armstrong Retractable Roof also infringes plaintiff's Lateral Release patent and utilizes misappropriated trade secrets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 98-105, 152-69.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The mere drafting of designs for the accused retractable roofs at the Arthur Ashe and Louis Armstrong stadiums would be insufficient to sustain a claim that the Rossetti Defendants made, used or sold any patented invention.

Geiger\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Uni-Systems has alleged sufficient facts to state a claim for patent infringement against Geiger as to Counts I, II and III of the Amended Complaint. Uni-Systems alleges that Geiger, \"served as mechanization engineer consultant and structural engineer, prepared performance criteria, developed documentation,\n   drawings, and specifications, and reviewed fabrication and construction of the Ashe Retractable Roof.... [and] [was] an engineer of the Armstrong Retractable Roof.\" (Omnibus Reply at 42 (citing FAC \u00b6\u00b6 76, 95, 164).) In that role, Geiger \"reviewed and approved\" of the mechanization work for the Arthur Ashe Stadium that was conducted by Morgan, another defendant. In its role as an engineer for the Arthur Ashe Retractable Roof, Geiger allegedly \"infringed and continues to infringe\" the Retention Mechanism patent and the Lateral Release patent \"by, among other things, making and using the Ashe Retractable Roof and/or controlling or directing one or more Defendants or third parties to make or use the Ashe Retractable Roof.\" (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 123, 146, 147.) Geiger is further alleged to have engineered the Armstrong Retractable Roof that infringed the Lateral Release patent in the Armstrong Retractable Roof, even after receiving notice of its infringing characteristic. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 165-66, 168.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Geiger argues that the Amended Complaint fails to set forth any plausible claim of infringement at Arthur Ashe or Louis Armstrong Stadium and that dismissal is proper, because plaintiff's factual allegations are either naked assertions or legal conclusions and not entitled to an assumption truth.

Geiger's arguments regarding titles and labels are unavailing, when combined with plaintiff's other factual allegations regarding Geiger's actions, including Geiger's role in designing and periodically reviewing the fabrication and construction of the allegedly infringing roof mechanisms.

(FAC \u00b6\u00b6 32-71, 170-204.) These misappropriations breached Hardesty &amp; Hanover's and Hunt's respective contracts with Uni-Systems at the Arizona Cardinals and Florida Marlins stadiums. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 205-223.) \"Separate and apart from the improper acquisition of these trade secrets, Hardesty &amp; Hanover and Hunt ... improperly disclosed and used ...

These factors are also instructive in analyzing a claim under the DTSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   By alleging facts regarding factors three through six, plaintiff adequately pleads that the information misappropriated by Hardesty &amp; Hanover and Hunt at the Arizona Cardinals Stadium and Florida Marlins Stadium constituted trade secrets. Uni-Systems alleges that it owned the trade secrets and that they were made up of confidential and proprietary, \"software, mechanization design principles and criteria, and methods for implementing the same using engineered solutions, which include compilations, methods, techniques, processes, procedures, programs, and codes, and which constitute Uni-Systems' trade secret.\" (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 172, 200.) Uni-Systems alleges that the trade secrets were developed \"through great effort and expense in terms of manpower, time, and costs\" and were a \"product or service used in, or intended for use in, interstate commerce, as they are used in connection with Uni-Systems' products and services, which are offered and used across the country.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 173-74.) Further, the trade secrets provided, \"commercial and business advantage to Uni-Systems by aiding Uni-Systems in offering reliable, long-lasting, and competitively priced stadium retractable roofs,\" making them extremely valuable to Uni-Systems. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 197.) Uni-Systems alleges that the trade secrets are critical to Uni-Systems' operation, and if the trade secrets are available to others, they would enable other parties to unfairly compete with Uni-Systems and harm Uni-Systems' business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Moreover, Uni-Systems alleges that it took reasonable steps to protect the trade secret information by limiting access to the information and requiring customers and clients to sign strict confidentiality agreements that prohibited unauthorized\n   \"access, use and disclosure.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 175, 198.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Hunt and Hardesty &amp; Hanover wrongfully acquired the trade secret information acquired at the Arizona Cardinals' and Florida Marlins' stadiums and participated in unauthorized use of the trade secrets in bad faith, including using the information to bid against Uni-Systems for projects. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 22, 49, 178, 192-204.) Specifically, the defendants used Uni-System's trade secrets and infringed its patents to design other retractable roofs, including at the Arthur Ashe Stadium and Louis Armstrong Stadium. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 82, 178.) Taken together these allegations are sufficient to state a claim for misappropriation of trade secrets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Defendants Hardesty &amp; Hanover and Hunt move to dismiss plaintiff's trade secret claims on four grounds. First, defendants argue that plaintiff's alleged trade secrets are not secret because they were disclosed without sufficient protections to preserve their secrecy. (Hunt Opp'n at 12; ECF No. 204-1, Hardesty &amp; Hanover Opposition to the Motion to Amend (\"Hardesty Opp'n\") at 20-25.) Second, they argue that the alleged trade secrets are not secret because they can be derived from a review of the plans, the as-built roof, or by reverse engineering. (Hunt Opp'n at 12.) Third, they allege that trade secrets claims are not pleaded with sufficient specificity and the Amended Complaint does not plead sufficient facts for misappropriation. (Hunt Opp'n at 12; Hardesty Opp'n at 17.) Finally, they claim that the misappropriation claim is time-barred. (Hunt Opp'n at 28; Hardesty &amp; Hanover Surreply to the Motion to Amend (\"Hardesty Surreply\") at 14-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   a. Plaintiff Sufficiently Pleads Secrecy of the Alleged Trade Secrets\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Hunt argues that Uni-Systems' free disclosure of the allegedly misappropriated drawings and specifications to third parties without protection negated any secrecy. (Hunt Opp'n at 12-14.) To the extent the information was not included in the drawings and specifications, Hunt argues that Uni-Systems licensed Hunt to use the information - negating any impropriety. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Subcontract at \u00a7 35.10.) Hunt also argues that the Subcontract warranted that \"[t]itle to all parts supplied by [Uni-Systems] will transfer ownership to Hunt upon receipt of full payment by [Uni-Systems],\" which included title to \"the PC based operator interface hardware and software.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"238361\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/990/119/#p126\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing ECF No. 135-1 (Sealed) at 69, 86, 89 (Subcontract Attachment III(C)(2) at \u00a7\u00a7 V(B), VIII(A) ).) Hunt argues that this same type of information was provided to the architect of record for the Marlins Ballpark project as part of the process for acquiring a building permit and was provided to Hardesty &amp; Hanover prior to plaintiff entering a confidentiality agreement with the architect or Hardesty &amp; Hanover. (Hunt Opp'n at 11 (citing FAC \u00b6\u00b6 42, 44, 50).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Hardesty &amp; Hanover similarly argues that the Arizona Cardinals Stadium roof and software are not Uni-Systems' trade secrets, and that their claim is precluded as a matter of law due to, \"the unambiguous terms of the Subcontract under which Uni-Systems sold that roof and software to the Arizona Cardinals.\" (Hardesty Opp'n at 8-10.) Hardesty &amp; Hanover argues that because the subcontract gives the Arizona Cardinals full control of the roof and software, \"[t]hey can [and do] disclose or sell, and/or hire anyone to maintain, modify, or even just look at, the roof and software as they wish, at any time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) Further, Hunt argues that Uni-Systems gave Hardesty &amp; Hanover access to the \"trade secret\" information during Hardesty &amp; Hanover's peer review of the Marlins Retractable Roof for\n   months before executing a confidentiality agreement. (Hunt Opp'n at 21 (citing FAC \u00b6\u00b6 40-50).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Both Hardesty &amp; Hanover and Hunt ask the court to review the terms of the relevant Subcontract governing the peer review of the Arizona Cardinals stadium roof to ascertain whether plaintiff protected its trade secrets sufficiently to state a claim that the trade secrets were, in fact, secret. The court finds that it is proper to consider the Subcontract\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   as plaintiff relies on it in the Amended Complaint, which incorporates it by reference at paragraphs 206-214, and neither party objects to the authenticity of the cited portions of the Subcontract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chambers v.

(FAC \u00b6\u00b6 46-51 (alleging plaintiff's efforts to protect its trade secrets and Hardesty &amp; Hanover's attempts to evade confidentiality provisions and eventual agreement).)

Nowhere in the Amended Complaint does Uni-Systems allege that it sold its confidential information regarding the entire roof to the Arizona Cardinals or that it sold its full portfolio of trade secrets with the roof. Even if the roof and accompanying trade secrets were sold to the Arizona Cardinals, plaintiff's claims for misappropriation of trade secrets would not be dismissed.

(Hunt Opp'n At 9.) The FAC alleges that Hunt \"orchestrated\" and \"encouraged and facilitated\" the acquisition of the trade secrets without Uni-Systems consent and alleges that both Hardesty &amp; Hanover and Hunt have disclosed and used Uni-Systems trade secrets for the Arthur Ashe Stadium project and the Louis Armstrong stadium project. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 85, 177-179.)

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hunt Br. at 27-28 (citing ECF No. 135-1 at 49, Subcontract \u00a7 34.2). Hunt's reliance on \u00a7 34.2 is misplaced. The Subcontract does not mandate post-completion survival of contractual terms without explicit survival provisions, except where both parties desire to be bound or where enforcement of the provision is a necessity. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 135-1 at 45, Subcontract \u00a7 35.13 (\"35.13 Survivability: It is the intent of the parties that all such sections which expressly state or, by necessity or by the parties' intent, should be so, shall survive termination of this Subcontract.\").) Unlike other provisions intended to survive completion of the contract, (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Subcontract \u00a7 35.10), \u00a7 34.2 of the Subcontract contains no expressly stated survivability provision. By virtue of filing the Complaint and Amended Complaint without subjecting itself to the process established in \u00a7 34.2 of the Subcontract, Uni-Systems has evinced an intent not to be bound by the provision, and Hunt has made no arguments as to the necessity of the provision's survival to the execution or enforcement of the contract.

Plaintiff Sufficiently Pleads a Factual Basis for the Alleged Breach of Contract\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Hunt argues that plaintiff failed to allege a factual basis for the alleged breach of contract. Plaintiff's allegations are not, as Hunt argues, that Hunt breached the contract by revealing information regarding the Cardinals Retractable Roof to Hardesty &amp; Hanover to maintain the roof. (Hunt Opp'n at 28.) Rather, plaintiff argues Hunt breached the parties' express agreement to maintain the confidentiality of the terms of the Subcontract and the express provision of the Subcontract by revealing to or sharing the terms or conditions of the subcontract with Hardesty &amp; Hanover and/or other third parties and by revealing confidential information \"including but not limited to the confidential design parameters for the Cardinals Retractable Roof and other drawings, specifications, working papers, and documents prepared or developed by Uni-Systems in connection with the Subcontract.... for use in connection with other stadium retractable roof projects, including the Ashe Retractable Roof and the Armstrong Retractable Roof.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 207-212.)
