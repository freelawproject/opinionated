No. 88), to which Defendants have filed a Response in opposition (Doc. No. 92), and Plaintiffs have filed a Reply (Doc. No. 93-1). The Court subsequently held oral argument on Plaintiffs' motion on October 25, 2018. (Doc. No. 95.) The Court ordered supplemental briefing, and the parties have now filed their respective briefs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 96, 97.) For the reasons stated below, Plaintiffs' Motion for Attorney's Fees and Expenses will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case was brought by parents of children in White County, Tennessee, who formed a group, in part, to oppose and support certain candidates for the White County Board of Education. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 1.) Plaintiffs filed suit against the Tennessee Registry of Election Finance for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the registration and disclosure requirements for political campaign committees under Tennessee's Campaign Financial Disclosure Act were unduly burdensome and violated their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs specifically challenged the definition of \"political campaign committee\" found in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%202-10-102\">\n    Tenn.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This Court initially stayed the case on abstention grounds (Doc. No. 39), and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case for further proceedings (Doc. No. 50). Before the case was remanded, however, legislation was introduced in the Tennessee General Assembly to repeal\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%202-10-102\">\n    Tenn.

Rather than enter into an agreement to stay the case pending a vote on the proposed legislation, Plaintiffs filed a renewed Motion for Preliminary Injunction, asking the Court to enjoin Defendants from enforcing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%202-10-102\">\n    Tenn.

Defendants opposed the renewed motion and moved to stay all proceedings in light of the pending, proposed legislation. (Doc. No. 59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In an Order dated April 19, 2017, this Court granted Plaintiffs' Renewed Motion for Preliminary Injunction, enjoining Defendants from enforcing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%202-10-102\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 2-10-102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (12)(A) pending further Order of the Court. (Doc. No. 70.) The Court also granted Defendants' Motion to Stay. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court explained that it was granting the injunction based upon Defendants' representation that they did not intend to enforce the statute against Plaintiffs (Doc. No. 69 at 7) and that it was unnecessary for the Court to decide the constitutionality of the statute at issue at that time. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 9, 2017, Governor Bill Haslam signed into law legislation that amended the definition of a political campaign committee to exclude the language challenged by Plaintiffs in this case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 71-1.) Defendants renewed their Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiffs opposed that motion, and the Court dismissed the case as moot. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 80.) Once again, Plaintiffs appealed. (Doc. No. 82.) The Sixth Circuit affirmed this Court's dismissal, determining that Plaintiffs' case was moot following the repeal of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%202-10-102\">\n    Tenn.

Dismissal of the case dissolved the preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Subsequently, Plaintiffs sought attorneys' fees in the amount of $214,667.50 and expenses in the amount of $2,730.01. (Doc. No. 88.) However, at oral argument, the Court asked Plaintiffs to recalculate their fees and expenses through the date of the preliminary injunction, April 19, 2017. Upon recalculation, Plaintiffs now request attorneys' fees in the amount of $204,574.11 and expenses in the amount of $2,216.61. (Doc.

Such relief was never obtained from this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs never received any kind of substantive judgment in this case. The preliminary injunction was not based upon the merits of the case. It simply made official Defendants' agreement or promise not to enforce a statute that was currently under review by the Tennessee General Assembly. (Doc. No. 69 at 10-11.) The Court specifically stated that it was balancing the equities and not reaching the constitutional issues. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The injunction was temporary, pending amendment (or not) of the relevant legislation. It was neither lasting nor irrevocable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Moreover, because the law amending the relevant statute rendered this case moot, the Court dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction (Doc. No. 80), a\n   decision that Plaintiffs appealed, and the Sixth Circuit upheld (Doc. No. 86). Plaintiffs argued on appeal that the case was not moot and that the Court should declare the statute at issue unconstitutional and make the preliminary injunction permanent. (Doc. No. 74 at 2). But if the preliminary injunction left nothing to be decided, Plaintiffs would have had no reason to oppose the Motion to Dismiss or appeal the decision. Obviously, based on their subsequent actions, Plaintiffs did not believe that the preliminary injunction had given them all the relief they sought. If the preliminary injunction had given Plaintiffs complete relief, they would have had no need to argue to this Court or to the Sixth Circuit that a declaratory judgment and permanent injunction were necessary. Their actions demonstrate that they sought to invalidate the law as applied and to enjoin its enforcement permanently. A result never reached by this Court or the Sixth Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   For these reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiffs are not \"prevailing parties,\" such that they are entitled to attorney's fees and costs under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, Plaintiffs' Motion for Attorney's Fees and Expenses (Doc. No. 88) is denied.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Plaintiffs represented, in support of their Renewed Motion for Preliminary Injunction, that they wanted to support a particular unopposed candidate in a then-upcoming 2017 special election for House District 95. (Doc. No. 55 at 5-7.) In their Complaint, Plaintiffs sought to participate in a different election, for the White County School Board. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. No. 1.) By the time of the Renewed Motion, that election was over. The Complaint however, was not limited to one election; Plaintiffs sought to enjoin the statute forever.
