Specifically, Defendant seeks $6,844.15 in deposition costs; $870.00 in witness fees and expenses; $451.50 in costs relating to copying paper documents; and $125.00 in fees for service of a deposition subpoena.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Courts should award costs other than attorneys' fees to the prevailing party\n   in a lawsuit, unless an express provision regarding costs is made by federal statue or court rule. Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(1). Generally, courts are limited to shifting costs incurred by the prevailing party in six statutorily defined categories, which include: fees paid to the clerk of court, fees paid for necessarily obtained transcripts, fees for printing and witnesses, fees for exemplification and necessarily obtained photocopies, certain docket fees, and expenses incurred for interpretation services.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201920\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Items proposed by winning parties as costs should always be given careful scrutiny.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court must first address Plaintiff's argument that the instant motion should be denied in its entirety due to the economic disparity between the parties. If the Court finds that argument unavailing, the Court will then separately address Defendant's claimed costs related to depositions, witness fees, photocopies, and service of process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Economic Disparity Between Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the Court should exercise its discretion to deny all costs sought by Defendant. Specifically, Plaintiff argues that a sizable economic disparity exists between himself, an individual operating a one-man plumbing business in south Arkansas, and Defendant, a wholly owned subsidiary of a multinational corporation reporting a net income of $1.55 billion for fiscal year 2017. Plaintiff also states that he has incurred medical expenses totaling $64,877.43 because of the injuries that were at issue in this case, and that he paid $4,000.00 to engage an expert witness. Plaintiff states further that he has permanent damage to his left eye and, as a result, has experienced a decline in income which will likely continue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant argues in response that, although a court may consider a losing party's inability to pay costs, the losing party must provide sufficient evidence to establish that inability, which Plaintiff has not done. Defendant also argues that other courts have held that a disparity in wealth between the parties is not, by itself, a sufficient ground to deny costs. Defendant argues further the equities in this case favor assessing costs against Plaintiff because he persisted in pursuing this case despite having early notice of the deficiencies in his claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Courts may consider a losing party's limited financial resources when determining whether to assess costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cross v.

As the party asserting a general \"inequities\" objection, Plaintiff bears the burden of sufficiently demonstrating the inequities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Finan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%201805639\">\n    2008 WL 1805639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9. Although Plaintiff offers evidence of his medical bills and his expert witness fees, he does not offer evidence of his current finances to show that he is unable to pay costs. Additionally, he does not argue that he is indigent or unable to pay costs; his arguments are only that he has incurred medical bills and expenses throughout this suit and that his income has decreased. Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not sufficiently demonstrated inequities warranting outright denial of costs. The Court also finds that the economic disparity between Plaintiff and Defendant is not an independently sufficient reason to deny costs outright. The Court will, however, keep Plaintiff's economic condition in mind throughout the remainder of this Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Moreover, the Court relied on each of those deposition transcripts in granting Defendant's summary judgment motion.

Thus, the question before the Court becomes whether those depositions seemed necessary at the time they were taken. Defendant argues that they were necessary because Mindy McLelland and Shane Richards were the only witnesses at the site of the incident when Plaintiff suffered the injuries that were at issue in this case. The Court agrees and finds that Defendant reasonably believed at the time that taking the depositions of Mindy McLelland and Shane Richards was necessary to verify or controvert Plaintiff's allegations for use in a dispositive motion or at trial. Thus, the Court finds that Defendant is entitled to recover costs related to those transcripts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Ben. Programs, Inc. v.

Witness Fees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant seeks $879.00 in costs related to witness fees. Specifically, Defendant seeks $40.00 in attendance fees paid to Plaintiff's expert witness, Don Johnston, for his one-day deposition. Defendant also seeks $39.00 in mileage costs paid to Mr. Johnston pursuant to the General Services Administration's travel rate of \"$0.55 per mile.\" Defendant further seeks $800.00, which was paid to Mr. Johnston as his customary deposition fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"Fees and disbursements for ... witnesses\" are contemplated by statute as recoverable costs.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201920\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, the Court also finds that Defendant is entitled to recover mileage costs paid to Mr. Johnston. However, the Court must reduce the amount requested by Defendant. Defendant's bill of costs indicates that Mr. Johnston traveled 70 miles and requests $39.00 in mileage costs, calculated using the General Services Administration's rate of \"$0.55 per mile.\" However, as of January 1, 2018, the General Services Administration's mileage rate changed to $0.545 per mile.\n   <em>\n    See Privately Owned Vehicle (POV) Mileage Reimbursement Rates\n   </em>\n   , Gen.

However, other than stating that these photocopies were \"necessary for use in the case,\" Defendant has provided the Court with no information from which it can determine whether the photocopies were, in fact, necessarily obtained. The table provided by Defendant provides no description of the photocopy batches for which Defendant seeks costs, instead generically labeling them all as \"Doc Reproduction - Black &amp; White.\" (ECF No. 57, p. 5). Although Defendant correctly points out that photocopies need not be provided to the Court or given to opposing counsel to be considered \"necessarily obtained\" for use in a case,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11406363\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/309/494/#p498\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , the Court cannot meaningfully evaluate Defendant's request for photocopy costs without some level of detail regarding what the photocopied documents were and/or how they were used. Defendant has provided no such information and, thus, the Court cannot determine whether Defendant's 4,515 photocopied pages were necessarily obtained for use in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Finan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%201805639\">\n    2008 WL 1805639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (denying an award of \"inadequately documented\" photocopy costs).
