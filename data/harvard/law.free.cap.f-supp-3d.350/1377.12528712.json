The litigation consists of seven actions pending in two districts, as listed on Schedule A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs in potential tag-along actions in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ) and the Southern District of West Virginia (\n   <em>\n    Riling\n   </em>\n   ) support the motion, as do non-governmental agency\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Manufacturer defendants\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   oppose the motion, as do distributor defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   After considering the argument of counsel, we conclude that Section 1407 centralization of this litigation is not necessary. The actions now before us are all brought on behalf of opioid-addicted infants who have been diagnosed with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). All cases share facts concerning the allegedly improper marketing and sale of prescription opiates, as well as their allegedly improper diversion to illicit channels. There is substantial overlap between all of these cases and MDL No. 2804 -\n   <em>\n    In re: National Prescription Opiate Litigation\n   </em>\n   , which we centralized in December 2017.\n   <em>\n    In re: National Prescription Opiate Litig.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523362\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/290/1375/\">\n    290 F.Supp.3d 1375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (J.P.M.L. 2017). This is unsurprising, since many of the cases on plaintiffs' motion already are pending in that MDL, transferred without objection from plaintiffs. Factual questions of the manufacturing and distributor defendants' knowledge of and conduct regarding the alleged diversion\n   of prescription opiates, as well as the manufacturers' alleged improper marketing of such drugs, lie at the heart of each case now before us. The identity of plaintiffs and their unique damages - which plaintiffs and\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   assert include the need for a medical monitoring trust that funds prolonged, multidisciplinary care - do indeed differentiate these cases from those brought by the cities, counties and states that comprise the bulk of MDL No. 2804. But these differences among claims and requested relief, in our opinion, do not justify the creation of a new MDL.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Few efficiencies will be gained by creating a new MDL for NAS plaintiffs. Discovery regarding the marketing, manufacture, distribution and diversion of prescription opiates in plaintiffs' cases will substantially overlap with that being undertaken in MDL No. 2804. The transferee judge in a new MDL would need to coordinate on most matters pertaining to liability with the transferee court in MDL No. 2804. Significantly, the risk of inconsistent pretrial rulings would increase dramatically were we to create another MDL, as plaintiffs request, before a judge in a district outside the Northern District of Ohio (in fact, plaintiffs' requested transferee courts are both outside the Sixth Circuit). The progress of both MDLs likely would be hindered by the need for two judges to attend to overlapping discovery matters, rule on redundant motion practice and administer both MDLs separately.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   New case management protocols and counsel leadership would have to be established in the NAS MDL. The substantial duplication of activity would be costly, and it likely would slow the pace of MDL No. 2804, in which discovery and bellwether motion practice is underway. Creating a new MDL simply is at odds with Section 1407's mandate that centralization \"promote the just and efficient conduct of [the involved] actions.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201407\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Movants offer several critiques of MDL No. 2804 as a justification for a new MDL. Plaintiffs are dissatisfied that the transferee court denied their request for leave to seek to establish an NAS infant track in June 2018. Their renewed motion, filed in late-August 2018, remains under submission. In their briefs and at oral argument, the NAS plaintiffs expressed concern that the MDL No. 2804 Plaintiffs' Executive Committee\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   was not sufficiently addressing their needs in the litigation by, for instance, keeping counsel for the NAS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   plaintiffs sufficiently apprised of upcoming depositions. NAS plaintiffs argue that these issues rise to the level of a deprivation of due process, citing the Supreme Court class settlement cases\n   <em>\n    Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/\">\n    521 U.S. 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/\">\n    117 S.Ct. 2231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/\">\n    138 L.Ed.2d 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997), and\n   <em>\n    Ortiz v.

The NAS plaintiffs now before us are represented by their own counsel, and no other counsel is purporting to settle the NAS plaintiffs' interests on their behalf while also representing another class with conflicting interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Historically, we have declined to entangle ourselves in case management disputes such as this.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, we dedicate their resolution to the discretion of the transferee judge. In 2013, for example, we were asked to carve out claims from the existing Deepwater Horizon MDL to create a new MDL. We rejected that request:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   No doubt, this is an extremely large and highly complex MDL. However, in our considered opinion, creation of another Deepwater Horizon MDL is not a solution to whatever challenges the current litigation may present. The Panel does not aspire to the role of an appellate court for disaffected MDL litigants. We are neither authorized by statute nor inclined to act in such a role. Moreover, the difficult issues of managing this complex litigation are best determined after a full airing before the transferee judge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    In re: Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico, on Apr. 20, 2010 (No. II)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3874593\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/961/1355/#p1357\">\n    961 F.Supp.2d 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1357 (J.P.M.L. 2013) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3874593\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/961/1355/#p1357\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3874593\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/961/1355/#p1357\">\n    at 1356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Given this extensive overlap, we find it quite impossible to see how a new Deepwater Horizon MDL would not result in duplicative discovery and pretrial motion practice, as well as other redundant pretrial proceedings.\").
