The primary issues are: (i) whether the Defendant Nicholas Baca \"recklessly endanger[ed] the safety of the aircraft,\" warranting a base offense level of 18 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A5.2(a)(2),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Presentence Investigation Report \u00b6 8, at 4, filed July 26, 2018 (Doc. 28)(\"PSR\"), when Baca intentionally pointed a laser pointer at a police helicopter, temporarily blinding the pilot, but there is no evidence that Baca was aware of the risks of his conduct; and (ii) whether the Court should apply a 6-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A5.2(b)(1)(B)(ii) for use of a dangerous weapon,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 14, at 4, when Baca used a laser pointer in the commission of the underlying offense, but there is no evidence that Baca used the laser pointer in any way not contemplated by the underlying offense. The Court concludes that: (i) the PSR's base-offense-level calculation is inaccurate, because there is no evidence on the record that Baca was aware of the risks of his conduct, as is required for a finding of recklessness, and, thus, the Court sustains Baca's Objection to that calculation and concludes that the appropriate base offense level is 9, pursuant to \u00a7 2A5.2(a)(4) ; and (ii) the 6-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A5.2(b)(1)(B)(ii) does not apply, because \u00a7 2A5.2(b)(1) only\n   applies if \"(A) subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) applies; and ... (ii) a dangerous weapon was otherwise used.\" Because the Court determines that Baca's base offense level, pursuant to \u00a7 2A5.2(a)(4), is 9, \u00a7 2A5.2(b)(1) does not apply, and there should be no increase for a dangerous weapon. Accordingly, the Court sustains both of Baca's Objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the Plea Hearing, held before the Honorable Steven C. Yarbrough, United States Magistrate Judge for the District of New Mexico, Baca pled guilty to the Indictment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Clerk's Minutes at 1, filed May 8, 2018 (Doc. 26)(\"Plea Hearing Minutes\"). The Indictment charges that Baca \"knowingly aimed the beam of a laser pointer at an aircraft in the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States and at the flight path of such an aircraft\" in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 39A(a). Indictment, filed September 6, 2017 (Doc. 1). There is a plea agreement in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plea Agreement, filed October 12, 2018 (Doc. 42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court takes the facts from the PSR. No one has objected to the PSR's recitation of the facts, so unless someone objects or wants an evidentiary hearing to present more facts, they will serve as the Court's findings of fact for purposes of this sentencing. The PSR describes the offense conduct as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   6. On July 29, 2017, the defendant pointed a handheld laser at [Bernalillo County Sheriff's Office (\"BCSO\") ]'s helicopter in flight. The laser hit the pilot's eyes, temporarily blinding the pilot. The pilot was able to regain focus. The helicopter was hit again with the laser. The defendant fled the area in his vehicle and was followed by the helicopter. Another officer located the defendant and attempted a traffic stop of the defendant, but he failed to stop. The defendant increased his speed and turned his headlights off. He failed to yield at two stop signs. The officer lost sight of the defendant, but the helicopter continued to follow him. The defendant drove through a residential neighborhood in circles. He stopped at a drainage ditch and walked north.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   7. The defendant then jumped over a wall and stayed in a yard for a short period. He attempted to go to the front of the residence, but an officer arrived to the location and arrested him. The laser was located in the defendant's vehicle. Next to the laser was a small piece of plastic containing heroin (less than one gram).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   PSR \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 6, 2017, a federal grand jury charged Baca with one count of aiming a laser pointer at an aircraft, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2039\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 1. On May 8, 2018, Baca pled guilty to the Indictment that he knowingly aimed the beam of a laser pointer at an aircraft.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plea Hearing Minutes at 1; Indictment at 1. In the Indictment, he specifically pled to the following facts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   On or about July 29, 2017, in Bernalillo County, in the District of New Mexico, the defendant, NICHOLAS BACA, knowingly aimed the beam of a laser pointer at an aircraft in the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States and at the flight path of such aircraft. In violation [of] 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 39A(a).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Indictment at 1. In the Plea Agreement he specifically admitted the following facts under penalty of perjury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   a. On or about July 29, 2017, in Bernalillo County, in the District of New Mexico, I knowingly aimed the beam of a laser pointer at an aircraft in the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States and at the flight path of such aircraft. Specifically, I pointed a laser pointer at a helicopter which I later\n   learned was operated by the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Department.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   b. It was not my intent in aiming the laser pointer at the helicopter to cause harm. I was under the influence of narcotics at the time and was bored, and, while I was aware of what I was doing, I did not know that I could hurt anyone by pointing the laser pointer at the helicopter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plea Agreement \u00b6 8, at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In the PSR, the United States Probation Office (\"USPO\") calculated Baca's base offense level at 18, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A5.2(a)(2) and applied a 6-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A5.2(b)(1)(B)(ii) for use of a dangerous weapon. Baca objects to the PSR's finding that he recklessly endangered the aircraft and contends that the applicable base level offense is 9 and not 18.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objections at 4. Baca also objects to paragraph 14 of the PSR and the application of a 6-level enhancement for the use of a dangerous weapon, contending that applying the enhancement would constitute impermissible double counting, because Baca's use of the laser pointer is already factored into the base offense level calculation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objections at 4-5. Baca further contends that, because the appropriate base offense level is 9, subsection (b) of \u00a7 2A5.2 does not apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objections at 5. Assistant United States Attorney George Kraehe concurs in Baca's objections.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objections at 5. The Court will further describe these Objections, with USPO's response, in its analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     RELEVANT LAW REGARDING THE GUIDELINES\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

According to one of the lead investigators in this case, an officer pilot, the beam of a laser pointer that is \"only the size of a pencil on the ground\" can intensify to \"12 inches in diameter depending on the distance.\" In other words, \"the farther it gets away from the point of origin, the beam spreads out,\" thus increasing its hazardousness, a notion that is counterintuitive, especially when one considers that an ordinary light beam would grow fainter. Additionally, the laser pointer is particularly hazardous to an aircraft when the beam is refracted off the cockpit glass, which intensifies the light even more, resulting in a \"bright, dazzling beam\" that lights up the entire cockpit. That one knows that the laser is dangerous when pointed directly in a person's eyes does not mean that one knows about the beam's ability to expand and refract, rendering it particularly hazardous for pilots in an aircraft miles away, or that the danger is heightened at nighttime because the pilot's eyes have adjusted to the dark.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180568\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/1277/#p1280\">\n    784 F.3d at 1281-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nothing on the record demonstrates that Baca was aware of the dangers or consequences of aiming the laser pointer at the aircraft. The PSR makes much of the fact that Baca fled, but it must also be noted that, when Baca was apprehended, heroin was also recovered from his vehicle, suggesting another possible motive for fleeing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 7, at 3. There is no factual finding to support that Baca fled because he was aware of the risks of his laser-pointing and that inference may not soundly be made. The USPO's response to Baca's Objection regarding his base offense level demonstrates only that he intentionally hit the helicopter -- conduct to which he pled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Addendum at 1. The record is devoid of evidence that Baca, or even an average person, would know that, by pointing a laser at an aircraft, the pilot could be blinded or distracted, or that the safety of the aircraft could be endangered. Absent that evidence, the base offense level of 18 may not be applied. The PSR, accordingly, miscalculates Baca's base offense level at 18 pursuant to \u00a7 2A5.2(a)(2). The Court thus concludes that, pursuant to \u00a7 2A5.2(a)(4), the appropriate base level is 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     THE COURT SUSTAINS BACA'S OBJECTION TO A 6-LEVEL ENHANCEMENT UNDER U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A5.2(b)(1)\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Section 2A5.2(b)(1) provides for a 4-level enhancement if \"(A) subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) applies; and ...

Applying \u00a7 2A5.2(a)(4), the USPO first concludes that a laser pointer meets the definition of\n   a dangerous weapon and, therefore, that a 4-level increase is applicable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 14, at 4.

Baca objects to the 6-level enhancement, arguing that there is no evidence that he \"otherwise used\" the laser pointer in any way not already factored into the base offense level and so applying the enhancement would constitute impermissible double-counting.

The specific offense characteristic states to apply an enhancement if a dangerous weapon was otherwise used. The laser meets the definition of a dangerous weapon.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   There is nothing in the application notes precluding the enhancement based on a specific conviction. The base offense level takes into account the recklessness endangerment and the specific offense characteristic takes into account whether a dangerous weapon was used. Therefore, the enhancement was applied pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2A5.2(b)(1)(B)(ii).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   It is noted that the USA PATRIOT Act led to the addition of subsection \u00a7 2A5.2(b) relating to the use of dangerous weapons. According to the United States Sentencing Commission, the amendment to 2A5.2(b) was added to \"address concerns that the current base offense level of 18 (in 2A5.2(a)(2) ) for reckless endangerment may be inadequate in situations involving a dangerous weapon and reckless disregard for the safety of human life.\" U.S.S.G.

According to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 comment note 1(I), \"otherwise used\" with reference to a dangerous weapon \"means that the conduct did not amount to the discharge of a firearm but was more than brandishing, displaying, or possessing a firearm or other dangerous weapon.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. n.1(I). The commentary to \u00a7 2A5.2 notes that, for the term \"otherwise used,\" the meaning is the same as that given in Application Note 1 of the Commentary to \u00a7 1B1.1. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A5.2 n.1. Application Note 1 of the Commentary to \u00a7 1B1.1 notes that multiple adjustments may be applied cumulatively even if both triggered by the same action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. n.4(B). Therefore, applying the enhancement for \"otherwise using\" the laser pointer by pointing it would not be double counting, although the application of the base offense level is also based on the same conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Because the Court has determined that Baca's base offense level is that in \u00a7 2A5.2(a)(4), section \u00a7 2A5.2(b)(1) does not apply, and there should be no enhancement for a dangerous weapon. The Court sustains Baca's objection to the enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A5.2(b)(1)(B)(ii) for use of a dangerous weapon, applied in paragraph 14 of the PSR, concluding that it does not apply because the correct base offense level is that under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A5.2(a)(4), and the enhancement in \u00a7 2A5.2(b)(1)(B)(ii) does not apply to offenses charged at that base offense level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the Defendant's Objections to the Presentence Report, filed August 6, 2018 (Doc. 30), are sustained.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Attorneys and courts often say that the \"Guidelines\" are advisory, but it appears more appropriate to say that the resulting Guidelines ranges are advisory.\n    <em>\n     Gall v.
