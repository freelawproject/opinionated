He claims ineffective assistance of counsel. Finding no basis for granting the extraordinary relief, the Court DENIES his Motion to Vacate. ECF No. 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. RELEVANT FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Adam Cobb is a former professor at the Naval War College. He was 47 years old at all relevant times. He plead guilty to having been involved in sending, receiving and producing lascivious photographs of naked minor children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Cobb agreed to the truth of these facts at his change of plea:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   In January of 2015 ... the Rhode Island Internet Crimes Against Children [ICAC] Task Force received a referral from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children that a person using the website \"tumbler.com\" with an account name of \"ddlg-obey-daddy,\" uploaded\n   four image files containing suspected pornography.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   This information ... led to a Rhode Island State Police investigation along with Homeland Security agents and other local law enforcement officers that belong to the ICAC, and they applied for and obtained a search warrant for the Defendant's house. That search warrant was executed ... and agents seized various computers and cellphones belonging to the Defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   ... during that search, a hard drive was seized, among other things, pursuant to the warrant and was examined by a Rhode Island State Police forensic analyst who discovered photographs and video footage of a 17-year-old minor who it turned out was a citizen of the United Kingdom....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   In the fall of 2014, the Defendant had this minor travel to the United States unbeknownst to her parents to stay with him at his Tampa residence. There the Defendant made multiple videos depicting himself and the U.K. minor engaged in various sexual acts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   On that same computer, the forensic analyst also found nude still images of this minor which involved a lascivious exhibition of the genitals. Many of these images had been sent going back as far as August 2013 ... They had been sent by the U.K. victim from England to the Defendant via the internet.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   ... [T]he day after the execution of the state search warrant, agents had encountered the Defendant while he was coming back from international travel and seized an iPhone 6 from him at a border search on that date.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [A]gents [thereafter] obtained a search warrant from this Court for that iPhone 6. Forensic analysis of that phone ... revealed that during the same timeframe that the Defendant was having the U.K. victim come to Florida, the Defendant was in communication with another minor, this time a 16-year-old who lived outside of Rhode Island in the eastern part of the United States. Forensic evidence from that iPhone revealed that the Defendant was engaged in online Skype text chats and live camera feeds with this victim. The Defendant identified himself as \"Daddy Mike 69.\" The Defendant engaged in explicit sexual text messaging with this victim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   For example, ... the Defendant told the victim that he wanted to engage in anal intercourse with her, forcing himself into her even if it hurt her because, \"daddy wants to see your teen tears.\" The analyst also found that the Defendant had engaged in screen captures by obtaining still images of these live video exchanges that were taking place on Skype.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   He engaged in screen captures of images from that live feed of the victim. The Defendant had saved these images onto his phone. These images depicted the United States victim ... engaged in sexually explicit conduct, including the lascivious exhibition of her genitals and acts of self-penetration of her genitals with a hairbrush as well as bobby pins being placed on her vaginal area. This victim was later interviewed ... and indicated that she posed and did these acts ... at the request of the Defendant. During these communications, the Defendant wanted to meet with her, but the victim cut off the relationship before that happened.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Finally ... the forensic analysis of the Defendant's phone indicated that ... the Defendant sent by text message four sexually explicit images of the United States victim ... to an unknown recipient.... [T]he next day or later the same day ... he sent two more such images to that same recipient. Again, that recipient\n   is unknown; but the sexually explicit images ... were accompanied by texts from the Defendant which said things like \"this little bitch is sky long with me right now,\" \"I did bobby pins on clit and nips,\" and \"hairbrush action.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ECF No. 60 at 13-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. TRAVEL OF THE CASE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Mr. Cobb was arrested and charged by complaint with Distribution and Receipt of child pornography, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). ECF No. 3. On that same day, two experienced criminal defense attorneys entered their appearances for Mr. Cobb. ECF Nos. 5 and 6. The Court at first detained Mr. Cobb but the Magistrate Judge later released him on $1,000,000 full surety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Government filed a series of motions to extend the 30-day time to indict under the Speedy Trial Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203161\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), under the tolling provisions in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203161\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h). The parties stated they needed time to engage in plea negotiations, as well as to view and digest the complex evidence accumulated against Mr. Cobb during the investigation. Mr. Cobb's attorneys met with the prosecutor to review evidence and discuss the case. After seeing the evidence amassed against Mr. Cobb, those attorneys proposed a guilty plea by Mr. Cobb.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Mr. Cobb then fired these attorneys and retained new counsel. Much of the pretrial work therefore began anew. ECF Nos. 25 and 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Mr. Cobb's new attorney met with the Government who again reviewed the evidence against Mr. Cobb, including the digital evidence and the images seized from Mr. Cobb's electronic devices. As with Mr. Cobb's first attorneys, his new attorney reasonably pursued a strategy of trying to minimize his ultimate sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Meanwhile, Mr. Cobb had collected several unauthorized electronic devices while on pretrial release without Probation's approval. He also had renewed contact with the victim and admitted he had violated his bail conditions. The Magistrate Judge ordered him detained. ECF No. 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After further extensive negotiations between the parties, the Government then filed an agreed-to one-count Information and plea agreement. ECF Nos. 37 and 38. Mr. Cobb appeared before the Magistrate Judge, who questioned him thoroughly before accepting his waiver of indictment. ECF Nos. 39 and 62. Mr. Cobb then pleaded guilty to the Information before this District Judge. ECF No. 60. During the change-of-plea hearing, Mr. Cobb told this Court that he understood the rights he was waiving by pleading guilty, and that he was fully satisfied with the advice his attorneys had given him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203161\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203161\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"THE COURT: Are you fully satisfied with the representation that you've received from your counsel in this case, Mr. Cobb?

In sentencing Mr. Cobb, the Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   I'm going to accept the joint recommendation of the parties. I must say I do it reluctantly and I do it without a great deal of confidence in its correctness. I think it's too short. I think for the actions of the person that stands before me, looking at all the 3553 factors, Dr. Cobb, that you deserve a longer time of incarceration. * * * [M]y analysis, Dr. Cobb, of the situation is that you used your tremendous talents and abilities and intellect and position in life to manipulate\n   young people. I believe that of your fiancee, I believe that of the 16 year old in Florida, and that's disturbing. It's disturbing because I think these people were vulnerable and I think they were weak to your talented manipulation, and I think that's what has taken place here. But you'll have to live with that and will have to proceed accordingly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   ECF No. 63 at 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A year later, Mr. Cobb filed this Motion to Vacate\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

ANALYSIS OF FACTS AND LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Mr. Cobb in large measure asserts that his attorneys were ineffective for several reasons, including failing to object to delays pre-indictment, failing to challenge the constitutionality of various searches, and misadvising him to waive his right to a grand jury indictment and to plead guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court first determines if Mr. Cobb's attorneys' performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and if so, whether the outcome would have been different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Delay Pre-Indictment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Mr. Cobb's primary claim is that his guilty plea was rendered defective through the alleged failure of his counsel to investigate the reasons for the 10-month period from his arrest until he pleaded to the Information. Mr. Cobb argues that the prosecution's \"failure\" to secure an indictment during this time shows that the Government had a weak case, and indeed could not generate sufficient evidence to obtain an Indictment. ECF No. 70 at 44-47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Mr. Cobb's analysis and conclusions are flawed. It contains unsupported innuendoes, conspiracy theories, and speculation about the reasons for the delay in presenting this case to the grand jury. As set forth in the facts to which Mr. Cobb voluntarily admitted at his change of plea, the Government possessed overwhelming evidence of Mr. Cobb's guilt, which, if presented to a grand jury, would have likely resulted in an indictment for various offenses. The Government's evidence included various sexually explicit images-some which show Mr. Cobb producing those images-of two separate minors. ECF No. 60 at 14-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Thus, Mr. Cobb's attorney's \"failure to investigate\" this delay, was not a failure at all, but the result of an apparent strategy to deal with the overpowering evidence before him to minimize his client's ultimate sentence by negotiating with the Government and counseling his client to accept responsibility. Counsels' pre-indictment work to minimize Mr. Cobb's sentence was a strategy ultimately successful. Instead of quickly getting an easily-obtained indictment,\n   the Government, at the request of both of Mr. Cobb's attorneys, delayed going to the grand jury to give his attorneys the time they needed to investigate various aspects of the case, and to seek to compile information to mitigate any future sentence after a guilty plea.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 84-1. Mr. Cobb's attorneys spent time obtaining a psychological examination of Mr. Cobb and obtaining character references for him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 48, 50, 51, and 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Most important, the delay allowed his attorneys to negotiate with the prosecution to forego charging him with manufacturing child pornography-a charge that would have imposed a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence. There was sufficient evidence to have supported a manufacturing charge. Moreover, even without the mandatory minimum for manufacturing, Mr. Cobb was facing a Sentencing Guidelines range of 121-151 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Mr. Cobb's attorneys' strategy was reasonable, as evidenced when he obtained the lowest possible sentence under law, despite a Guideline range twice as high as the sentence he obtained, and even though the Court said it concluded the jail sentence negotiated between the parties would have been longer but for their negotiated agreement. ECF No. 63 at 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Thus, Mr. Cobb's attorneys' performance exceeded the standards under\n   <em>\n    Strickland'\n   </em>\n   s first prong. The agreed-to delay in presenting this case to the grand jury was a smart, appropriate, and effective means to minimize Mr. Cobb's prison exposure. Because Mr. Cobb's attorneys negotiated a significantly reduced sentence in the face of overwhelming culpable evidence, potentially triple mandatory minimum, and higher Guideline range, there certainly was no prejudice to him by the delay in indicting him, or the waiver of his right to indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Adam Cobb has failed to show any reason this Court should disregard his plea of guilty. He claims ineffective assistance of counsel as a basis, but a review of the facts establishes that just the opposite is true. Mr. Cobb faced a mandatory minimum of 15 years of imprisonment, a Sentencing Guideline range of over ten years, and a sentencing judge that felt that the negotiated jail time was insufficient. Both sets of attorneys represented Mr. Cobb well by expertly negotiating a shorter time in prison in the face of overwhelming evidence of\n   guilty.
