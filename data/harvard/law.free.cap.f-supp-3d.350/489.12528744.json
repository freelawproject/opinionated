Jones, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The plaintiff in this action, Christopher Earl Snipes, asserts claims against defendant The Southwest Virginia Regional Jail Authority (\"Jail Authority\"), his former employer, alleging that the Jail Authority violated the Family Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\") by interfering with his FMLA rights and retaliating against him for exercising these rights. The Jail Authority has moved to dismiss Snipes' Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. For the reasons that follow, I will grant the motion in part and deny it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Complaint alleges the following facts, which I must accept as true for the purpose of deciding the Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Snipes began working for the Jail Authority in 2005. Snipes supervised several other employees, received employee evaluations demonstrating that he was a commendable employee, and exceeded job performance criteria. Snipes was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant because he performed his duties skillfully and with distinction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2015, Snipes' wife developed a medical condition that was ultimately diagnosed as Cacchi-Ricci disease. As a result, she underwent inpatient care and periods of continuous treatment by a healthcare provider, and she experienced periods of incapacity. In October 2015, she underwent a medical procedure, and Snipes took intermittent leave under the FMLA so he could assist her with daily activities. On March 14, 2016, Snipes' wife underwent another medical procedure, and her physician completed a Certification of Healthcare Provider for Family Member's Serious Health Condition regarding this procedure. The certification stated that Snipes' wife would be incapacitated from March 14, 2016, to April 13, 2016, and during this time, she would be unable to rise from a seated position without assistance, to lift heavy weights, to care for her children, to operate a motor vehicle, or to perform household duties. The certification was provided to the Jail Authority on April 5, 2016. Snipes alleges that his supervisors \"questioned his use of leave and exhibited hostility towards him which included but was not limited to statements that he needed to return to work.\" Compl. \u00b6 28, ECF No. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 26, 2016, Snipes received an Employee Performance Appraisal, which found that he \"Meets Standards.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18. The performance appraisal also rated his ability to interact with others and maintain a productive relationship as \"distinguished,\" which is the highest rating that can be given.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19. Further, the appraisal rated his leadership and staff relations as \"commendable,\" the second highest rating that can be given.\n   <em>\n    Id. at\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 31, 2016, the Jail Authority terminated Snipes' employment. As grounds for his termination, the Jail Authority\n   alleged that his \"[l]eadership and support for staff is not acceptable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23. In particular, the Jail Authority alleged that on May 27, 2016, Snipes had acted inappropriately when he became upset with and belittled a subordinate. Snipes denies these allegations. Snipes had not been advised of any deficiencies in his leadership or support before his termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Snipes' Complaint alleges that the Jail Authority violated the FMLA when it terminated Snipes' employment. In particular, the Complaint alleges that the Jail Authority violated the FMLA by interfering with Snipes' use of FMLA-protected leave and by retaliating against Snipes for using FMLA-protected leave. The Jail Authority moved to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The Motion to Dismiss has been fully briefed and is now ripe for decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Federal pleading standards require that a complaint contain a \"short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed.

In order to survive a motion to dismiss, the complaint must \"state[ ] a plausible claim for relief\" that \"permit[s] the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct\" based upon its \"judicial experience and common sense.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Snipes counters that the Jail Authority interfered with his FMLA rights because its hostile comments had a chilling effect and would discourage employees from requesting FMLA leave. Snipes also alleges that the Jail Authority interfered with his FMLA rights when it terminated him, because he would plausibly have required additional FMLA leave in the future, but the termination prevented him from exercising this right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The FMLA makes it unlawful for any employer to \"interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise, any right provided under [the FMLA].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).

The court found that this conduct provided sufficient facts to plausibly infer that the employer interfered with the plaintiff's FMLA rights by discouraging employees from exercising their rights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   There are key distinctions between the case at issue and both\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez.\n   </em>\n   In each of these cases, the plaintiffs alleged facts showing a change in their working conditions after they exercised their FMLA rights - Gordon had to take a \"fitness for duty\" examination that could have found her unfit for duty, and Rodriguez had to complete an atypical \"return to work\" plan. The employer conduct in both cases - making new demands of employees after they requested or took FMLA leave - makes it plausible that employees would be discouraged from taking FMLA leave. Here, however, Snipes has not alleged any changes in his working conditions after he returned from his FMLA leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In addition, Snipes has not alleged facts making it plausible that the Jail Authority's hostile comments alone discouraged him or other employees from exercising their FMLA rights, nor has he alleged facts regarding his reaction to the Jail Authority's alleged hostility or facts suggesting that other employees heard or\n   knew of the hostility. Thus, Snipes has not submitted facts sufficient for the court to infer that the Jail Authority's conduct interfered with his FMLA rights by discouraging him or other employees from exercising their rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Snipes' argument that the Jail Authority interfered with his FMLA rights when it terminated him also fails to allege facts sufficient to state a claim for relief. Employees who are terminated after taking FMLA leave and being reinstated to the same position from which they left do not satisfy the fifth element of a claim for interference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Capps v.

Snipes did not allege any facts about his wife's prognosis or condition at the time he was terminated. Thus, Snipes has not alleged facts sufficient for the court to infer that the Jail Authority interfered with his FMLA rights. Accordingly, I will grant the Motion to Dismiss as to Snipes' interference claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Jail Authority also moves to dismiss Snipes' retaliation claim, arguing that the claim is not plausible because he has not alleged facts showing a causal connection between his termination and his use of FMLA leave. The Jail Authority asserts that instead, the facts in the Complaint show that Snipes was terminated for misconduct and a failure of leadership. The Jail Authority argues that Snipes' denial of this misconduct is a bare assertion, and thus the court need not accept it as true. In contrast, Snipes argues that his denial is a factual statement that the court must accept as true, and this fact supports a causal connection between his termination and his use of FMLA leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The FMLA makes it unlawful for any employer to \"discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any individual for opposing any practice made unlawful by [the FMLA].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).

His denial of the Jail Authority's factual assertion remains a factual assertion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Taking this denial and the remaining facts in the Complaint as true, Snipes' allegations permit the court to plausibly infer that the Jail Authority terminated him because of his FMLA leave. As alleged in the Complaint, Snipes was a distinguished employee who had not been advised of any deficiencies in his performance. Snipes took a month of FMLA leave, and the Jail Authority questioned his use of leave, was hostile towards him, and stated that he needed to return to work. The month after Snipes returned from FMLA leave, the Jail Authority alleged that he belittled a subordinate, which Snipes denies, and it terminated him. Snipes had received a positive performance evaluation the month before he was terminated, and he had not been given any other feedback regarding his interactions with subordinates before his termination. Moreover, the temporal relationship between these events is sufficient to plausibly infer causality at the motion to dismiss stage. Accordingly, I will deny the Motion to Dismiss as to Snipes' retaliation claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 7, is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   It is so\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    I will dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not significantly aid the decisional process.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Of course, I hold only that Snipes' retaliation claim alleges facts sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. I make no prediction that it would survive a motion for summary judgment or that Snipes would prevail at trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
