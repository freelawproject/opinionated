Jimerson's motion to cite additional authority [Doc. No. 68] is granted, and her motion to expand the record [Doc. No. 69] is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The factual findings, summary of the evidence, and summary of the procedural history detailed by Magistrate Judge Jerome Kearney are adopted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Proposed Findings and Recommendations, Doc. No. 61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Myrtle Holmes was raped and murdered at her home in Fordyce, Arkansas, on September 22, 1988.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record on Appeal, Resp.'s Ex. 11 (\"R.\") at 669-73. On March 16, 1991, Charlie Vaughn, John Brown, Jr., and Reginald Early were charged with her murder.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. A week later, Vaughn pleaded guilty to first degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 1051. Vaughn's testimony at his plea hearing implicated Brown, Early, and Jimerson. Vaughn testified that Jimerson drove the men to Holmes's residence and stayed in the car while the men carried out the crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 1043, 1049.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Jimerson was charged as an accomplice and, over her objection, was jointly tried with Brown and Early for capital murder. DNA evidence connecting Early to Holmes's rape was presented, and the prosecution argued that Brown and Early committed the assault, rape, and murder, while Jimerson drove them and Vaughn to Holmes's residence. A mistrial was declared.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Brown, Early, and Jimerson were subsequently charged with first degree murder and aggravated robbery. R. 404, 510. The DNA evidence linking Early to the crime was not presented at the second trial, and Vaughn-whose testimony first implicated Jimerson-recanted his testimony, stating that he was told what to say and that he was afraid of being sentenced to death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 1059-61, 1069. Nevertheless, his earlier testimony implicating Jimerson was read into evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 1035-1055. Based on witness testimony, Brown, Early, and Jimerson were convicted by a jury and sentenced to life in prison on August 19, 1992.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 1263-64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Jimerson timely appealed to the Arkansas Supreme Court, which affirmed her conviction in January 1994.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Her habeas petition, under 28 U.S.C. section 2254, was filed on June 30, 2015, and is based on new material evidence that was not available at the time of her direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 1. On January 26, 2016, she amended her petition to include a freestanding claim of actual innocence based on an affidavit executed by co-defendant Early on December 21, 2015. In that affidavit, Early states that he raped and murdered Holmes by himself. Doc. No.15-1 at 100-06.

In\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that withholding evidence favorable to the defendant, where that evidence is material to the defendant's guilt or punishment, violates due process. In\n   <em>\n    Youngblood\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that failing to preserve potentially useful evidence, when done in bad faith, denies the defendant due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The proposed findings and recommendations submitted by Judge Kearney recommend denying relief for all claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Proposed Findings and Recommendations, Doc.

MOTIONS TO EXPAND RECORD AND TO CITE ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   John Brown's habeas petition was granted on August 21, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Ark. Aug. 21, 2018). The order in that case found that \"the only direct evidence against ... Brown,\" was \"Vaughn's confession, the use of which in ... Brown's trial was the result of a glaring\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. On August 30, 2018, Jimerson moved for permission to cite the order granting Brown's petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 68, 76. That motion is granted.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Connor v. Credit Prot.

Jimerson had an opportunity to object to the magistrate judge's findings, including why the record was inadequate and why evidence she wished to include was not offered at the evidentiary hearing. She also received a two-month extension to file her objections.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 61, 63; Local Rule 72.1(VIII)(C-D) (providing fourteen days to file objections and submit additional evidence);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Rules Governing Sec. 2254 Cases Rule 7 (explaining how the record may be expanded) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Jimerson timely filed her objections to the magistrate judge's findings and recommendations, which was more than one month after Brown's evidentiary hearing and three weeks after the transcript of the hearing became available.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 64. Her objections, however, failed to request that evidence from Brown's hearing be included in the record. She is not excused from her lack of diligence in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   III.

Early maintained his innocence until he confessed to his lawyer in November 2015, that he committed the crime by himself. Evid. Hr'g Tr. (\"Tr.\"), Doc. No. 51, at 57, 65-68, 79. Jimerson could not have known of Early's confession until she became aware of his December 21, 2015, affidavit in which he swore out his confession.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Early Aff., Doc. No. 51, Pet. Ex. 1. Therefore, Jimerson timely discovered and pursued her actual innocence claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    2.

No. 59 at 28. For Jimerson's\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim, she must show that, in the year preceding the filing of her petition, she discovered through the exercise of diligence, evidence that (1) the prosecution suppressed evidence (2) that was favorable to her in that it is exculpatory or impeaching and (3) was material to her guilt or punishment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The magistrate judge found that she did not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Proposed Findings and Recommendations, Doc. No. 61 at 39-40. Jimerson testified that since the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed her conviction, she filed an application and an update with the Innocence Project; she paid a lawyer to file a habeas petition, but the lawyer did nothing and was later disbarred; she filed clemency petitions; and her brother wrote organizations on her behalf.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr., Doc.

Given the prosecution's success in concealing and destroying useful evidence as described below, Jimerson's efforts as an incarcerated and indigent person were diligent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Once the legal clinic accepted Jimerson's case, it retained a private investigator named Greg Stimis, who spoke to Dallas County Sheriff Donny Ford in January 2014, and discovered\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   evidence. The newly discovered information included that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 the investigators in the Holmes case used a jailhouse informant,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 the informant was being transported to the Dallas County Jail on another charge and was told, when he inquired, that he could improve his situation by obtaining information from Vaughn, Early, or Brown in the Dallas County Jail,\n   \u2022 the informant had conversations with Vaughn-Jimerson's co-defendant who first implicated her with his plea hearing testimony-that he recorded at Ford's request,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 the informant discussed the death penalty and other potential punishments with Vaughn,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 Vaughn confessed to killing Holmes and provided details about the crime,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 Ford believed the recording could not be used at trial, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 the recording was lost or destroyed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr., Doc.

In response, Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Robin F. Wynne represented that the State had \"no knowledge of any informant who led to or assisted in making the arrest in this matter,\" except for someone identified as \"Sam,\" who was actually trial witness Taura Bryant. R. 156. Wynne also responded that the only cassette tapes the State possessed were of conversations with trial witnesses, brothers Kenny and Lee Parsons, and that the State \"has made no offers of immunity, leniency, sentence or charge concessions, or other inducements that have been made to any Co-Defendant, potential witness or informant other than the offer made to Co-Defendant Charlie Vaughn,\" that is, his plea agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 157-58.

Jimerson knew when Stimis spoke with Ford that evidence was suppressed because the trial record-which showed that the State denied the use of an informant-was available to her and her counsel when Stimis spoke with Ford. Although her trial counsel's affidavit is supportive of her\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim, it was not a missing element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Jimerson also knew when Stimis spoke with Ford that the evidence suppressed was favorable to her. Ford told Stimis that the informant discussed the death penalty and other penalties with Vaughn and that Ford told the informant that he could better his situation by obtaining information about the murder. Jimerson thus knew that there was an informant who may have coerced the key\n   witness against her into confessing by discussing penalties with him and that the State offered him an inducement in exchange for his work as an informant.

The State argues Jimerson possessed the materiality element of her\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim when Stimis spoke with Ford. The problem with this argument is that Jimerson did not know from Stimis's conversation with Ford what Vaughn and the informant discussed other than the fact that they discussed punishment and that Vaughn participated in the crime.

On July 11, 2014, Prescott executed an affidavit in which he confirmed his participation as the informant in the Holmes investigation, including that his conversations with Vaughn were recorded, that he knew about the murder before those conversations, and that the charges against him were dismissed after his conversations with Vaughn.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr., Doc.

Ford stated that he told Prescott he could improve his situation if he obtained such information from one of Jimerson's co-defendants. Jimerson, therefore, knew that Prescott was promised leniency in exchanged for his informant work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   What Jimerson did find out on July 11, 2014, is that Vaughn told Prescott that a girlfriend drove the men to and from Holmes's residence, that Prescott's pending charges in a separate criminal matter\n   were dismissed after he obtained the information from Vaughn, and that Prescott was told about the murder before his conversation with Vaughn. These details turn the impeachment evidence Jimerson became aware of on January 7, 2014, into material evidence for the third element of her\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim. In Prescott's affidavit, he identifies details of his conversation with Vaughn and of the deal Ford offered him. These details revealed the impact of Prescott's role as an informant and the missing recording on Vaughn's confession and implication of Jimerson. Jimerson therefore possessed support for the three elements for her\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim on July 11, 2014, the date Prescott executed his affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Additionally, as Jimerson points out, she discovered for the first time in the July 2014 conversation with Prescott that Vaughn referred to the woman driver as the girlfriend of one of Jimerson's co-defendants, exculpatory evidence that was not available to Jimerson when Stimis spoke with Ford.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet. Reply, Doc. No. 14 at 4. Jimerson testified that she was never romantically involved with any of her co-defendants. Tr., Doc. No. 51 at 125-26. The co-defendants' testimony was that Jimerson and Brown were friends; Jimerson, Vaughn, and Early were aware of each other but were not friends; and Early had never seen Brown before trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 36-37, 126. Thus, at this time, she discovered evidence that was both favorable to her as exculpatory evidence and material to her guilt and punishment. Jimerson's habeas petition asserting her\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim on June 15, 2015, was timely, and her efforts in discovering the facts underlying the claim were diligent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    3.

She has shown that, in the year before filing her petition, she exercised diligence in discovering that the prosecution and investigating officers destroyed evidence, in bad faith, that was potentially useful to her.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Briscoe v.

She discovered for the first time when her counsel received Prescott's affidavit on July 11, 2014, that Prescott's and Vaughn's conversations contained at least one piece of exculpatory evidence-that a girlfriend drove Jimerson's co-defendants to the Holmes home-as well as other helpful impeachment evidence, such as Prescott's receiving leniency on separate charges against him in exchange for his informant work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Before that, on January 7, 2014, Jimerson learned, from Stimis's conversation with Ford, that an informant was used in the Holmes investigation and that the recording of their conversation had been lost or destroyed. Had she filed at this time, however, she would not have had sufficient facts to support a claim of bad faith. This missing element is grounds for dismissal of habeas petitions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Tyler v.

Therefore, Jimerson was reasonable to continue searching for evidence supporting the officers' bad faith in destroying the useful evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Jimerson's counsel discovered in January 2015, when she met with Arkansas State Police in person, the handwritten statement referenced in the state police\n   report regarding an interview with Prescott. The statement largely confirmed Prescott's affidavit as to his involvement and Vaughn's statements, but it omitted that Prescott had recorded their conversations at Ford's suggestion and that Prescott was promised leniency in exchange.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prescott Handwritten Statement, Doc. No. 51, Pet. Ex. 7. The statement bore Chief of Fordyce Police Ronnie Poole's signature-the police officer who first arrived at the crime scene in 1988-and another officer who is now deceased.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8970505\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/413/696/#p702\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; R. 670-73. Prescott testified at the evidentiary hearing that he would not have been able to read the statement at the time, that he did not write it but for his signature, and that he could \"barely make out a lot of this stuff that's written here\" at the evidentiary hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr., Doc. No. 51 at 26-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   This final handwritten statement, together with the other facts, provided sufficient evidence for Jimerson to make a\n   <em>\n    Youngblood\n   </em>\n   claim. Because of the successful efforts of the officers to conceal and destroy the recordings, Jimerson could not have discovered the existence of the informant and the recordings until January 7, 2015, when she received the handwritten statement signed by Prescott. Jimerson's\n   <em>\n    Youngblood\n   </em>\n   claim is also timely, and she exercised diligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Exhaustion of State Court Remedies\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Jimerson acknowledges that her claims are procedurally defaulted because they were not presented in state court proceedings and there are no remaining state court remedies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ; Jimerson's Obj., Doc.

If, then, the jury did not believe Vaughn's plea hearing testimony, the only remaining evidence with which to convict Jimerson was circumstantial testimony placing her with the other defendants and near the crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605024\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1885/#p1893\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1893-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that materiality must be determined in light of the entire record).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   That circumstantial testimony supporting Jimerson's role as an accomplice to the murder of Holmes included the following. Taura Bryant, who is now deceased, testified that she saw the four co-defendants together the night before Holmes's murder at a party at Levi Grandy's house, a half mile from Holmes's residence, where they came and went three times in three different\n   vehicles. R. 963-66, 985. She further testified that she saw them twice the next day and overheard Vaughn saying that Early or Brown had stolen a ring and money from an old lady, that the old lady \"was as big as an ocean and he could fit a light pole up her,\" and that Jimerson was crying and telling them to \"shut up.\" R. 968. Bryant believed she saw blood on either Brown's or Early's pants the day after the murder. R. 983. On cross-examination, she admitted that she could not remember whether it was Early or Brown who had blood on his pants, which day she saw the stain, where she saw them, or what the vehicles she saw them in looked like. R. 977-83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Lee and Kenny Parsons, brothers with whom Brown lived for some time before the murder, testified that Jimerson drove her three co-defendants to their house the night before they learned of Holmes's murder. R. 930, 933, 946-47. They testified that Brown's clothes appeared to have blood on the right side and that Brown went home to change clothes. R. 935, 949, 952. Brown told Kenny he had been in a fight with Sonny Tidwell. R. 948. Lee testified he did not tell police sooner than two years after the murder because he did not want to get involved,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 937, and Kenny testified he told the police he knew nothing until 1991, when he became a \"trusty\" at the jail,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 953-54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Benny Cox testified that he was with Jimerson on the day before Holmes was murdered, and that he loaned his car to her that night. R. 1086, 1089. Jimerson confirmed she had been with Cox, that she drove his car, and that Vaughn joined them in the car and wanted to go to a party. R. 1116-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Jimerson testified that she reported that she had been raped to the Calhoun County Sheriff's Department in 1989, and that the officer taking her report said, \"You better be glad they didn't do you like they did Myrtle Holmes.\" R. 1106. The officer, Bill Setterman, testified that he interviewed Jimerson in connection with the reported rape and that, when he brought up the Holmes murder, Jimerson became nervous and said that people were talking about her being involved. R. 1010-11. He also took a statement from her in which she stated she had given Brown a ride to a stop sign a couple blocks behind the police station,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 1109-that is, near Holmes's home-which she testified was to the \"South side\" of Fordyce sometime in June or July, not September, R. 1113, 1116.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Against this circumstantial evidence, Jimerson testified that she was at home after 9:00 p.m. the night of the crime and was not with Early, Brown, or Vaughn. R. 1108. Jimerson's father confirmed she came home around 9:00 p.m. the night of the crime and was home the next morning when they first heard of Holmes's murder. R. 1124-26. Early testified, in addition to confessing that he committed the crime by himself (Tr., Doc. No. 51 at 35-55), that he knew Jimerson from childhood, but he had not seen her in more than ten years. R. 1135-36. At the evidentiary hearing, Brown testified that he was never at the Parsons' home with Jimerson or Early, that he did not know Levi Grandy, and that he had not been to a party at Grandy's house. Tr., Doc. No. 51 at 153. Vaughn testified at the evidentiary hearing that he pleaded guilty because he was \"real young\" then.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 158.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In the order vacating Brown's conviction, the district court found that beyond \"the enticed, recanted confession of a mentally deficient co-defendant [Vaughn] ... [,] the result of a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation,\" was circumstantial evidence from four witnesses, three of whose testimony was called into question by new evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203999705\">\n    2018 WL 3999705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7. Although that order is not binding, it is persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The testimony linking Jimerson to the crime outside of Vaughn's illegally procured confession is tenuous.

Jimerson has shown that the prosecution obtained a confession from Vaughn through the use of an undisclosed informant and failed to preserve or disclose the recording of the confession-but only after the deputy prosecutor reviewed the recording for evidentiary value. Tr., Doc. 51, at 170. Whether the State did so in bad faith is a more difficult question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Whether bad faith exists depends on the knowledge of the officers and investigators at the time the evidence was lost or destroyed.\n   <em>\n    Briscoe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3505400\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/690/1004/#p1013\">\n    690 F.3d at 1013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Youngblood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1495598\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/51/\">\n    488 U.S. at 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1495598\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/51/\">\n    109 S.Ct. 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Although the contents of the recording is not entirely clear,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr., Doc. No. 51 at 22, 85-86, 91, what the recording did contain appears to be significant enough that the prosecution concealed it from the defense. Ford testified that he gave Prescott the recording device after Prescott told him that Vaughn \"was telling him about a murder.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr., Doc. No. 51 at 83. Although the value of the recording is unclear, the determination as to its value must weigh in favor of Jimerson, because it was not produced to her. Moreover, the statement Prescott signed would not have been reviewed by him, as he did not write it and could not read it to confirm its accuracy. That statement, which Jimerson's trial counsel should have received in the open file, omitted the recording in the jail cell. The existence of the recording was also omitted from the state police report and Prescott was never identified as an informant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Supreme Court \"has long recognized the serious questions of credibility informers pose.\"\n   <em>\n    Banks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897931\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/668/#p691\">\n    540 U.S. at 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897931\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/668/#p691\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Without the recording, Jimerson lost her ability to argue that Vaughn's confession was enticed by an informant. The prosecution's destruction of the recording constitutes bad faith; therefore, Jimerson's\n   <em>\n    Youngblood\n   </em>\n   claim also succeeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    2.

No. 61 at 44; Tr., Doc. No. 51, at 57, 65-68, 79. Whether Early committed the crime is not disputed. What is uncertain is whether he committed the crime alone. Nevertheless, in light of the State's\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Youngblood\n   </em>\n   violations and the fact that the remaining circumstantial evidence only vaguely connects Jimerson to the co-defendants and the crime, Early's confession renders the trial stained by constitutional error such that it shakes the confidence in the outcome of trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McQuiggin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697052\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/383/#p393\">\n    569 U.S. at 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697052\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/383/#p393\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Schlup\n   </em>\n   , 513 U.S. at 329,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/#p329\">\n    115 S.Ct. 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   This is not to say, however, that Jimerson's evidence is so strong that \"no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    Schlup\n   </em>\n   , 513 U.S. at 327,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/#p329\">\n    115 S.Ct. 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This standard is higher than the standard for materiality under\n   <em>\n    Brady.\n   </em>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   standard, again, is \"not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in its absence [s]he received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Strickler v.

Jimerson cannot meet the high bar for actual innocence. Circumstantial testimony placing Jimerson near the scene and with the co-defendants, Vaughn's recanted confession, and Early's confession, all come with their fair share of credibility issues. A reasonable juror could still believe the testimony placing Jimerson with the co-defendants and convict her even with the information that Vaughn's confession was obtained by an informant and that the State destroyed the recording. As a result, she is not excused from default based on actual innocence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Jimerson cannot meet the gateway actual innocence standard; accordingly, her actual innocence claim fails. Because Jimerson cannot satisfy the lower threshold for gateway actual innocence, her freestanding actual innocence claim need not be addressed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dansby v.
