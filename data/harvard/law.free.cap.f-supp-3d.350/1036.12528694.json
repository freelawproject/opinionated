Doc. 21. The government timely filed a Response on October 15, 2018 [Doc. 24], and the defense replied on October 29, 2018 [Doc. 26]. The Court, having considered the motion, briefs, relevant law, and being otherwise fully informed, finds that the motion is well-taken and will be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 9, 2016, Jason Butner (\"Defendant\") was arrested by state authorities on a warrant for a parole violation and booked in the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC). Doc. 21 at 1. On July 29, 2016, he was released from MDC to the New Mexico Corrections Department (NMCD) on a parole retake. Doc. 21 at 1, Def. Ex. A at 2. On January 12, 2017, the United States indicted Mr. Butner on one count of Felon in Possession of a Firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. sections 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). Doc. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Butner was in the custody of NMCD at the time of the federal indictment and remained in NMCD custody until January 11, 2018. Doc. 21 at 2, Def. Ex. B. When released, a detainer and warrants check showed no pending charges. Doc. 21 at 2, Def. Ex. C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 17, 2018, Defendant was arrested by state authorities on new state charges. Defendant was held without bond at MDC. Doc. 21 at 2, Def. Ex. D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 29, 2018, a writ was issued for his transfer to federal custody. Doc. 7. Two weeks later, on July 10, 2018, the federal indictment was unsealed and Mr. Butner was arrested by federal authorities. Doc. 21 at 2. He was arraigned on the federal charges on July 12, 2018. Doc. 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant argues that dismissal is warranted because the government violated the Speedy Trial Act and the Sixth Amendment. Doc. 21. The government denies these allegations. Doc. 24. Because the Court finds a violation of Defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial, it need not address Defendant's argument that the government violated the Speedy Trial Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Over the course of the two-month and 11-day period after Mr. Butner learned of the charges, he filed one motion to continue. This single continuance does not demonstrate a lack of desire for a swift resolution of his case. Rather, as defense explained, the continuance was necessary to obtain discovery, conduct an investigation, and determine Mr. Butner's whereabouts since July 2016. Doc. 21 at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Toombs\n   </em>\n   , for instance, the defendant requested seven continuances over the course of 17 months before finally asserting his speedy trial right.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677031\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/574/1262/#p1274\">\n    574 F.3d at 1274-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Batie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   the defendant's first trial ended in a mistrial. He moved to dismiss the indictment on the basis of double jeopardy and, after that motion was denied, requested two continuances before ultimately filing a second motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"881173\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/433/1287/#p1290\">\n    433 F.3d at 1289-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Unlike\n   <em>\n    Toombs\n   </em>\n   , where the defendant requested seven continuances, Mr. Butner only requested one.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677031\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/574/1262/#p1274\">\n    574 F.3d at 1274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, while the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Batie\n   </em>\n   only requested two continuances, he asserted his speedy trial right after his earlier motion to dismiss was unsuccessful.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"881173\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/433/1287/#p1290\">\n    433 F.3d at 1289-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Batie\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Butner did not file any other substantive dispositive motions prior to his motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds. This supports the conclusion that Mr. Butner's primary goal was to pursue a \"swift resolution of his case.\"\n   <em>\n    Gould\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3736060\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/672/930/#p937\">\n    672 F.3d at 938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The single continuance is particularly excusable given the facts of this case. While Mr. Butner's interest in obtaining a speedy trial had been accruing over the course of a year and a half, his defense counsel was not appointed until shortly after Mr. Butner's arrest in July 2018. The first and only motion to continue was filed just over a month after his arraignment and issuance of the discovery order. Doc. 14. Typically, defense counsel is retained shortly after a defendant is indicted, and a speedy trial motion would not be contemplated just over two months later. In this case, however, because defense counsel was appointed so late in the pretrial timeline, he was placed in the unusual situation of having to simultaneously apprise himself of the facts of the case while pursuing a speedy trial motion far earlier than is typical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In sum, Mr. Butner asserted his Sixth Amendment right just over two months after learning of the charges against him. During that time, he requested a single continuance, which is excusable considering that defense counsel was appointed more than a year and a half after Mr. Butner was indicted. Accordingly, this factor weights in Mr. Butner's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   d.\n   <em>\n    Prejudice\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The fourth\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   factor is prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">\n    407 U.S. at 529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The individual claiming the Sixth Amendment violation has the burden of showing prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    Toombs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677031\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/574/1262/#p1274\">\n    574 F.3d at 1275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Tenth Circuit held that the defendant was prejudiced in three ways: (1) the delay added to the defendant's pretrial incarceration; (2) the defendant was denied access to the assistance of counsel for over six months; and (3) the defendant was \"deprived ... of a chance to invoke his statutory rights under the Speedy Trial Act at an earlier date.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4215884\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/595/1170/#p1178\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4215884\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/595/1170/#p1178\">\n    at 1180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Of the three examples of prejudice found in\n   <em>\n    Seltzer\n   </em>\n   , the latter two are present in the instant case. Defendant was denied assistance of counsel for more than a year and a half. As a result, Defendant was deprived of the opportunity to invoke his rights under the Speedy Trial Act and the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, both of which contain notice provisions that allow a defendant to demand a speedy trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   18 U.S.C.

Additionally, because Defendant was neither represented by counsel nor notified of the indictment prior to his arrest in July 2018, Defendant was precluded from invoking his rights under either of these statutes. Under\n   <em>\n    Seltzer\n   </em>\n   , these deprivations are sufficient to constitute prejudice.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4215884\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/595/1170/#p1178\">\n    595 F.3d at 1181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Thus, this factor weighs in favor of Mr. Butner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   e.\n   <em>\n    Balancing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Each of the four\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   factors weighs in favor of Mr. Butner. First, the eighteen-month delay in this case is presumptively prejudicial, and is especially concerning given the relative simplicity of the charges against Mr. Butner. Second, while not intentionally, the TFO caused the delay. Third, Mr. Butner was indicted in January 2017, but the government failed to inform Mr. Butner of these charges until July 2018. Mr. Butner asserted his Sixth Amendment right just over two months after learning of these charges. While he did request one continuance, it does not reflect a desire to avoid trial or attempt to pursue other strategic avenues. Fourth, Mr. Butner was prejudiced by the eighteen-month deprivation of counsel, which ultimately precluded him from exercising his rights under the Speedy Trial Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Based on the foregoing analysis, the Court finds that Defendant Jason Butner has demonstrated a violation of his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial.
