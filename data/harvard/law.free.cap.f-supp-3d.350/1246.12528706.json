As set forth below, the motion will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In November 2011, Kevin Guice created Loyal Financial &amp; Credit Services, LLC (\"Loyal\"). (Loyal Articles of Organization, PX 47, at 22-23).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Through Loyal, Guice established a telemarketing company that sold debt-relief services. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compton Decl., PX 43, \u00b6 16; Loyal Commercial Telephone Seller Business License Application, PX 43, at 22-27; Loyal's Call Scripts, PX 43, at 30-36). The first service sold by Loyal was a program that purportedly assisted individuals in obtaining lower interest rates on their existing credit card debt-the lower interest rate (\"LI\") program. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX 43 at 30, 33-36). Loyal's primary method of obtaining lower interest rates for customers involved getting the customers new credit cards with promotional zero percent interest rates and then directing the customers to transfer their existing credit card debt to the new cards. (Cline Aff., Doc. 168-7, at 1;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 (indicating that Loyal and its related companies obtained lower interest rate credit cards for over ten thousand customers) ). When this method was utilized, Loyal claimed that it would keep the customers' interest rates at zero percent by perpetually obtaining new zero percent cards and transferring balances when the previous introductory rate expired. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2; Stickles Dep., Doc. 163-49, at 179:18-180:2). Additionally, Loyal would sometimes negotiate with the customers' credit card companies to have the account placed in \"hardship\" status-i.e., the account would be closed, and customers would be given a zero or near zero percent interest rate for a certain period of time within which they were required to pay off their balance. (Doc. 168-7 at 1; Andrews Dep., Doc. 163-52, at 23:5-19). Loyal charged fees ranging from $500 to $5000 for the LI program. (Doc. 163-49 at 280:22-24;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 163-52 at 213:1-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2013, Loyal also began selling debt-elimination (\"DE\") services. (Doc. 163-52 at 23:23-24). These services were marketed to Loyal's LI clients who had a certain amount of credit card debt. (Brownell Dep., Doc. 163-50, at 58:3-12). Loyal's DE services involved the customers ceasing to make payments on their credit card debt, and once the customers had been in default for at least three months, Loyal's employees negotiating a settlement of the debt with the credit card companies. (Hampton Dep., Doc. 163-51, at 20:2-12, 58:25-59:19). Loyal's fees for its DE program ranged from $2000 to $26,000. (Doc. 163-50 at 59:6-7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 163-52 at 212:21-25)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In February 2014, Life Management Services of Orange County, LLC (\"LMS\") was established, (LMS Articles of Organization, PX 47, at 13), and began offering the same LI and DE programs as Loyal, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   LMS Commercial Telephone Seller Business License Application, PX 43, at 137-142; LMS Call Scripts, PX 43, at 146-153). Throughout this time period, eleven other companies were established as part of Loyal's and LMS's business operations\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   -IVD Recovery, LLC (IVD Recovery Articles of Organization, PX 47, at 47-48); KWP Services, LLC (KWP Services Articles of Organization, PX 47, at 51-52); KWP Services of Florida LLC (KWP Services of Florida Articles of Organization,\n   PX 47, at 56-57); LPSofFla LLC, (LPSofFla Articles of Organization, PX 47, at 60-61); LPSofFlorida L.L.C., (LPSofFlorida Articles of Organization, PX 47, at 64-65); PW &amp; F Consultants of Florida LLC, (PW &amp; F Articles of Organization, PX 47, at 68-69); UAD Secure Services LLC, (UAD Articles of Organization, PX 47, at 71-72); UAD Secure Service of FL LLC, (UAD Secure Service of FL Articles of Organization, PX 47, at 75-76); URB Management, LLC, (URB Articles of Organization, PX 47, at 79-80); YCC Solutions LLC, (YCC Articles of Organization, PX 47, at 83-84); and YFP Solutions LLC, (YFP Articles of Organization, PX 47, at 87-88), (collectively the \"Shell Defendants\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") and the State of Florida began investigating Defendants for multiple violations of Section 5 of the FTC Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (\"FDUTPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20501.201\">\n    Fla.

As a result, Plaintiffs filed this case, and on June 8, 2016, all of Defendants' business activities relating to Loyal, LMS, and the Shell Defendants ceased due to a Temporary Restraining Order (Doc. 36) issued by this Court. (\n   <em>\n    See also generally\n   </em>\n   Preliminary Injunctions, Doc. Nos. 75-81, 83, 89, 99).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The claims in this case have been settled as to all Defendants except Guice. Plaintiffs allege that Loyal, LMS, and the Shell Defendants were operating as a common enterprise, which was controlled by Guice. They further allege that this enterprise, at Guice's direction, engaged in deceptive business practices, made material misrepresentations and omissions when selling their services, and violated numerous provisions of the TSR, including those relating to the Do Not Call (\"DNC\") Registry. Plaintiffs have now moved for summary judgement as to all claims against Guice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

July 18, 2013) (quotation omitted) (collecting cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   First, Loyal and LMS were, for all intents and purposes, the same company. Indeed, the record evidence indicates that LMS was created to take over Loyal's operations because Loyal and Guice were subject to criminal investigations and civil liabilities. Loyal and Guice were facing charges by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (\"FDACS\"), (PX 43 at 5 \u00b6\u00b6 29-33;\n   <em>\n    see also generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 50-69), and therefore, FDACS denied the renewal of Loyal's Commercial Telephone Seller license, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6 \u00b6\u00b6 35-36; Denial of Application, PX 43, at 101). Further, Guice and Loyal were facing civil liability due to a suit by a previous customer, (\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Childress Compl., Doc. 163-3 (filed in December 2013); Childress Notice of Dismissal, Doc. 163-4 (acknowledging that the case was settled in March 2014);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Second Guice Dep., Doc. 163-43, at 84:2-9, 86:18-87:9 (invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in response to questions regarding whether LMS was created as a sham, at Guice's direction, during the pendency of the Childress litigation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Accordingly, Guice asked one of his employees, Wayne Norris, to set up LMS and find someone to temporarily stand in as LMS's Registered Agent until he got his \"court case\" \"cleared up.\" (Norris Dep., Doc. 163-44, at 120:2-5, 225:19-228:18;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 163-43 at 84:2-9). Norris arranged for his wife's friend, Adrien Brezinski, who did not otherwise have ties to Loyal or the telemarketing industry, to do so. (Doc. 163-44 at 36:19-21, 168:9-12, 227:11-228:18).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Norris testified that Guice was, in reality, the owner of both Loyal and LMS, (Doc. 163-44 at 133:23-134:4), and Guice invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when asked whether he owned an interest in LMS, (First Guice Dep., Doc. 163-42, at 9:15-18).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In addition, LMS submitted to FDACS scripts and documents that were identical to Loyal's scripts and documents, (\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   PX 43 at 30-36\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 146-153),\n   and a substantial portion of Loyal's employees simultaneously became LMS's employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 \u00b6\u00b6 54-56). Those employees noticed no changes in the operation of the business, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 163-50 at 56:1-18); and many of them did not even know there had been a change until they received their paychecks or their renewed telemarketing license, which listed their employer as LMS rather than Loyal. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 56:13-57:1; Doc. 163-49 at 81:4-8, 82:15-83:23). Loyal and LMS were clearly operating as a common enterprise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   With regard to the Shell Defendants, the record establishes that they, combined with Loyal and LMS, constituted the quintessential \"maze of interrelated companies\" that forms a common enterprise. First, each of the Shell Defendants was set up in much the same manner as LMS-Guice asked Norris or another employee, Harry Wahl, to find people to set up the Shell Defendants to be \"merchant accounts\" for Loyal or LMS-i.e., to invoice and charge customers for Loyal's and LMS's services. (Doc. 163-44 at 149:14-150:14, 154:13-19, 189:9-25, 229:10-18). The record supports this conclusion as to each of the Shell Defendants as follows: IVD Recovery, (Karen Wahl Dep., Doc. 163-46, at 67:17-68:3; Doc. 163-43 at 67:13-24); KWP Services, (Doc. 163-44 at 229:10-18; Doc. 163-46 at 6:21-24; PX 43 at 3, \u00b6 19; Doc. 163-43 at 101:12-21); KWP Services of Florida, (Doc. 163-44 at 234:9-12); LPSofFla, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 232:9-14); LPSofFlorida, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 232:25-233:3); PW &amp; F, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 230:24-231:1); UAD Secure Services, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 221:1-5, 222:17-25); UAD Secure Services of Florida, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 219:20-24); URB Management, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 219:20-24); YCC, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 233:7-12); YFP, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 234:1-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Once the Shell Defendants were established, they were used as fronts for Loyal and LMS. Customers interacted with Loyal and LMS employees, and to the extent services were provided, they were done so by Loyal and LMS employees, but customers were told that they were working with one of the Shell Defendants.

The money was co-mingled with Loyal's and LMS's operations. Specifically, after payments were made to the Shell Defendants, the individuals who set up those Shell Defendants would take cash out of their bank accounts and give it to a manager at Loyal or LMS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jackowski Dep., Doc. 163-47, at 6:10-15, 9:6-16, 13:6-12, 14:2-15:11, 17:6-19:21; Doc. 163-44 at 235:17-236:4, 249:17-251:10, 254:11-21). That money was then used for various expenses, including Loyal's and LMS's payroll and rent. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 163-47 at 30:6-21; PX 102 at 1-3 (checks written from KWP's bank account to pay LMS's rent); PX 103 at 1-3 (wire transfers from LPSofFla and KWP to LMS for payroll); PX 98 at 5, 7 (transfers from LPSofFlorida to LMS for payroll) ). Money was also freely transferred among the various corporate bank accounts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First George Decl., PX 45, \u00b6\u00b6 25-39 (detailing over $8.8 million in transfers between the Corporate Defendants); PX 113 (summary of bank accounts);\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , LMS Bank Account Statement, PX 101, at 1 (showing electronic transfer from YCC to LMS); PX 94 at 1-2 (customer checks written to IVD and deposited into Loyal's bank account); PX 96 at 1 (customer check written to URB and deposited in Loyal's bank account); PX 99 at 1, 2 (showing that a $6,490 check and a $4,359 check made out to UAD Secure Services was deposited in LPSofFla's bank account); PX 98 at 3 (showing transfer from LPSofFlorida to KWP Services) ). And finally, there is evidence that approximately $8,593,352.60 was transferred directly from the Shell Defendants to Guice, personally. (Fourth George Decl., Doc. 163-33, \u00b6 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   There is additional evidence that Loyal, LMS, and the Shell Defendants were operating a common enterprise, including overlapping addresses,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (PX 47 \u00b6\u00b6 11-12 (Loyal and IVD), \u00b6\u00b6 18-19 (UAD Secure Services and UAD Secure Service of FL); PX 48 \u00b6 29); IP addresses, (PX 48 \u00b6\u00b6 24-26); documents, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-23); and phone numbers, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In sum, there was no real distinction between Loyal, LMS, or the Shell Defendants.

Sept. 30, 1997) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   With regard to Loyal, there is no question that Guice had the ability to control its practices. Indeed, Guice does not appear to dispute this fact. (Doc. 168 at 16 (arguing that there is an issue of fact as to whether Guice controlled any of the companies \"\n   <em>\n    other than\n   </em>\n   Loyal\" (emphasis added) ) ). First, the evidence establishes that Guice owned an interest in Loyal. In addition to Guice invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   when asked, \"do you own any interest in [Loyal]?,\" (Doc. 163-42 at 9:24-10:2), Guice admitted to being the owner of Loyal during a 2013 investigation by FDACS, (Investigator's Field Report, PX 43, at 65-66 (identifying Guice as \"owner\" of Loyal in a document that Guice signed); Settlement Agreement with FDACS, PX 43, at 83 (containing Guice's signature on behalf of Loyal as its owner) ). Guice was also identified as the owner of Loyal by Norris, (Doc. 163-44 at 133:23-134:4), and Guice's Facebook page listed him as the owner of \"LFCS\"-an abbreviation of Loyal's full name, (PX 48 at 108). Additionally, Guice received approximately $1,732,332.60 in payments from Loyal. (Fourth George Decl., Doc. 163-33, \u00b6 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The evidence also establishes that Guice's position was not simply a title; he\n   exerted control over Loyal's operations. Guice applied for a Commercial Telephone Seller business license on behalf of Loyal, and the application listed Guice as Loyal's Registered Agent and Manager. (PX 43 \u00b6 16; PX 43 at 22-23);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   PX 47 at 22-23 (listing Defendant as the registered agent and manager of Loyal) ). Guice was also the only individual listed on a Bank of America account on behalf of Loyal. (Bank of America Signature Card, Doc. PX 121, at 1). Finally, Guice invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in response to the following questions: \"Did you ever develop any of [Loyal's] scripts?\" and \"Did you ever develop any of [Loyal's] new client packets?\" (Doc. 163-42 at 117:21-118:3). Thus, there is no issue of fact with regard to Guice's ability to control Loyal's practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   With regard to LMS, the record also demonstrates that Guice was able to exert control over it. First, as explained above, LMS was, for all intents and purposes, the same entity as Loyal, and the policies, scripts, and procedures that were put in place by Guice at Loyal were carried over to LMS. Moreover, the evidence establishes that Guice participated in the day-to-day oversight of LMS. Guice directly controlled the flow of LMS's income. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 163-44 at 265:2-266:17; Doc. 163-47 at 14:12-14, 14:25-17:2; Doc. 163-52 at 102:14-20). He also set out requirements for hiring at least some employees. (Second Norris Dep., Doc. 163-45, at 12:15-13:4). And, Guice was involved in operational decisions such as making payments on behalf of customers, refunds, addressing complaints from regulatory agencies-often dealing with the types of allegations at issue here-and consulting regularly with many of LMS's managers and with Lea Brownell, the primary salesperson\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the DE program, (Doc. 163-50 at 57:14-20, 59:15-16). (Doc. 163-45 at 13:8-18; Doc. 163-51 at 84:10-15; Doc. 163-50 at 163:24-164:7; Doc. 163-52 at 10:15-20, 11:14-16, 99:24-100:17;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 163-43 at 153:18-21 (invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in answer to the question of whether Guice \"formulated, directed, controlled, had the authority to control or participate in the acts and practices of the common enterprise composed of [LMS, Loyal, and all of the Shell Defendants]\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Guice's reliance on the deposition testimony of various low-level LMS employees is insufficient to create an issue of fact. Guice asserts that employee Randi Stickles \"did not consider ... Guice to be her boss\" and that employees Jessica Hernandez and Lea Brownell believed that Harry Wahl owned LMS. (Doc. 168 at 18). First, the testimony cited by Guice relating to Stickles and Brownell is not on the record. (Doc. 168 at 18 nn.64-65 (citing page 58 of Stickles' deposition); Doc. 163-49 at ECF pp. 6-7 (skipping from deposition page 56 to deposition page 81); (Doc. 168 at 18 nn.66-67 (citing pages 62 and 71 of Brownell's deposition); (Doc. 163-50 at ECF pp. 5-6 (skipping from deposition page 60 to deposition page 81) ). Nevertheless, accepting Guice's representation of the deposition testimony as true, it is inconsequential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Stickles was a low-level salesperson, who lacked any actual knowledge of the ownership of the companies. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 163-49 at 92:10-14 (noting that Stickles was a \"closer\"-i.e., a salesperson-the entire time she worked for Loyal and LMS);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 82:20-84:9 (indicating that Stickles was not aware of the organization of the Defendant companies or who had ultimate authority over them) ). Brownell and Hernandez were similarly low-level employees-as noted, Brownell was the salesperson for the DE program; Hernandez was a salesperson\n   for approximately six months, and thereafter she was a customer service representative, where she made new client packets, answered the phone, and scheduled appointments, (Hernandez Dep., Doc. 163-53, at 17:10-19). Neither had actual knowledge of who owned LMS. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 163-50 at 163:2-164:3 (noting that Brownell \"was told\" that Harry Wahl was her boss but admitting that she \"really [did not] know\" and noting that she continued to speak with Guice on a weekly basis regarding the DE program); Doc. 163-53 at 34:6-24 (indicating that Hernandez believed that Harry Wahl was the owner because she \"heard rumors that he ... took over [LMS]\") ). Further, the dispositive issue is not whether Guice\n   <em>\n    owned\n   </em>\n   LMS, but instead, whether he\n   <em>\n    controlled\n   </em>\n   LMS. The record evidence discussed above establishes that he did.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   None of the testimony cited by Guice undermines or contradicts the above-cited evidence that Guice did, in fact, assert control over LMS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Finally, there is also no issue of fact as to Guice's control over the Shell Defendants. As explained above, they were set up and operated at Guice's direction. Guice controlled the flow of money between the Shell Defendants, LMS, and Loyal; he decided how much money would be withdrawn from those companies and where that money would go. And, as also noted above, collectively, the Shell Defendants paid Guice over 8.5 million dollars. Accordingly, it is clear that Guice had the ability to control the acts and practices of the Shell Companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Such statements are inadequate to counteract the false and misleading statements regarding affiliations. Representations are deceptive when, \"based on a common sense net impression of the representations as a whole, the representations are likely to\n   mislead reasonable customers to their detriment.\"\n   <em>\n    F.T.C. v.

First, the language cited by Guice does not mitigate the false statements made by employees-i.e., that the Loyal and LMS were affiliated with the above-referenced institutions-the company could certainly have been affiliated with a lending institution without being a lending institution or making a credit card offer themselves. Moreover, such a vague, technical disclosure read after customers have committed to purchasing a product is not sufficient to undermine the net impression that the company was affiliated with these institutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Additionally, in many cases, Loyal's and LMS's employees falsely stated that they worked for certain non-existent entities, the names of which sounded consumer-friendly or like they were affiliated with banks and credit card issuers, such as \"American Credit Assistance,\" \"Bank Card Services,\" \"Credit Assistance Program,\" \"Credit Card Services,\" and \"Credit Management Associates.\" (PX 46 \u00b6\u00b6 15, 29; PX 51 at 8:22-25; PX 52 at 7:18-20; PX 5 \u00b6 2; PX 11 \u00b6\u00b6 10-11; Goldsmith Decl., PX 17, \u00b6 3; PX 19 \u00b6 9; PX 20 \u00b6 5; PX 21 \u00b6 7; PX 22 \u00b6 2; PX 33 \u00b6 6; PX 34 \u00b6 8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Second Caplan Decl., Doc. 41-2, \u00b6 9 (describing call scripts found at Defendants' office with American Credit Assistance, Credit Assistance Program, and Bank Card Services listed);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, 10, 13 (call scripts directing salespeople to state the name of the company was American Credit Assistance, Credit Assistance Program, or Bank Card Services) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The uncontradicted evidence establishes that Loyal's and LMS's managers knew that their employees were making such misrepresentations.

Thus, at a minimum, Guice had an awareness of a high probability that such misrepresentations were being made, and if he did not have actual knowledge of the misrepresentations it was because he intentionally avoided the truth.

The TSR requires sellers and telemarketers, prior to a customer consenting to pay, \"to disclose truthfully, in a clear and conspicuous manner ... [t]he total costs to purchase, receive, or use, ... any goods or services that are the\n   subject of the sales offer.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20310.3\">\n    16 C.F.R. \u00a7 310.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The LI program was typically fulfilled by obtaining new credit cards for the customer with introductory zero percent interest rates and then transferring the customer's existing credit card debt to the new card or cards. These balance transfers typically carry a balance transfer fee-during this time frame, the most common fee was three percent of the amount transferred. (Wilhelm Decl., PX 42, \u00b6 36). It is undisputed that employees did not inform customers of these balance transfer fees. (Doc. 163-49 at 181:6-23; PX 7 \u00b6 12; PX 8 \u00b6 14; PX 10 \u00b6 15; PX 13 \u00b6 13; PX 16 \u00b6 13; PX 17 \u00b6 15;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 163-43 at 62:19-63:22 (pleading the Fifth with regard to whether Defendants' employees advised customers of fees including balance transfer fees) ). Further, in their sales pitches, Loyal's and LMS's employees emphasized that there was only a \"one time\" service fee, which could be reasonably interpreted by customers to mean that there would be no fees other than that charged by Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX 19 \u00b6 63;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   PX 5 \u00b6 20; PX 8 at 5; PX 12 at 6; PX 13 at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   According to Heather Cline, one of the managers and Guice's sister, Loyal and LMS relied on the credit card issuer to inform the customer of any transfer fees. (Doc. 168-7 at 1). However, obtaining new, lower interest rate credit cards and transferring balances was an essential part of the LI program-that is, in most cases balance transfer fees were necessary to the fulfillment of the program-and those fees were borne by the customer. Thus, the fees were part of the cost of the LI program, and Defendants had a duty under the TSR to disclose them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Further, Loyal's and LMS's employees did not begin the process of speaking with the banks about obtaining a new card until customers had already agreed to purchase the LI program. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PX 5 \u00b6\u00b6 12-13; PX 7 \u00b6\u00b6 11-15; PX 8 \u00b6\u00b6 12-15; PX 10 \u00b6\u00b6 13-16, 18; PX 12 \u00b6\u00b6 19, 23-24; PX 13 \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15). Therefore, even if the credit card issuer's representatives did properly inform the customers about the balance transfer fees, it was too late. Loyal and LMS had already obtained the customers consent to pay for the LI services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Loyal and LMS violated the TSR by failing to fully and clearly disclose the cost of Defendants' rate reduction program.\n   <em>\n    F.T.C. v.

Given that Guice was involved in the creation of the scripts and he interacted regularly with Loyal's and LMS's managers, there is sufficient evidence, when taken in conjunction with Guice's invocation of his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, (Doc. 163-43 at 63:3-6, 96:25-97:8), to hold Guice liable for these violations.

Indeed, in his argument Guice only points to one individual who he argues obtained a permanent zero percent interest rate,\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   but the evidence he cites in\n   support contradicts his contention. (Doc. 168 at 7 (claiming that \"the company negotiated [Phyllis Burke's J.C.

Thus, according to Guice, for all intents and purposes, the customers did get a permanent zero percent interest rate. Guice's argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   As discussed above, at the time these statements were made, the employees did not have sufficient information to determine whether the customers would have qualified for a promotional zero percent interest rate, much less whether they would be able to continuously qualify for one or otherwise obtain a hardship status.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, even assuming that the customers could qualify for such rates, these statements were still material misrepresentations because the customers did not know-and thus were not able to weigh-the fact that they would have to frequently open new credit cards and pay balance transfer fees or that they would have to close their credit card accounts due to hardship status.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    RCA Credit Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4119681\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/727/1320/#p1339\">\n    727 F.Supp.2d at 1329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that express claims used to induce the purchase of services are presumed to be material (quoting\n   <em>\n    Transnet Wireless Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3663845\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/506/1247/#p1270\">\n    506 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1267 ) ). Further, customers were not warned that obtaining new credit cards or going into hardship status could impact their creditworthiness, which in and of itself supports the conclusion that these statements were material.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20310.3\">\n    16 C.F.R. \u00a7 310.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(x) (including misrepresentations regarding \"the effect of the service on a customer's creditworthiness\" in the list of actionable misrepresentations about \"material aspect[s] of [a] debt relief service\"). Moreover, putting a customer's account into hardship status cannot satisfy the promise to obtain a permanent zero percent interest credit card for the customer. Going into hardship status closes the account and the customer can no longer use the card, and while hardship statuses typically last longer than an introductory zero percent credit card, they are not permanent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Guice is liable for the misrepresentations regarding permanent zero-percent interest rates. The managers of Loyal and LMS knew that the salespeople were making such misrepresentations. (Doc. 163-49 at 177:24-178:19). When their knowledge is combined with Guice's involvement in the day-to-day operations of the common enterprise, his frequent contact with Loyal's and LMS's managers, and his invocation of his Fifth Amendment right in response to whether Loyal's and\n   LMS's employees made such misrepresentations, (Doc. 163-43 at 60:19-61:6, 94:12-16, 94:25-95:8), it is sufficiently established that, at a minimum, Guice was aware of a high probability of fraud and, if he did not have actual knowledge, it was because he intentionally avoided the truth. Therefore, insofar as Counts One, Three, and Eleven involve misrepresentations regarding permanent, substantially lower interest rates, Plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   e.\n   <em>\n    Omissions Regarding Adverse Effects\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As explained previously, Defendants' DE program exclusively relied on customers failing to make timely payments to creditors. In such circumstances, the TSR requires specific disclosures regarding adverse consequences, which Plaintiffs assert Loyal and LMS failed to make. If \"any aspect of [a] debt relief service relies upon or results in the customer's failure to make timely payments to creditors or debt collectors,\" sellers and telemarketers must disclose-prior to the customer consenting to pay for the service-\"that the use of the debt relief service will likely adversely affect the customer's creditworthiness, may result in the customer being subject to collections or sued by creditors or debt collectors, and may increase the amount of money the customer owes due to the accrual of fees and interest.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20310.3\">\n    16 C.F.R. \u00a7 310.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(viii)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Loyal and LMS employees did not disclose any of the possible negative consequences listed above.

Guice argues that-despite the abundance of evidence indicating that customers were not warned that their credit would be adversely affected or that their accounts may be put into collections-the customers\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   have been told about that possibility because the \"New Client Packet\"-which was typically sent to customers months after starting the DE program-included an offer to assist clients with credit repair and dealing with collections. Such an argument is based purely on conjecture, is contradicted by the record evidence, and is without merit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Guice is liable for these violations. Guice was intimately involved in the DE program. He introduced the DE program into the company, (Doc. 163-52 at 24:24-25:6), and was involved in establishing details of the operation, including setting the DE negotiator's salaries and specifying their hiring qualifications, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 99:9-11; Doc. 163-45 at 12:15-13:4). Once the program was up and running, Guice spoke with Kara Andrews, a manager of the DE program, (163-52 at 27:24-28:5, 28:19-21, 90:21-23), regularly-often daily-regarding all aspects of the DE program, including which client accounts were being completed, which were being negotiated, and any problems or complaints. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 99:24-101:9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 163-45 at 13:8-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Guice also gave Andrews instructions on how to deal with the problems and complaints regarding the DE program. (Doc. 163-52 at 101:10-12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 163-45 at 13:14-18). In addition, Guice spoke with Brownell, the primary salesperson for the DE program, on a weekly basis. (Doc. 163-50 at 163:24-164:3). When this evidence is combined with Guice's above-referenced invocation of his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, there is no issue of fact: Guice is liable for the failure to make disclosures under \u00a7 310.3(a)(1)(viii)(C). Thus, Plaintiffs will be granted summary judgment as to Count Six.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   f.\n   <em>\n    Misrepresentations Regarding a Fund to Pay Off Debts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Additionally, with regard to the DE program, Loyal and LMS employees regularly led customers to believe that there was some sort of fund that could be used to pay off their debt-sometimes it was referred to as a government fund and other times it was described as a fund created by a lawsuit against the credit card companies. (PX 2 \u00b6 31; PX 3 \u00b6 16; PX 6 \u00b6 6; PX 7 \u00b6 26; PX 9 \u00b6 8; PX 10 \u00b6 37; PX 16 \u00b6 24; PX 20 \u00b6 16; PX 25 \u00b6 38; PX 28 \u00b6 5; PX 30 \u00b6 16; PX 31 \u00b6 8; PX 36 \u00b6 18; PX 38 \u00b6 24; PX 111 \u00b6 27; PX 112 \u00b6 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 163-50 at 209:17-210:8, 210:24-16; PX 197 at 141:2-17; Doc. 163-43 at 62:3-18, 96:3-13 (pleading the Fifth). Such statements were false; no such fund existed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 163-50 at 210:24-211:16; Doc. 163-51 at 149:23-150:3). Thus, these statements violated Section 5, FDUTPA, and \u00a7 310.3(a)(2)(x) of the TSR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Guice is liable for these violations. In addition to the analysis of Guice's involvement in the DE program discussed in Section III.C.2.e above, there is evidence that Cline-a manager who spoke to Guice on a regular basis regarding Loyal's and LMS's operations-had actual knowledge of the false statements regarding a government fund. (Ex. 6 to Maxwell Decl., PX 28, at 43). This evidence combined with Guice's intimate involvement in the DE program and his invocation of his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination is sufficient to establish Guice's knowledge of these violations. Thus, Plaintiffs will be granted summary judgment as to Counts Six and Seven and as to Counts One, Three, and Eleven insofar as they relate to misrepresentations regarding the government fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    3. Up-Front Fees\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs assert that Defendants requested and collected fees from customers prior to providing any services, in violation of the TSR. Sellers and telemarketers are prohibited from \"[r]equesting or receiving payment of any fee or consideration for any debt relief service until and unless ... (A) [t]he seller or telemarketer has renegotiated, settled, reduced, or otherwise altered the terms of at least one debt ...; [and] (B) [t]he customer has made at least one payment pursuant to [the new terms obtained for the customer].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20310.4\">\n    16 C.F.R. \u00a7 310.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5)(i).

Guice argues that because in many cases new credit cards had been obtained when fees were requested or charged, Defendants complied with the law. This argument fails. The TSR requires that customer make at least one payment pursuant to the new terms prior to payment being requested. As the above-referenced consumer declarations make clear, most of the time when payment was requested-and often when payment was actually made-no debt had even been transferred to the new card. More importantly, there is no evidence on the record that Defendants ever waited until after payment on the new card had been made to request payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Further, Guice is liable for these violations because he was given actual notice of the up-front fees via customer complaints. (Doc. 163-15 at 1, 8 (stating in a complaint to Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office, which was e-mailed to Guice, that on the day the customer signed up for the LI program she was charged $2,500 for the services), 13-14 (stating in a complaint to the Illinois Attorney General's Office, which was e-mailed to Guice, that an employee directed the customer to obtained a cash advance and pay the fee prior to receiving a lower interest rate card), 23 (stating in a complaint to the Illinois Attorney General's Office, which was e-mailed to Guice, that she was required to pay a $500 up-front fee for the LI program) ). Additionally, as explained in Section III.B.1, Guice controlled the flow of money in and out of the Shell Defendants-to which these customer payments were made. Finally, as indicated by the above-cited consumer declarations, the process by which payment was requested was standardized. Given Guice's involvement in developing the policies and procedures of the Defendant companies, as discussed at length throughout this Order, it is impossible to conclude anything other than the fact that Guice had knowledge of these violations. (\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 163-43 at 65:17-66:6, 99:9-23 (pleading the Fifth) ).
