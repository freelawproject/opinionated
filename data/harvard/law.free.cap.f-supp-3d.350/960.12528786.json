(ECF No. 1). As required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201914\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the required filing fee was paid. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). At the time the Petition was filed, Petitioner was incarcerated at the Chief Ignacio Justice Center in Towaoc, Colorado, pursuant to his convictions and combined sentences of\n   over 2,630 days in Case Nos. SDPMR-0617-05 and SDPMR-0617-10 imposed by the Santo Domingo Tribal Court of the Kewa Pueblo in New Mexico. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On November 20, 2018, counsel for the Petitioner filed a First Amended Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus for Relief from a Tribal Court Conviction and Banishment Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201303\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Amended Petition\"). (ECF No. 10). Subsequently on November 21, 2018, in apparent recognition of this Court's Local Rules regarding the filing of an amended pleading under D.C.COLO.LCivR 15.1, a Notice of Filing Amended Petition Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1) was filed which attached as an exhibit the Amended Petition as a \"strike through\" document. (ECF No. 14). Review of the Amended Petition demonstrates that dismissal of this action without prejudice is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Petitioner is a member of the Pueblo of Kewa (formerly known as the Pueblo of Santo Domingo) (\"Tribe\"), a federally recognized Indian Tribe in New Mexico. (ECF No. 14-1 at 3 (citing Fed. Reg. 83,34863 (July 23, 2018) ). Respondent Moquino is the current Tribal Governor/Tribal Court Judge of the Tribe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). In his Amended Petition, the Petitioner alleges that he was arrested on June 5, 2017 and taken into custody by Tribal Police. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Petitioner claims he was arraigned and sentenced in a single criminal proceeding held before the Santo Domingo Tribal Court of the Kewa Pueblo (\"Tribal Court\") on June 7, 2017 based on two separate case numbers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Although none of the referenced Exhibits are attached to the strike through Amended Petition filed on November 21, 2018 (ECF No. 14-1), the Court is aware from other filings in the case that the written Arraignment and Judgment for Case No. SDPMR-0617-05 reflects a plea of guilty by the Petitioner on June 7, 2017 to the crimes of Intoxication, Disorderly Conduct 2nd, Theft, and Breaking &amp; Entering. (ECF No. 10-2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 14-1 at 6). Based upon the Petitioner's guilty plea, the Tribal Court imposed a sentence upon him in Case No. SDPMR-0617-05 of a total jail term of 450 days, together with fines, court costs, and other fees or costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The written Arraignment and Judgment for Case No. SDPMR-0617-10 reflects a plea of guilty by the Petitioner on June 7, 2018 to the crimes of Assault (X7), Recklessly Endangering Another (X7), Terroristic Threats, Disorderly Conduct, Negligent Use of Deadly Weapon (X7), Negligent Use of Deadly Weapon, and Abuse of a Child (X5). (ECF No. 10-3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 14-1 at 6). Based upon the Petitioner's guilty plea, the Tribal Court imposed a sentence upon him in Case No. in Case No. SDPMR-0617-10 of a total jail term of 2,180 days, together with fines, court costs, and other fees and costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Physical custody of the Petitioner was transferred to the Chief Ignacio Justice Center in Towaoc, Colorado. (ECF No. 14-1 at 2). Respondent High Hawk is the Captain and/or Acting Warden of the Chief Ignacio Justice Center. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the original Petition filed with this Court on October 26, 2018, Petitioner had challenged \"his present physical confinement,\" arguing that his convictions from June 7, 2017 were not only invalid but also imposed in violation of the Indian Civil Rights Act (\"ICRA\"). (ECF No. 1 at 2). Petitioner sought, among other things, immediate release from physical custody. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16). On October 30, 2018, Magistrate Judge Gordon P. Gallagher directed Respondents to file a preliminary response to the original Petition that was limited to addressing the affirmative defense of exhaustion\n   of tribal remedies. (ECF No. 5). Respondents were provided with 21 days from the date of the Order in which to file their preliminary response. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Under the October 30, 2018 Order, Petitioner was allowed 21 days from the date of the filing of a preliminary response in which to file a reply and provide any information that might be relevant to his efforts to exhaust tribal remedies or factual basis to demonstrate that an exception to the tribal exhaustion doctrine is present. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 20, 2018 at approximately 12:20 p.m., Petitioner filed an Amended Petition. (ECF No. 10). However, Petitioner's filing of the Amended Petition did not comply with D.C.COLO.LCivR 15.1(a), since the pleading was not filed pursuant to a separate notice which attached the Amended Petition as a \"strike through\" document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Also on November 20, 2018, at approximately 5:10 p.m., counsel for Respondent Moquino filed his Preliminary Response to the original Petition. (ECF No. 12). In his response, Respondent Moquino indicates that Petitioner made no attempt to appeal his conviction in the Tribal Court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Respondent Moquino further indicates that in spite of the Petitioner's failure to exhaust his tribal remedies, on November 14, 2018, Respondent Moquino entered an Order Vacating the Conviction and Sentence of the Petitioner and ordered Petitioner's release from custody. (ECF Nos. 12 and 12-1). Respondent Moquino represents that Petitioner was released from custody on November 14, 2018, and that a certified copy of the Tribal Court Order was provided to counsel for Petitioner on November 16, 2018. (ECF No. 12 at 2). Respondent Moquino therefore contends that since Petitioner has received the relief to which he is entitled under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201303\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , his original Petition and the issue of exhaustion of tribal remedies is moot and therefore, this action must be dismissed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Respondent High Hawk filed his Preliminary Response to the original Petition on November 20, 2018 at approximately 10:18 p.m., indicating that he would not raise the affirmative defense of exhaustion of administrative remedies. (ECF No. 13). In a footnote, Respondent High Hawk indicates that he may no longer be a proper respondent in the action since the Petitioner is no longer in the custody of the Chief Ignacio Justice Center. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On November 21, 2018 at approximately 8:12 a.m., Petitioner filed his Amended Petition in compliance with this Court's Local Rules although, as noted, the strike through Amended Petition has none of the referenced exhibits attached. (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 14 and 14-1). In the Amended Petition, Petitioner acknowledges that he has been released from physical custody and that the Tribal Court has vacated Petitioner's convictions and sentences. (ECF No. 14-1 at 6-7). Petitioner claims, however, that no notice of the Tribal Court's Order was provided to him or his counsel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7). Petitioner alleges that on November 16, 2018 at approximately 11:00 p.m., he was brought before the Tribal Court and \"formally and punitively banished [ ] from the Tribal government for exercising his rights under the ICRA.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Under the Amended Petition, Petitioner seeks an Order from this Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   1. Finding that the convictions dated June 7, 2017, are invalid and in violation of the Indian Civil Rights Act;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   2. Finding the conviction and banishment on or about November 14, 2018 [sic] are invalid and in violation of the Indian Civil Rights Act, and;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   3. Issuing the Writ of Habeas Corpus directing Respondent Thomas Moquino to vacate the banishment imposed on Petitioner, and;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   4.

In the alternative, Order an expedited evidentiary hearing on the merits, and;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   6. Grant any other further relief that this Court deems just and proper.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (ECF No. 14-1 at 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Accordingly, this Court ordered a Preliminary Response with regard to Petitioner's original Petition concerning the issue of whether Petitioner exhausted his tribal remedies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dry v.

Therefore, the immediate physical custodian rule, by its terms, does not appear to apply because Petitioner \"challenges something other than his present physical confinement.\"\n   <em>\n    Padilla,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2527700\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/426/#p435\">\n    542 U.S. at 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2527700\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/426/#p435\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A habeas petitioner \"who challenges a form of 'custody' other than present physical confinement may name as respondent the entity or person who exercises legal control with respect to the challenged 'custody.' \"\n   <em>\n    Padilla,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2527700\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/426/#p435\">\n    542 U.S. at 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2527700\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/426/#p435\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Petitioner acknowledges that he must name as a respondent a tribal official who has both an interest in opposing the petition if it lacks merit, and the power to give the petitioner what he seeks if the petition has merit - namely his unconditional freedom.\" (ECF No. 14-1 at 3 (citing\n   <em>\n    Poodry,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"571815\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/85/874/#p879\">\n    85 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   899-900 ) ). Petitioner alleges that the appropriate tribal official in this regard is Respondent Moquino, who he contends would possess the authority to alter his convictions, sentences, and underlying tribal orders which would, among other things, encompass the issue of Petitioner's banishment from Tribal government. (ECF No. 14-1 at 3). The Amended Petition, however, fails to allege any facts or legal authority to demonstrate that Respondent Moquino or the Tribal Court are situated within the respective jurisdiction of the District of Colorado or are otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of this Court. Therefore, as the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (\"Tenth Circuit\") has cautioned, \"so as long as [Petitioner's] custodian is not located within the territorial jurisdiction\" of the District of Colorado, this Court \"does not have jurisdiction to grant him habeas corpus relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Palomarez,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=726%20Fed.%20Appx.%20724\">\n    726 Fed.Appx. at 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The bottom line in this case is that none of the events or omissions giving rise to the actions complained of in the Amended Petition occurred within the District of Colorado, Petitioner's liberties are not restrained in this District, and the Respondent who the Petitioner acknowledges has authority to provide him with the relief he seeks does not reside within this District. \"A court may\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   cure jurisdictional and venue defects by transferring a suit under the federal transfer statutes,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201406\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and 1631, when it is in the interest of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Trujillo v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3263114\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/465/1210/#p1222\">\n    465 F.3d 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1222 (10th Cir. 2006). The Tenth Circuit has \"interpreted the phrase 'if it is in the interest of justice' to grant the district court discretion in making a decision to transfer an action or instead to dismiss the action without prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3263114\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/465/1210/#p1222\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court declines to transfer this action to the District of New Mexico because transfer of the Amended Petition to the District of New Mexico would not solve the issue of personal jurisdiction. Petitioner has named two Respondents in this action who, for purposes of the habeas corpus claims he has raised, reside in two different states. The Tenth Circuit has recognized that a patent impediment exists with regard to transfer in situations where named defendants reside in different states because \"there [is] no single court to which the action could be transferred with any assurance that jurisdiction would [be] proper.\"\n   <em>\n    Shrader v. Biddinger,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091446\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/1235/#p1249\">\n    633 F.3d 1235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1249-50 (10th Cir. 2011). The reasoning concerning an impediment to transfer in the situation where defendants reside in different states as acknowledged by the Tenth Circuit is clearly applicable in this case. Further, although the Tenth Circuit has stated that transfer is a discretionary option to cure deficiencies related to personal jurisdiction, the appellate court has noted an absence of authority \"permitting, much less requiring, a district court to unilaterally split up an action\" to transfer a resulting component of the case to another jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091446\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/1235/#p1249\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091446\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/1235/#p1249\">\n    at 1249-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Conclusion and Orders.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Based on the foregoing analysis, and the record herein, the interests of justice and judicial economy are best served in this action by a dismissal without prejudice of the Amended Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court certifies pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) that any appeal from\n   this Order is not taken in good faith, and, therefore, in forma pauperis status will be denied for the purpose of appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coppedge v.
