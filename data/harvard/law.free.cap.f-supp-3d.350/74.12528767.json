Thompson, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendants Dannel Malloy, in his official capacity as Governor of Connecticut, Diana Wentzell, in her official capacity as Commissioner of Education, Kevin Lembo, in his official capacity as State Comptroller, Denise Nappier, in her official capacity as State Treasurer, and Denise W. Merrill, in her official capacity as Secretary of State, move to dismiss the plaintiffs' complaint. The defendants argue that the plaintiffs lack standing, that the plaintiffs' suit is barred by the Eleventh Amendment, and that the statutes at issue should be subject to rational basis scrutiny, which they survive. For the reasons set forth below, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Complaint is being granted, except as to Claim Six, but the defendants are hereby granted leave to file a supplemental motion to dismiss as to that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiffs allege that, for decades, Connecticut public schools have failed to provide a minimally adequate education to inner-city students. The plaintiffs allege that Connecticut compels thousands of schoolchildren to attend \"severely underperforming schools,\"\n   <em>\n    Compl.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30, citing data indicating that inner-city schools, in particular, perform far below state targets\n   for academic performance. The plaintiffs allege that their experiences at their respective schools \"exemplify [the] pervasive chronic failure\" reflected in the data. Compl. \u00b6 37. They refer to data on each school showing that each of their schools is underperforming.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiffs allege that in contrast to its inner-city schools, Connecticut's schools serving white and non-low-income student populations \"generally perform quite well academically.\" Compl. \u00b6 45. They further allege that the achievement gap is one of the worst in the country, with minority students falling several grades behind more affluent, white students. The achievement gap results in \"deeply lopsided\" graduation rates, students being poorly prepared for college, and much lower median incomes. Compl. \u00b6 47. The plaintiffs allege that the State knows that its underperforming public schools \"simply do not provide students with the necessary tools to succeed academically or to become productive members of society.\" Compl. \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As an alternative to traditional public schools, Connecticut maintains a system of magnet and charter schools, and operates a program that allows students to attend higher-performing traditional public schools in other districts on a space-available basis. The plaintiffs allege that magnet and charter schools and the school choice program allow students to attend higher-performing schools. Despite the existence of these options, the State of Connecticut \"has taken steps that prevent these poor and minority children from having viable publicschool alternatives.\" Compl. \u00b6 3. The plaintiffs allege that the status quo is a \" 'state-imposed' system of discrimination that deprives low-income and minority schoolchildren \"of the vital educational opportunities available to their more affluent and predominantly white peers.\" Compl. \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiffs allege that \"[t]he inexcusable educational inequity and inadequacy in Connecticut is, in substantial part, the result of state laws and policies.\" Compl. \u00b6 30. The plaintiffs challenge three specific state laws and policies in this lawsuit: (1) the moratorium on new magnet schools; (2) the \"dysfunctional\" state laws that govern public charter schools; and (3) the state's inter-district Open Choice enrollment program, which they define as the \"Anti-Opportunity Laws\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Magnet School Moratorium\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The plaintiffs allege that the most common type of magnet school is a \"full-time inter-district magnet school,\" which is \"a publicly funded school designed to promote racial, ethnic, and economic diversity that draws students from more than one school district and offers a special or high-quality curriculum.\" Compl. \u00b6 51. The plaintiffs allege that the State Department of Education completed a study that indicates that \"inter-district magnet schools are a superior alternative to its traditional district schools.\" Compl. \u00b6 55. Also, the plaintiffs allege that magnet schools serving predominantly low-income and minority student populations have had remarkable success in maintaining high student performance -- sometimes even higher than the state average. The plaintiffs allege that the State knows that \"inter-district magnet schools are a superior alternative to its traditional district schools that are failing to provide thousands of children with a minimally adequate education.\" Compl. \u00b6 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In this lawsuit, the plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of Public Act 09-6, a law passed in 2009, which imposed a moratorium \"prohibit[ing] the construction of new inter-district magnet schools,\" until the Connecticut Commissioner of Education \"assesses magnet schools' performance and develops a comprehensive statewide\n   magnet school plan.\" Compl. \u00b6 83. The plaintiffs allege that the Commissioner of Education has not yet submitted her plan, and that the moratorium remains in place. Compl. \u00b6 84. As a result, new magnet schools have not been able to open in this state. The plaintiffs allege that because magnet schools have a \"proven track record of success\" and seats at each school are in very high demand, the state's decision to impose a moratorium on the opening of new magnet schools \"intentionally impede[s] the availability of such superior alternatives [to traditional district schools] and [compels] students to attend failing traditional district schools that it knows are hurting low-income and minority school children.\" Compl. \u00b6 82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Charter School Funding Scheme\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The plaintiffs allege that a charter school is \"a public, nonsectarian school that is established under a charter, organized as a nonprofit entity, and operated independently of any local or regional board of education.\" Compl. \u00b6 62. The plaintiffs allege that, \"[f]or the 2015-16 school year, 85% of students enrolled in Connecticut charter schools were African-American or Hispanic and 70% were low-income.\" Compl. \u00b6 64. The plaintiffs allege that the State has recognized that \"city resident students\" who attend charter schools perform measurably better -- and achieve at or above proficiency -- in reading and mathematics than city resident students attending traditional public schools, and that the State \"knows that charter schools offer poor and minority students superior educational opportunities as compared to failing traditional district schools.\" Compl. \u00b6 65. The plaintiffs cite to studies demonstrating that students in charter schools often outperform students in traditional public schools in the same district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of the way charter schools are funded. The plaintiffs allege that Connecticut \"effectively caps the ability of charter school operators to open new schools and to maintain or expand existing schools in the State.\" Compl. \u00b6 88. The State \"effectively caps\" charter school funding by forcing them to \"depend on the shifting whims of the General Assembly to provide them with the support necessary to keep their doors open.\" Compl. \u00b6 88. Specifically, the plaintiffs allege that \"the General Assembly must decide whether or not to appropriate funding to charter schools,\" and some payment installments over the course of the school year are subject to adjustment or are only paid out if the State has sufficient funds. Compl. \u00b6 91. The plaintiffs further allege that even if a new charter school obtains a charter from the State Board of Education, it is uncertain whether the General Assembly will appropriate funds for the school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The plaintiffs allege that Connecticut's approach to funding charter schools disincentivizes charter school operators from trying to open new charter schools in the state. To illustrate this assertion, the plaintiffs allege that national charter school networks, such as the Knowledge is Power Program and Uncommon Ground, operate dozens of schools in surrounding states, but zero in Connecticut. As a result, \"Connecticut has far fewer charter schools per student than other states,\" and \"thousands of students are stuck on charter-school waitlists, trying to gain admission and escape the failing traditional schools they would otherwise be forced to attend.\" Compl. \u00b6 98. Although charter schools provide \"significant potential to help inner-city low-income and minority students ... close the achievement gap,\" the State's approach to funding the schools, the plaintiffs allege, in reality, \"actively prevents\n   [Connecticut] students from obtaining a meaningful education.\" Compl. \u00b6 99.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Open Choice Program Funding Scheme\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The plaintiffs allege that Connecticut's Open Choice program was created to \"(1) [i]mprove academic achievement; (2) reduce racial, ethnic and economic isolation or preserve racial and ethnic balance; and (3) provide a choice of educational programs.\" Compl. \u00b6 76. The program \"allow[s] students to attend traditional district schools in other districts on a space-available basis.\" The plaintiffs allege that access to high-quality public schools through the Open Choice program provides Connecticut schoolchildren an alternative to \"chronically failing traditional schools in the plaintiffs' districts.\" Compl. \u00b6 81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The plaintiffs claim that the way the Open Choice program is funded \"has built-in disincentives that effectively cap the number of students that recipient schools may accept.\" Compl. \u00b6 101. The plaintiffs allege that the Open Choice program is funded through the State's Education Cost Sharing grant formula, which determines how much a state will contribute to local school districts for all education expenditures on a per pupil basis. For the Open Choice program, however, the receiving districts are only permitted to count one-half of each Open Choice student when reporting to the State the number of pupils in their districts. The plaintiffs allege that this imposes an additional financial burden on school districts accepting Open Choice students, which \"causes far too few school districts to open up far too few seats for students in need.\" Compl. \u00b6 104. The plaintiffs allege that less than one percent of public school students in Connecticut participate in the Open Choice programs, and that the waitlists for students are \"staggering.\" Compl. \u00b6 107. Consequently, the State is \"knowingly leav[ing] thousands of Connecticut's most vulnerable students languishing in chronically-failing schools.\" Compl. \u00b6 109.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The plaintiffs in this case are Connecticut students and parents. Plaintiffs Jose Martinez, Jorr Morley, Alec Patterson, Nina Martinez, and Dylan Frances are students enrolled in low-performing traditional public schools in Bridgeport and Hartford. Plaintiffs Jessica Martinez, Dahlia Bryan, Leslie Rodriguez, and Frankie Frances are parents of the plaintiff-students. The plaintiffs allege that the plaintiff-parents have applied on behalf of their children to high-performing magnet and charter schools, but their children were denied admission because of lack of capacity. The plaintiffs allege that the plaintiff-parents will apply on the students' behalf for admission to high-performing magnet and charter high schools and/or apply for an inter-district transfer to higher-performing traditional public schools in the future, however, the challenged laws and policies \"are likely to prevent [the students] from gaining admission to any such schools.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff Curtis Morley was recently accepted into a high-performing public charter school, but alleges that the challenged laws and policies make it \"far more likely\" that the school \"will be unable to obtain funding for the upcoming school year and/or future school years.\" Compl. \u00b6 14. If and when that occurs, the plaintiffs allege, Curtis Morley will have no choice but to attend a low-performing traditional public school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

But the plaintiffs' injuries are fairly traceable to the Anti-Opportunity Laws because the plaintiffs allege that the State's decision to restrict enrollment in magnet, charter, and Open-Choice schools diminishes the plaintiffs' chances of escaping failing schools. Being in those failing schools is the direct cause of their injury, and the laws at issue deprive them of the opportunity to attend a school that is not failing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

To the contrary, the Court rejected the idea of a fundamental right to education, without parsing how effective or adequate the education might be, because such a right is not guaranteed in the Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10186\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/1/#p37\">\n    411 U.S. at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10186\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/1/#p37\">\n    93 S.Ct. 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, the language relied on by the plaintiffs appears in the following context:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   Whatever merit appellees' argument might have if a State's financing system occasioned an absolute denial of educational opportunities to any of its children, that argument provides no basis for finding an interference with fundamental rights where only relative differences in spending levels are involved and where--as is true in the present case--no charge fairly could be made that the system fails to provide each child with an opportunity to acquire the basic minimal skills necessary for the enjoyment of the rights of speech and of full participation in the political process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10186\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/1/#p37\">\n    411 U.S. at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10186\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/1/#p37\">\n    93 S.Ct. 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Because there is no fundamental right to a minimally adequate education under the Equal Protection Clause or the Due Process Clause, Claim Two and Claim Four are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Claim Three: Rational Basis Scrutiny Applies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In Claim Three, the plaintiffs claim that the Anti-Opportunity Laws violate their equality interest as protected by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiffs contend that the heightened scrutiny standard applied by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Plyler v. Doe\n   </em>\n   applies here because the Anti-Opportunity Laws present unreasonable obstacles to advancement on the basis of merit.\n   <em>\n    Plyer\n   </em>\n   's heightened scrutiny standard does not apply in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The plaintiffs claim that the Anti-Opportunity Laws trigger heightened scrutiny because, irrespective of whether education is a fundamental right, they deprive certain students of an equal opportunity to access the quality education available to other students in the State. The Anti-Opportunity Laws \"treat students in failing traditional public schools ... far worse than students who are fortunate enough to attend satisfactory or superior traditional public schools.\" Pls.' Mem., at 26. Students in failing traditional public schools rely on educational alternatives for an adequate education; therefore, the plaintiffs argue, only those students are harmed by the Anti-Opportunity Laws that restrict the public alternatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The plaintiffs argue that under\n   <em>\n    Plyler\n   </em>\n   , \"any law impairing a child's ability to receive an equal or adequate educational opportunity\" is subject to heightened scrutiny if the burdens fall on poor students who cannot control where they live. The Court's rationale for using intermediate scrutiny in\n   <em>\n    Plyler\n   </em>\n   does not apply here. In\n   <em>\n    Plyler\n   </em>\n   , the State of Texas deliberately targeted and discriminated against an entire class of individuals, namely, children of undocumented immigrants, by prohibiting\n   every such child from attending the State's public schools. The Court stated that \"legislation directing the onus of a parent's misconduct against his children does not comport with fundamental conceptions of justice.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187607\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/202/#p221\">\n    457 U.S. at 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187607\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/202/#p221\">\n    102 S.Ct. 2382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Given the importance of public education, the State's complete deprivation of all educational opportunities, and the equal protection concerns raised by the State's deliberate discrimination against an entire class of children, the Court determined that intermediate scrutiny was appropriate in the unique circumstances of that case. The Supreme Court and the Second Circuit have both found that\n   <em>\n    Plyer\n   </em>\n   cannot be extended \"beyond the \"unique circumstances that provoked its unique confluence of theories and rationales.\"\n   <em>\n    Kadrmas v.
