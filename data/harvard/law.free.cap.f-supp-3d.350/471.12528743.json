BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This action arises out of several text and Facebook messages about Plaintiff Ken Spirito (\"Plaintiff\") that were exchanged among the PAC Defendants, reported to the Virginia Department of Transportation (\"VDOT\"), and published by the Daily Press. Defendants Ortiz, Ford, and Thomas are or were employed in various capacities by the PAC. Doc. 1 at 3-4. Defendant Scott is a Board Member of the PAC and is a member of the City Council of the City of Newport News.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Plaintiff is an airport management professional who was Executive Director of the PAC from 2009 until he was terminated following the events at issue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2014, the PAC Board of Commissioners voted to approve a contractual arrangement with People Express Airlines and voted to guarantee a loan to People Express \"in an effort to facilitate its operation at the airport.\" Doc. 1 at 6. People Express \"operated briefly, but quickly failed and defaulted on the loan.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In 2017, VDOT initiated an investigation of the events.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff alleges he was targeted as being responsible for the loan's failure, and as \"the targeting of Plaintiff became widely known, certain disgruntled PAC employees began a digital whispering campaign of unfounded innuendo that Plaintiff was shredding documentary evidence relevant to the People Express investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   There was no written policy pertaining to shredding, but Plaintiff alleges there was an \"unwritten policy\" that sensitive documents should be shredded.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. During his tenure as Executive Director, Plaintiff had personally shredded documents regularly and openly, approximately one to two times per week on average for approximately eight years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. On March 2, 2017, Plaintiff shredded hard copies of some \"old, duplicate airline presentations as part of his routine duties.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. That same day, the following text message exchange occurred between Defendant Ortiz and Defendant Ford:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Ortiz: \"Wow Ken is shredding shredding shredding.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Ford: \"Unbelievable\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Ortiz: \"Seems kinda weird\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Ford: \"This is getting out of hand!\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. On or about March 2, 2017, Defendant Ford notified Commissioners Steve Mallon and Rob Coleman that she had received the messages and conveyed the contents of the messages about shredding to them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Coleman, allegedly acting in his capacity as a Commissioner and as an agent of the PAC, made a report of the shredding allegation to the State Police.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The contents of his statement to the police are unknown.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On April 12, 2017, after being terminated for cause, Defendant Thomas sent the following message to Defendant Scott: \"I told you I know about that I know about the paper shredding a couple of weeks ago. I saw Jessica and Ken coming from the shredder when I walked in the office after 8pm. Then I was let go about two weeks later...\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. On an earlier, unknown date, Defendant Thomas wrote the following text message to Defendant Scott: \"I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   know about the paper shredding at the airport! ...\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Plaintiff further alleges that the PAC Defendants \"acted in whole or in part out of ill-will and malice toward Plaintiff in publishing the implied allegations of improper shredding of documents, despite their knowledge that these implied allegations were false, or, at a minimum, their high degree of certainty that they were false.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The above messages \"were further published and transmitted to others, ultimately finding their way into the VDOT Report relating to the People Express investigation and to the front page of the Daily Press,\" a Virginia newspaper.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Under the heading \"The Defamatory Statements,\" Plaintiff alleges that DP published three separate defamatory editions. First, in its June 2, 2017, online edition, DP ran a story that included the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   They [VDOT] reported that they had received two separate reports that former executive director Ken Spirito had shredded and destroyed documents after the auditors asked for airport records. They said they were also given information that Spirito had removed records from the airport.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Doc. 1 at 16. Plaintiff further alleges that the front-page graphic of the June 2, 2017, print version of the Daily Press featured the text exchanges about shredding discussed above.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Next, Plaintiff alleges that the front page of the June 3, 2017, edition of the Daily Press included a \"large graphic covering approximately two-thirds of the front page showing an image of evidentiary material overlaid with pictures\" of the above messages about shredding by Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. The accompanying story in the June 3 edition was about Plaintiff's involvement in the People Express Contract and loan to People Express.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Specifically, this article included the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The [VDOT] auditors blasted the commission's lack of transparency about the deal, and reported that they had received two separate reports that former airport executive director Ken Spirito had shredded and destroyed documents after they asked for records about the payment. They also received reports that he had removed documents from the airport.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff alleges that a June 3, 2017, editorial in the Daily Press made the following statements: \"This goes beyond losing jobs. The next question, in light of this audit, becomes whether Spirito or anyone else needs to be brought up on charges. Whether anyone needs to go to prison. Yes, it's that serious.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff alleges defamation\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   (Count I) and, in the alternative, defamation (Count II) against all defendants. He alleges that the above messages are \"defamatory statements by implication about the 'shredding' of evidence related to a VDOT investigation of the People Express operation at the Peninsula Airport.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On January 17, 2018, Plaintiff filed a defamation action in state court against the PAC Defendants based on the same facts at issue in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ken Spirito v. Peninsula Airport Commission Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport, Lisa M. Ortiz, E. Renee Ford, Wilmer K.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas, Jr. and Sharon P. Scott\n   </em>\n   , Case No. CL 18-103; Doc. 9 at 1. After a hearing on April 13, 2018, the state court sustained the PAC Defendants' demurrer and gave Plaintiff leave to amend his Complaint. Doc. 14-1 at 88-89. On April 27, 2018, the state court entered a Nonsuit Order, Doc. 9-1 at 280, and on May 23, 2018, Plaintiff filed the present action against the PAC Defendants and Daily Press. Doc. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On June 19, 2018, the PAC Defendants filed their Motions to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim and joint Memorandum in Support. Docs. 3-8. On the same day, the PAC Defendants filed a Motion for the Court to Take Judicial Notice of Plaintiff's lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Williamsburg/James City County, and a Motion to Sever their claims from those brought against Daily Press, Doc. 11. On July 3, 2018, the PAC Defendants filed another Motion for the Court to Take Judicial Notice of the April 13, 2018, Demurrer Hearing before the Circuit Court of Williamsburg/James City County. Doc. 14. Plaintiff filed his Opposition to these Motions on July 3, 2018. Doc. 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On August 10, 2018, Daily Press filed a Motion to Dismiss, Doc. 23, and a Motion to Sever its claims from those brought against the PAC Defendants, Doc. 25. Plaintiff filed his Opposition to these Motions on August 24, 2018, Docs. 31-32, and DP filed its Replies on August 30, 2018, Docs. 33-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    II. THE PAC DEFENDANTS' MOTIONS FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Federal Rule of Evidence 201 provides that a court may judicially notice a fact \"that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it ... can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\" Fed. R. Evid. 201. Pursuant to this rule, \"a federal court may consider matters of public record such as documents from prior state court proceedings in conjunction with a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.\"\n   <em>\n    Walker v. Kelly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3499877\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/589/127/#p139\">\n    589 F.3d 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 139 (4th Cir. 2009), A court \"must\" take judicial notice when a party requests it, and the court is supplied \"with the necessary information.\" Fed. R. Evid. 201. However, this mandate applies only to \"adjudicative facts,\" which are defined as \"the facts of the particular case\"; no evidentiary rule deals with judicial notice of other information. Fed. R. Evid. 201 advisory committee notes to 1972 Proposed Rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The PAC Defendants have moved the Court to take judicial notice of the entire case file for the state action Plaintiff filed against them on January 18, 2018, in the Circuit Court of Williamsburg/James City County.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ken Spirito v. Peninsula Airport Commission Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport, Lisa M. Ortiz, E. Renee Ford, Wilmer K. Thomas, Jr. and Sharon P. Scott\n   </em>\n   , No. CL 18-103 (Va. Cir. Ct. Jan. 18, 2018); Doc. 9 at 1. They have also filed a motion for this Court to take judicial notice of the April 13, 2018, demurrer hearing in which the state court judge sustained the PAC Defendants' demurrer and granted Plaintiff leave to amend his complaint. Doc. 14-1 at 88-89. In total, the PAC Defendants move this Court to notice four hundred and one (401) pages of documents from Plaintiff's state action. Because \"Virginia law governs this action.\" they argue \"it is entirely appropriate to take judicial notice of a state court's ruling on virtually the same allegations.\" Doc. 21 at 1. They further urge that \"[i]n light of the need for comity between the state and federal judicial systems, judicial notice is especially appropriate\" in this\n   instance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3499877\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/589/127/#p139\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff stipulates that this case \"as pertaining to the PAC defendants was refiled from an earlier state court proceeding,\" but argues that the materials offered by the PAC Defendants \"do not constitute 'adjudicative facts' under the terms of Rule 201, are irrelevant, and contain numerous items of information that may be inadmissible in this matter on any number of grounds.\" Doc. 16 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Neither party offers binding authority on how the Court should dispose of this issue. Of course, the state court action is a matter of public record and may therefore be considered on a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moore v. Flagstar Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"535573\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/6/496/#p500\">\n    6 F.Supp.2d 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 500 (E.D. Va. 1997). However, the Court is not constrained by the mandate of Rule 201, since the record contains numerous legal arguments and conclusions which need not be considered \"adjudicative facts\" in the present case.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat. Res. Def. Council v. Sw. Marine, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11631124\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/39/1235/\">\n    39 F.Supp.2d 1235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1237 n.1 (S.D.

R. Evid. 201 is not a bar.\"). Defendants' argument for comity is also inapposite, as the state court action is no longer pending.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nautilus Ins. Co. v. Winchester Homes, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1527463\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/15/371/#p377\">\n    15 F.3d 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 377 (4th Cir. 1994) (citing the \"long-standing rule\" that a federal court should \"ordinarily decline, for reasons of efficiency and comity, to grant declaratory relief where\n   <em>\n    another suit is pending in a state court\n   </em>\n   presenting the same issues, not governed by federal law, between the same parties.\") (emphasis added and internal quotations omitted). Finally, the state court proceedings are of limited relevance to the instant matter because the complaints in the two actions, while substantially similar, are not identical, and the state court granted Plaintiff leave to amend.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Doc. 9-1 at 3-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Given the above considerations, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the PAC Defendants' Motions for Judicial Notice, Docs. 9 and 14,\n   <strong>\n    IN PART.\n   </strong>\n   The Court will take judicial notice of the state court record for the limited purpose of demonstrating the existence of those proceedings.

If a factual statement, given its verbal and practical context, can only lead to one defamatory conclusion, such an implication is actionable. Here, the PAC Defendants published statements about Plaintiff's shredding to superiors and to VDOT officials during a VDOT investigation. Given Plaintiff's contention that he regularly shredded documents, the ongoing investigation, and the alleged \"whisper campaign\" against Plaintiff, the PAC Defendants' comments about one particular instance of shredding give rise to the unmistakable conclusion that Plaintiff was shredding documents material to the investigation. As Plaintiff has argued, his coworkers would not have commented on innocent conduct but for their desire to imply that it was improper. Such an implication is sufficiently destructive to Plaintiffs professional and personal reputation to constitute defamation. Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Pendleton\n   </em>\n   , the alleged comments were not targeted at any other individual, nor could they reasonably imply that Plaintiff's actions were blameless.

For example, Page 43 of the report, under the heading \"Shredding\" states: \"There were two separate accounts in which the Executive Director [Plaintiff] was observed destroying documents within the PAC office.\" Doc. 24 at Ex. 1 (hereinafter \"VDOT Report\"), p. 43. Page 45 of the report states \"During our review, we were also provided information that the Executive Director was observed removing records from the airport.\" VDOT Report at 45. Page two (2) of the report states \"PAC administrative staff, including the Executive Director [Plaintiff], did not always provide complete, open, and timely disclosure of key and/or material interests to the Commission.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Under the heading \"Obstacles that Delayed or Limited Our Review,\" the report lists \"PAC documents and records that may have been destroyed and not retained.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. Finally, under\n   the heading \"Record Retention Policies and Procedures,\" the report states: \"Our comparison of the Executive Director's [Plaintiffs] email that was provided to us as being 'everything' to what we were provided from other outside sources indicated that many of the emails that should have been located in the Executive Director's email were no longer there.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43. Although the VDOT Report does not explicitly state that Plaintiff impeded its investigation by,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , shredding material information, it suggests that he did; the report would likely not have mentioned Plaintiff's shredding unless it was relevant to the investigation. The DP articles at issue contain this same inference. Accordingly, DP appears to have reported the content of the VDOT Report in a substantially accurate manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Nor does the juxtaposition with images - again, taken directly from the VDOT Report - significantly change the implication that is already contained in the report. Plaintiff urges that overlaying the images of the text messages and random pages from the report (handwritten notes, an email, and a letter on Commonwealth letterhead) creates a defamatory inference that Plaintiff was shredding evidence material to the VDOT investigation. While Virginia law recognizes defamation by implication,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pendleton v.

It argues: \"if a newspaper could not report on the contents of a publicly available governmental report highlighting issues of public concern involving actions of a governmental agency, Peninsula Airport Commission, and its commissioners and executive director, then the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of the press would be eviscerated and the fair report Privilege would have no function.\" Doc. 33 at 2. It is true that, \"[a]lthough Virginia's common law of libel governs this diversity case, the First Amendment's press and speech clauses greatly restrict the common law where the defendant is a member of the press, the plaintiff is a public figure, or the subject matter of the supposed libel touches on a matter of public concern\"\n   <em>\n    Chapin v.

Government documents serve as the basic data of governmental operations ... In return for frequent and timely reports on governmental activity, defamation law has traditionally stopped short of imposing extensive investigatory requirements on a news organization reporting on a governmental activity or document. Inevitably, this reduces the chances that a news organization could actually know that a government report contained false charges or could maintain serious doubts about them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <em>\n    Reuber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1789389\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/925/703/#p714\">\n    925 F.2d at 712-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, DP did not violate the fair report privilege by relying on the representations contained in the VDOT Report, even if that report contained suggestions that were untrue. The policy underlying the fair report privilege advises that DP is entitled to dismissal before it incurs further litigation costs, lest similar defamation claims have a chilling effect on government reporting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   While most cases analyzing the fair report privilege contemplate later stages of litigation, a Court may apply the privilege as a matter of law when \"the facts are not in dispute and reasonable people could not differ [as to] whether or not the publication constitutes a substantial departure from the public record ....\"\n   <em>\n    Rush v.
