(Shingobee) brings a breach-of-contract suit against North Segment Alliance (NSA).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1, pp. 1, 4-7. NSA is a non-profit corporation chartered under tribal law by the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation (MHA Nation), a federally recognized Indian tribe.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 10-2, p. 2. Shingobee's contract claims stem from its work on the construction of an apartment complex in New Town, North Dakota,\n   located within the boundaries of the Fort Indian Berthold Reservation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1, p. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 31, 2015, Shingobee signed a Guaranteed Maximum Price contract with NSA's predecessor in interest\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to construct a \"30 unit apartment building and ... student housing\" known as the Red Hawk Estates Project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1, p. 2; Docket No. 9, p. 9; Docket No. 10-3, p. 2 (capitalization altered).

Shingobee describes that, thereafter, the parties twice amended the contract, each time enlarging the scope of work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1, pp. 1-3. Shingobee asserts that it has not received payment for work it performed pursuant to the contract amendments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1, p. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As the party invoking federal jurisdiction, Shingobee asserts in its complaint that the Court has subject matter jurisdiction because \"the action involves citizens of different states and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket.

It is not necessary to resolve those arguments because they mirror NSA's 12(b)(1) arguments and their analysis would be duplicative.

The Court considers undisputed facts in the record, which are the same facts the Court would consider under a 12(b)(6) motion, and Shingobee receives the same protections as it would as the non-moving party in a 12(b)(6) motion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    NSA does not have to succeed on both arguments.
