PERRY, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This Order considers defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiffs' first amended complaint and defendants' motion for determination of foreign law, along with certain other procedural motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In their motion to dismiss, defendants assert that dismissal is required for several reasons. They argue that principles of international comity require abstention, that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over the non-Missouri defendants, and that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. In their motion for determination of foreign law, defendants ask me to rule that the law of Peru applies to all aspects of this case. Plaintiffs respond by arguing for the application of Missouri law. Additionally pending are a motion to substitute parties to replace the defendant Trusts with the trustees and beneficiaries of each Trust, and a motion to consolidate three additional cases with these consolidated cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over the newly-added individual and Trust defendants, although the Court continues to have jurisdiction over previously-named defendants Ira Rennert and Renco. I conclude that plaintiffs' negligence-based claims survive the motion to dismiss, whether considered under Missouri, New York, or Peruvian law, but their claims of strict liability and civil conspiracy fail to state a claim on which relief may be granted. I conclude that the law of Missouri should apply to this case. Finally, I conclude that abstention based on international comity is not appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs are hundreds of Peruvian children (many of whom have attained majority in the many years these cases have been pending) who live near the La Oroya Complex, a metallurgical smelting and refining complex owned and operated by the defendant companies and their Peruvian subsidiary. The individual defendants are directors and/or officers of the defendant companies. The defendant Trusts were established by defendant Ira Rennert for the benefit of himself and his family and together own the defendant companies. Plaintiffs allege that defendants, acting from Missouri and New York, ran the operations of the La Oroya Complex in a manner that resulted in plaintiffs' exposure to lead and other toxic substances, which caused plaintiffs' serious medical and developmental injuries. They bring a variety of state-law tort claims against the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Operative Complaint\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs originally brought their seven-count complaint in this action against four corporate defendants: Doe Run Resources Corporation (\"Doe Run Resources\"), DR Acquisition Corp. (\"DR Acquisition\"), The Renco Group, Inc. (\"Renco\"), and Renco Holdings, Inc.; and six individual defendants: Marvin K. Kaiser, Albert Bruce Neil, Jeffery L. Zelms, Theodore P. Fox III, Daniel L. Vornberg, and Ira L. Rennert. With leave of Court, and upon stipulation of the parties, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in February 2017, naming fifteen additional defendants, specifically, Doe Run Cayman Holdings LLC (\"Cayman Holdings\"); individual defendants Roger L. Fay, Marvin M. Koenig,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   John A. Siegel Jr., Dennis A. Sadlowski,\n   John A. Binko, and Michael C. Ryan; and several Ira Rennert Trusts (\"the Trusts\"). Originally-named defendants Renco Holdings and Daniel L.

Personal Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As noted above, the amended complaint added as defendants eight trusts established by Ira Rennert for the benefit of himself and his family; six individuals who are described as officers and directors of various of the originally-named company defendants; and one additional company, Doe Run Cayman Holdings LLC. Originally-named defendants Ira Rennert and Renco challenge personal jurisdiction, as do all newly-added defendants other than Cayman Holdings, which is a Missouri limited liability company. I conclude that this Court cannot assert personal jurisdiction over the Trusts and the newly-added individual defendants, and so I will dismiss the case against them without prejudice. I conclude that Rennert and Renco are properly subject to personal jurisdiction in this district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   To survive a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, a plaintiff is only required to make a prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction, that is, plaintiff must allege facts sufficient to support a \"reasonable inference that the defendants can be subjected to jurisdiction within the state.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    K-V Pharm.

For a Missouri court to exercise specific jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant, two requirements must be met: 1) jurisdiction must be allowed by the Missouri long-arm statute; and 2) the reach of the long-arm statute must comport with due process.\n   <em>\n    Viasystems, Inc. v.

Missouri's long-arm statute authorizes,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , personal jurisdiction over defendants who transact business or commit a tort within the state.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20506.500.1\">\n    Mo.

The Trusts and the Newly-Added Individual Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Trusts were established under New York law and are alleged to together own 100% of Renco stock. Renco lost its corporate status from December 31, 2003 to August 10, 2004. The amended complaint alleges that the Trusts, along with other shareholders, officers, and directors of Renco are personally liable for the torts\n   committed by Renco during the time of the dissolution. ECF 474 \u00b6 110. It also alleges that certain of the officers and directors participated in the tortious activity, including acts that caused the delay of necessary environmental improvements at the La Oroya Complex.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   ECF 474 \u00b6 123, 124, 138-140.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that under New York law they may look to the owners and officers of the dissolved corporation for damages attributable to the dissolved corporate defendant's acts during that time.

Plaintiffs' argument based on this theory fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiffs' amended complaint makes very few allegations about the Trusts. It names them in the paragraphs introducing the defendants. ECF 474 \u00b6 12, 13, 14. It adds them to a few paragraphs that make allegations about Rennert (ECF 474 \u00b6 78, 83, 84, 235) but provides no specific allegations about their actions. The amended complaint makes numerous allegations against \"defendants\" generally, and plaintiffs' brief opposing the motion to dismiss does the same. To the extent those allegations can be construed to include the Trusts, they are too vague to establish personal jurisdiction in Missouri. Merely alleging that a party is a shareholder, even a 100% shareholder, without more does not establish personal jurisdiction over the shareholder.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lakota Girl Scout Council, Inc. v.

Plaintiffs have not shown that this Court can exercise personal jurisdiction over these New York Trusts,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and I will grant the motion to dismiss as to the Trusts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The newly-added individual defendants worked for Renco and various of the other corporate defendants, including some of those with their principal places of business in Missouri.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition to being Renco officers, several of them are alleged to have held special powers of attorney to act in Peru for Renco and the other corporate defendants, including some of the Missouri corporate defendants. Unlike most of the individual defendants named in the original complaint, none of these defendants ever worked in Missouri or entered into any contracts in Missouri. Although none dispute being officers of Renco, some were never directors of Renco or the other corporations, and the two who were directors (Fay and Sadlowski) attested that they were never \"dominant or controlling\" directors. ECF 757-1. Plaintiffs have not presented any evidence that these defendants have had sufficient contacts with Missouri to allow the exercise of personal jurisdiction here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that the Trusts and the newly-added individual defendants\n   waived any objection to personal jurisdiction in Missouri. Between the date the amended complaint was deemed filed, February 21, 2017, and the filing of the motion to dismiss on May 12, 2017, attorneys entered their appearances for all the newly-added defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those lawyers participated in a status conference, joined in filing a status report, and agreed to certain requested extensions of time. In the time the motion has been pending, the newly-added defendants have participated in discovery and in the regular scheduling conferences with the Court. I do not agree with plaintiffs that those actions constituted a waiver of the new defendants' right to challenge personal jurisdiction. Indeed, given all the other things going on in this case, it was entirely reasonable for the new lawyers to take the actions that they did before filing the anticipated motion to dismiss. And their actions taken after the motion was filed are consistent with my directives that discovery proceed without delay and without regard to any pending motions. These newly-added defendants did not waive their right to challenge personal jurisdiction. I will grant the motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction as to defendants Roger L.

Defendants urge that under this doctrine the Court must use the law of Peru. Non-parties Doe Run Peru and Doe Run Mining are Peruvian companies, but under the facts of this case the Court would have to look at the law of Missouri and New York as well, because Cayman Holdings and DR Acquisition were established under Missouri law and Doe Run Resources and Renco were incorporated under New York law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Defendants cite to cases supporting their premise that veil piercing requires \"a court to examine the internal structure and administration of a corporation and its parents or affiliates[.]\" ECF 843 at p. 16.

Instead of having an expressed doctrine as recognized by common law courts, Peruvian law has a form of indirect liability derived from misfeasance. As explained by plaintiffs' expert, a Peruvian lawyer and law professor, the lack of a codified positive legal rule does not preclude derived liability from fraudulent misfeasance under Article 96 of the Civil Code because entities that are organized via \"legal fraud\" violate the public order, thereby allowing for dissolution of the entity similar to veil piercing.

An example of this can occur when fraudulent (unlawful) conduct materializes by harming creditors' economic expectations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When applied in the context of Doe Run, this is the sort of activity at the heart of plaintiffs' claims - the La Oroya Complex was an undercapitalized corporate entity directly controlled by defendants, and the undercapitalization resulted in plaintiffs' harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Plaintiffs also plead theories of agency as a basis for liability. A principal-agent relationship between two corporate entities is established when there is such domination and control \"that the controlled corporation has no separate mind, will or existence of its own and is but a business conduit for its principal.\"\n   <em>\n    Blackwell Printing Co. v.

The following elements show an agency relationship: the agent has the power to alter legal relations, the agent is a fiduciary within the scope of matters entrusted to it, and a principal has a right to control the conduct of the agent.\n   <em>\n    Blanks v.

Plaintiffs have pled facts to establish an inference of authority; therefore, defendants' argument for a lack of agency relationship fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Plaintiffs' allegations also state a basis for liability under Article 1981 of the Peruvian Civil Code. When a subordinate relationship exists - meaning when the subordinate acts on behalf of the parent - and results in damage, then the parent may be liable for the acts of the subordinate. ECF 871-121, Espinoza Report at \u00b6 5.24. This type of relationship is a low\n   bar, only requiring a \"causal relationship\" between the parties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.25. Thus, if it is possible to exercise power over a party, then a subordinate relationship is present because of the mere existence of the relationship and the exercise of control. The relationship between defendants and Doe Run Peru qualifies as a \"subordinate\" relationship because Doe Run Peru acted on behalf of its owners. Liability is established when there is the mere existence of a relationship between the principal and agent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.26.

ECF 871-121, Espinoza Report at \u00b6 5.52. Defendants were directly or indirectly responsible for the La Oroya Complex and the alleged discharge of pollutants. Article 1985 is analogous to both direct cause and proximate cause, two essential elements for a claim of negligence. To establish a claim under Article 1985, the harm must be directly attributed to the defendants' conduct and \"probability judgment.\" This judgment is measured by what a person of normal mentality (similar to a reasonable person) could have foreseen because of his or her actions when assessed in the abstract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.60.

Additionally, Articles 142.1 and 142.2 of the General Environmental Law create a right of action against anyone that causes damage to the environment or human health, specifically defining environmental damage as \"any material impairment suffered by the environment... that may be caused through the breach of legal provisions and which results in actual or negative potential effects.\" ECF 871-121, Espinoza Report at \u00b6 5.46.

Those factors are: (a) existence of a high degree of risk of some harm to the person, land, or chattels of others; (b) likelihood that the harm that results from it will be great; (c) inability to eliminate the risk by the exercise of reasonable care; (d) extent to which the activity is not a matter of common usage; (e) inappropriateness of the activity to the place where it is carried on; and (f) extent to which its value to the community is outweighed by its dangerous attributes. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 520 (1977).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Plaintiffs simply allege that the \"ownership, operation, maintenance, management, handling, processing and use of metals and gases and other toxic substances\" at the La Oroya Complex \"constitute an abnormally dangerous activity or ultra-hazardous activity, because such activities create a high risk of significant harm.\" ECF 474 \u00b6 144, 151. They have thus alleged only one of the factors listed under the Restatement - the high risk of harm. They do not attempt to allege that the risk cannot be eliminated through the exercise of reasonable care or that lead mining is not a common activity, or any of the other Restatement factors. In their brief they argue that \"routine maintenance\" would not have eliminated the risk (ECF 640 at p. 169), but this is not the test. Even if \"routine\" maintenance would not eliminate the risk, this cannot be a strict liability claim if \"reasonable care\" would have done so. Indeed, in the same paragraph of their brief, plaintiffs go on to argue that defendants\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have lessened the risk had they \"implement[ed] suitable technologies and processes to prevent the pollution and contamination.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4133283\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/971/896/#p916\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This is a negligence allegation, not an allegation that the activity is so unusual and so unreasonably dangerous that its hazards cannot be eliminated through the exercise of reasonable care.

These counts allege that the defendants' breach of these duties of care caused the plaintiffs' injuries from toxic emissions. Counts VIII, IX, and XII allege that defendants are directly liable for their actions and those of their agents. Counts X and XI appear to allege derivative liability arising from various express contractual undertakings (Count X) or from financial agreements among the corporate entities (Count XI). All counts list various environmental, financial and management activities that they allege defendants negligently performed or failed to perform, and all counts make allegations related to underfunding the Complex or avoiding costs of environmental improvements.

Under Articles 1314 and 1327, there exists a similar cause of action to breach of assumed duties. Article 1314 states: \"Anyone who acts with the required ordinary diligence is not liable for a failure to meet an obligation, or its partial, late or defective completion.\" ECF 871-121, Espinoza Report \u00b6 5.82. Article 1327 provides that there will be no compensation available if an alleged tortfeasor used \"ordinary diligence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.83. Ordinary diligence is analogous to a reasonable care standard because in assuming the duty to act, a party must do so \"with the act of protecting an obligation,\" which requires an assessment of attention and caution to a set of characteristics.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.84-5.85. Assuming the duty requires acting with reasonable care under the circumstances. Articles 1969, 1981, and 1983 impose extra-contractual liability on individuals and corporations, and when combined with Article 1314, the same liability can apply to third parties when individuals or corporations assume a duty via contract. ECF 871-121, Espinoza Report at \u00b6 5.86. Moreover, Article 1457 allows for extra-contractual liability claims to proceed in conjunction with Articles 1969, 1981 or 1983 because Article 1457 provides an action for negligence in fulfilling the duty if a task for the benefit of a third person occurs in a contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.88-5.90.

Although punitive damages do not appear to be applied in the same manner in Peru as they are applied in the United States (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , as a separate submission of damages), Peru does recognize that damages can be imposed as a \"form of private punishment.\" ECF 871-121, Espinoza Report at \u00b6 5.93.

Thus, damages are not solely based on compensation.

For each of the claims that are plausible under Missouri law, a comparable form of relief exists under Peruvian law. Although Peruvian law may not identify the claims at issue by the same doctrinal name and litigation procedure is obviously different, this does not mean that the same substantive relief cannot exist under analogous legal provisions of both countries' laws. Given the similarity, making a further choice-of-law analysis is unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Defendants have failed to prove a true conflict exists between Missouri and Peruvian law.

There is no doubt that the injuries occurred in Peru, but that does not mean that defendants are correct in arguing that the\n   <em>\n    conduct\n   </em>\n   giving rise to injury occurred in Peru.

To the extent that defendants argue that the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement shows that Peruvian sovereignty would be affected by this case going forward, they are wrong. Chapter 18.4, paragraph four of that agreement recognizes that suits like this could go forward in the United States, as it provides that each party (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the United States and Peru) must provide remedies \"for violations of a legal duty under that\n   <em>\n    Party's law\n   </em>\n   relating to the environment or environmental conditions affecting human health, which may include rights such as: to sue another person under\n   <em>\n    that Party's jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   for damages under\n   <em>\n    that Party's laws\n   </em>\n   .\" ECF 545-10 at p. 4 (emphasis added). \"The interpretation of a treaty, like the interpretation of a statute, begins with its text.\"\n   <em>\n    Medellin v.

Although there is no doubt that plaintiffs suffered the consequences in Peru, an American court is in the best position to consider the American conduct of American defendants. While defendants have consistently argued that this case is not about their conduct in the United States, plaintiffs have alleged that it is, and, as set out above, they have stated valid claims under Missouri and New York law, based on defendants' alleged actions here in the United States. The lack of any parallel proceeding in Peru, and the Peruvian courts' likely inability to hold these same defendants responsible for their conduct, is also significant in maintaining the case in Missouri.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Having considered the sovereign interests and balanced the applicable Restatement factors, I conclude that abstention on the basis of international comity is not supported in this case.
