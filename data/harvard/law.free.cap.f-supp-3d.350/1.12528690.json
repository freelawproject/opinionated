General familiarity by the reader is presumed, although specific facts necessary to resolve the motion at hand will be recited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The initial complaint (# 1) in this case was filed on July 27, 2016; the first amended complaint was filed over two months later on October 11, 2016. (# 24.) In March 2017, this court issued a Report and Recommendation (R &amp; R) (# 43) recommending\n   that the motion to dismiss the amended complaint filed by Boston Housing Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Trial Court (BHC) be allowed in its entirety. Chief Judge Saris endorsed that R &amp; R as follows: \"After a review of the objections, I adopt the report and recommendation and dismiss the claims with prejudice except the Title VII claim in count II which will be dismissed unless plaintiff, who is pro se, amends it to meet the deficiencies outlined by the magistrate judge within 30 days.\" (# 50.) On June 13, 2017, plaintiff Hector M. Jenkins filed a second amended complaint (# 54); BHC moved to strike plaintiff's pleading, and sought dismissal of the remaining Title VII claim (# 57). On November 3, 2017, this court issued another R &amp; R (# 60) recommending that the Title VII failure to promote claim be dismissed as time-barred, and that any remaining claims beyond the failure to promote claim be stricken as outside the scope of amendment allowed by Chief Judge Saris. Plaintiff filed an objection to the recommendation. (# 62.) On March 12, 2018, Chief Judge Saris issued a Memorandum and Order on the R &amp; R. (# 66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the March 12th Memorandum, Chief Judge Saris adopted the recommendation that the failure to promote claim be dismissed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. She further determined that plaintiff's hostile work environment claim should be dismissed \"because there is no indication that it was exhausted at the administrative level.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Having reviewed the allegations of the second amended complaint, however, Chief Judge Saris concluded that the interests of justice favored permitting Jenkins to prosecute his retaliatory termination claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   BHC filed a motion for reconsideration of the decision that the retaliatory termination claim was viable. (# 69.) That motion was ultimately denied on July 9, 2018. (## 73, 77, 78.) On July 27, 2018, BHC filed its answer to plaintiff's second amended complaint. (# 79.) Approximately a month and a half later, on October 11, 2018, plaintiff filed a motion to amend the second amended complaint (# 86) seeking to add claims under the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. BHC opposes the motion to amend.

At no place in his amended complaint does McDonald make any allegation with respect to 'federal financial assistance.' On this ground alone, the amended complaint is fatally deficient under Rule 12(b)(6) for failing to state a claim.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Lastly, defendant contends that in the second amended complaint, plaintiff has alleged several reasons why he was terminated. For example, Jenkins claims that he suffered retaliatory termination because he complained about racial discrimination in employment. (# 54 \u00b6\u00b6 55-57.) In his proposed amendment, plaintiff alleges that he was terminated on account of his disability. (# 86-1 \u00b6\u00b6 75-79.) By its terms, the Rehabilitation Act requires an individual to have suffered discrimination \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     solely\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   by reason of ... his disability.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added).
