(Doc. No. 24 at 4.) In March 2016, Plaintiffs sought to develop a student-housing project at Tennessee Technological University (\"Tennessee Tech\") in Cookeville, Tennessee and met with Defendant Wayne Cravens, a financial advisor, about acquiring real estate in Cookeville. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.) Plaintiffs and Cravens discussed the potential project for several months, and, in August 2016, representatives from Sonnyman and MMA traveled to Cookeville and met with Cravens and Defendant Justin Cumby, owner of Defendant Titan Development, LLC (\"Titan\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Cravens and Cumby showed Plaintiffs two parcels of land suitable for student-housing, which were located near Tennessee Tech's campus (the \"Property\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In February 2017, Titan acquired the Property for a total purchase price of $1 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) Cravens and Cumby then traveled to Fort Worth, Texas in May 2017 to meet with Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) During the meeting, Cravens and Cumby, on behalf of themselves and Titan, communicated that they wanted to form a formal partnership with Plaintiffs to develop student-housing on the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs, Cravens, and Cumby orally agreed on: (1) the essential terms of the partnership; and (2) each partner's contribution to the partnership (money, skill, labor). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Specifically, the parties agreed that: (1) Sonnyman would fund the partnership's pre-development costs related to efforts to rezone the Property for the student-housing project; (2) Titan would contribute the Property in fee simple to the partnership; and (3) Domus would lead the partnership's local efforts in Cookeville to rezone the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) The parties also agreed to memorialize the pertinent information about the partnership in a financing \"pitch book\" to attract additional investors for the project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The parties then began pre-development activities, including preparing rezoning efforts, compiling information for the pitch book, and creating architectural and engineering designs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.) The parties agreed to name the student-housing development \"Aerie,\" and met in Cookeville in July 2017 to further discuss the development. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) During this time, the parties contracted with HFF, Inc. (\"HFF\"), a provider of capital markets and brokerage services, and HFF created the \"pitch book\" necessary to attract additional funding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9.) The pitch book contained certain information about the parties' partnership, including that: (1) the parties were in \"a partnership led by Domus Development\" intended to develop the Property; (2) Domus was the \"key principal\" of the partnership; (3) other \"key principals\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   included representatives of MMA, Cravens, and Cumby; and (4) the Property had been purchased by the parties and rezoning efforts were ongoing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Domus then met with Defendant Clinton Engineering, a local engineering firm in Cookeville, about providing limited civil engineering services with respect to the Aerie project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) Clinton Engineering provided some preliminary plans to Domus, and Domus and Clinton Engineering agreed on proposals for more work in the future. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.) After creating these plans (\"Aerie Plans\"), Domus met with additional stakeholders in the project, including the president of Tennessee Tech, members of Cookeville's planning and zoning commission, and members of Cookeville's City Council, to secure additional support for the Aerie development. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.) As a result, in November 2017, Domus, Cravens, and Cumby, on behalf of Titan, appeared before the Cookeville Planning Commission and requested that the Property be rezoned from single family residential to multi-family residential. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) Cravens confirmed at the meeting that the Property was being developed by the partnership according to the Aerie Plans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At the conclusion of the November 2017 meeting, the Cookeville Planning Commission approved the request to rezone the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) Domus attended a final meeting on January 4, 2018, where it obtained final zoning approval. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that, once the rezoning efforts were complete, Titan and Cravens began shopping the Property to other third-party developers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15.) When confronted by Plaintiffs, Defendants refused to perform pursuant to the agreed-upon partnership. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) Plaintiffs then filed the instant lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that a partnership was formed among the parties, with an agreement to develop the property, and Defendants breached that partnership agreement by engaging in negotiations to sell the property to a third-party and otherwise failing to proceed with the development. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-21.) Plaintiffs also allege claims of unjust enrichment, promissory estoppel, misappropriation of trade secrets, trademark infringement, conversion, breach of contract (as against Clinton Engineering), and civil conspiracy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-30.) Moreover, based on its claims that Titan intended to contribute the Property to the partnership, Plaintiffs, on June 20, 2018, filed a lien lis pendens on the Property based on their complaint. (Doc. No. 25-1.) Defendants Titan, Cravens, and Cumby then filed the instant partial motion to dismiss. (Doc. No. 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Defendants' Partial Motion to Dismiss\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In their partial motion to dismiss, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' conclusory allegation that they have an interest in the Property is barred by Tennessee's Statute of Frauds because Plaintiffs cannot identify any written document memorializing an agreement to convey the Property to the alleged partnership. (Doc. No. 26 at 1.) For this same reason, Defendants also argue that any claim for which Plaintiffs request specific performance as a remedy should be dismissed, as there is no writing establishing what specific performance could possibly be sought. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) Further, Defendants contend that, because there is no writing related to the alleged conveyance of the Property to the partnership or other facts demonstrating that the Property was conveyed to the partnership, Plaintiffs cannot assert equitable estoppel to prevent application of the Statute of Frauds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Moreover, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' lien lis pendens on the Property is\n   defective because: (1) it does not state the amount of the lien \"sought to be fixed\"; and (2) Plaintiffs have no valid claim to any ownership interest in the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.) Accordingly, Defendants request that the Court declare the lien lis pendens invalid so that the Property is no longer encumbered. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court will address the lien lis pendens argument first, and then turn to the Defendants' argument regarding the Statute of Frauds, equitable estoppel, and specific performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, the Court must view the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, accepting all well-pleaded factual allegations as true.\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Tenn. Feb. 6, 2013) (\"The primary purpose of a lien lis pendens is to put third parties on notice of the existence of the claimant's interest in the property so as to prevent further alienation.\"). As the Tennessee Court of Appeals has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   By filing a notice of lis pendens at the commencement of a lawsuit, a plaintiff provides notice to the world of the existence of a pending action affecting the title or right to possession of the subject property. Prospective purchasers and\n   encumbrancers are thereby put on notice that the plaintiff has a claim which, if successful, would adversely affect their title to the property. When the suit on which the notice of lis pendens terminates, however, the right to subject subsequent purchasers and encumbrancers to the claims described in the action on which the lis pendens is based comes to an end. Accordingly, a lis pendens terminates upon the conclusion of the underlying lawsuit, whether by dismissal or entry of a final decree ...

Regardless, in the Court's view, the relevant question is not the strength of Plaintiffs' claims to the Property, or whether Plaintiffs' lien lis pendens complies with \u00a7 101(a), but, rather, the pendency of this action. Viewed through this lens, Defendants' request for an order declaring the lien lis pendens invalid is clearly premature, and, indeed would not be appropriate until final judgment has been entered, whether as a result of a dispositive motion or otherwise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, to the extent that Defendants' Partial Motion to Dismiss requests an order from the Court declaring Plaintiffs' lien lis pendens invalid, the\n   Motion to Dismiss is denied without prejudice as premature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Statute of Frauds, Equitable Estoppel, and Specific Performance\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants' remaining arguments primarily center on Tennessee's Statute of Frauds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-11.) Defendants contend that Plaintiffs present no writing at all to support any alleged agreement by Titan to convey an interest in the Property either (1) to Plaintiffs; or (2) to any alleged partnership that was formed between the parties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) Therefore, Defendants argue that any claim Plaintiffs may have for such an interest is barred by the Statute of Frauds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Further, Defendants maintain that Plaintiffs cannot raise the doctrine of equitable estoppel to prevent application of the Statute of Frauds because there is neither a writing evidencing a conveyance of the Property to the partnership, nor other facts demonstrating that the alleged conveyance was contemplated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-11.) Relatedly, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs cannot assert specific performance as a remedy because there is no writing establishing what specific performance could possibly be sought.

The parties are in agreement that the Tennessee Statute of Frauds applies to the instant action, but differ on whether the doctrine of equitable estoppel prevents Defendants from asserting the Statute of Frauds. (\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 26 at 8-11, 29 at 11-16.) Taking the allegations in the Amended Complaint as true, at first glance, it certainly appears that Plaintiffs have validly raised the doctrine of equitable estoppel. Defendants allegedly \"acted in a certain manner as to indicate an agreement\" by stating at the Fort Worth meeting that they desired a formal partnership with Plaintiffs and that their contribution to the partnership would be the Property.\n   <em>\n    Thornton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20836368\">\n    2008 WL 836368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-3. In \"reasonable reliance on that indication of agreement,\" Plaintiffs mounted significant efforts to improve the Property, including securing a zoning change of the Property to multi-family residential.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20836368\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, after such improvements were complete, Defendants allegedly asserted a contrary position, namely that no partnership had ever been formed and the Property\n   was theirs to do with as they wished.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20836368\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This factual situation seems tailor-fit to serve as the basis for a claim of equitable estoppel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20836368\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Nonetheless, definitively determining whether the doctrine of equitable estoppel applies to the instant action would require the Court to resolve several disputed factual issues, such as (1) the precise conduct of the Defendants, including their specific representations at the partnership meeting; (2) the Defendants' knowledge at the time of their conduct; and (3) Plaintiffs' subsequent actions based upon the conduct of Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Osborne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9278024\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/130/769/#p774\">\n    130 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   774 ;\n   <em>\n    Roach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11619711\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/989/335/#p339\">\n    989 S.W.2d at 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise, determining the issue of whether specific performance suffices as an appropriate remedy for Plaintiffs' claims would force the Court to confront even more significantly disputed factual issues, including whether a partnership agreement actually existed between the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williamson Cty.

These kinds of factual determinations are inappropriate for a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, and the Court believes that the better course of action is to allow development of the factual issues through discovery to aid the Court's ultimate disposition of the issues, whether through additional dispositive motions or at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moher v.
