SHAW, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This removed diversity matter is before the Court on plaintiff OS33's (\"plaintiff\" or \"OS33\") Motion for Leave to File a First Amended Complaint. Remaining defendant CenturyLink Communications, L.L.C. (\"CenturyLink\") opposes the motion. Plaintiff did not file a reply memorandum and the motion is ready for decision. For the following reasons, the motion for leave to amend will be granted in part and denied in part, and plaintiff will be ordered to submit a revised First Amended Complaint for filing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   By Memorandum and Order dated May 17, 2018 (the \"Order\"), the Court granted in part and denied in part CenturyLink's motion to dismiss OS33's Petition for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. P., and for failure to plead fraud with particularity pursuant to Rule 9(b). Shortly thereafter, plaintiff filed the instant motion for leave to amend, accompanied by a proposed First Amended Complaint that attempts to cure the pleading defects found by the Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As detailed in the Order, OS33 and CenturyLink entered into a contract for cloud computing, hosting, and related services. OS33 asserted two claims in its state court Petition. In Count I, OS33 sought a declaratory judgment that (a) CenturyLink breached the parties' Agreement by changing the Service Term and Billing Commencement Dates for services without notice to OS33 whenever there was a change to an original Service Order; (b)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   CenturyLink breached the parties' Agreement because it lacked cause to terminate services it provided to OS33 after OS33 withdrew its request for early termination; (c) CenturyLink's claim for Early Termination Charges is improper based upon CenturyLink's breach of the parties' Agreement by terminating the services without cause and improperly changing the Service Terms without notice; and (d) OS33 does not owe any Early Termination Charges for services CenturyLink cancelled without cause. In Count II, OS33 asserted a claim of fraud based on CenturyLink's alleged breach of the parties' agreement by changing the Service Term and Billing Commencement Dates for services without notice to OS33 whenever there was a change to an original Service Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   CenturyLink moved to dismiss OS33's Petition. The Court granted the motion to dismiss OS33's claims in Count I that CenturyLink breached the parties' agreement by changing the Service Term and Billing Commencement Dates for services without notice to OS33 whenever there was a change to an original Service Order. The Court denied the motion as to OS33's claims in Count I that CenturyLink breached the parties' agreement when it terminated services after OS33 withdrew its request for early termination. The Court also granted the motion to dismiss OS33's fraud claim in Count II, because it was based solely on the factual allegations underlying the breach of contract claims that were dismissed for failure to state a claim. The Court did not reach CenturyLink's other arguments for dismissal of the fraud claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   OS33 now seeks to file an amended complaint to revive the dismissed claims. OS33's motion does not cite a procedural basis for the relief it seeks or discuss the appropriate legal standard. CenturyLink argues that OS33's motion should be denied because the proposed amendment is futile and would not survive a motion to dismiss, and because OS33 does not show good cause for the amendment under Rule 16(b), Fed. R. Civ. P.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(Doc. 20.) CenturyLink's motion to dismiss was filed in December 2017, and the Court\n   issued the Order dismissing most of OS33's Petition on May 17, 2018. While the motion to dismiss was pending, OS33 chose to rest on its Petition and did not attempt to address the deficiencies identified by the motion, though it could have filed an amended pleading as a matter of course under Rule 15(a)(1)(B), Fed. R. Civ. P. OS33 sought leave to amend its complaint on May 21, 2018, four days after the Court's ruling. Although OS33's motion to amend was filed beyond the deadline for amending pleadings in the scheduling order, the Court in the exercise of its discretion will evaluate it under the standard of Rule 15(a), because the motion was filed only two weeks past the deadline and CenturyLink's challenge to the proposed amendment is based primarily on an assertion of futility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"Futility is a valid basis for denying leave to amend.\"\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Count I - Declaratory Judgment/Breach of Contract Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As previously stated, the Court dismissed OS33's claims in Count I that CenturyLink breached the parties' Agreement by (1) changing the Service Term and Billing Commencement Dates for services without notice to OS33 whenever there was a change to an original Service Order; and (2) failing to issue new written Service Orders and provide notice to OS33 when it changed Billing Commencement Dates. OS33 attempts to revive both of these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    1. Plaintiff's Claim that CenturyLink Breached the Parties' Agreement by Improperly Restarting Billing Commencement Dates\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   With respect to OS33's claim that CenturyLink's changes to Billing Commencement Dates breached the parties' Agreement, the Court concluded the Petition failed to state a claim because it only alleged facts showing that CenturyLink took actions it was authorized to take under the parties' Agreement; specifically, that CenturyLink established a new Billing Commencement Date whenever plaintiff submitted a Service Order for an upgraded or additional service. (Doc. 27 at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In the proposed Amended Complaint, OS33 alleges that when it would issue a new Service Order to upgrade an existing service, CenturyLink not only issued a new Billing Commencement Date for the new upgraded service, as was proper under the parties' Agreement, but also changed the Billing Commencement Date for the original service to match the Billing Commencement Date for the new service, and thereby improperly extended the term of the original service. OS33 alleges that as a result of this breach, CenturyLink subjected it to improperly increased Early Termination Charges under the parties' Agreement upon OS33's cancellation of any services before the end of the service term. (Doc. 30 at \u00b6\u00b6 29-30, p.5; \u00b6\u00b6 24-34, pp. 6-7.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   CenturyLink's opposition memorandum does not discuss this aspect of OS33's proposed Amended Complaint. These factual allegations appear to cure the defects the Court previously found in OS33's claims based on CenturyLink's restarting of Billing Commencement Dates, and therefore the proposed Amended Complaint is not futile in this respect and amendment will be allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    2. Plaintiff's Claim that CenturyLink Breached the Parties' Agreement by Failing to Issue a New Written Service Order and Provide Notice When Changing Billing Commencement Dates\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As to OS33's claim that CenturyLink breached the parties' Agreement by failing to issue a new written Service Order and provide notice when changing Billing Commencement Dates, the Court concluded the Petition failed to state a claim because its factual allegations concerning notice were \"grounded exclusively on CenturyLink's alleged failure to issue written Service Orders, which the Agreement does not obligate CenturyLink to do.\" (Doc. 27 at 18.) Instead, the Agreement called for OS33 to issue written Service Orders. The Court also found that the \"Agreement calls for CenturyLink to provide written notice of installation only under certain limited circumstances, none of which are pleaded in the [Petition.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The operative paragraphs of the proposed Amended Complaint are similar to those of the Petition. The Petition alleged in pertinent part,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   25. [CenturyLink] would further change the date of the Billing Commencement Date for calculating the Service Term without advising Plaintiff of this change, and without issuing a new written Service Order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   26. By failing to issue new Service Orders showing the Change in the Billing Commencement Date for the Service, [CenturyLink] made it impossible for Plaintiff to track the Service terms for the various Services which it requested [CenturyLink] to supply pursuant to [the] MSA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   27. Further, by failing to issue new Service Orders showing the Change in the Billing Commencement Date for the Service, Plaintiff never agreed in writing to any change in the Billing Commencement Date or Service Term regarding any Services provided by [CenturyLink].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Pet. at 5.) The relevant portion of Count I's prayer for relief asked the Court to enter an order finding that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   a. [CenturyLink] violated the MSA and Service Schedule between the parties by changing the Service Term and Billing Commencement Date's [sic] for services without notice to Plaintiff whenever there was [a] change to the original Service Order[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (Pet. at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The proposed Amended Complaint is similar, and alleges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   34. [CenturyLink] made these changes to the Billing Commencement Dates of services without advising Plaintiff of these changes, and without issuing a new written Service Order as required for establishing a Billing Commencement Date.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   35. By failing to issue new Service Orders showing the Change in the Billing Commencement Date for the Service, [CenturyLink] made it impossible for Plaintiff to track the Service terms for the various Services which it requested [CenturyLink] to supply pursuant to [the] MSA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   36. Further, by failing to issue new Service Orders showing the Change in the Billing Commencement Date for the Service, Plaintiff never agreed in writing to any change in the Billing Commencement\n   Date or Service Term regarding any Services provided by [CenturyLink].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   (Doc. 30 at 8.) Paragraphs 35 and 36 of the Amended Complaint are identical to paragraphs 24 and 25 of the Petition. The prayer for relief is also identical:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   a. [CenturyLink] violated the MSA and Service Schedule between the parties by changing the Service Term and Billing Commencement Date's [sic] for services without notice to Plaintiff whenever there was [a] change to the original Service Order[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   (Doc. 30 at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   OS33's proffered amendment does not cure the defects of the original Petition as to its claim that CenturyLink breached the parties' Agreement by failing to issue new written Service Orders and provide notice when changing Billing Commencement Dates. The Amended Complaint repeats the factual allegations that CenturyLink failed to issue Service Orders, although the parties' Agreement provides that OS33 is to issue Service Orders. The proposed amendment also does not add factual allegations that CenturyLink failed to provide written notice of installation under the limited circumstances specified in the parties' Agreement. As a result, OS33's proposed amendment is not supported by the terms of the parties' Agreement. The Court concludes that this aspect of OS33's Amended Complaint is futile as it fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and OS33 will not be permitted to amend this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Count II - Fraud\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court dismissed OS33's claim for common law fraud, which was based on CenturyLink's alleged breach of the parties' Agreement by changing the Service Term and Billing Commencement Dates for services without notice to OS33 whenever there was a change to an original Service Order, i.e., the same facts that formed the basis of part of Count I. The Court concluded OS33 failed to allege facts that plausibly stated a fraud claim under Missouri law, because the claim was based on the same conduct by CenturyLink that did not constitute a breach of the parties' Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   OS33 reasserts a fraud claim in the proposed Amended Complaint. It incorporates the factual allegations of Count I and alleges that: (1) CenturyLink changed the Billing Commencement Dates for existing services without notice to OS33 \"any time a change to the Service by new Service Order was made by the parties;\" (2) this change altered the Service Term under the original Service Order; (3) CenturyLink knew in making this change that it was changing the date upon which any Service would end or auto-renew; (4) by making this change, CenturyLink was changing the terms of the Service Orders between the parties in violation of the parties' Agreement; (5) CenturyLink knew that the parties' Agreement did not allow the Service Terms to be changed, and only provided for Service Terms to be auto-renewed; (6) CenturyLink represented to OS33 the remaining terms for services which were cancelled based on the improperly altered changed dates; (7) CenturyLink made these representations with the intent that OS33 rely on them in paying Early Termination Charges; (8) CenturyLink knew that its representation of the Early Termination Charges due and owing was based on false and incorrect Service Term dates; (9) CenturyLink intended OS33 to rely on its representations; and (1) OS33 did not know these representations were false when made, and OS33 relied on the representations. (Doc. 30, \u00b6\u00b6 47-57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   CenturyLink argues that OS33's proposed fraud count fails to cure the pleading deficiencies previously identified by the Court, and alleges no facts supporting a\n   claim for fraud based on CenturyLink's alleged failure to issue new written Service Orders or provide \"notice\" to OS33. CenturyLink also argues that Missouri's economic loss doctrine bars the fraud claim, and that OS33 fails to plead fraud with particularity as required by Rule 9(b), Fed. R. Civ. P. Because OS33 did not file a reply in support of its motion for leave to amend, CenturyLink's arguments are unopposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The elements of an action for fraud under Missouri law are: \"(1) a representation; (2) its falsity; (3) its materiality; (4) the speaker's knowledge of its falsity or ignorance of its truth; (5) the speaker's intent that it should be acted on by the person in the manner reasonably contemplated; (6) the hearer's ignorance of the falsity of the representation; (7) the hearer's reliance on the representation being true; (8) the hearer's right to rely thereon; and (9) the hearer's consequent and proximately caused injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Renaissance Leasing, LLC v.

Sept. 28, 2015) (where fraud claim was based on the same set of facts that supported breach of warranty claims and did not assert damages outside of those recoverable on the warranty claims, it was barred by the economic loss doctrine).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Here, the substance of OS33's fraud claim is for the recovery of economic losses that arise solely out of CenturyLink's alleged\n   breach of the parties' Agreement. OS33 incorporates the declaratory judgment/breach of contract allegations of Count I into the fraud claim in Count II, so the same facts support both claims and it is clear the subject matter of the alleged fraud was incorporated into the parties' Agreement. The only damages OS33 alleges are the incorrect imposition of Early Termination Charges under the Agreement, specifically that (1) CenturyLink improperly restarted Billing Commencement Dates when it should not have, thus increasing the Early Termination Charges OS33 owed, or (2) CenturyLink is not contractually entitled to any Early Termination Charges because it did not have cause to terminate after OS33 withdrew its early termination request. Although OS33 also prays for punitive damages, it does not allege that it suffered additional damages outside of the Agreement as a result of the alleged fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Based on these factors, it is evident OS33's fraud claim is not independent of the parties' Agreement. Instead, it arises directly out of contractual duties and expectations and does not seek damages outside of the Agreement. The Court therefore concludes OS33's fraud claim fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and it would be futile to allow OS33 to assert it in an amended pleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Morever, even if OS33's fraud claim were not barred by the economic loss doctrine, it fails for the final reason raised by CenturyLink, that it has not been pleaded with particularity as required by Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Rule\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   demands a higher degree of notice than that required for other claims, and is intended to enable the defendant to respond specifically and quickly to the potentially damaging allegations. To satisfy the particularity requirement of Rule 9(b), the complaint must plead such facts as the time, place, and content of defendant's false representations, as well as the details of the defendant's fraudulent acts, including when the acts occurred, who engaged in them, and what was obtained as a result.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.
