Although Defendant holds a permit that authorizes the company to discharge pollutants from the Vermilion Power Station to the Middle Fork through nine external outfalls, Defendant's discharge of pollutants into the Middle Fork from these seeps violate the CWA because they are not authorized by any permit and are contrary to the limited authorization to discharge within Defendant's discharge permit. Defendant also discharged and is discharging on an ongoing basis, pollutants into the Middle Fork in concentrations, colors, and with characteristics that violate Illinois effluent limits and water quality standards that are incorporated as conditions of the Vermilion permit. By violating these permit conditions, Defendant is also in violation of the CWA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Parties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff is an Illinois non-profit organization with more than 1,000 members that champions clean, healthy rivers and lakes and safe drinking water to benefit the people and wildlife of Illinois. Plaintiff advocates public policies and cultural values that sustain ecological health and biological diversity of water resources and aquatic ecosystems. Plaintiff holds events for members of the organization and the public along and on the Middle Fork, including immediately downstream of the pollution and discharge points of Defendant. Its members, some of whom live, work, and recreate around the Middle Fork, have had their use and enjoyment of the Middle Fork harmed by Defendant's unauthorized and prohibited discharge of pollutants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant, a Delaware corporation, owns the Vermilion Power Station. Defendant is a subsidiary of Vistra Energy, which is headquartered in Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Vermilion Power Station (VPS) is a retired coal-fired power plant located five miles north of Oakwood, Illinois. The plant sits on the west bank of the Middle Fork, in a 17-mile section designated as Illinois' only National Scenic River and first State Scenic River. From the mid-1950s until 2011, the plant burned coal and generated millions of tons of coal combustion residuals (\"coal ash\"). Defendant and its predecessor mixed the coal ash generated at VPS with water and sluiced it into three unlined coal ash pits, known as the Old East Ash Pond, the North Ash Pond System, and the New East Ash Pond. When the plant opened in 1955, ash was flushed into the Old East Ash Pond. That pit was in service until the North Ash Pond System, a two-cell pit, was built in the mid-1970s. In 1989, the coal ash was diverted to the New East Ash Pond, which received coal ash until the plant's closure in 2011. Although the coal ash pits are out of service, all three continue to store coal ash-including coal ash as deep as 44 feet in\n   some locations. The three unlined coal ash pits contain an approximate total of 3.33 million cubic yards of coal ash. Defendant continues to own these pits and remains responsible for maintaining them, as well as performing any remaining activities at the plant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Coal ash wastewater such as that in the coal ash pits contains heavy metals and other toxic pollutants that are harmful and at times deadly to people, aquatic life, and animals. Among the contaminants found in coal ash are arsenic, barium, boron, chromium, lead, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, and sulfate. These contaminants can inflict severe harm, including brain damage, cancer, learning disabilities, birth defects, and reproductive defects. Arsenic is a well-known carcinogen that also damages the nervous system. Manganese is associated with learning disabilities and nervous system impairment, and can render water unusable by discoloring the water, giving it a metallic taste, and causing black staining. Molybdenum has been linked to gout (joint pain, fatigue), increased blood uric acid levels, high blood pressure, liver disease, and potential adverse impacts on the reproductive system. Boron, a dependable indicator of coal ash contamination, can lead to reduced sperm count, testicular degeneration, birth defects, and low birth weight among humans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant's limited authorization to discharge wastewater from the VPS is set out in NPDES Permit IL0004057 (\"the Permit\"), granted by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) pursuant to the IEPA's delegated authority under the CWA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201342\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The Permit regulates discharges of pollutants from the VPS, specifying which wastewater streams may be discharged from which points at the plant. It also establishes effluent limitations, as well as monitoring and reporting requirements for certain pollutants within those wastewater streams. To this effect, the Permit defines nine external outfalls at the VPS, each of which authorizes limited discharges of pollutants at specific outfalls to the Middle Fork.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Standard Condition 23 of the Permit states that \"collected screening, slurries, sludges, and other solids shall be disposed of in such a manner as to prevent entry of those wastes (or runoff from the wastes) into the waters of the State. The proper authorization for such disposal shall be obtained from the Agency and is incorporated as part hereof by reference.\" Applicable Illinois regulations define \"sludge\" as \"any solid, semisolid, or liquid waste generated from a municipal, commercial, or industrial wastewater treatment plant, water supply treatment plant, or air pollution control facility or any other such waste having similar characteristics and effects.\" 35 Ill. Adm. Code \u00a7 301.395. Applicable Illinois law defines \"disposal\" as being \"the discharge, deposit, injection, dumping, spilling, leaking, or placing of any waste or hazardous waste into or on any land or water ... so that such waste or hazardous waste or any constituent thereof may enter the environment or be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters, including ground waters.\" 415 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3.185.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Standard Condition 25 provides: \"The permittee shall comply with, in addition to the requirements of the permit, all applicable provisions of 35 Ill. Adm. Code Subtitle C, Subtitle D, Subtitle E, and all applicable orders of the [Illinois Pollution Control] Board.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Subtitle C of the Illinois Administrative Code provides that \"no effluent shall contain settleable solids, floating debris, visible oil, grease, scum or sludge solids. Color, odor and turbidity must be reduced to below obvious levels.\" 35 Ill. Adm. Code \u00a7 304.106. The term \"effluent\" is defined, in relevant part, as \"any wastewater discharged,\n   directly or indirectly, to the waters of the State or to any storm sewer, and the runoff from land used for the disposition of wastewater or sludges.\" 35 Ill. Adm. Code \u00a7 301.275.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Subtitle C of the Illinois Administrative Code further provides that \"[n]o person shall cause or allow the concentration of the following constituents in any effluent to exceed the following levels, subject to the averaging rules contained in Section 304.104(a).\" Ill. Adm. Code \u00a7 304.124(a). The current iteration of the Permit was issued and became effective on March 7, 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Dating back to at least May 2013, the coal ash pits at VPS have discharged, and continue to discharge on an ongoing basis, pollutants - including, but not limited to, arsenic, barium, boron, chromium, iron, lead, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, sulfate, and totally dissolved solids - into the Middle Fork from numerous, discrete, unpermitted seeps on the riverbank adjacent to the North Ash Pond and Old East Ash Pond in areas where there are no permitted outfalls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Middle Fork is a surface water body within the jurisdiction of the CWA as well as a water of the state of Illinois. The Middle Fork has no specific use designation and, as such, is subject to the general use standards codified at 35 Ill. Adm. Code Part 302 Subpart B, which forms part of 35 Ill. Adm. Code Subtitle C. See 35 Ill. Admin. Code \u00a7\u00a7 303.201, 302.101(b). The Middle Fork is also subject to the general effluent limitations set forth at 35 Ill. Adm. Code Part 304 Subpart A, which also forms part of 35 Ill. Adm. Code Subtitle C. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201342\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 304.101(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Groundwater monitoring at the North Ash Pond System and Old East Ash Pond was performed from 1992 through 2007, and again in 2011. The groundwater monitoring at the site was reinitiated in 2017. Over the extended period of groundwater monitoring undertaken between 1992 and 2011, concentrations of boron and sulfate - primary indicators of coal ash contamination - consistently exceeded Illinois' groundwater protection standards and, on numerous occasions, also exceeded U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) drinking water health advisories for those contaminants. Defendant's consultants have concluded that the presence of boron and sulfate at the concentrations found at the VPS \"indicat[e] that groundwater quality at the facility has been impacted by leachate from the [Old East Ash Pond] and [North Ash Pond System],\" and that the elevated concentrations of boron, sulfate, manganese, iron, pH, and total dissolved solids in groundwater at the site are partially due to the impacts of coal ash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Coal ash at the VPS has groundwater flowing through it year round. While the thickness of saturated ash varies as groundwater levels rise and fall with the seasons, groundwater has saturated coal ash at depths of more than 21 feet. That groundwater flows laterally through the ash, picking up contaminants in the process, while precipitation leaching down through the top of the coal ash mixes with the groundwater and further adds to the pollutant load contained within the discharge to the Middle Fork. Defendant's own reports and information have concluded that the coal ash contaminated groundwater flows right into the adjacent Middle Fork.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In May 2016 and September 2017, Plaintiff sampled five discrete groundwater seeps discharging into the river. Independent laboratory testing revealed concentrations of arsenic, barium, boron, chromium, manganese, molybdenum, and sulfate in those seeps that exceed background levels and, for multiple pollutants, exceed health-based standards set by EPA and Illinois EPA. Plaintiff's sampling also detected\n   iron concentrations as high as 241 mg/l and manganese concentrations as high as 7.35 mg/l. Dating back to at least May 2013, discharges from the coal ash pits at VPS have discolored, and are continuing to discolor, the Middle Fork in low-flow areas of the river adjacent to the coal ash pits with a bright orange-red color not of natural origin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Claims for Relief\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Count I of Plaintiff's Complaint alleges that Defendant discharged pollutants without authorization in an NPDES Permit. Plaintiff alleges the Middle Fork is a navigable water as defined in \u00a7 1362(7) of the CWA, and that Defendant has discharged pollutants as defined in the CWA from the coal ash pits at the VPS to the Middle Fork. The discharge of pollutants from the VPS into the Middle Fork from discrete, unpermitted seeps on the riverbank adjacent to the North Ash Pond and Old East Pond are not authorized by the Permit, and are contrary to the limited authorization to discharge contained in the Permit. Because Defendant violated \u00a7 1311 of the CWA, Plaintiff has brought suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Count II alleges discharges in violation of the NPDES Permit Conditions. Plaintiff alleges that the discharge of pollutants from the VPS coal ash pits into the Middle Fork violates Standard Condition 23 of the Permit. Further, Defendant's discharge of pollutants have discolored the Middle Fork, and include iron and manganese at concentrations exceeding the effluent limits in Subtitle C of the Illinois Administrative Code, in violation of Standard Condition 25 of the Permit. Plaintiff also alleges that the pollutants are a bright orange-red color that stands out \"distinctly,\" and are not below \"obvious levels,\" as well as containing solids that settle on the riverbed, in violation of Condition 25 of the Permit. By violating these conditions, Plaintiff alleges, Defendant has violated \u00a7 1311(a) of the CWA and is subject to suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant's motion argues that, because Plaintiff's Complaint alleges that the coal ash residuals at VPS were releasing contaminants to groundwater, and that the groundwater was discharging to the Middle Fork via discrete unpermitted seeps, the Complaint should be dismissed because Seventh Circuit precedent establishes that the CWA does not regulate discharges to groundwater, even where the groundwater is hydrologically connected to surface waters regulated by the CWA. Plaintiff counters that the Seventh Circuit decision is distinguishable and inapposite to the instant case. Further, Plaintiff alleges the allegations in Count II set forth distinct violations of the CWA that provide an independent basis for the court's jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendant asks that the Motion to Dismiss be considered under both Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). Motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) are meant to test the sufficiency of the complaint, not to decide the merits of the case.\n   <em>\n    Center for Dermatology and Skin Cancer, Ltd. v.

In the context of a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the court accepts as true the well pleaded factual allegations, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff, but a plaintiff faced with a 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss bears the burden of establishing that the jurisdictional requirements have been met.\n   <em>\n    Burwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266409\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/770/586/#p588\">\n    770 F.3d at 588-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A motion under Rule 12(b)(6) challenges the sufficiency of the complaint to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\n   <em>\n    Hallinan v.

Based on the Seventh Circuit precedent, the court will analyze the motion under Rule 12(b)(1). However, the court would note that, under either 12(b)(1) or 12(b)(6), the result would be the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Count I\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For Count I, Defendant argues that Seventh Circuit decision in\n   <em>\n    Oconomowoc\n   </em>\n   is \"on all fours\" with the factual situation in the instant case, and is clear that the CWA does not regulate discharges of contaminants to groundwater, even where that contaminated groundwater reaches navigable waters. Because Plaintiff's Complaint is entirely predicated upon alleged discharges to groundwater, the court should dismiss it. Plaintiff responds that\n   <em>\n    Oconomowoc\n   </em>\n   is inapposite and that Defendant is mischaracterizing the decision, because that case \"governs discharges\n   <em>\n    into groundwater itself\n   </em>\n   , absent evidence that the groundwater discretely conveys pollution into a navigable water.\" Plaintiff contends that \"is a separate question not at issue here,\" and that, in the specific factual circumstances of this case, the majority of courts have held that the plain language of the CWA applies to and prohibits such discharges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Oconomowoc\n   </em>\n   , a local village sued Target for violations of the Clean Air Act and CWA. Target operated a warehouse in the area. Trucks parked at the warehouse dripped oil, which collected into rainwater runoff from storms. Rainwater runoff from the site then collected in a 6-acre artificial pond on the site. From the retention pond water seeped into the ground, possibly carrying hydrocarbons and other unwelcome substances. The district court judge, regarding the rainwater runoff, dismissed the complaint, finding that parking lots and retention ponds were not \"navigable waters\" under the CWA. Even though groundwater eventually reached streams, lakes, and oceans, the district court held, it was not part of the \"waters of the United States,\" as defined in \u00a7 1362(7) of the CWA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Seventh Circuit affirmed. The court began by noting that the CWA applied to \"the waters of the United States,\" and that the CWA was a \"broad statute, reaching waters and wetlands that are not navigable or even directly connected to navigable waters.\"\n   <em>\n    Oconomowoc\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10512022\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/24/962/#p963\">\n    24 F.3d at 964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court then noted that, though broad, the CWA's reach was not total, finding that the EPA's regulatory definition of \"waters of the United States\" included \"intrastate lakes, rivers, streams (including intermittent streams), mudflats, sandflats, wetlands, sloughs, prairie potholes, wet meadows, playa lakes, or natural ponds, the use, degradation or destruction of which could\n   affect interstate or foreign commerce'[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Oconomowoc\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10512022\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/24/962/#p963\">\n    24 F.3d at 965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20230.3\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (s)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The court then asked the question \"[w]hat of the possibility that water from the pond will enter the local ground waters, and thence underground aquifers that feed lakes and streams that are part of the 'waters of the United States'?\"\n   <em>\n    Oconomowoc\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10512022\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/24/962/#p963\">\n    24 F.3d at 965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Seventh Circuit affirmatively held that the CWA did not assert authority over groundwaters, just because those waters \"may\" be hydrologically connected with surface waters. This court's reading of that passage is that the Seventh Circuit found any hydrological connection between surface waters and groundwater to be irrelevant in terms of whether groundwaters were covered by the CWA. If the discharge is made into groundwater, and the pollutants somehow later find their way to navigable surface waters via a discrete hydrological connection, the CWA is still not implicated, because the offending discharge was made into groundwater, which is not subject to the CWA. This interpretation is bolstered later in the decision, where the Seventh Circuit again considered \"[t]he possibility of a hydrological connection\" between groundwater and covered navigable waters, but concluded that \"neither the statute nor the regulations makes such a possibility a sufficient ground of regulation.\"\n   <em>\n    Oconomowoc\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10512022\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/24/962/#p963\">\n    24 F.3d at 965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Seventh Circuit acknowledged that the EPA has, on several occasions, noted the connection between surface and groundwaters, but found that the EPA has \"left the regulatory definition alone[,]\" concluding that \"[c]ollateral reference to a problem is not a satisfactory substitute for focused attention in rule-making or adjudication.\"\n   <em>\n    Oconomowoc\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10512022\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/24/962/#p963\">\n    24 F.3d at 965-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Seventh Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Oconomowoc\n   </em>\n   was not distinguishing between discharges of pollutants into groundwater with only the hypothetical possibility of further seepage into navigable waters and discharge of pollutants into groundwater with\n   <em>\n    definite\n   </em>\n   seepage into navigable waters.
