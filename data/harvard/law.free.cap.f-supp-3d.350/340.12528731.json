Because his claims are futile, even as delineated in his proposed amended complaint, Mr. Oliver's motion for leave to amend his complaint will be denied and this case will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 1995, a jury convicted Mr. Oliver of first and second degree rape in the Circuit Court for Prince George's County. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 26.) His conviction was overturned on appeal. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 27.) In 1998, Mr. Oliver entered an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea to rape in the second degree and received a 5-year sentence. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 28.) In July 1999, he was released from custody and simultaneously was required to register as a sex offender. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 29-30.) He objected to the sex offender registration requirement. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 29.) From July 1999 until May 2015, Mr. Oliver was required to re-register as a sex offender, at regular intervals, with state and local authorities, and remained listed on the Maryland Sex Offender Registry (hereafter, \"MSOR\"). (Am. Compl. \u00b6 26-70.) In the interim, the specific requirements and purported duration of his registration changed numerous times with various retroactive amendments to the Maryland Sex Offender Registration Act (hereafter \"the Act\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Act was first promulgated on October 1, 1995, and applied only to Child Sexual Offenders. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 73-74.) On October 1, 1997, an amendment to the Act broadened the Act's applicability to include \"Sexually Violent Offender[s]\" and \"Sexually Violent Predator[s].\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 79.) Following Mr. Oliver's release and registration in 1999, a new amendment to the Act required individuals who, like Mr. Oliver, were convicted under Article 27 \u00a7 464A to register for life. (ECF 10-1 at p. 4.) In 2010, additional amendments instituted a tiered structure whereby Mr. Oliver, as a \"tier III sex offender,\" was required to register in person every three months for life. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2013, the Maryland Court of Appeals concluded that the Act's retroactive registration requirement violated the ex post facto prohibition contained in Article 17 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Dep't of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr.

The decision was based purely on Maryland law, and the court noted its own divergence from the narrower prohibitions dictated by the federal constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause. In 2014, the Maryland Court of Appeals held further that, despite\n   registration obligations imposed by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016901\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , the federal Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (\"SORNA\"), Maryland courts have the ability to instruct the State to remove a registrant's information when its inclusion would violate the state constitution under the prescriptions of\n   <em>\n    Doe I.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Pub.

On April 15, 2015, in the wake of\n   <em>\n    Doe II\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Oliver filed a complaint for declaratory judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Mem. P. &amp; A. Supp. Def. Montgomery Co., MD's Mot. Dismiss Pl.'s Compl., ECF 9-1 at p. 10.) MSOR staff reviewed the facts and timing of Mr. Oliver's case and sentence, and determined that he was not required to register as a sex offender in Maryland. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 71; State Defs' Mot. to Dismiss, ECF 10-1 at p. 5.) He was delisted on or about May 28, 2015. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 1, 2018, Mr. Oliver filed suit against the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, the Sexual Offender Advisory Board, Montgomery County, and various employees working for these agencies, alleging that his rights under the United States Constitution, the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and Maryland common law were violated by the initial and continued requirement that he register as a sex offender. (Compl., ECF 1.) Both County and State defendants filed motions to dismiss-on March 26, 2018, and on April 9, 2018, respectively. (ECF 8; ECF 10.) Mr. Oliver did not respond to either motion to dismiss. On May 8, 2018, Mr. Oliver instead filed an amended complaint, adding as defendants four former Secretaries of the Department and three members of the Montgomery Police Department. (Am. Compl., ECF 12.) In this amended complaint, Mr. Oliver abandoned his claims against the Department and the Sexual Offender Advisory Board, converted his claims against employees to individual capacity claims, but maintained his claims against Montgomery County.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173550\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/439/201/#p207\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Additionally, he added three claims brought under \u00a7 1983.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173550\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/439/201/#p207\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In response, both the State and County defendants filed motions to strike the amended complaint. (ECF 13; ECF 14.) Mr. Oliver again filed no response. On June 29, 2018, Mr. Oliver filed a Motion for Leave to Amend. (ECF 15.) Both defendants filed responses opposing the plaintiff's motion. (ECF 16; ECF 17.) Mr. Oliver replied, (ECF 19), and the issues are now ready for ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The defendants in this case assert that granting Mr. Oliver leave to amend would be a futile exercise because his complaint, as amended, fails to state a viable claim. Specifically, they argue, as a threshold matter, that his claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations and are thus untimely. Second, they contend that he fails to plead facts sufficient to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). Third, they put forth affirmative defenses-including qualified immunity-contending that even if the complaint contains facts sufficient to support a claim, they are immunized from suit. Taken together, the second and third grounds demonstrate the proposed amended complaint's futility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Time Bar\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The court is ill-equipped to rule on the plaintiff's continuing violation theory without more facts, and, ultimately, there is no need to do so. The timing dispute here is over the date of accrual. The defendants argue that all claims brought by Mr. Oliver are subject to a three-year deadline. (ECF 10-1 at pp. 6-7; ECF 9-1 at pp. 19-20.) He does not dispute this contention; rather, he asserts that the continuing violation exception or the doctrine of equitable tolling salvage his belated filing. (ECF 19 at p. 12.) Mr. Oliver was first required to register as a sex offender in July 1999. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 29-30.) But because he was sentenced in 1995, when the Maryland Sex Offender Registration Act only applied to \"Child Sexual Offender[s],\" and the victim was over 18 years of age, he objected. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 74.) Mr. Oliver was required to re-register, at regular intervals, through May 5, 2015. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 99.) On May 23, 2015, MSOR staff determined that Mr. Oliver was no longer required to register. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 100.) On May 28, 2015, he was informed that he was no longer required to remain registered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6 71.) This case was filed on February 1, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   There are not, in the record at present, \"all facts necessary\" to dispose of the plaintiff's continuing violation theory.\n   <em>\n    Goodman v.

Denying the plaintiff leave to amend, therefore, would not be appropriate on statute of limitations grounds. \"A continuing violation is occasioned by continual unlawful acts, not continual ill effects from an original violation.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Advert.

The same rule applies under Maryland law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bacon v.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 73-89), and to its retroactivity requirements.\n   <em>\n    Doe I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3716866\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/430/535/#p568\">\n    430 Md. at 545-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3716866\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/430/535/#p568\">\n    62 A.3d 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the defendants' contention that plaintiff knew the facts necessary to pursue his claim on July 22, 1999, (ECF 17 at p. 2), is not necessarily true. Not only were the Act's alterations likely to interfere with the plaintiff's ability to know if and when to sue, but it also was unclear, during the years the plaintiff was registered, whether his registration was even unlawful. While he objected to registration, it was not until\n   <em>\n    Doe I\n   </em>\n   that Maryland's sex offender registration law was held to violate Article 17 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and it has never been held to violate the federal constitution's ex post facto prohibition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3716866\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/430/535/#p568\">\n    430 Md. at 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3716866\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/430/535/#p568\">\n    62 A.3d 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because of the iterative nature of the alleged violation and the numerous changes to the act, the alleged injury is more like the monthly over-charge of rent than the lingering effects of a bygone constitutional violation. And therefore, because facts sufficient to support a continuing violation theory could develop in the course of discovery, the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend is not futile on statute of limitations grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goodman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047463\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/494/458/#p464\">\n    494 F.3d at 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Failure to State a Claim &amp; Affirmative Immunity Defenses\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In their motions opposing leave to amend, the defendants assert that the plaintiff's complaint, even as amended, fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

The plaintiff's Eighth Amendment claims, for example, rise and fall with his Ex Post Facto Clause claim. The plaintiff alleges that his ongoing inclusion in the Maryland Sex Offender Registry and the requirement that he re-register violate the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. (Am.

In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Given the foregoing discussion of the predicate constitutional violations in the plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case, there remains a slim possibility that the plaintiff's constitutional rights were, in fact, violated. There is no possibility, by contrast, that the rights allegedly violated were clearly established at the time of the purported violation. Explicating this second prong, the Supreme Court explained that a right is clearly established when \"its contours [are] sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.\"\n   <em>\n    Hope v.

MSOR officials removed Mr. Oliver from the registry within a year of the Maryland Court of Appeals decision in\n   <em>\n    Doe II\n   </em>\n   , despite the fact that he still met the definition of a sex offender under SORNA. This shows only an intent to remain on the right side of a developing area in the law. More importantly, if any constitutional violation occurred in this case, it was not clearly established at the time. Mr. Oliver has neither pleaded nor proffered in his memoranda any facts to show that a reasonable official would know Mr. Oliver's registration violated a constitutional right, any facts to show that pre-existing law demonstrated the unlawfulness of the defendants' action, or any facts to show the defendants had, or should have had, any warning that their conduct was less than in full compliance with the dictates of the constitution. As set forth above, the Supreme Court and the Fourth Circuit have upheld similar retroactive registration requirements. Even assuming the MSOR could be held to be punitive under the test announced in\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Doe\n   </em>\n   , knowledge of that fact cannot be imputed to the defendants during the time of Mr. Oliver's registration. Because the plaintiff's right not to\n   be listed in the MSOR was not clearly established at the time the alleged violation occurred, qualified immunity insulates the individual defendants in this case from liability under \u00a7 1983.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    ii. State Law Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In addition to his constitutional claims, Mr. Oliver alleges that the defendants violated his rights under the Maryland Constitution. Specifically, he alleges a deprivation of his rights under Declaration of Rights Article 24, Article 17, and Article 25. The first is brought as a standalone claim. (Count III). The latter two are included within his federal constitutional claims. (Count IV and Count V).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

Indeed, there is no mention of the LGTCA in his proposed amended complaint. Second, while Mr. Oliver attaches a letter dated April 6, 2016, from the County defendants purportedly acknowledging notice of his claim, there is no way to ascertain from all the plaintiff's filings whether he adhered to the 180-day deadline.

The notice period of 180 days would have expired January 30, 2016. The plaintiff should have pled his compliance with the LGTCA in his first complaint; and he should have pled his compliance with the LGTCA in his proposed amended complaint, once the County defendants raised the argument in their motion to dismiss. But he did not. Instead, Mr. Oliver acknowledged the argument for the first time in his Reply to his motion for leave to amend, and even there failed to sufficiently allege compliance with \u00a7 5-304. The April 6, 2016, letter from the County that is attached to the Reply is too little too late. The plaintiff's state law claims against Montgomery County and its officers would not survive a motion to dismiss, and thus granting the plaintiff leave to amend his state law claims against the County and its officers would be futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    iii.

Therefore, plaintiff's motion for leave to amend will be denied. The unopposed motions to strike the amended complaint filed without leave of court also will be granted. And the defendants' initial motions to dismiss, opposed only by the attempt to file an amended complaint, prevail for the same reasons the amended complaint would be futile. Accordingly, those motions also will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   A separate order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Additionally, \"if a pleading is one to which a responsive pleading is required, [a party may amend its pleading within] 21 days after service of a responsive pleading or 21 days after service of a motion under Rule 12(b), (e), or (f), whichever is earlier.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(1)(B).
