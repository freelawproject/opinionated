Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This action arises from a dispute over real property located at 1741 Choice Hills Drive, Henderson, Nevada 89012 (\"the property\"). (ECF No. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Theresa Wingender purchased the property on July 6, 2001. (ECF No. 68-2). Wingender financed the purchase with a loan in the amount of $562,500.00 from World Savings Bank, FSB (\"WSB\"). (ECF No. 68-1). WSB secured the loan with a deed of trust, which names WSB as both the lender and beneficiary, and Golden West Savings Association Service Company as the trustee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In December 2007, WSB changed its name to Wachovia Mortage, FSB (\"Wachovia\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On November 1, 2009, Wachovia merged into Wells Fargo.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, Wells Fargo has been at all times relevant to this action the been the beneficiary of the deed of trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 16, 2011, Foothills at MacDonald Ranch Master Association (\"Foothills\"), through its agent defendant Homeowner Association Services, Inc. (\"HAS\"), recorded a notice of delinquent assessment lien (\"the lien\") against the property for Wingender's failure to pay Foothills in the amount of $19,454.00. (ECF No. 68-2). On August 29, 2012, Foothills recorded a notice of default and election to sell pursuant to the lien, stating that the amount due was $22,129.69 as of August 29, 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 6, 2012, Foothills mailed copies of the notice of default and election to sell to WSB at two different addresses specified in the deed of trust: (1) 1901 Harrison Street, Oakland, California 94612; and (2) P.O. Box 859548, San Antonio,\n   Texas 78265.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Wells Fargo acknowledges receiving the copy sent to the Oakland address. (ECF No. 68).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On August 12, 2013, Foothills recorded a notice of foreclosure sale against the property, stating that a payment of $33,877.90 would be necessary to satisfy the lien. (ECF No. 68-2). On August 8, 2013, Foothills mailed copies of the notice of foreclosure sale to WSB at both the Oakland and San Antonio addresses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, Wells Fargo denies ever receiving copies of the notice of foreclosure sale. (ECF No. 68).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 26, 2013, Foothills sold the property in a nonjudicial foreclosure sale to SFR in exchange for $56,000.00. (ECF No 68-1). On January 14, 2014, SFR recorded the deed of foreclosure with the Clark County recorder's office.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On September 26, 2016, Wells Fargo filed a complaint, alleging six causes of action: (1) declaratory relief under the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment against all defendants; (2) declaratory relief under the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments against all defendants; (3) wrongful foreclosure against all defendants; (4) violation of NRS 116.1113\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   against Foothills and HAS; (5) unjust enrichment against Foothills and SFR; and (6) quiet title against all defendants. (ECF No. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Now, SFR and Wells Fargo have filed cross-motions for summary judgment, requesting that the court resolve whether the foreclosure sale extinguished the deed of trust.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Before the court are several motions. First, the court will set aside the entry of default against Transunion as the court can reasonably resolve this case on the merits. Second, the court will resolve the cross motions for summary judgment in favor of SFR because Chapter 116 is not unconstitutional and Wells Fargo received adequate notice of the foreclosure sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    a. Entry of default\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(c) provides that \"[t]he court may set aside an entry of default for good cause ...\" Fed. Ru. Civ. P. 55(c). To determine if good cause exists, the court considers: \"(1) whether the party seeking to set aside the default engaged in culpable conduct that led to the default; (2) whether it had no meritorious defense; or (3) whether reopening the default judgment would prejudice the other party.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Signed Personal Check No. 730 of Yubran S. Mesle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3711722\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/615/1085/#p1091\">\n    615 F.3d 1085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1091 (9th Cir. 2010) (quotes and citation omitted). \"[J]udgment by default is a drastic step appropriate only in extreme circumstances; a case should, whenever possible, be decided on the merits.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3711722\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/615/1085/#p1091\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   While the court considers the same factors prior to vacating an entry of default as it would for a default judgment, the test is less stringent when the court has not entered default judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hawaii Carpenters' Trust Funds v.

Transunion was not aware of this action until July 2018 due the mistakes of a third party, Transunion does not possess any interest in the property, prejudice is unlikely to result, and Wells Fargo has not opposed the motion to set aside entry of default.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LR 7-2(d)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (\"[T]he failure of an opposing party to file points and authorities in response to any motion shall constitute a consent to the granting of the motion.\").
