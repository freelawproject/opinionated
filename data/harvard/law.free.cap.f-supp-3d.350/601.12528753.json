Basically, the heater prepared a naphtha stream for additional refining by sending the high-volume and high-pressure stream through a snaking series of pipes within a box-shaped furnace. One of the pipe segments burst. The parties differ over how to describe the precise sequence; suffice it to say the heater refractory suffered significant damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Continental subsequently sought recovery for certain damages under its Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company (HSB) insurance policy for Equipment Breakdown Coverage (EBC).

HSB explicitly told the Court that \"until receiving Continental's response [to the summary judgment motion], given the reality of the charge heater along with Continental's admission and the 30(b)(6) testimony, HSB had no clue that there was any issue in anyone's mind that the F-2001 Charge Heather was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a steam boiler, steam piping, steam engine, steam turbine, or any other type of steam vessel.\" DE # 35, at 3 n.2 (emphasis in original).

Boilers, yes. Heaters, no.\"). Mariscalco did not say BLEVEs happen exclusively in steam boilers; in fact, he explicitly differentiated between \"Steam boiler BLEVEs and Charge Heater BLEVEs,\" DE # 33-3, at \u00b6\u00b6 5-7, thus recognizing that steam boilers and charge heaters (such as the F-2001) are distinct pieces of equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In this context, the Court accepts the event version depicted by Continental expert Mariscalco. He, a PE, unequivocally attributes the losses at issue to a BLEVE, a \"boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion.\" DE # 28-9, at 5-6. In particular, \"It can thus be reasonably concluded that the pipe burst incident resulted in a BLEVE-type, high energy mechanical explosion ... and that explosion damaged both the F-2001 sidewall refractory and stacked floor brickwork.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Inarguably, Mariscalco attributes the harm to the explosion-\"The damage to the refractory walls and floor was caused by the pipe burst mechanical explosion, and subsequent high pressure impact forces.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 \u00b66. The pipe rupture began the short chain of events, but the BLEVE, per the expert, followed the rupture and directly caused the damages claimed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Policy excludes all explosions, except for non-combustion explosions of \"steam boilers, steam piping, steam engines or steam turbines.\" The exclusion language is clear and stresses: \"We [HSB] will not pay for loss ... caused directly or indirectly by any of the following, whether or not caused by or resulting from an 'accident.' \" DE # 1-1, at 22 \u00a7 B.1. Thus, if an excluded explosion directly or indirectly caused the loss, HSB has no obligation to pay for such loss, even if the explosion was one \"caused by or resulting from\" the pipe section bursting. That is just the causal sequence Mariscalco depicts. DE # 28-9, at 11 \u00b6 4 (\"The explosion caused by the pipe burst incident created pressures and forces sufficient to damage [the property at issue.]\"). The actual manner in which the loss occurred means that the loss from the explosion is outside the risk of the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Return to the policy language. Again, it plainly excludes coverage not only for \"[c]ombustion explosion,\" but also for \"any other explosion, except as provided in\n   A.1.a.(3).\" DE # 1-1, at 22 (Section B.1.a.3). Because, as Plaintiff admitted, the F-2001 Charge Heater is not a steam boiler, steam piping, steam engine or steam turbine, it, perforce, does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   fall within A.1.a.3's reach (regardless of any other case issue). This means, applying the contract, that B.1.a.3's \"except\" phrase is inapplicable and that this event\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   fall within B.1.a.3's catch-all explosion exclusion. Indeed, to that point, Haseotes-Continental's chief voice-could not explain the company's theory, and had no opinion, \"as to why the policy's fire, smoke or explosion exclusions don't apply here.\" DE # 28-1, at 32 (Depo. p. 126). \"[A]ny applicable exclusion is sufficient to remove coverage,\" and the B.1.a.3 exclusion, coupled with the other Section B language, \"clearly defines the coverage\" here.\n   <em>\n    Kemper Nat'l Ins.

First, Plaintiff cites no authority for the lack-of-expert-proof argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE # 33, at 13. The question whether the F-2001 is a \"steam boiler, steam piping, steam engine or steam turbine\" is factual, and Continental's admission is dispositive.

Regardless, Plaintiff cites no case proof suggesting that a non-excluded \"peril [wa]s the efficient and dominant cause\" of damage.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *7. The parties do not fully develop this argument, but the key, to the Court, would be evaluating Plaintiff's theory in light of the clause, which purports to resolve by contract (rather than the default law) the causation measurement. The briefing does not do that, and the Court does not rule premised on the anti-concurrent causation clause.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    An alternative reading (although Continental does not advocate for this-indeed, on the cited page, it reads the provision as does the Court) simply is a grammatical non-starter. If the parties had intended the provision to cover, for instance,\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    explosions other than combustion explosions of steam boilers, steam piping, steam engines or steam turbines, they would have omitted the comma following \"combustion explosion.\" Such a reading would also result in internal contract inconsistencies; for example, the policy would cover\n    <em>\n     some\n    </em>\n    combustion explosions in A.1.a.3, but exclude\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    combustion explosions in B.1.a.2. The parties surely did not intend such a self-defeating absurdity. Continental confirmed as much in the briefing, and HSB certainly views (in the briefing) and viewed the policy that way.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    DE # 33-2, at 94 (Depo. p. 93) (\"Well, I mean, the only type of explosion we cover is a steam explosion.\"). This solidifies, to the Court, the provision's clarity.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    \"Under the doctrine of reasonable expectations,\" which Continental repeatedly invokes, \"an insured is entitled to all the coverage he may reasonably expect to be provided\n    <em>\n     according to the terms of the policy.\n    </em>\n    \"\n    <em>\n     Ky.

This is unpersuasive. This case is all about application of the policy, and HSB copied policy language word-for-word in the request for admission. Indeed, earlier requests in the same document\n    <em>\n     did\n    </em>\n    explicitly note the policy at issue.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    DE # 37-1, at 1-2 (Requests Nos. 1 &amp; 2). The Court fails to see how the specific request not explicitly referencing the policy makes any difference, and Continental cites no authority for the contention. This further underscores that (as discussed in more detail later in this Opinion) Continental admitted a\n    <em>\n     fact\n    </em>\n    (as opposed to,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , a legal position on the meaning of a contract term).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    HSB explained that the parties had used \"steam vessel\" as \"shorthand for the actual policy provision\" before HSB \"had any idea that Continental would dispute its previous admission[.]\" DE # 35, at 7;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    DE # 28, at 1 n.2 (using this shorthand pre-dispute).

Those are separate matters from whether (even if there was gas or vapor involved) the F-2001 Charge Heater is a steam boiler, steam piping, steam engine or steam turbine-a factual question QEI did not address. The report does not even include the word \"steam,\" save for in two mentions of Defendant's name.
