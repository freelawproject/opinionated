Hegarty, United States Magistrate Judge\n   Plaintiffs initiated this employment action on October 30, 2015, against their former employer, Defendant Vectrus Systems Corp. (\"Vectrus\"), alleging that they suffered adverse employment actions in retaliation for reporting to the United States military what they believed to be conduct by Defendant that adversely affected security at Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan. This case was tried to a jury for common law retaliatory termination (Claim I) (all Plaintiffs) and violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n    10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Department of Defense whistleblower statute (Claim II) (Plaintiff Walker). The jury found for Defendant on Plaintiff Cross's claim and for the remaining Plaintiffs under both the common law claims (all Plaintiffs) and the statutory claim (Plaintiff Walker). In the interim, Plaintiff Cross has settled with Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Here, Defendant seeks judgment as a matter of law on Plaintiffs Wascher's and Walker's theory of constructive discharge, which was used to support their respective claims for retaliatory discharge in violation of public policy and Walker's statutory whistleblower claim. ECF No. 318. Defendant argues that a constructive discharge theory is untenable here, because these Plaintiffs admitted at trial they were laid off by Defendant. Even though Plaintiffs did testify to that effect, I deny Defendant's motion, because I find that Plaintiffs' claims for constructive discharge in violation of public policy under Colorado law and under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n    10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   are supported both by the law and the evidence presented over fifteen trial days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b) provides that \"[n]o later than 28 days after the entry of judgment... the movant may file a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law....\" Fed.

To prove constructive discharge under Colorado law, \"a plaintiff must present sufficient evidence establishing deliberate action on the part of an employer which makes or allows an employee's working conditions to become so difficult or intolerable that the employee has no other choice but to resign.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

In other words, Defendant pursues a theory that these two Plaintiffs were terminated, they did not resign, and that judgment must be entered against them because they have painted themselves in a corner by pursuing a constructive discharge theory. Defendant also contends that the second element (intolerability) is not satisfied because even assuming Plaintiffs did resign, the evidence at trial was insufficient for a rational jury to find that their transfer to other operating bases in October 2013 or Defendant's offer of an alternative Biometric Clerk position to them was so intolerable that they had no choice but to resign. Finally, Defendant argues that the doctrine of judicial estoppel precludes Plaintiff Wascher from even bringing a constructive discharge claim. I disagree for a host of reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. There Was Sufficient Evidence for a Jury to Find That Plaintiffs Had No Choice but to Resign Due to Difficult or Intolerable Conditions.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As a threshold matter, Defendant puts undue emphasis on Plaintiffs' own characterization of their separation from employment. The terminology used by a plaintiff is \"not dispositive\" of whether separation amounts to a constructive discharge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Romero v. Helmerich &amp; Payne Int'l Drilling Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-cv-00720-NYW,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203608194\">\n    2017 WL 3608194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (D. Colo. Aug. 22, 2017) (\n   <em>\n    Romero I\n   </em>\n   ). In\n   <em>\n    Romero I\n   </em>\n   , the Honorable Nina Y. Wang also evaluated constructive discharge in the context of a claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. In denying the defendant's summary judgment motion, the court stated that the employee's \"testimony that he was fired, viewed within the context of all of his testimony, is not dispositive of whether he was constructively discharged.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. The court took \"a step back from the semantics of 'fired' versus 'quit,' \" and \"consider[ed] the general remedial nature of the Colorado common law claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Furthermore, I believe it would be error to grant judgment as a matter of law here because the evidence is susceptible to multiple interpretations. The facts of this case, including the evidence of Defendant's treatment of Plaintiffs after the whistleblowing events, adequately support both a resignation and a constructive discharge claim. The Tenth Circuit's discussion in\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. United Parcel Service, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5583793\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/555/1224/\">\n    555 F.3d 1224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2009), is particularly instructive and supports my conclusion. The issue there was whether an employee who turned in her company laptop and informed her supervisor she was leaving intended to end her employment, when she later testified she did not believe she had quit or resigned at that time.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5583793\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/555/1224/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5583793\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/555/1224/\">\n    at 1227-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reversing the district court's grant of judgment as a matter of law in the employer's favor, the Tenth Circuit made clear that some ambiguity within an employee's testimony does not automatically defeat a constructive discharge claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court granted judgment as a matter of law because it concluded Strickland did not intend to terminate her employment when she stopped working. Parts of her testimony supported\n   such a finding. Other parts of her testimony, however, revealed ambiguity on the issue. Strickland testified she would not return if she had to work for Roten. She also testified she was \"done\" and \"at her wits end.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The existence of constructive discharge is an issue of fact to be resolved by the jury, and judgment as a matter of law is only appropriate if the evidence is susceptible to but one interpretation. The testimony here is susceptible to multiple interpretations. A jury could find Strickland intended only to take temporary leave. On the other hand, a jury could alternatively find she left UPS with no intention of returning to work under Roten. While she expressed a hope that UPS would offer her a different position where she would have no contact with Roten, such a hope did not necessarily negate her intent to permanently stop working in her former position. Since the evidence could have been interpreted by a reasonable jury in Strickland's favor, the district court erred in granting judgment as a matter of law to UPS on the issue of constructive discharge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5583793\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/555/1224/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1228-29 (citing\n   <em>\n    Riske v.

Regardless of the characterizations used during Plaintiffs' own trial testimony and any resulting ambiguities, I believe there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find that the Plaintiffs did resign-and indeed the jury so found. Of great importance at trial were Exhibits 211 and 234, Plaintiffs Walker's and Wascher's separation documents. On May 27, 2014, Wascher was offered a demotion and given the option to accept or to decline it. The declination language in his separation document was as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Job Offer Declination\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   I decline the conditions of employment as stated above, with the understanding that it will result in separation and demobilization no later than June 1, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Pls.' Trial Ex. 234. Walker signed a similar letter with the same \"Job Offer Declination\" (but a different separation date) on July 8, 2014. Pls' Trial Ex. 211. Walker and Wascher signed these documents knowing they were separating from the company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Language later in Plaintiff Wascher's letter lends further support to the jury's constructive discharge finding. On the third page of Exhibit 234, Defendant asked Wascher the following question: \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     WHAT IS YOUR PRIMARY REASON FOR LEAVING EXELIS MISSION SYSTEM? (SELECT FROM BELOW):\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   Personal issues/reasons.\" Pls' Trial Ex. 234 at 234-003. It would not make sense for Defendant to ask why Wascher was leaving the company if it did not construe what was happening to be a resignation; there would be no other purpose for such a question. After all, if the company was terminating Wascher, it already would have known the reason for separation.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    The evidence at trial was that Plaintiffs Walker and Wascher conflated resignation and termination, believing ultimately that the company simply intended to terminate them. Other employees testified consistent with this state of affairs. Particularly revealing was the testimony (upon cross examination by defense counsel) of Kelly Harris, a Vectrus employee who had been assigned first to Bagram and who then spent several years at Forward Operating Base Shank:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n    Q.

As noted above, Defendant asserts that because Plaintiffs testified they were terminated, they failed to establish a wrongful termination claim through a constructive discharge theory. Although the state of Colorado law on this issue is not entirely clear, the outcome most consistent with the policy behind a wrongful termination claim is that a wrongful separation from employment permits recovery, regardless of whether an employee pleads a wrongful termination or constructive discharge.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    My research shows that the first Colorado case to adopt the concept of \"constructive discharge\" for employment cases was\n    <em>\n     Colorado Civil Rights Commission v.

In such a circumstance, the fact of \"voluntary\" resignation does not necessarily bar the claim for wrongful discharge. An employee can recover for being \"\n    <em>\n     constructively\n    </em>\n    discharged\" upon a proper factual showing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Subsequent Colorado cases do not draw a clear line of demarcation between a constructive discharge and a termination.

And my review of Colorado law does not draw such a mechanical boundary between wrongful termination and constructive discharge claims.

I do not see a clear inconsistency between Wascher's trial testimony and his statement to the unemployment bureau-particularly given that an employee's characterization of his separation is not dispositive, as established above. Besides, the Tenth Circuit has imposed a restriction that \"judicial estoppel only applies when the position to be estopped is one of fact, not one of law.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     BancInsure\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5768383\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/796/1226/#p1239\">\n     796 F.3d at 1240\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Defendant has not convinced me that the statements it juxtaposes are actually factual, as opposed to legal. At a minimum, Defendant is asking me to attribute a legal significance to Wascher's factual statements, which seems to cross (or at least blur) an impermissible line. For all of these reasons, I conclude judicial estoppel does not provide a basis for judgment as a matter of law in Defendant's favor.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      CONCLUSION\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    In sum, the jury reasonably concluded based on the record in this case that Plaintiffs Walker and Wascher resigned from their employment and proved a claim for constructive discharge. Specifically, the \"job offer declination\" Plaintiffs signed could reasonably be interpreted as a resignation from employment. I will not disturb the jury's factual finding on this issue.
