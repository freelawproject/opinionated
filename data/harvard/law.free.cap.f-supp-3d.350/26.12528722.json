(Docket Nos. 4, 55, 63, 69, 71 and 72.) Bancr\u00e9dito moves for an order to show cause as to why this action should not be dismissed for failure to join an indispensable party pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(7) and 19.

On July 10, 2018, Flowers contacted Bancr\u00e9dito in his capacity as Choice Bank's liquidator and asserted ownership of all remaining funds in Choice Financial's account. (Docket No. 59 at p. 7.) The Central Bank of Belize provided Bancr\u00e9dito with a letter confirming that Flowers is Choice Bank's liquidator. (Docket No. 41, Ex. 5.) Although the letter referenced \"on-going litigation with Choice Bank Limited and Choice Financial International,\" the Central Bank of Belize \"made no mention of [Flowers'] purported authority over [Choice Financial].\" (Docket No. 41, Ex. 5 at p. 2; Docket No. 59 at p. 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Choice Financial subsequently informed Bancr\u00e9dito that Choice Bank and Choice Financial are two separate legal entities, and that Bancr\u00e9dito \"is not authorized to pay the balances in [Choice Financial's] account to Choice Bank, Choice Bank's Liquidator or any other third party.\" (Docket No. 59 at p. 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Faced with competing claims over the remaining $1,642,200.00 in Choice Financial's account, Bancr\u00e9dito filed a complaint for interpleader against Flowers and Choice Financial.

Bancr\u00e9dito denied any \"interest over the Balance of Deposited Funds, and ... simply sought to comply with its obligation to release said funds to the rightful owner.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=P.R.%20Laws%20Ann.%20tit.%2031%2C%20%C2%A7%202994\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=P.R.%20Laws%20Ann.%20tit.%2031%2C%20%C2%A7%202994\">\n    at p. 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

(Docket No. 62.) On August 15, 2018, Flowers removed Choice Financial's directors and appointed himself as the sole director. (Docket No. 69, Ex. 2.) Indeed, the Puerto Rico Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions (\"OFCI\") confirmed that Choice Financial is a \"wholly owned subsidiary of [Choice Bank].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docket No. 69, Ex. 3 at p. 1.)

Flowers reiterated his request to withdraw Choice Bank's funds and that Bancr\u00e9dito transfer the funds from Choice Financials' account. (Docket Nos. 63 and 69.) Flowers also moved to dismiss Bancr\u00e9dito's complaint for interpleader, because Choice Bank and Choice Financial \"are not adverse and do not have conflicting claims.\" (Docket No. 71 at p. 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Tellingly, Bancr\u00e9dito refrained from opposing Flowers' motions to withdraw funds\n   and to dismiss the complaint for interpleader. Flowers requested that the Court deem these motions as unopposed. (Docket No. 72.) Bancr\u00e9dito responded only that Flowers \"is not entitled to any [accrued] interests in this case.\" (Docket No. 73 at p. 2.) Flowers subsequently withdrew his request for \"any interests that could have accrued over [Choice Financial's] Funds and limit[ed] its request ... to the interests accrued over [Choice Bank's] Funds since its consignment, as they have been deposited in an interest-bearing account, pursuant to Local Rule 67(b).\" (Docket No. 76 at p. 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Flowers is entitled to the funds deposited in Choice Bank and Choice Financial's accounts. Choice Bank failed to overcome the liquidity crisis referred to in its motion for a preliminary injunction, prompting the Bank of Belize to revoke its banking license and to appoint Flowers as liquidator.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 4. The Court is satisfied that Choice Financial is subject to Flowers' control as Choice Bank's liquidator. Accordingly, the Clerk of the Court will disburse the following amount that was deposited into an interest-bearing account to Cedric D. Flowers: $12,726,460.80. The Court\n   <strong>\n    ORDERS\n   </strong>\n   Bancr\u00e9dito to transfer the $1,642,200.00 in Choice Financial's account to Cedric D. Flowers in his capacity as Choice Bank's liquidator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The causes of action set forth by Choice Bank and Bancr\u00e9dito are dismissed.
