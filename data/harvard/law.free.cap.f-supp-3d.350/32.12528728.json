(\"Vitalife\") requests that the Court enforce the settlement agreement between Vitalife and defendant Omniguide, Inc. (\"Omniguide\"). (Docket No. 51.) For the reasons set forth below, Vitalife's motion to enforce the settlement agreement is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 23, 2018, Vitalife commenced a civil action against Omniguide in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico Court of First Instance, San Juan Superior Division (\"Commonwealth of Puerto Rico litigation\"). Docket No. 19, Ex. 1;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vitalife, Inc. v. Omniguide, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Civil No. SJ2018-CV-3440. Vitalife amended its complaint on the following day, setting forth two causes of action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   First, Vitalife alleged that Omniguide violated an exclusive distribution agreement in contravention of Puerto Rico Law 75, P.R. Laws. Ann. tit. 10, sections 278\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . (\"Law 75\"). (Docket No. 19, Ex. 1. at p. 7.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, Vitalife avers that Omniguide failed to perform the exclusive distribution agreement in good faith.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=P.R.%20Laws%20Ann.%20tit.%2010%2C%20%C2%A7%203375\">\n    P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10, \u00a7 3375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Two days before the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico litigation commenced, Omniguide filed suit against Vitalife in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (\"District of Massachusetts litigation.\" Docket No. 10 at p. 2; citing\n   <em>\n    Omniguide, Inc. v. Vitalife, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Case 18-11073. In the District of Massachusetts litigation, Omniguide requested a declaratory judgment confirming that \"Omniguide has a valid right to sell its products directly to customers in Puerto Rico.\" (Docket No. 10, Ex. 1 at p. 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 5, 2018, Omniguide removed the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico litigation to this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. section 1446. (Docket No. 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties engaged in unduly contentious motion practice concerning discovery disputes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 8, 10, 21, 29, 32, 36, 40, 42, 43 and 45. The Court intervened, striking nine motions from the docket and prohibiting additional filings until the parties submitted their Joint Case Management Memorandum. (Docket No. 46.) Ultimately, Vitalife and Omniguide filed the Joint Case Management Memorandum three months after the notice of removal. (Docket No. 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Vitalife requests that the Court enforce a settlement agreement that the parties allegedly entered into prior to the September 28, 2018 initial scheduling conference. (Docket No. 51.) Omniguide opposed Vitalife's motion, contending that \"the parties did not reach a settlement agreement.\" (Docket No. 54 at p. 4; Docket No. 62.) The Court agrees. Because there is no settlement agreement to enforce, Vitalife's motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The record demonstrates that although the parties stood on the precipice of a settlement agreement, they failed to achieve a meeting of the minds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    K-Mart Corp. v.

(finding that the parties did not reach a final contract because the text of the agreement evidenced the defendant's intent not to be bound until the parties had finalized negotiations). Vitalife and Omniguide's outward manifestations, not their subjective intent, inform the Court's analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bushkin Associates, Inc. v. Raytheon Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"519437\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/815/142/\">\n    815 F.2d 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Cir. 1987) (\"Contracts depend on objective manifestations of consent and not on uncommunicated subjective expectations.\"). Consequently, only the communications between Vitalife, Omniguide and the Court are relevant. What the parties thought or believed to have occurred are immaterial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. There is No Settlement Agreement to Enforce\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The parties participated in a telephone settlement conference on September 27, 2018. (Docket No. 51, Ex. 11.) Vitalife contends\n   that the parties agreed to settle all claims in exchange for:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Omniguide's repurchase of Vitalife's CO2 laser for $40,000.00, without any warranties and based on 'as is, where is' terms, plus a cash payment of $70,000.00, plus the exchange of mutual general releases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (Docket No. 51, Ex. 12 at p. 5.) Omniguide, however, asserts that it agreed to purchase the laser \"as is\" with \"assurance from Vitalife that it was in good working condition.\" (Docket No. 62, Ex. 1 at p. 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The initial scheduling conference occurred on September 28, 2018. (Docket No. 48.) Although Vitalife \"[thought] the parties reached a settlement,\" Omniguide stipulated that \"[t]here [was] still a small part of the whole thing related to an equipment that is going to be shipped to the company. And depending on that, [the case] will be closed.\" (Docket No. 61 at p. 2.) The Court granted Vitalife's request for 30 days to finalize the terms of the settlement agreement. (Docket No. 48; Docket No. 61 at p. 4.) Omniguide anticipated that the parties would file \"separate motions for voluntary dismissal in Massachusetts and Puerto Rico.\" (Docket No. 61 at p. 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Vitalife's contention that a settlement \"agreement was recorded in the Court's Minute\" is misguided. (Docket No. 51 at p. 8.) The mere mention of an \"agreement\" in the minute entry is no substitution for the memorialization of a contract. (Docket No. 51.) Had a settlement agreement existed on the day of the initial scheduling conference, Vitalife would not have requested an additional \"30 days to finalize the terms and inform the Court.\" (Docket No. 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Instead of submitting the \"finalized\" terms to the Court, Omniguide and Vitalife identified two points of contention. First, the shipment and condition of the laser remained subject to further negotiation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2. Second, the parties conditioned settlement of this action on the simultaneous dismissal of the District of Massachusetts litigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 4. Concurrence on some terms, but not others, negates the existence of a settlement agreement between Omniguide and Vitalife.\n   <em>\n    SeeShelly v. Trafalgar House.
