Specifically, the government points to two provisions of this treaty: Article 3, which calls on the signatories to \"ensure the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of all civil and political\n   rights set forth in the present Covenant\"; and Article 24, which states that \"[e]very child shall have, without any discrimination as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, national or social origin, property or birth, the right to such measures of protection as are required by his status as a minor, on the part of his family, society and the State.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The government argues that Congress, by enacting the FGM statute, acted reasonably to carry out these two treaty obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court rejects the government's argument for two reasons. First, there is no rational relationship between the FGM statute and Article 3, which obligates member states \"to ensure the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of all civil and political rights set forth in the present Covenant.\" This article seeks to ensure equal civil and political rights (e.g., the freedom of expression, the right to participate in elections, and protections for defendants in criminal proceedings) for men and women, while the FGM statute seeks to protect girls aged seventeen and younger from a particular form of physical abuse. There is simply no rational relationship between Article 3 and the FGM statute. The latter does not effectuate the purposes of the former in any way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The relationship between the FGM statute and Article 24 is arguably closer. As noted, that article states that \"[e]very child shall have, without any discrimination as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, national or social origin, property or birth, the right to such measures of protection as are required by his status as a minor, on the part of his family, society and the State.\" Still, the relationship between the FGM statute and Article 24 is tenuous. Article 24 is an anti-discrimination provision, which calls for the protection of minors without regard to their race, color, sex, or other characteristics. As laudable as the prohibition of a particular type of abuse of girls may be, it does not logically further the goal of protecting children on a nondiscriminatory basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Second, even assuming the treaty and the FGM statute are rationally related, federalism concerns deprive Congress of the power to enact this statute. In adopting the ICCPR, each member state obligated itself to \"take the necessary steps, in accordance with its constitutional processes ... to adopt such laws or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to the rights recognized in the present Covenant.\" ICCPR Art. 2 \u00b6 2. The constitutional processes in the United States include the important - indeed, foundational - division of authority between the states and the federal government, as recognized in the report of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, which recommended that the Senate ratify this treaty subject to various reservations, understandings, and declarations. One of these understandings was\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [t]hat the United States understands that this Convention shall be implemented by the Federal Government to the extent that it exercises legislative and judicial jurisdiction over the matters covered therein, and otherwise by the state and local governments; to the extent that state and local governments exercise jurisdiction over such matters, the Federal Government shall take measures appropriate to the Federal\n   system to the end that the competent authorities of the state or local governments may take appropriated [sic] measures for the fulfillment of the Convention.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defs.' Ex. S at 23 (Report of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations dated Mar. 2, 1992). This understanding comported with one recommended by the Bush Administration,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6159097\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/354/1/#p16\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6159097\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/354/1/#p16\">\n    at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which offered the following explanation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   In light of Article 50 (\"The provisions of the present Covenant shall extend to all parts of federal States without any limitations or exceptions\"), it is appropriate to clarify that, even though the Covenant will apply to state and local authorities, it will be implemented consistent with U.S. concepts of federalism.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The proposed understanding serves to emphasize domestically that there is no intent to alter the constitutional balance of authority between the State and Federal governments or to use the provisions of the Covenant to \"federalize\" matters now within the competence of the States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6159097\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/354/1/#p16\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6159097\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/354/1/#p16\">\n    at 17-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   One aspect of this constitutional balance is that the \"States possess primary authority for defining and enforcing the criminal law.\"\n   <em>\n    Brecht v.

In that case, defendant was charged with violating the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act, which Congress passed to effectuate the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling, and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction. The Court found it unnecessary to rule on the constitutionality of the statute, as it determined that defendant's use of certain chemicals did not come within the statute's definition of a chemical weapon. Nonetheless, the Court's comments on the federalism issue bear repeating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   There is no reason to think the sovereign nations that ratified the Convention were interested in anything like Bond's common law assault.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Even if the treaty does reach that far, nothing prevents Congress from implementing the Convention in the same manner it legislates with respect to innumerable other matters-\n   <em>\n    observing the Constitution's division of responsibility between sovereigns and leaving the prosecution of purely local crimes to the States\n   </em>\n   . The Convention, after all, is agnostic between enforcement at the state versus federal level: It provides that \"[e]ach State Party shall, in accordance\n   with its constitutional processes, adopt the necessary measures to implement its obligations under this Convention.\" Art. VII(1), 1974 U.N.T.S. 331 (emphasis added); see also Tabassi, National Implementation: Article VII, in Kenyon &amp; Feakes 205, 207 (\"Since the creation of national law, the enforcement of it and the structure and administration of government are all sovereign acts reserved exclusively for [State Parties], it is not surprising that the Convention is so vague on the critical matter of national implementation.\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Fortunately, we have no need to interpret the scope of the Convention in this case. Bond was prosecuted under section 229, and the statute-unlike the Convention-must be read consistent with principles of federalism inherent in our constitutional structure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The Convention provides for implementation by each ratifying nation \"in accordance with its constitutional processes.\" Art. VII(1), 1974 U.N.T.S. 331. As James Madison explained, the constitutional process in our \"compound republic\" keeps power \"divided between two distinct governments.\" The Federalist No. 51, p. 323 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). If section 229 reached Bond's conduct, it would mark a dramatic departure from that constitutional structure and a serious reallocation of criminal law enforcement authority between the Federal Government and the States. Absent a clear statement of that purpose, we will not presume Congress to have authorized such a stark intrusion into traditional state authority.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 856, 866,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12580944,12707009\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2077/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2077\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

The Government argues that possession of a firearm in a school zone may result in violent crime and that violent crime can be expected to affect the functioning of the national economy in two ways. First, the costs of violent crime are substantial, and, through the mechanism of insurance, those costs are spread throughout the population. Second, violent crime reduces the willingness of individuals to travel to areas within the country that are perceived to be unsafe. The Government also argues that the presence of guns in schools poses a substantial threat to the educational process by threatening the learning environment. A handicapped educational process, in turn, will result in a less productive citizenry. That, in turn, would have an adverse effect on the Nation's economic well-being. As a result, the Government argues that Congress could rationally have concluded\n   that \u00a7 922(q) substantially affects interstate commerce.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   We pause to consider the implications of the Government's arguments. The Government admits, under its \"costs of crime\" reasoning, that Congress could regulate not only all violent crime, but all activities that might lead to violent crime, regardless of how tenuously they relate to interstate commerce. Similarly, under the Government's \"national productivity\" reasoning, Congress could regulate any activity that it found was related to the economic productivity of individual citizens: family law (including marriage, divorce, and child custody), for example. Under the theories that the Government presents in support of \u00a7 922(q), it is difficult to perceive any limitation on federal power, even in areas such as criminal law enforcement or education where States historically have been sovereign.

As in\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   , the Court rejected the government's explanations as to how violent crime may affect interstate commerce. The Court quotes this passage at length because the reasoning applies equally to the present case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   In contrast with the lack of congressional findings that we faced in\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   , [the VAWA] is supported by numerous findings regarding the serious impact that gender-motivated violence has on victims and their families. But the existence of congressional findings is not sufficient, by itself, to sustain the constitutionality\n   of Commerce Clause legislation....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   In these cases, Congress' findings are substantially weakened by the fact that they rely so heavily on a method of reasoning that we have already rejected as unworkable if we are to maintain the Constitution's enumeration of powers. Congress found that gender-motivated violence affects interstate commerce\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \"by deterring potential victims from traveling interstate, from engaging in employment in interstate business, and from transacting with business, and in places involved in interstate commerce; ... by diminishing national productivity, increasing medical and other costs, and decreasing the supply of and the demand for interstate products.\" H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-711, at 385, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1994, pp. 1803, 1853.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Given these findings and petitioners' arguments,\n   <em>\n    the concern that we expressed in Lopez that Congress might use the Commerce Clause to completely obliterate the Constitution's distinction between national and local authority seems well founded\n   </em>\n   . The reasoning that petitioners advance seeks to follow the but-for causal chain from the initial occurrence of violent crime (the suppression of which has always been the prime object of the States' police power) to every attenuated effect upon interstate commerce. If accepted, petitioners' reasoning would allow Congress to regulate any crime as long as the nationwide, aggregated impact of that crime has substantial effects on employment, production, transit, or consumption. Indeed, if Congress may regulate gender-motivated violence, it would be able to regulate murder or any other type of violence since gender-motivated violence, as a subset of all violent crime, is certain to have lesser economic impacts than the larger class of which it is a part.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   We accordingly reject the argument that Congress may regulate noneconomic, violent criminal conduct based solely on that conduct's aggregate effect on interstate commerce.\n   <em>\n    The Constitution requires a distinction between what is truly national and what is truly local\n   </em>\n   . In recognizing this fact we preserve one of the few principles that has been consistent since the Clause was adopted. The regulation and punishment of intrastate violence that is not directed at the instrumentalities, channels, or goods involved in interstate commerce has always been the province of the States. Indeed, we can think of no better example of the police power, which the Founders denied the National Government and reposed in the States, than the suppression of violent crime and vindication of its victims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508946\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/598/#p607\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508946\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/598/#p607\">\n    at 614-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508946\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/598/#p607\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added; citations and footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Court pauses here to note an interesting point defendants make at pages 12-13 of their reply brief: The Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   , which post-dated ratification of the ICCPR by eight years, did not mention that treaty as a possible basis for upholding the VAWA, although this argument was raised in a lengthy amicus brief that was filed with the Supreme Court by a group of international legal scholars and human rights experts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brzonkala v.

Regarding the first factor, the Sixth Circuit found that the regulated activity - blocking access to abortion clinics - is commercial in nature because of its direct economic effect (causing clinics to close, delaying services, persuading some doctors not to provide services, etc.). Regarding the second factor, the Sixth Circuit noted that the statute lacked a \"formal jurisdictional element,\" but it found this to be unimportant \"[i]n light of the extensive congressional findings regarding the economically disruptive effects of clinic blockades and anti-abortion violence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11450755\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/298/547/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11450755\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/298/547/\">\n    at 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These findings, which are the third factor, were contained in extensive reports made by both Senate and House committees, and also covered the fourth factor, i.e., the link between the activity and interstate commerce. For example, Congress found that there is a national commercial market for abortion services, that anti-abortion protests burden interstate commerce, that patients and physicians often travel interstate to obtain or provide abortion services, and that protests sometimes cause clinics to close and for some doctors to stop working in this field. The Sixth Circuit concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   In addition to the documented economic disruption of clinic blockades and violent protests, Congress also found that this conduct was driven by a nationally unified and nationally coordinated anti-abortion movement. Congress found that many of these activities were organized and directed across state lines, and that the problem was increasingly beyond the scope of local and state authorities. H.R.Rep.

The cases the government cites in this section of its brief dealt with abortion services and healthcare generally,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 37, which bear no resemblance to the crime of mutilating girls' genitalia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The government further asserts that \"like the legislation at issue in\n   <em>\n    Raich\n   </em>\n   , Congress has enacted a comprehensive regulatory regime to eradicate FGM.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33. The regulatory regime at issue in\n   <em>\n    Raich\n   </em>\n   is the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act and implementing regulations. This statute covers drug treatment (Title I), drug control and enforcement (Title II), and drug importation (Title III). Title II, which classifies a long list of drugs in one of five schedules, sets \"strict requirements regarding registration, labeling and packaging, production quotas, drug security, and recordkeeping.\"\n   <em>\n    Raich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208788\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/1/#p22\">\n    545 U.S. at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208788\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/1/#p22\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is no comparable \"regulatory regime\" for FGM, but simply a ban on the practice. In\n   <em>\n    Raich\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court noted that \"[e]conomics refers to the production, distribution, and consumption of commodities,\" and found that the CSA \"regulates the production, distribution, and consumption of commodities for which there is an established, and lucrative, interstate market.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208788\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/1/#p22\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208788\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/1/#p22\">\n    at 25-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208788\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/1/#p22\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . No such comparison can be made with FGM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   FGM cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be classified as an economic or commercial activity. There is no suggestion that the procedure is done for money, aside from the unsupported comment made years ago by Senator Wellstone.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   note 7. Nor is there any suggestion that this \"service\" is offered within anything approaching an established interstate market, as exists for illegal drugs and pornography. Committing FGM is comparable to possessing a gun at school, i.e., a criminal act that \"has nothing to do with commerce or any sort of economic enterprise.\"\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339171\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/549/#p564\">\n    514 U.S. at 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339171\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/549/#p564\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nor can the Court distinguish FGM from gender-motivated crimes of violence, which the Supreme Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   \"are not, in any sense of the phrase, economic activity.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508946\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/598/#p607\">\n    529 U.S. at 613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508946\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/598/#p607\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even assuming that FGM is a wide-spread practice within the United States (a fact the government has not established), it cannot be as wide-spread as violence against women. If, as the Supreme Court found in\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   , rape and other forms of sexual assault against women are not economic or commercial activity, and therefore not part of an interstate market, no different conclusion can be reached concerning FGM, which is another form of gender-related violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The second factor the Court must consider is whether the statute contains \"a jurisdictional element limiting the reach of\n   the law to a discrete set of activities that has an explicit connection with, or effect on, interstate commerce.\"\n   <em>\n    Norton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11450755\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/298/547/\">\n    298 F.3d at 555-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is no jurisdictional element in the FGM statute, which does not require any proof that the victims or the provider traveled in, or had any effect on, interstate commerce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The cases indicate that the absence of a jurisdictional element is unimportant if there are sufficient congressional findings (third factor) or other evidence (fourth factor) of a substantial effect on interstate commerce. In the present case, however, there are no congressional findings other than the pro forma ones that accompanied passage of the statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, these are not findings as much as unsupported conclusions, and they do not begin to compare with the extensive findings made, for example, by both houses of Congress in\n   <em>\n    Norton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Raich\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Perez\n   </em>\n   . Nor are these the type of detailed, record-based findings that \"would enable us to evaluate the legislative judgment that the activity in question substantially affected interstate commerce, even though no such substantial effect was visible to the naked eye.\"\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339171\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/549/#p564\">\n    514 U.S. at 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339171\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/549/#p564\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Court next comes to the fourth factor, \"the link between the regulated activity and interstate commerce,\"\n   <em>\n    Norton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11450755\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/298/547/\">\n    298 F.3d at 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , i.e., whether there is a rational basis for finding that FGM has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Here the government's argument amounts to this: there is a market for FGM, and even if defendants' activities have only a slight effect on that market, Congress can regulate it just as in\n   <em>\n    Wickard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Raich\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Chambers\n   </em>\n   . That is, the government seems to concede that it cannot show that defendants, by performing FGM and/or aiding and abetting and/or conspiring to do so, had a substantial effect on interstate commerce. But, the argument continues, because Congress can regulate the \"market\" for this service, it can also regulate defendants' activities in that market, regardless of how trivial their impact individually may be on the market as a whole. For the reasons stated above, the Court rejects this argument. There is no evidence that FGM is a commercial activity, and there is no evidence that anyone beyond the mothers of the nine girls alleged in the third superseding indictment is in the market for this \"service.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Finally, the government asserts that only a federal statute can deal with FGM because, as Congress asserted in its fourth finding, \"the unique circumstances surrounding the practice of female genital mutilation place it beyond the ability of any single State or local jurisdiction to control.\"\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   note 8. This argument fails for at least two reasons. First, the Commerce Clause allows Congress to regulate\n   commercial activity that has a substantial effect on interstate commerce, not activity that is \"beyond the ability of any single State or local jurisdiction to control.\" Second, the government informs the Court that twenty-seven states have passed FGM statutes,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Gov't's Ex. 20, and nothing prevents the others from doing so. Further, counsel for the government argued during the December 5, 2017, hearing on defendants' motion to dismiss one of the counts of the second superseding indictment that FGM is criminal sexual conduct because it involves unlawful touching and penetration. If that is correct, then FGM could already be prosecuted in every state under existing criminal sexual conduct statutes, to say nothing of battery or child abuse statutes. The government's suggestion that \"those seeking the procedure [can] travel to refuge states where the practice is not prohibited\" is simply false. Gov't's Br. at 33, 43. No state offers refuge to those who harm children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Having reviewed \u00a7 116(a) with the greatest possible deference, the Court concludes that it is unconstitutional. Congress had no authority to pass this statute under either the Necessary and Proper Clause or the Commerce Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Necessary and Proper Clause does permit Congress to pass legislation to enforce treaty obligations, but there must be a rational relationship between the two. In the present case, there is no such relationship between the ICCPR and the FGM statute. Article 3 calls for \"the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of all civil and political rights set forth in the present Covenant,\" while Article 24 calls for protection of children without discrimination based on \"race, colour, sex, language, religion, national or social origin, property or birth.\" Neither article is rationally related to the FGM statute, which prohibits the mutilation of girls' genitalia. Even if it could be argued that the statute rationally seeks to implement a provision of the ICCPR, Congress may not enact such a statute because, as the Supreme Court has stated, the federal government has no \"plenary police power,\"\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339171\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/549/#p564\">\n    514 U.S. at 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339171\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/549/#p564\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and \"the clearest example of traditional state authority is the punishment of local criminal activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Bond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707009\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/844/\">\n    572 U.S. at 858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12580944,12707009\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2077/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2077\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Federalism concerns demand that this division of authority between the federal and state governments be respected. No treaty - and no statute enacted to implement a treaty - may upset this balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Nor was enactment of the FGM statute a permissible exercise of congressional power under the Commerce Clause. That clause permits Congress to regulate activity that is commercial or economic in nature and that substantially affects interstate commerce either directly or as part of an interstate market that has such an effect. The government has not shown that either prong is met. There is nothing commercial or economic about FGM. As despicable as this practice may be, it is essentially a criminal assault, just like the rape at issue in\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   . Nor has the government shown that FGM itself has any effect on interstate commerce or that a market exists for FGM beyond the mothers of the nine victims alleged in the third superseding indictment. There is, in short, no rational basis to conclude that FGM has any effect, to say nothing of a substantial effect, on interstate commerce. The present case cannot be distinguished from\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   . As in those cases, FGM is a crime that could be prosecuted under state law. FGM is not part of a larger market and it has no demonstrated effect on interstate commerce. The Commerce Clause does not permit Congress to regulate a crime of this nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   As the Supreme Court has stated, \"[a] criminal act committed wholly within a State 'cannot be made an offence against the United States, unless it have some relation to the execution of a power of Congress, or to some matter within the jurisdiction of the United States.' \"\n   <em>\n    Bond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707009\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/844/\">\n    572 U.S. at 854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12580944,12707009\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2077/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2077\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.
