BOUGH, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before the Court are Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. # 38) and Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. # 40). For the following reasons Plaintiff's Motion is GRANTED IN PART and Defendants' Motion is DENIED. The case is remanded to Unum for further consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises out of the denial of a claim for accidental death benefits following a single-car accident and subsequent death of the insured, Eric Boyer. Plaintiff, the sole beneficiary of Mr. Boyer's accidental death policy, alleges Defendants denied her claim for accidental death benefits because they determined Mr. Boyer's death was not an accident and Mr. Boyer died during the commission of crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Boyer was employed by Schneider Electric Holdings, Inc. (\"Schneider\") and participated in a Life and Accident Plan (\"the Plan\") sponsored and administered by Schneider. (Doc. # 43, p. 2). The Plan is an employee welfare benefit plan governed\n   by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Unum Life Insurance Company of America (\"Unum\") insures the benefits available under the Plan through a group insurance policy (\"the Policy\"). (Doc. # 44, p. 2). The Policy grants Unum \"discretionary authority to make benefit determinations under the Plan.\" (Doc. # 43, p. 3). Mr. Boyer possessed $67,000 in basic life insurance coverage, which was paid to Plaintiff upon Mr. Boyer's death. Mr. Boyer also possessed $464,000 in total accidental death coverage that was not paid to Plaintiff and is at issue in this case. (Doc. # 44, p. 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 22, 2016, Mr. Boyer died in a single-car accident in St. Louis County, Missouri, after his vehicle ran off the roadway and struck a tree. On April 7, 2016, Schneider filed a claim for life and accidental death benefits under the Plan on behalf of Plaintiff. (Doc. # 44, p. 3). On April 11, 2016, Unum advised Plaintiff it would pay life benefits, but that it needed further information to determine whether it would pay accidental death benefits. (Doc. # 43, p. 4). Upon reviewing Mr. Boyer's death certificate, the police report, the autopsy report, and the toxicology laboratory report, Unum denied Plaintiff's claim for accidental death benefits. (Doc. # 44, pp. 3-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The police report cited \"Speed-Exceeded Limit\" and \"Improper Passing\" as \"probable contributing circumstances\" to Mr. Boyer's death. (Doc. # 44, p. 4). Several witnesses reported Mr. Boyer was traveling westbound on Centaur Road at a high rate of speed as he entered the eastbound lane of traffic in a \"No Passing Zone\" to pass several vehicles when his vehicle ran off the roadway and struck a tree. (Doc. # 43, pp. 4-5). The report also noted the speed limit at the site of the accident was either 25 or 35 miles per hour. (Doc. # 43, pp. 5, 8). One witness, an off-duty police officer who observed Mr. Boyer approaching in his rear view mirror, stated he believed Mr. Boyer's vehicle was traveling approximately 80 miles per hour. (Doc. # 43, p. 5). There was no radar or other machine reading of the speed of Mr. Boyer's vehicle. (Doc. # 43, pp. 4-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The medical examiner's report listed the manner of death as an accident caused by blunt craniocerebral and thoracic trauma. (Doc. # 44, p. 3). A medicolegal investigator who investigated the scene of the car accident noted the road conditions were \"somewhat slushy/icy with dry areas.\" (Doc. # 44, p. 4). The toxicology laboratory report demonstrated there was no trace of drugs or alcohol in Mr. Boyer's system at the time of the car accident. (Doc. # 44, p. 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In a letter to Plaintiff dated June 10, 2016, Unum denied the accidental death benefits claim based on (1) its conclusion that Mr. Boyer's death was not an \"accidental bodily injury\" under the Plan and (2) the \"crime exclusion\" in Mr. Boyer's plan that excludes coverage for \"accidental losses caused by, contributed to by, or resulting from: ... an attempt to commit or commission of a crime.\" (Doc. # 44, p. 5). Specifically, Unum stated in the denial letter:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Information from the police report indicates that your brother was passing vehicles in a no passing zone. In addition, according to a witness statement, he was driving approximately 80 miles per hour with the posted speed limit being 35 miles per hour. The speed at which he was driving, and passing other vehicles in a no passing zone, contributed to his motor vehicle accident, and in turn his death.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Doc. # 43, p. 6). Unum further stated that such traffic violations are considered misdemeanors under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20304.010\">\n    Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 304.010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 304.016. (Doc. # 43, p. 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Notably, Unum's internal policy manual states that \" 'Attempt to commit' or 'commission' policy language was intended to exclude disabilities/losses which result from an activity that would typically be classified as a crime (or felony, depending on policy language) ... [and] was not intended to apply to activities which would generally be classified as traffic violations.\" (Doc. # 44, p. 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On July 1, 2016, Plaintiff appealed the denial and on July 8, 2016, Unum issued a second letter denying accidental death coverage. (Doc. # 44, p. 5). On April 11, 2017, through counsel, Plaintiff again requested Unum reconsider its decision. (Doc. # 44, p. 6). Unum responded by letter, informing Plaintiff the appeal process was complete and reaffirming its decision to deny coverage. (Doc. # 44, p. 6). Plaintiff then brought this claim for \"benefits due\" under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Plaintiff further argues such determination was not supported by substantial evidence. Defendants argue Unum's decision to apply the crime exclusion was reasonable and based on substantial evidence.

The primary goal of the Plan, and specifically accidental death coverage, is to provide benefits in the case of the insured's accidental death. To apply the crime exclusion to traffic violations is inconsistent with this goal and with the overall goal of ERISA under \u00a7 1001 of protecting the interests of plan beneficiaries, particularly when crimes are not defined under the Plan and Unum's own policy instructs that the crime exclusion was not intended to apply to traffic violations. Further, while Defendants contend the inclusion of a crime exclusion in an accidental death plan serves to shift the costs of self-destructive behavior, here, as discussed below, substantial evidence is lacking to show that Mr. Boyer was committing a crime. Without substantial evidence supporting this conclusion, it cannot be reasonably argued that treating Mr. Boyer's death as resulting from the commission of a crime is consistent with Defendants' proffered goal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     Finley\n    </em>\n    Factor 2 - Renders Any Language Meaningless\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The second\n   <em>\n    Finley\n   </em>\n   factor tests whether the insurer's \"interpretation renders any language in the Plan meaningless or internally inconsistent.\"\n   <em>\n    Finley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520235\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/957/617/#p621\">\n    957 F.2d at 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff argues Unum's interpretation of the crime exclusion creates a blanket exclusion rendering the entire accidental death policy meaningless because it allows denial of coverage for a car accident under an accidental death policy. Plaintiff contends \"by excluding something as trivial as speeding or passing in a no passing zone in a 'crime exclusion' Unum undermines the very title of the Policy-Accidental Death and Disability.\" (Doc. # 47, p. 7).

Such a far-reaching construction of the \"crime\" exclusion is inconsistent with Unum's own internal claims manual. The claims manual instructs: \"When administering a crime exclusion ... 'Attempt to commit' or 'commission' policy language was intended to exclude disabilities/losses which result from an activity that would typically be classified as a crime (or felony, depending on policy language) under state or federal law\" and \"was not intended to apply to activities which would generally be classified as traffic violations.\" (Doc. # 39-1, p. 1).

Plaintiff also notes that in its initial denial letter Unum stated, \"Even if the crimes were classified as violations or infractions ... they would still be crimes.\" (Doc. # 43, p. 14). Plaintiff contends this interpretation \"reduces 'accident insurance' to insurance only for strange, unforeseeable injuries or for injuries in which the victim was passive rather than active,\" which is contrary to a reasonable policyholder's interpretation.\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8972157\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/414/994/#p999\">\n    414 F.3d at 1008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendants argue Unum's interpretation poses no conflict with ERISA requirements. They argue the point of the \u00a7 1022(a) requirement is to ensure the plan administrator does not \"rely on some exotic definition outside the realm of reasonable.\" (Doc. # 48, p. 11). Defendants state Unum relied on an ordinary dictionary definition of crime and, therefore, its interpretation did not conflict with ERISA. Defendants also refute Plaintiff's position that including infractions in the definition of \"crime\" would undermine the purpose of accident insurance, arguing that a number of accidents, such as those in which a driver was not committing a crime, would not be susceptible to the crime exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court finds Unum's interpretation of the Plan conflicts with the requirements of ERISA. Interpreting the crime exclusion to include traffic violations conflicts with the requirements of \u00a7 1022(a). Defendants failed to define crimes under the Plan, and it is unreasonable to believe the average plan participant could anticipate Unum would construe the concept of crime in such a broad manner as to include traffic violations. Further, as the Court discussed in its analysis of the third\n   <em>\n    Finley\n   </em>\n   factor, including speeding and passing in a no passing zone as crimes under the crime exclusion unreasonably limits accidental death coverage, which is contrary to a reasonable policyholder's understanding and in conflict with \u00a7 1022(a). The Court also finds Unum's interpretation conflicts with \u00a7 1022(b), which requires that the plan description contain \"circumstances which may result in disqualification, ineligibility, or denial or loss of benefits.\" The Plan does not state that traffic violations will result in denial of or ineligibility for benefits. To the contrary, Unum's internal claims manual states the opposite: that the crime exclusion was not intended to apply to traffic violations. Therefore, Unum's interpretation of the crime exclusion conflicts with ERISA requirements under \u00a7 1022(a) - (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    d.\n    <em>\n     Finley\n    </em>\n    Factor 4 - Interpret Provisions Consistently\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The fourth factor under\n   <em>\n    Finley\n   </em>\n   asks whether the plan administrator has interpreted the provisions at issue consistently.\n   <em>\n    Finley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520235\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/957/617/#p621\">\n    957 F.2d at 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Unum has presented no substantial evidence establishing Mr. Boyer's actions were consistent with criminal behavior rather than traffic violations. Moreover, Unum's argument that its interpretation here is consistent with prior interpretations in\n   <em>\n    Oomrigar\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Caldwell\n   </em>\n   is inaccurate. As detailed above, in both of those cases, Unum relied on substantial evidence resulting from thorough and detailed investigations in making its decision to apply the crime exclusion. To the contrary, in this case, Unum declined to investigate and instead decided to deny accidental death benefits based on witness statements and \"probable contributing circumstances\" listed in the police report. Therefore, Unum has not interpreted the crime exclusion consistently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    e.\n    <em>\n     Finley\n    </em>\n    Factor 5 - Contrary to Clear Language\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The fifth\n   <em>\n    Finley\n   </em>\n   factor examines whether the insurer's \"interpretation is contrary to the clear language of the Plan.\"\n   <em>\n    Finley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520235\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/957/617/#p621\">\n    957 F.2d at 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff argues Unum's interpretation is contrary to the plain language of the Plan in that the crime exclusion as written does not include traffic violations. Defendants argue Unum's interpretation is consistent with the plain language of the Plan because speeding and passing in a no passing zone are misdemeanors under Missouri law and because misdemeanors are considered crimes according to the dictionary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court finds Unum's interpretation of the crime exclusion is contrary to the plain language of the Plan. The crime exclusion in Mr. Boyer's plan excludes coverage for \"accidental losses caused by, contributed to by, or resulting from: ... an attempt to commit or commission of a crime.\" This language does not demonstrate an exclusion of coverage for accidents resulting from the insured's traffic\n   violations. To allow Defendants' construction to stand would allow Unum to deny coverage every time a plaintiff was caught speeding even one mile per hour over the speed limit.

Plaintiff states there was no accident reconstruction done to prove that speeding or improper passing contributed to Mr. Boyer's death and that there is no substantial evidence to conclude that the area was in fact a no passing zone. Plaintiff cites\n   <em>\n    Glenn v. Metlife\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that failure to consider meaningful evidence and undertake a thorough investigation renders a benefits denial an abuse of discretion.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3672906\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/660/\">\n    461 F.3d 660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2006). Plaintiff argues Unum chose to make its decision to deny coverage by giving significant weight to witness statements and minimizing consideration of evidence such as the medicolegal investigator's report noting icy roads and the medical examiner's determination that the manner of death was an accident. Plaintiff further argues Unum failed to inquire with relevant authorities as to whether charges would have been filed against Mr. Boyer and failed to speak to any witnesses, investigators, or reporting officers. Plaintiff states that Unum failed to conduct a meaningful investigation and instead opted to rely on a file review, which should be considered in assessing whether the decision to deny coverage was reasonable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3672906\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/660/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3672906\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/660/\">\n    at 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendants claim substantial evidence, including the police report and autopsy report, supports Unum's decision. They argue Unum did not need to investigate because the police report already captured the police officer's and witnesses' thoughts. Defendants further state Plaintiff has not cited any authority about the extent of investigation required before applying the crime exclusion and argue, \"District courts do not second guess the investigation\"; rather, they \"only review ... the evidence in front of Unum and determine if substantial evidence supports the decision.\" (Doc. # 48, pp. 13-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Court finds Unum's interpretation of the Plan was not supported by substantial evidence. It is unreasonable to define an insured's behavior as criminal based solely on witness statements and \"probable contributing circumstances\" contained within a police report. The police report contained no detailed analysis of the scene of the accident and no independent police investigation findings. Unum applied the crime exclusion to this claim without any evidence of the posted speed limit at the location of the car accident, of what speed Mr. Boyer's car was traveling, or that speed or improper passing in fact caused or contributed to causing Mr. Boyer's death. Unum also failed to meaningfully consider the medicolegal investigator's report noting icy roads and the medical examiner's determination that the manner of death was an accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Without substantial evidence available upon which Unum could rely, Unum arbitrarily concluded Mr. Boyer's conduct and cause of death was criminal in nature. Unum forewent any meaningful investigation or attempt to contact the reporting officers, investigators, prosecutors, or any authority whatsoever to obtain any substantial evidence regarding the circumstances surrounding Mr. Boyer's death. Unum did not contact a single witness in the claim review process. Instead, Unum relied on a file containing unsubstantiated and speculative information. Accordingly, Unum abused its discretion by concluding Mr. Boyer's car accident was caused by his own criminal activity without any substantial evidence in support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In sum, the Court finds Unum abused its discretion in denying accidental death benefits based on the Plan's crime exclusion in that its determination was unreasonable under the\n   <em>\n    Finley\n   </em>\n   factors and not supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Accident\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiff argues Unum used the incorrect standard in determining Mr. Boyer's death was not an accident under the Plan.

The test is satisfied \"if the court can fairly call the outcome of the litigation some success on the merits without conducting a 'lengthy inquir[y] into the question whether a particular party's success was substantial or occurred on a central issue.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198775\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/680/#p694\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court finds Plaintiff's argument that she is entitled to attorney's fees assumes the Court agrees with her position that she is \"entitled to her full payment of the accidental death benefits[.]\" (Doc. # 39, p. 27). The Court does not find in Plaintiff's favor on this point, but instead remands for further consideration by Unum. Accordingly, Plaintiff's request for attorney's fees is denied without prejudice. Given that this Order grants Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment on the issue of the \"crime exclusion\" and remands the case to Unum for proper analysis of the \"accident\" issue, Plaintiff may move for attorney's fees after Unum decides the \"accident\" issue under the\n   <em>\n    Wickman\n   </em>\n   framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Court finds Unum abused its discretion in denying Plaintiff accidental death benefits based on the Plan's crime exclusion in that its determination was unreasonable and not supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. # 38) is GRANTED IN PART and Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. # 40) is DENIED. The Court remands the case to Unum for further consideration of the \"accident\" determination under the\n   <em>\n    Wickman\n   </em>\n   standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Unum reconsider its determination that Mr. Boyer's car accident was not an \"accident\" under the\n   <em>\n    Wickman\n   </em>\n   standard and file a joint status report within 30 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Additionally, Plaintiff pled common law breach of contract in her Complaint (Doc. # 1, p. 6). Defendants argue an ERISA \"benefits due\" claim preempts the breach of contract claim. Plaintiff did not challenge or otherwise respond to Defendants' preemption argument. Accordingly, the Court finds Plaintiff has abandoned the breach of contract claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
