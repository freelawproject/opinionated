No. 28] for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. For the reasons stated below, the Court will partially grant and partially deny the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant Allina Health System (\"Allina\") is a health care system that provides medical care throughout Minnesota and western Wisconsin. (Compl. \u00b6 21.) Qualifying Allina employees were covered by the Allina retirement plan. Allina previously offered a 403(b) Plan to its employees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84.) However, in October 2010, new participant entry into the 403(b) Plan was frozen, and by January 1, 2011, all employee salary deferrals, employer matching contributions, and discretionary employer contributions were frozen. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84.) In conjunction with freezing the 403(b) Plan, effective January 1, 2012, all eligible Allina employees became participants in the 401(k) Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Since that time, all deferral elections and employer contributions have been received within the 401(k) Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Both the 403(b) and 401(k) Plans are \"defined contribution plans\" or \"individual account\" plans within the meaning of ERISA \u00a7 3(34),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (34). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) Therefore, each Plan contains individual accounts for every participant and for benefits based solely upon the amount contributed to those accounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83.) The retirement benefits each Plan provides are based solely on the amounts allocated to an individual's account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Allina is the named fiduciary of the Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) Allina acted through the Board of Directors (\"Director Defendants\"), the Chief Administrative Officer (\"CAO Defendants\"), the Chief Human Resources Officer (\"HR Defendants\"), the Plan Administrators (\"Plan Administrator Defendants\"), and Retirement Committee (\"Retirement Committee Defendants\"), to perform Plan-related fiduciary functions in the course and scope of their employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) Director Defendants are in charge of selecting Retirement Committee Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) Retirement Committee Defendants are tasked with selecting the Plan's core investment options. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) Plan Administrator Defendants are responsible for determining benefits eligibility and construing Plan documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Plan currently offers three groups of investment options. First, the ProManage program automatically allocates enrolled participant's contributions to eleven\n   set investment options. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 100.). ProManage, LLC, headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, is the firm appointed by Allina to provide investment management services \"with respect to assets held in the individual Plan accounts of Participants who do not elect to opt out of the ProManage Service.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94.). Second, the core options program allows enrolled participants to pick where they would like to invest their contributions from a list of thirteen investment options. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 126.). Lastly, the mutual fund window allows enrolled participants to choose where to invest their contributions from a list of approximately three hundred mutual funds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12, 130.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Fidelity Management Trust Company (\"Fidelity\") is the custodian of the 403(b) Plan and trustee of the 401(k) Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90.) Fidelity also provides recordkeeping, and management services to the Plans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Under both of the Plans' terms, Plan administration and reasonable expenses are to be paid from the Plan assets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 157.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs are three former employees and participants of the Plan who seek to represent a class of all participants in and beneficiaries of the Plan from the 403(b) Plan's inception in 2011 through to the 401(k) Plan today. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 17, 18.) Plaintiffs' action is brought on behalf of themselves and all persons, except Defendants and their immediate family members, who were participants in or beneficiaries of the 403(b) Plan and/or the 401(k) Plan, at any time between August 18, 2011 and the present. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs' Complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) arguing that the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction and under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) arguing that Plaintiffs' Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 requires that a complaint present \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9. To meet this standard and survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), \"a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 100, 102, 104.) The ProManage option, Plaintiffs claim, allocates a participant's contributions to eleven set investments according to an investment mix in the Trust. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It does this by considering the participant's account balance, projected Social Security income, and age in allocating assets to a pre-set menu. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As payment, ProManage charges participants a yearly fee of up to 0.35% of their invested assets in the Plans, with an average fee of .701% (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 102.) Plaintiffs contend that the ProManage option had \"little to no benefit despite the fees it charged participants.\" (Pls.' Mem. in Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss [Doc. No. 43] (\"Pls.'

They argue that Department of Labor regulations \"make clear that such decisions cannot be challenged on fiduciary breach grounds.\" (Defs.' Mem. at 14.) Moreover, they contend that the Plaintiffs' challenge to the selection and retention of the ProManage option also fails to state a plausible claim. (Defs.' Reply in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss [Doc.

Defendants assert that the average fee for ProManage of .701% was not unreasonable and that Plaintiffs failed to provide any comparison to show that the service was inferior to others available on the market.

(Defs.' Mem. at 13.) Defendants assert that mutual funds offer greater transparency than collective trusts and separate accounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) Moreover, they claim that mutual funds have \"important regulatory safeguards, including diversification requirements, limitations on leverage, and mandatory oversight by a largely independent board of directors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Hence, it is a judgment call, like so many other judgment calls they must make and, without more, is not a breach per se.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    White v.

Plaintiffs argue that there is an \"inherent conflict of interest\" that arises when plan administrators and other fiduciaries allow a service provider's proprietary fund to be used as an investment option. (Compl. \u00b6 121.)

Plaintiffs explain that Defendants \"fail[ed] to have in place a method of systematic review\" for \"the portfolio as a whole\" and for the Plan's \"individual investment options.\" (Compl. \u00b6 152.) Plaintiffs maintain that a \"review of just the Plans' high value mutual fund options would have revealed other mutual funds available ... with similar or better performance and lower fees.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 164.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that these better investment options could be found both in other Fidelity funds and on the open market. First, Plaintiffs claim that Fidelity \"offered\n   <em>\n    identical\n   </em>\n   funds in a K asset class (K-shares),\" that had \"expenses that were [five] to [twenty] basis points lower than the mutual funds provided.\" (Compl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 163.) (emphasis added). And second, Plaintiffs claim that \"the Fidelity Contrafund and the Fidelity Diversified International Fund\" were included \"despite the fact that every year from 2010 through 2016, those funds were significantly more expensive than\n   <em>\n    similar\n   </em>\n   but better performing market alternatives.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 166, 170.) (emphasis added). Plaintiffs also assert that Defendants' mutual fund \"window\" was not truly a window because from 2011 to 2015 there were between 7,599 and 8,116 mutual funds available for investment in the marketplace, but Defendants only chose to open up three hundred options to Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 130.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Defendants respond that permitting Fidelity to include and subsequently failing to remove high-cost investment options (retail funds) does not state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty. (Defs.' Mem. at 19.) Defendants contend that \"[r]equiring fiduciaries to monitor every investment in a brokerage window would be\" impossible. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As Plaintiffs admit, \"sponsors lack resources to monitor every single investment in a window arrangement in the way that they do core investments.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants also contend that they intentionally decided to place mutual funds within the window that are not in the cheapest share class to \"ope[n] up the investment universe to [their] participants.\" (May 16, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 43.) Moreover, they argue that Plaintiffs' allegation that specific mutual funds within the window had \"lackluster returns ... likewise fails to demonstrate imprudence.\" Defendants claim the important factor is that the fund \"outperformed its benchmark.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Cunningham v.

Therefore, the plaintiffs had failed to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In this case, Plaintiffs' allegations that Defendants failed to properly manage Fidelity's administration of the Plan as a whole because of the inclusion of retail funds is not sufficient to state a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty. Further, Plaintiffs' allegations that the Fidelity Contrafund and the Fidelity Diversified International Fund should not have been included because they underperformed cannot stand because Plaintiffs have only pled a market alternative that is similar, but not identical to, the Fidelity shares that were actually included in the Plan. However, Plaintiffs' claim regarding the Fidelity K asset class funds does state a claim because Plaintiffs have provided a meaningful, identical benchmark to compare against the original fund. Therefore, Defendants may have breached their fiduciary duty in allowing Fidelity to select specific Fidelity retail funds to include in the Plan over identical, but lower-cost, K asset class funds.

Recordkeeping Fees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendants breached their fiduciary duty of prudence by failing to properly monitor recordkeeping fees for both the core options and mutual fund window. (May 16, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 31.) Plaintiffs contend that in 2015 alone, the Plans paid an excessive $1.65 million in recordkeeping services to Fidelity. (Compl. \u00b6 228.) In addition, Plaintiffs claim that, over the course of the six years prior to filing the complaint, the Plan paid Fidelity an excess of $8 million for its recordkeeping services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 229.) This \"imprudence,\" Plaintiffs contend, \"can be inferred from a number of factors,\" including: (1) \"the use of the same recordkeeper for the past [twenty-two] years ...; (2) no change to the \"compensation arrangement since mid-2012 ...;\" (3) the lack of any \"explicit recordkeeping fee offsets within the Trust Agreement;\" and (4) the failure to \"engag[e] an expert or outside consultant to review the Plans' recordkeeping arrangements at any time during the Class Period.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs also argue that even if Fidelity did return \"$3.4 million\" in revenue credit, \"[Fidelity's] fees still were excessive by $4.7 million.\" (Pls.' Mem. at 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Defendants respond that Plaintiffs' allegations regarding their system of monitoring recordkeeping fees and failure to solicit bids from other recordkeeping services was not, without more, a breach of fiduciary duty. (Defs.' Mem. at 22.) They contend that the Plaintiffs' allegations about what an \"appropriate fee would have been are speculation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.) Moreover, they argue that fiduciaries are allowed a \"wide latitude\" when selecting recordkeepers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Defendants also explain that they negotiated increases to the Plans' revenue credit, totaling $4.9 million, and changed the core options to a lower fee share class in\n   2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.) In addition, they assert that their choice to charge participants with a per-participant fee instead of an asset-based fee was reasonable.

Too Many Options\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendants breached their fiduciary duty of prudence by placing too many investment options in the mutual fund window.

However, under Rule 12(b)(6), Plaintiffs have failed to plead that Defendants' description of the expenses related to the Plan as \"Investment Adv.
