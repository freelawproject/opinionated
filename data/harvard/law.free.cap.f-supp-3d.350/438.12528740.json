These safe access and loading units have fall protection equipment, such as safety cages, gates and railings. No later than 2003, SafeRack began selling fall protection equipment that included the color orange. (Dkt. Nos. 50-2 at 3; 50-3.) Bullard, though a 30(b)(6) witness, acknowledged that he had seen SafeRack products with orange on its \"standard truck loading, railcar loading, and access platforms, gangways and gates\" prior to June 2017.\n  <footnotemark>\n   1\n  </footnotemark>\n  (Dkt. No. 50-14 at 16, 20, 25.) On May 30, 2017, after a three year examination, the United State Patent and Trademark Office (\"USPTO\") registered SafeRack's Design Mark No. 5,211,514. (Dkt. No. 50-4.) The registration included a photo of a gangway:\n </opinion>\n <footnote label=\"1\">\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Bullard alleges there is a dispute regarding when it first learned of SafeRack's use of orange on equipment. (Dkt. No. 57 at 11 - 12.) However, Bullard identifies no evidence disputing the testimony of its 30(b)(6) witness, and instead only disputes the reason it chose to use orange and when it was actually informed that orange refers to SafeRack.

No. 57-10 at 4.)\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The registration further stated that \"[t]he color(s) orange is/are claimed as a feature of the mark.

On June 12, 2017, SafeRack sent a cease and desist letter to Bullard after Bullard's platform was shown at ILTA. Bullard asserts that while it showcased the units, it never sold any with that configuration. (Dkt. No. 49-1 at 8, 15.) SafeRack presented no evidence that Bullard ever sold a work platform or gangway as showcased at the ILTA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Instead, both parties agree that since 2015 Bullard has sold at least six\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   mobile access platforms (\"MAP\") with gray railings, cages, and fall protection with an orange vehicle base.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Dkt.

SafeRack also brought a claim for unjust enrichment. Bullard argues that the use of orange on its equipment was not likely to cause confusion, and presents six affirmative defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As the Fourth Circuit has explained, to establish trademark infringement a plaintiff must prove:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (1) that it owns a valid mark; (2) that the defendant used the mark 'in commerce' and without plaintiff's authorization; (3) that the defendant used the mark (or an imitation of it) 'in connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising' of goods or services; and (4) that the defendant's use of the mark is likely to confuse customers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Rosetta Stone, Ltd. v.

Ownership of Valid Mark\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   There is no dispute that SafeRack owns a valid trademark to the color orange as applied to railings, gates, and cages of fall protection equipment. Generally, \"the party claiming ownership of a mark must be the first to use the mark in the sale of goods. The party claiming ownership must also use the mark as a trademark, that is, the mark must be used to identify the source of the goods to potential customers.\"\n   <em>\n    George &amp; Co., LLC v.

Finally, color alone can serve as a trademark where it has acquired secondary meaning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Prod. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339492\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/159/#p163\">\n    514 U.S. 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 163,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339492\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/159/#p163\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339492\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/159/#p163\">\n    131 L.Ed.2d 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Here, SafeRack has a presumption of ownership of its mark dating to June 11, 2014, when its trademark was filed with the USPTO. (Dkt. Nos. 50-4; 50-7.) SafeRack further presented evidence that it sold its first loading rack with orange colored components in September 2003. (Dkt. No. 50-2 at 3; 50-3.) Bullard has presented no evidence to dispute this fact. The record evidence demonstrates that Bullard first showcased orange on the railings of its fall protection equipment in June 2017, after SafeRack's registration was both filed and granted. (Dkt. Nos. 49-1 at 8; 50-25; 50-10 at 36.) SafeRack therefore owns a valid trademark to the color orange as applied to railings, gates, and cages of fall protection equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   However, SafeRack has not presented any evidence that it owns a valid trademark to orange appearing anywhere else on its safe access and loading units. To begin with, the presumption applies only to the trademark issued by the USPTO, which is limited to \"the color orange as\n   applied to\n   <em>\n    railings, gates, and cages\n   </em>\n   of fall protection equipment.\" (Dkt. No. 50-4) (emphasis added). Furthermore, SafeRack in its motion describes the mark as limited to \"orange on specific portions of gangways, railings, gates, and mobile access units-industry (\"MAUI\")...that SafeRack manufactures and sells.\" (Dkt. No. 50-1 at 2.)\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   (Dkt. No. 50-1 at 21; \"The vast majority of them have nothing to do with this field-they are not metallic gangways, railings, gates and other fall prevention components of industrial loading and MAUI applications.\"). Finally, SafeRack has presented no evidence that it has ever used orange on areas of its equipment other than railings, gates and cages as a mark. All photographs SafeRack has presented includes orange solely on the gangways, railings, cages and gates of its equipment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. Nos. 50-11; 50-12; 50-21.) Testimony from SafeRack consumers also confirmed this point. PJ Fjeld-Hansen, a purchaser of SafeRack products, testified that he identified a gangway as a SafeRack product through orange on top railings, midrails and a springcover.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 50-6 at 3 - 4.) Another consumer, Thomas Hansen, further testified it was orange gangways that identified SafeRack. (Dkt. No. 50-10 at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Therefore, it is undisputed that SafeRack owns a trademark to the color orange specifically as applied to railings, gates, and cages of fall protection equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Used in Commerce Without Consent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   There is no dispute that Bullard used this mark in commerce without consent. Bullard admits that it showcased a work platform and gangway with orange railings and cages at the ILTA in June 2017. (Dkt. Nos. 49-1 at 8; 50-10 at 36.) There is no evidence that Bullard used the mark without consent at any other time. The only other evidence of Bullard using orange on its equipment is its use of orange on the vehicle base of seven MAPs it sold in 2015 and 2016. (Dkt. No. 50-25.) However, the vehicle base of the MAP included no railings, gates, cages, or any other type of fall protection equipment. (Dkt. No. 50-22.) Indeed, the only fall protection equipment on the MAP that included any color, a staircase with railings, was painted yellow. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Therefore, it is undisputed that Bullard used SafeRack's mark in commerce without consent at the ILTA in June 2017 and at no other time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Offer for Sale or Advertising of Goods and Services\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   There is no dispute that Bullard showcased and advertised the work platform and gangway with orange railings and cages at the June 2017 ILTA. The ILTA is an important trade show in Bullard and SafeRack's industry. (Dkt. No. 50-15 at 4.) Therefore, it is undisputed that by showcasing a work platform and gangway with orange railings and cages, Bullard used the mark in connection with the advertising of goods or services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Likelihood of Confusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   There is no material dispute that Bullard's use of orange on fall protection equipment is likely to cause confusion with consumers. The Fourth Circuit has articulated nine factors relevant to determining likelihood of confusion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (1) the strength or distinctiveness of the plaintiff's mark as actually used in the marketplace; (2) the similarity of the two\n   marks to consumers; (3) the similarity of the goods or services that the marks identify; (4) the similarity of the facilities used by the markholders; (5) the similarity of advertising used by the markholders; (6) the defendant's intent; (7) actual confusion; (8) the quality of the defendant's product; and (9) the sophistication of the consuming public.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Rosetta Stone Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3757645\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/144/#p152\">\n    676 F.3d at 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court considered each of these factors and, as discussed below, determined there is no material dispute regarding likelihood of confusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the outset, the Court notes that this case arose in unusual factual circumstances for a trademark case. Here, the alleged infringing goods, Bullard's work platforms and gangway with orange on the railings, were never sold or distributed and the record evidence indicates that they were only shown at a single tradeshow. (Dkt. No. 49-1 at 8, 15.) Once SafeRack delivered its cease and desist letter after the tradeshow, Bullard did not engage in any further attempts to market the allegedly infringing product until these legal challenges have been decided. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    i. Strength and Distinctiveness of Mark\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   There is no material dispute that SafeRack has a strong and distinctive mark. It is undisputed that SafeRack uses the mark in its advertising slogan (\"Orange. Safety has a new color\"), and has used the mark in the marketplace since at least 2003. Furthermore, SafeRack has spent between $925,000 and $2,560,000 each year from 2014 to 2017 advertising products with its orange mark. (Dkt. No. 50-19.) Finally, SafeRack submitted undisputed testimony from multiple consumers that orange on fall protection equipment identified SafeRack products and, until Bullard, no competitors who sold similar equipment in its industry used the color orange on fall protection equipment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 50-6 at 3 - 4; 50-8 at 14; 50-10 at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Bullard does not dispute these facts, and instead argues that while SafeRack may have a distinctive orange mark as shown on the USPTO trademark certificate, SafeRack cannot show strength or distinctiveness for \"orange in all of its shades,\" focusing on the fact that the shade of orange on the trademark registration and SafeRack's equipment differs from the orange used on Bullard's equipment. (Dkt. No. 49-1 at 11 - 13.) However, Bullard, in making its argument, relies on\n   <em>\n    Campbell Soup Co. v.

SafeRack has a strong mark. Indeed, these uses of color, whether orange for SafeRack, or yellow for another competitor, is one of the only ways that companies differentiate themselves in an industry that is otherwise all gray. (Dkt. No. 50-6 at 7; 50-26.) Furthermore, there is no material dispute that the marks are incredibly similar, used on exceptionally similar equipment, that both SafeRack and Bullard operate in a specific marketplace and that Bullard uses the same facilities and methods of advertising when selling its safe access and fall protection equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Court is cognizant that there is only limited evidence of actual confusion since Bullard's marketing of the challenged product was limited. However, Bullard has identified no admissible evidence rebutting this record evidence. Moreover, while the fact that Bullard never sold these items and only displayed them at a single tradeshow may serve to limit SafeRack's damages, Bullard's reticence to sell infringing items and create opportunities for actual confusion cannot be used as a shield when the likelihood of confusion is apparent. In sum, there is no dispute of material fact that Bullard's use of the orange mark created a likelihood of confusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Therefore, the Court concludes that there is no dispute of material fact that SafeRack has ownership of an orange color mark on railings, gates, and cages of fall protection equipment, that Bullard used the mark in commerce without authorization when it advertised its safe access and loading equipment with orange railings, gates and cages at the 2017 ILTA, and that this use was likely to cause confusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

First, Bullard relies extensively on an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") regulation identifying orange as a \"safety color,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201910.145\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). However, the OSHA regulation discusses colors for signs and tags dealing with accident prevention, such as for a \"biohazard,\" or \"high voltage\" equipment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201910.145\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (f)(2). These definitions do not indicate that the color orange on the railings here is functional. Furthermore, Bullard relies on a publication by the American National Standards Institute (\"ANSI\"), Z535.1-2017, that identifies a particular shade of orange, allegedly the one used by Bullard, as \"safety orange.\" However, the publication also lists safety colors for red, yellow, green, blue, purple, white, and black, and ANSI gives no indication that those seven colors are the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   colors that can indicate safety. Finally, Bullard has pointed to no laws, regulations, standards, or admissible evidence indicating that orange is required or even recommended for the railings, cages, gates or other fall protection equipment in the safe access equipment industry. Instead, record evidence demonstrates that many other competitors use metallic gray or other colors, such as yellow. Therefore, there is no material dispute that SafeRack's orange color mark is nonfunctional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    ii. Fair Use\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Bullard's argument for fair use duplicates its arguments regarding the use of orange as a safety color under OSHA and ANSI recommendations. These arguments fail for the same reasons. Additionally, Bullard argues that at least four other companies, to varying degrees, use the color orange to communicate safety on railings, gates and cages: JLG, WAAG, Werner Co. and Ballymore Company. (Dkt. No. 49-1 at 24 - 26.) \"To establish a fair use defense for these [products], [the infringer] must prove that [the products] are used 'fairly and in good faith' only to describe the [product] and that the infringing mark is not used as a trademark.\"\n   <em>\n    Shakespeare Co. v. Silstar Corp. of Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"695147\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/110/234/#p242\">\n    110 F.3d 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 242 (4th Cir. 1997). Bullard's argument regarding JLG, WAAG, Werner Co. and Ballymore essentially restates Bullard's argument regarding orange as a safety color, and those companies' use of orange does not transform orange into a color that describes safe access equipment in the loading and unloading industry. Indeed, none of those companies were identified as competitors by either SafeRack or Bullard in record evidence, and the pictures submitted by Bullard do not demonstrate that the use of orange on the railings, cages and gates of safe access equipment in their industry has somehow become generic by the use of orange by other companies in other industries. Indeed, the record testimony shows the opposite: that at least some consumers use orange as a signifier for SafeRack in the industry. Therefore, there is no material dispute that Bullard's use of orange did not constitute fair use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    iii. Generic and Distinctiveness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   SafeRack's registration of its mark \"is prima facie evidence that the registered term is not generic.\"\n   <em>\n    JFJ Toys, Inc. v. Sears Holdings Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268052\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/237/311/#p329\">\n    237 F.Supp.3d 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 329 (D.

Therefore, instead of the test stated in Bullard's motion, Bullard must meet the three part test from\n   <em>\n    Glover\n   </em>\n   to show that a mark has become generic, namely, a party must: \"(1) identify the class of product... to which use of the mark is relevant; (2) identify the relevant purchasing public of the class of product...; and (3) prove that the primary significance of the mark to the relevant public is to identify the class of product...to which the mark relates.\"\n   <em>\n    Glover\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7622819\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/74/57/#p59\">\n    74 F.3d at 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Bullard cannot meet this test. Notably, for the third prong, SafeRack has already submitted undisputed testimony from consumers that its use of orange to the purchasing public indicates the company rather than the class of product. (Dkt. No. 50-6 at 7; \"I would say...that SafeRack stands out being orange in a world that's gray.\"); (Dkt. No. 50-10 at 39 - 40; \"If it's orange...I'm 95 percent sure that's a SafeRack product.\"). Bullard's arguments regarding the mark being generic further try to relitigate issues of orange as a color that denotes safety, which the Court already found unpersuasive. Therefore, it is undisputed that SafeRack's mark is not generic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Regarding distinctiveness, Bullard again argues that SafeRack has not acquired distinctiveness for \"every shade of orange across the orange color space.\" (Dkt. No. 49-1.) Again, though, SafeRack is not limited to the sole shade of orange included in its USPTO registration, and Bullard cannot infringe on SafeRack's trademark even where it uses a slightly different shade of a color.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cava Grp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203632689\">\n    2016 WL 3632689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 ;\n   <em>\n    T-Mobile US, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323813\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/991/888/#p910\">\n    991 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   911 ;\n   <em>\n    The Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=149%20U.S.P.Q.%20%28BNA%29%20656\">\n    149 U.S.P.Q.

Tex. 2014) (\"The case law does not support Aio's underlying assumption that once T-Mobile identifies and pursues protection of a particular Pantone color, that color cannot be protected or acquire secondary meaning unless every appearance and use conforms exactly to that color.\"). Instead, it is SafeRack's use of the color orange \"in [a] context [that] seems unusual\" and \"tying that color to [its] product\" that makes the mark protectable,\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Christian Louboutin S.A. v.

Fraud\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Finally, Bullard alleges that SafeRack obtained its registration fraudulently. Bullard's argument has no merit, and instead rests on out of context statements and misstatements of testimony. For instance, Bullard argues that SafeRack misstated that amount of revenue \"relat[ed] to the orange color mark.\" (Dkt. No. 58 at 3.) However, SafeRack's CFO merely acknowledged that there are \"component\n   pieces\" on some products that \"don't have orange.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Simply because some part of a product does not have orange does not prevent SafeRack from counting the sale as related to its orange color mark.

Obvious mark infringement by Bullard would cause irreparable harm to SafeRack. Furthermore, since Bullard never sold any infringing equipment and it instead chose to \"await the decision on this lawsuit\" before selling the equipment with orange components, purely legal remedies\n   are inadequate and would not prevent Bullard from deciding at some point in the future to sell equipment with orange railings, gates or cages. The hardships balance in SafeRack's favor as its mark would be infringed upon and Bullard has no right to infringe on SafeRack's mark, and the public interest would be served by preventing future consumers from being misled. Therefore, SafeRack is entitled to a permanent injunction against Bullard using the color orange as applied to railings, gates, and cages of fall protection equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    H.

Therefore, for the same reasons discussed regarding SafeRack's trademark infringement claim, it is undisputed that SafeRack is entitled to summary judgment for unfair competition under the SCUTPA.

The Court also notes that, even if admissible, Ms. Morton's opinion regarding the difference in the shades of orange used by SafeRack and Bullard is irrelevant.
