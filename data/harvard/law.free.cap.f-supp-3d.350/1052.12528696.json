The Court held a hearing on September 14, 2018. The primary issue is whether evidence of land use by other than Plaintiff Pueblo of Jemez after 1848 -- the year when the Pueblo Indians can under United States jurisdiction -- is relevant to whether Jemez Pueblo holds continuing aboriginal title to the Valles Caldera.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court denies MIL 1,\n   because the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has expressly instructed the Court to consider such evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pueblo of Jemez v.

Specifically, the Tenth Circuit has instructed the Court to consider evidence necessary to determine whether Jemez Pueblo's use of the Valles Caldera was exclusive as to other Indian Tribes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6769576,4272849\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/790/1143/\">\n    790 F.3d at 1165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he 'exclusive' part of the test mean[s] ... that in order to establish aboriginal title, a tribe must show that it used and occupied the land to the\n   <em>\n    exclusion of other Indian groups.\n   </em>\n   \" (internal quotation marks omitted)(emphasis in original) ). The Tenth Circuit also has instructed the Court to consider whether Jemez Pueblo's use of the Valles Caldera suffered interference by others after Congress granted the land to the Baca family in 1860.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6769576,4272849\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/790/1143/\">\n    790 F.3d at 1166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[I]f there was actually substantial interference by others with these traditional uses before 1946, the Jemez Pueblo will not be able to establish aboriginal title.\"). Furthermore, because the expert report authored by Dr. Terence Kehoe contains relevant evidence of multiple Pueblos' use of the Valles Caldera, the Court will not exclude the substance of Dr. Kehoe's report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Expert Report of Dr. Terence Kehoe at 19-20, filed August 31, 2018 (Doc. 249-1)(\"Kehoe Report\").

The Valles Caldera is a dormant crater of a\n   supervolcano located at the center of the Jemez Mountains. The crater rim itself is twenty miles in diameter and is surrounded by four high-mountain valleys and eleven resurgent volcanic domes. The crater rim, high-mountain valleys, and volcanic domes are located within the exterior boundaries of the Valles Caldera National Preserve.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The Jemez Pueblo is made up of the ancestral Jemez populations of Towa-speaking pueblos, including the Pecos Pueblo and the Jemez Pueblo village of Walatowa. The ancestral Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title allegedly included the Rio Jemez drainage and the Valles Caldera, an area known to the Pueblo Jemez as the \"western Jemez homeland.\"\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   ... The western Jemez homeland includes a portion of the land at issue in this case within the Valles Caldera National Preserve and covers an area of more than 1,100 square miles in and around the Jemez Mountains. It includes the entire Rio Jemez drainage system above Walatowa, the modern Jemez Pueblo village, and sections of the Rio Puerco drainage west of the Jemez Mountains.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The western Jemez homeland contains ancestral Jemez Pueblo villages, sacred areas, and ceremonial shrines where the ancestral Jemez have lived since migrating from the mesa and canyon country to the northwest prior to 1200 CE. The Jemez Pueblo's oral history refers to the area to the northwest and describes the great southern migration to its western Jemez homeland. Archeological investigations in the western homeland have found at least sixty pueblo villages linked with a network of trails and many thousand farmhouse sites, agricultural fields, ceremonial sites, sacred areas, mineral procurement areas, camp sites, and other areas associated with the ancestral Jemez. The ancestral Jemez population in the western homeland has ranged from about 10,000 to 15,000 during the prehistoric period and from 7,000 to 10,000 during the Spanish colonial period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The ancestral Jemez maintained an extensive network of agriculture and farming practices in the Valles Caldera and Jemez Mountains. The Valles Caldera contains many important sacred areas and religious sites of the traditional ancestral Jemez culture and the area is greatly valued by the Jemez Pueblo as a spiritual sanctuary. The ceremonial sites and gathering areas are still actively used by the Jemez Pueblo today and are crucial to the continuing survival of traditional Jemez Pueblo culture and religion. Ancient religious pilgrimage trails link Walatowa to sites within the Valles Caldera, including Redondo Peak and sacred springs, and the Jemez Pueblo members continue to make religious pilgrimages to these sites to leave prayer offerings and conduct rituals. The Jemez Pueblo hunt societies make lengthy visits to the Valles Caldera to hunt and conduct religious ceremonies and initiations of new members. Moreover, the mineral and hot springs within the Valles Caldera are used by the Jemez Pueblo's medical societies for healing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The Jemez continue to rely on the Valles Caldera for many critical resources, as they have done for more than 800 years, including the land and water for livestock; plants and animals on the land for subsistence living; timber for construction and firewood; mountain and forest shelter from the elements; plants, herbs, and roots for medicine;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   aspen and willow for drums and ritual objects; oak, cherry, and mahogany for bows and ritual objects; rosewood, plums, and reeds for arrows; obsidian and chert for stone tools; minerals for paint and pigments; spring water and evergreens for ceremonial rites; large and small game for ceremonial use; and feathers for ceremonial use and for arrows. The Jemez Pueblo alleges that by this native occupancy and use it has established aboriginal title to the lands at issue in the Valles Caldera National Preserve.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6769576,4272849\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/790/1143/\">\n    790 F.3d at 1148-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and the Baca Land Grant\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 1848, the United States signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, thereby ending the Mexican-American war and acquiring the territory of New Mexico.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, U.S.-Mex., Feb. 2, 1848, art.

Although Jemez Pueblo contends that it possessed unextinguished aboriginal title in 2000, when Congress passed the Preservation Act, the United States argues that Jemez Pueblo was divested of aboriginal title in 1860, when the United States granted the land encompassing the Valles Caldera to the Baca family.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 10. The United States contends that the ICCA bars Jemez Pueblo's action in this case because of the ICCA's \"finality provision,\" which states that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (1) payment of any claim after a determination under the Act shall be a full discharge of the United States of all claims and demands touching any of the matters involved in the controversy, and (2) a final determination against a claimant made and reported in accordance with the Act shall forever bar any further claim or demand against the United States arising out of the matter involved in the controversy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Motion at 11 (quoting ICAA \u00a7 22(a) ).

According to the United States, issue preclusion obtains because the ICC: (i) \"made specific factual findings ... defining the outer contours of the Pueblo's aboriginal lands\"; (ii) paid an award to Jemez Pueblo that discharged all matters in controversy, which was effectively the Court of Claims' final judgement; and (iii) permitted Jemez Pueblo to provide \"extensive\" evidence, which is indicative of a \"full and fair\" opportunity to litigate.

Moreover, according to the United States, the ICC already concluded that the United States' decision \"to relinquish ownership and control of land in the public domain ... extinguished any aboriginal title.\" Motion at 24.

Jemez Pueblo thus contends that it never had a \"full and fair\" opportunity to litigate this claim, which is exclusive to the Valles Caldera. Response at 34.

Jemez Pueblo avers that it brought its claim within the QTA's twelve-year statute of limitations period, and that the claim should be evaluated under that statute and not the ICCA, because the claim accrued only in 2000 when the United States acquired an interest to the Valles Caldera.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellant Br. at 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Jemez Pueblo argues that Judge Brack ignored the distinction between extinguished and unextinguished title when he decided the factual merits of Jemez Pueblo's claim under rule 12(b)(1) without making the necessary factual determination of when Jemez Pueblo's claim accrued.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellant Br. at 17-19.

Moreover, Jemez Pueblo asserts that it could not have brought a claim for equitable relief in 1946, because the QTA was not enacted until 1972 and because the United States did not at that time have an interest in the Valles Caldera.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellant Br. at 25-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Jemez Pueblo argues that Judge Brack further erred when he held that the ICCA provides the exclusive remedy for unextinguished Indian land claims, as the ICCA is remedial legislation for takings designed to end the practice whereby Congress required individual Tribes to obtain such legislation on an ad hoc basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellant Br. at 27-28. Jemez Pueblo identifies seven separate arguments, each of which indicate that the ICCA is not an exclusive remedy: First, the legislative history proves that Felix Cohen, \"the author of the definitive treatise on Indian law,\" informed the\n   House Indian Committee Chairman that the ICCA statute of limitations \"would only deny a remedy for\n   <em>\n    then existing claims\n   </em>\n   .\" Appellant Br. at 28 (emphasis in Appellant Br.). Second, according to Jemez Pueblo, caselaw does not support the United States' assertion that the waiver of sovereign immunity imposes an \"exclusive -- money damages only -- remedy\" for Indian Tribes alleging unextinguished property rights. Appellant Br. at 28. Third, according to Jemez Pueblo, a \"great number\" of Indian Tribes have successfully litigated Tribal rights to land and water, chief among them being Congress' enactment of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act on December 18, 1971, \"the largest land claims settlement in United States history.\" Appellant Br. at 30. Fourth, according to Jemez Pueblo, the Tenth Circuit's ostensible support for the exclusive remedy theory in\n   <em>\n    Navajo Tribe v. New Mexico\n   </em>\n   does not bar Jemez Pueblo's claim, because that case involved land that was \"indisputably taken by the federal government in 1908 and 1911,\" which had \"clearly accrued as of 1946.\" Appellant Br. at 35. Fifth, according to Jemez Pueblo, the exclusive remedy theory is contrary to Supreme Court precedent, because the Supreme Court has adjudicated numerous \"live\" title claims to water and land rights in the years since 1946. Appellant Br. at 42-44. Sixth, according to Jemez Pueblo, the United States has taken inconsistent positions on the ICCA's effect on otherwise unextinguished aboriginal title by previously arguing in favor of the Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo's post-1946 claim to aboriginal water rights in\n   <em>\n    New Mexico, ex rel.

Seventh, according to Jemez Pueblo, nothing in the ICCA's jurisdictional grant is intended to extinguish valid title claims, and \"no decision under the ICCA has ever cited the Act itself as taking or extinguishing Indian title.\" Appellant Br. at 51. Jemez Pueblo concludes that the Tenth Circuit should reverse Judge Brack and thereby follow the Supreme Court precedent in\n   <em>\n    Tee-Hit-Ton Indians v. United States\n   </em>\n   , wherein the Supreme Court noted the \" 'compassionate purpose' of the ICCA and federal policy to 'extinguish Indian title through negotiation.' \" Appellant Br. at 51-53 (citing\n   <em>\n    Tee-Hit-Ton Indians v.

Br.\"). ICCA \u00a7 12 applies, according to the United States, because Jemez Pueblo's claim accrued no later than 1860, when the United States \"unconditionally transferred\" the Valles Caldera to the Baca heirs. Resp. Br. at 15. The United States argues that Judge Brack properly determined the accrual question, based on the United States' conveyance of the land to the Baca heirs, without needing to reach the merits of Jemez Pueblo's claim that it exercised \"full dominion\" over the Valles Caldera. Resp. Br. at 18. The United States argues that ICCA \u00a7 22 applies, because Jemez Pueblo \"already litigated its claim to aboriginal title before the ICC\" and received payment from the federal government, thereby discharging all future \"claims and demands touching any of the matters involved in the controversy.\" Resp. Br. at 15 (citing ICCA \u00a7 22(a) ). Again, the United States argues that Judge Brack properly reached this conclusion without considering the merits of Jemez Pueblo's claim, because \"there is no overlap between the substantive issue of whether Jemez Pueblo holds continuing aboriginal title and whether Jemez Pueblo's claims of aboriginal title before the\n   ICC touched on its current claim.\" Resp. Br. at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The United States contends that ICCA \u00a7 12 divests Article III courts of jurisdiction over Jemez Pueblo's claim, because its claim existed before 1946, and Congress expressly deprived district courts of jurisdiction over all claims that could have been brought before the ICC, to include suits to quiet title.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. Br. at 20. Claim preclusion applies to Jemez Pueblo, according to the United States, because even unextinguished claims could have been litigated before the ICC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. Br. at 21. The United States notes that the only remedy available to Tribes was monetary compensation, because Congress desired to ensure that \"non-Indians were assured of continuing possession regardless of the outcome of the litigation.\" Resp. Br. at 22. Furthermore, that the claim accrued before 1946 is evident, because three factors indicate that the United States acted \"inconsistently\" with Jemez Pueblo's alleged aboriginal title in 1860: First, the Surveyor General found that these lands were \"vacant\" before authorizing their transfer to the Baca heirs, in conflict with Jemez Pueblo's claim that they \"occupied\" the lands at the time. Resp. Br. at 24-25. Second, according to the United States, the United States transferred the disputed lands to the Baca heirs \"absolutely, without condition,\" which necessarily \"extinguished any aboriginal title (if any existed),\" thereby causing any claim based on aboriginal title to accrue. Resp. Br. at 26. The United States rejects Jemez Pueblo's assertion that the Baca grant is subject to pre-existing interests, because the statutory language contains no such limitation. Resp.

Furthermore, according to the United States, even if Jemez Pueblo could point to evidence of Congressional intent for the QTA to displace ICCA \u00a7 12, the QTA's twelve-year statute of limitations would bar Jemez Pueblo's claim, which accrued in 1860 when the United States first asserted an interest in the Valles Caldera.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp.

The Tenth Circuit adds that, given that the taking in\n   <em>\n    Navajo Tribe of Indians v.

The Tenth Circuit concludes that, because\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   there is no evidence the Pueblo had a claim against the United States prior to 1946 with respect to the land involved in this action, we disagree with the government that the Jemez Pueblo could have brought its current claims before the ICC in the prior litigation.

Jemez Pueblo references\n   <em>\n    Santa Fe\n   </em>\n   as \"the touchstone\" for analysis of whether aboriginal title has been legally extinguished. MIL 1 at 7. According to Jemez Pueblo,\n   <em>\n    Santa Fe\n   </em>\n   requires evidence of \"plain and unambiguous Congressional action, a treaty of cession, purchase pursuant to Congressional enactment or Treaty, [or] collective (official) tribal abandonment\" to extinguish aboriginal title.

Jemez Pueblo contends that ICC caselaw is inapplicable to an Article III court's analysis of title extinction, because \"United States Supreme [C]ourt decisions are absolutely clear that once aboriginal Indian title has been established, only the federal government can extinguish title and only in accordance with the clear principle of law stated in\n   <em>\n    Santa Fe Pacific\n   </em>\n   and many other Supreme Court decisions.\" MIL 1 at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Jemez Pueblo argues that the ICC and Court of Claims findings of Indian title takings and extinguishment are \"absolutely incompatible\" with existing Supreme Court precedent \"in countless decisions since the founding of the Republic.\" MIL at 9. It follows, according to Jemez Pueblo, that, given this incompatibility, the Court should not follow rulings on aboriginal title extinguishment authorized in the \"Article I Court of Claims.\" MIL 1 at 9. Cases exploring the establishment of Indian title, on the other hand, \"are an important addition to the analysis performed by Article III Courts.\" MIL 1 at 9. Because the ICC was limited to adjudicating compensation for Congressionally authorized extinguishment in the years preceding 1946, asserts Jemez Pueblo, extinguishment analysis is irrelevant to the analysis that present-day Article III courts perform.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MIL 1 at 9-10. Jemez Pueblo notes that the ICC was prone to conclude that takings occurred, because, in the 1940s, \"it was widely believed that tribes would soon pass out of existence and be fully assimilated into the dominant society.\" MIL 1 at 10. Jemez Pueblo argues that, given this political climate, together with \"contingent compensation of the claims attorneys, almost no lawyer was motivated to prove continuing Indian title,\" leading to \"spurious\" takings claims that provide no guidance to the Court. MIL 1 at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Jemez Pueblo cites a number of ICC cases which describe \"methods\" of extinguishment based on \"tacit stipulations of counsel for both sides that a taking occurred,\" thereby leaving the ICC to decide only when such taking occurred, which was important for compensation and \"counsel's contingent fee.\" MIL 1 at 11. Jemez Pueblo argues that, \"[i]n essence, the ICC and the Court of Claims allowed counsel to make up the law to suit their mutual objectives -- resolution of the claim for the lawyers for the United States, and payment of fees to counsel for the plaintiff tribe.\" MIL 1 at 12. Jemez Pueblo highlights four \"egregious examples\" of \"non-takings\" that resulted in ICC compensation and subsequent citations \"as precedent\n   for the imaginary 'takings' which were the basis of liability\":\n   <em>\n    Western Shoshone Identifiable Group v.

The showing for actual and continuous use, on the other hand, requires that Jemez Pueblo prove that it used the Valles Caldera \"without substantial interference by others\" before 1946, an inquiry that the United States asserts \"can overlap with the question whether a tribe's aboriginal title has been extinguished.\" MIL 1 Response at 8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The United States rejects Jemez Pueblo's assertion that \"[w]hether non-Indians (or Indians) interfered with [Jemez Pueblo's] continuing use and occupancy is not an issue,\" arguing instead that a Tribe which physically abandons land has lost aboriginal title.

The United States contends that, of the four cases which Jemez Pueblo cites as \"egregious examples\" of \"non-takings,\" the first three are not among those which the Tenth Circuit relies on in this case.

Jemez Pueblo cited to similarities between this case and\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Jemez Pueblo argued that, as a result of the court's holding in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Jemez Pueblo further questioned the legitimacy of ICC takings findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   And rather than providing a remedy for ancient wrongs as Congress promised when it enacted the Indian Claims Commission, the ICC became an engine to quiet title to Indian lands in favor of the United States and on the cheap.

Jemez Pueblo asked the Court to view this case through the lens of property law -- not Indian law -- and specifically requested that the Court observe the \"ordinary rules of property conveyance,\" which require \"an actual conveyance, not trespass or gradual encroachment.\" Tr. at 64:19-65:4 (Luebben). Jemez Pueblo repeated that the principle of adverse possession does not apply to aboriginal title.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 65:4-5 (Luebben).

Jemez Pueblo explained how, under\n   <em>\n    Santa Fe\n   </em>\n   , there are only four ways to extinguish aboriginal title: \"Plain and unambiguous Congressional action; a treaty of cession, voluntary by the Tribe; purchase pursuant to a Congressional act under a treaty; and intentional Tribal abandonment.\" Tr. at 68:6-10 (Luebben).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Jemez Pueblo rejected the United States' proposition that\n   <em>\n    Santa Fe\n   </em>\n   held that trespass by White settlers extinguished the Tribe's aboriginal title, arguing instead that the suit was to enjoin interference with the Tribe's unextinguished aboriginal title.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 68:12-21 (Luebben). In further rejecting the United States' reliance on the ICC gradual takings theory, Jemez Pueblo asserted that ICC rulings were administrative in nature and therefore inferior to Article III courts, especially the Supreme Court, and also guided by questionable motives: \"[T]he claims attorneys in order to get paid; the United States in order to quiet title.\" Tr. at 68:22-69:17 (Luebben).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Jemez Pueblo noted that every ICC award for an alleged taking was based either on an express or an implied stipulation of extinguishment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 70:17-19 (Luebben). Jemez Pueblo referred the Court to the original petition in\n   <em>\n    Pueblo of San Ildefonso v.

Jemez Pueblo added that the plaintiffs in these cases wanted a later date to maximize the historical appraisal value, while the United States\n   \"wanted an earlier date to minimize compensation.\" Tr. at 72:2-4 (Luebben). Jemez Pueblo argued that this process reached \"its height of absurdity\" in\n   <em>\n    Western Shoshone Identifiable Group v. United States\n   </em>\n   and in\n   <em>\n    Gila River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community v. United States\n   </em>\n   , wherein the Court of Claims determined that the takings were effectuated by \"gradual encroachment of White settlers\" and \"quote, 'a fit of absentmindedness,' unquote, by the trustee.\" Tr. at 72:4-12 (Luebben). Jemez Pueblo referred the Court to the 1978 DOI memorandum under which \"any analysis of the Taylor Grazing Act, its history and purpose, brings one to the ultimate conclusion that neither the Taylor Grazing Act nor its implementation can operate to extinguish Indian title.\" Tr. at 72:23-73:2 (Luebben).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Jemez Pueblo rejected the United States' contention that the Tenth Circuit's opinion in this case mandates application of the ICC gradual encroachment decisions, because the ICC lacked -- and never claimed to have -- jurisdiction to extinguish title on its own authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 73:3-13 (Luebben). Jemez Pueblo argued that the decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Dann\n   </em>\n   supports its position, because, in that case, the Supreme Court held that the Tribe's land claims \"were not terminated until the preclusion provision of Section 22(a) of the Indian Claims Commission Act was triggered by payment of the ICC award.\" Tr. at 73:14-18 (Luebben). Jemez Pueblo notes that this decision is distinct from a quiet title action, whereby a court's decree concludes the title adjudication, because the litigation in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Dann\n   </em>\n   did not end until the award was paid, and even then the Tribe's claim to aboriginal title was precluded -- not explicitly extinguished.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 73:14-24 (Luebben). It follows, argued Jemez Pueblo, that \"if the United States had ever opposed a tribal allegation of a taking on the merits ... the ICC would have lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate that title.\" Tr. at 74:2-5 (Luebben).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Jemez Pueblo asserted that the extent of the Tenth Circuit's holding is that neither the 1860 Baca grant nor the 2000 Preservation Act extinguished aboriginal title.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 74:10-12 (Luebben). Therefore, according to Jemez Pueblo, because the issue whether trespass or interference can extinguish aboriginal title was not before the Tenth Circuit, the Court is not required to take evidence of interference with Jemez Pueblo's use and occupancy by the Baca heirs, \"or even other Indians.\" Tr. at 74:12-17 (Luebben). Jemez Pueblo argued that the only remaining issues are whether Jemez Pueblo established aboriginal title before 1860 and whether Congress extinguished, or Jemez Pueblo abandoned, that title.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 74:8-10 (Luebben). Jemez Pueblo noted that, should it prevail in this suit, it has proposed that the Valles Caldera \"be made into the first tribal cultural national park with aboriginal title held by the Pueblo and a co-management agreement with the National Park Service, whereby it would continue to be fully opened to the public and all pre-existing rights would be respected.\" Tr. at 74:20-25 (Luebben).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The Court questioned Jemez Pueblo about its statement that this is a property law case and not an Indian law case, because the cases in the table of authorities in MIL 1 struck the Court as being cases of important Indian law and not of property law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 76:1-7 (Court). Jemez Pueblo responded that the cases which the Court references are \"property cases that deal with aboriginal title,\" which is unique, in part, because aboriginal title is subject to extinguishment, and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution does not protect that title. Tr. at 76:8-13 (Luebben). Jemez Pueblo further explained that this case is a property case,\n   because, once Jemez Pueblo establishes aboriginal title, issues of trespass or interference become irrelevant given that the only question is whether Jemez Pueblo abandoned -- or Congress extinguished -- its title.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 76:15-19 (Luebben). Moreover, attention to chain of title is important, asserted Jemez Pueblo, because nothing in Anglo-American property law dictates that trespass can extinguish aboriginal title and effect conveyance to the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 76:19-23 (Luebben). Jemez Pueblo concluded that this case is a \"very straightforward\" property law case: if it cannot establish aboriginal title, \"then the case is over,\" and if it can establish aboriginal title, \"then the interference is merely trespass, and the only question is whether Congress extinguished it or the Pueblo abandoned it.\" Tr. at 76:25-77:8 (Luebben).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   The United States responded that the Tenth Circuit's opinion in this case is dispositive as to Jemez Pueblo's requests in MIL 1, because, although the Tenth Circuit held that the 1860 Baca grant could not per se extinguish aboriginal title, it remanded the case to determine whether aboriginal title ever existed, and, assuming that such title did exist, whether the Baca grant resulted in substantial interference with Jemez Pueblo's use of the Valles Caldera.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 77:23-78:19 (Dykema). The Court asked the United States whether the Tenth Circuit's decision means that Jemez Pueblo can have aboriginal title while the Baca heirs used the Valles Caldera as a ranch.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 78:20-23 (Court). The United States responded in the affirmative and referred the Court to the Tenth Circuit's discussion of how aboriginal title to the Valles Caldera could persist if, for example, \"a peaceful and private Indian pueblo ... used portions of this large area of land for its traditional purposes, while one agreeable rancher was using portions of it for grazing livestock.\" Tr. at 79:10-13 (Dykema). The Court asked the United States whether, according to its analysis of the Tenth Circuit's opinion, the Court must \"look at what occurred after 1860 to determine whether ... the Bacas having [the Valles Caldera] allowed [Jemez Pueblo] to continue to have title.\" Tr. at 80:2-5 (Court). The United States responded in the affirmative and stated that this case \"was remanded specifically for this Court to take that evidence.\" Tr. at 80:6-7 (Dykema). The United States quoted from the Tenth Circuit's opinion in this case that whether Jemez Pueblo can prove that it had aboriginal title \"in 1860 and thereafter is a fact question to be established on remand,\" and that, to establish aboriginal title, Jemez Pueblo \"must show actual exclusive and continuous use and occupancy for a long time.\" Tr. at 80:9-19 (Dykema). The United States conceded that the exclusivity requirement applies only to other Tribes' use and not to \"the whole world,\" as it had previously argued on appeal. Tr. at 80:23-24 (Dykema).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The United States asserted that Jemez Pueblo cannot satisfy the continuous use and occupancy requirement \"if the Bacas or their successors, the Bonds or the Dunigans, substantially interfered with ... the traditional uses of the property.\" Tr. at 81:2-8 (Dykema). Moreover, averred the United States, if there is evidence of others' substantial interference with Jemez Pueblo's traditional uses of the Valles Caldera before 1946, not only can Jemez Pueblo not establish aboriginal title but its claim would also be time-barred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 81:16-22 (Dykema). Thus, actual interference with traditional occupancy and uses before or after 1946 is the question on remand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 81:24-82:2 (Dykema).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   The United States rejected Jemez Pueblo's \"low regard\" for the ICC and Court of Claims cases that the Tenth Circuit cited, and argued instead that the Tenth Circuit \"specifically ruled that the Court of Claims cases on extinguishment provide guidance\n   for the resolution of the case on remand.\" Tr. at 82:3-13 (Dykema). The United States noted that, although the ICC \"typically only had to determine the date on which extinguishment happened,\" it also had to define extinguishment, which the Court of Claims did when ruling on the ICC decisions that the Tenth Circuit has adopted as \"governing authority\" in this case. Tr. at 82:14-20 (Dykema). The United States disagreed that the Tenth Circuit's discussion of the ICC and Court of Claims cases is dicta, because \"anything in those decisions that provide guidance as to the legal principles to be applied is ... the mandate of the Court.\" Tr. at 82:21-25. In rejecting Jemez Pueblo's interpretation of\n   <em>\n    United States v. Dann\n   </em>\n   , the United States countered that \"the question here is not whether the ICC had the power to extinguish, but ... the ICC's decisions as to what constitutes extinguishment by the federal government.\" Tr. at 83:1-7 (Dykema). Further support for this position, asserted the United States, is seen in\n   <em>\n    Pueblo of Nambe v. United States\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Pueblo of Taos v. United States\n   </em>\n   , wherein the court held that creation of a national park effected extinguishment by \"limiting the access and the freedom of access of those pueblos to the land in question.\" Tr. at 83:8-15 (Dykema). The United States argued that the Tenth Circuit has instructed the Court to take as guidance the ICC and Court of Claims cases which suggest that, contrary to Jemez Pueblo's assertions, aboriginal title does not \"continue[ ] ad infinitum unless Congress expressly extinguishes it.\" Tr. at 83:16-20 (Dykema). The United States added that Jemez Pueblo's position is \"at war with common sense,\" because \"it implies that ... aboriginal title continues even if other tribes occupied the land to [Jemez Pueblo's] exclusion, even if [Jemez Pueblo] ceased all use, even if the private owners to whom Congress gave the land put up a fence and precluded all use by [Jemez Pueblo] for 150 years.\" Tr. at 84:13-21 (Dykema). The United States added that the Indian Nonintercourse Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20177\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , is irrelevant to these proceedings, because it was enacted \"to prevent the government's Indian wards from improvidently disposing of their lands and becoming homeless public charges,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   to give the federal government a role in aboriginal title extinguishment. Tr. at 84:22-85:10 (Dykema). \"The federal government here had a role,\" argued the United States; \"[t]hey gave the land to the Bacas.\" Tr. at 85:10-11 (Dykema).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   As to Jemez Pueblo's discussion of the mandate doctrine, the United States averred that \"the remand to take evidence on substantial interference or not is a part of the Court's mandate, the Tenth Circuit's mandate, as is the Court of Appeals' instruction that the case law of the Court of Claims and the ICC regarding what accomplishes extinguishment is providing guiding law.\" Tr. at 85:15-19 (Dykema). The United States agreed with Jemez Pueblo that the mandate rule is \"nothing more than a specific application of the Law of the Case Doctrine,\" but added that \"the doctrine stands for the proposition that an appellate decision on an issue must be followed in all subsequent trial court proceedings unless [there is] presentation of new evidence or [an] intervening change in the controlling law.\" Tr. at 85:21-86:6 (Dykema).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   The United States argued that this case is not one of gradual encroachment of non-Indian settlers, but rather of \"an act by Congress giving this land, in fee, to private parties, and a decision by the Tenth Circuit that if the result of that was substantial interference with [Jemez Pueblo's] traditional use of the property, aboriginal title -- whatever aboriginal title may have once existed is gone.\" Tr. at 86:9-14 (Dykema). The Court asked whether this reasoning makes sense to the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 86:15 (Court). The United States responded\n   in the affirmative, and referred the Court to\n   <em>\n    Pueblo of Nambe v. United States\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Pueblo of Taos v. United States\n   </em>\n   , because those cases suggest that, \"if the act of Congress results in a substantial encroachment upon that original estate, then Congress has acted in a way to accomplish extinguishment.\" Tr. at 86:16-24 (Dykema). The Court opined that, although it is inclined to agree with the United States' understanding of the Tenth Circuit's mandate in this case, it is unsure whether it agrees with the Tenth Circuit's analysis of the relevant caselaw.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 87:2-5 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     LAW REGARDING ABORIGINAL TITLE\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Aboriginal title, or original Indian title, refers to American Indian land occupancy rights premised on exclusive use and occupancy of a particular territory at the time of first European contact, and to an entitlement arising subsequent to such contact under the governing European sovereign's laws, which are derived largely from international law concepts that prevailed before the American Revolution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pueblo of Jemez v.

The factual context sufficient to find a gradual taking of aboriginal title in\n   <em>\n    Gila River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community v. United States\n   </em>\n   is: (i) Congressional authorization to establish an Indian reservation; (ii) Congressional authorization of non-Indian settlement of historic Indian lands; and (iii) Congressional ratification of an Executive Order that doubled the size of the reservation, thereby implying Congress' belief that aboriginal title to non-reservation lands was extinguished when the Executive Order was issued.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10812504,192917\" index=\"554\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/494/1386/\">\n    494 F.2d at 1394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The claim in the\n   <em>\n    Zia\n   </em>\n   litigation arose after Congress passed the Taylor Grazing Act and the Secretary of the Interior -- pursuant to the Taylor Grazing Act and at the President's direction -- issued an order establishing a grazing district; \"the effect of this Order was that [the Pueblos] were now required to obtain grazing licenses and pay grazing fees for the use of lands which they were still using up to the date of said Order, and had been using for livestock grazing from time immemorial.\"\n   <em>\n    Zia III\n   </em>\n   , 19 Ind.

Hence, there is a fourth factor that may contribute to aboriginal title extinguishment: a cabinet-level order, pursuant to a Congressional act, that in some manner encumbers a Tribe's use of their historic lands, either through licensing requirements or the paying of fees. The encumbrance must result from Congress' act or by the President executing Congressional will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   The Court of Claims in the\n   <em>\n    Zia\n   </em>\n   litigation also references another factor that may result in aboriginal title extinguishment: the unilateral designation -- by Congress or by the President -- of Indian land for another public use, such as the creation of a national forest reserve or, again, a grazing district.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 Ind.

Importantly, each of the factors found in the cases cited by the Tenth Circuit involve some action on the part of Congress, either directly or through the President, that significantly affects an Indian Tribe's use of their historic lands. In this way, the Court of Claims never completely abrogated Congressional intent to extinguish aboriginal title, but rather found that Congressional intent was implied based on various actions offensive to aboriginal use and possession. Because, in this case, neither party has suggested that Congress has expressly extinguished aboriginal title to the Valles Caldera, the Court will consider evidence of use after 1848 helpful insofar as such evidence speaks to the five above-mentioned factors, each of which support the Tenth Circuit's mandate to consider evidence of \"substantial interference by others\" with Jemez Pueblo's traditional use of the Valles Caldera.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Pueblo of Jemez v.

Second, the United States engaged in prolonged military conflict with the Pit River Indians in the 1850s and 1860s, which culminated in the Tribe's defeat and in the Tribe's involuntary removal from its historic lands.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1062275\" index=\"562\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/535/1145/#p1149\">\n    535 F.2d at 1148-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Fourth, the Tribe brought a damages claim against the United States before the ICC for the taking of its lands, and, in an agreement settling all California Indians' outstanding aboriginal title claims, the ICC awarded the Tribe compensation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1062275\" index=\"564\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/535/1145/#p1149\">\n    535 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1149 (citing\n   <em>\n    Pit River Indians v.

In concluding that the Tribe previously had acknowledged the extinguishment of its aboriginal title by accepting the ICC award, the Ninth Circuit opined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-255\">\n   The exact date on which Indian title has been extinguished is often difficult to determine. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Pueblo of San Ildefonso, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1391.) The four events we have recounted amply illustrate that problem. Any one of these actions, examined in isolation, may not\n   provide an unequivocal answer to the question of extinguishment. However, the activity of the federal government, beginning with the ambiguous Act of 1851 and culminating in the payment of the compromise settlement, has included expulsion by force, inconsistent use, and voluntary payment of compensation agreement.

Although the Court is uncomfortable with finding a taking based on a \"century-long course of conduct,\" the Court concedes that each of these four events independently suggests Congressional intent to extinguish the Pit River Tribe's aboriginal title.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1062275\" index=\"569\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/535/1145/#p1149\">\n    535 F.2d at 1149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Moreover, the United States argues that, in compiling his expert report, Dr. Kehoe \"studied, among other things, use of the Valles Caldera lands by other Tribes and interference with Jemez's use of the Valles Caldera during the years when the Baca, Bond, and Dunigan families owned the land.\" MIL 1 Response at 13.

First, the Court of Claims opinions do not bind the Tenth Circuit and, without the Tenth Circuit's directive, this Court.

In discussing\n    <em>\n     Baker v. Harvey\n    </em>\n    , the Supreme Court in\n    <em>\n     Santa Fe\n    </em>\n    stated that \"the Act of 1851 was interpreted as containing machinery for extinguishment of claims, including those based on Indian right of occupancy.\"\n    <em>\n     Santa Fe\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6139837\" index=\"743\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/314/339/#p345\">\n     314 U.S. at 350\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6139837\" index=\"744\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/314/339/#p345\">\n     62 S.Ct. 248\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Court concludes that such machinery is the appropriate vehicle for aboriginal title extinction and disagrees that the gradual taking theory is the appropriate standard when, as in this case, the question whether a taking occurred is the subject of the litigation before the Court. Nevertheless, the Court interprets the Tenth Circuit's mandate as requiring the Court to consider evidence of \"substantial interference\" with Jemez Pueblo's traditional use of the Valles Caldera, regardless whether Jemez Pueblo can demonstrate that it possesses aboriginal title to those lands.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-326\">\n    Notwithstanding the Tenth Circuit's mandate, the Court expresses its concern that, by failing to acknowledge the unique factual circumstances surrounding the Court of Claims' takings findings, the Tenth Circuit has overemphasized the Court of Claims cases' precedential value. For this reason, the Court emphasizes in the Memorandum Opinion and Order that all evidence of aboriginal title extinguishment must also evidence Congressional intent, if not on the face of the statute -- as the Court would prefer -- then through evidence of substantial Congressionally authorized interference, as discussed in greater detail in the above section of the Court's analysis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-327\">\n    Finally, while the Court has tried to lay out specifically what the Tenth Circuit requires, and the Court has also stated that it does not think that the Tenth Circuit correctly analyzed the applicable, controlling aboriginal title extinguishment law -- the Supreme Court precedent -- the Court also takes the opportunity to state what it would decide on a clean slate, if it were Chief Justice John Marshall confronting the issue in the early days of the Republic. The Court agrees, as a starting point, that aboriginal title is, in the words of the Marshall Court, \"as sacred as the fee simple of the whites\"; courts must take this statement seriously. What taking that principle seriously would mean is that taking of aboriginal title by the United States must be express and not implied by the circumstances. On a clean slate, the Court would not adopt the gradual taking theory but would require evidence of clear and unambiguous Congressional intent to extinguish aboriginal title, and require that such intent be obvious on the face of a Congressional statute.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
