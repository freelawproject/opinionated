At step one, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff had not engaged in substantial gainful work activity since August 21, 2012, the alleged onset date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At step two, the ALJ found that Plaintiff suffered from the severe impairments of degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine and degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18). The ALJ further found that Plaintiff's medically determinable impairments of breathing difficulties associated with asthma, left shoulder pain, and history of learning disabilities were non-severe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At step three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of any Listing.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff retained the RFC to perform light work as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1567\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and 416.967(b), which involves:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   lifting and/or carrying 20 pounds occasionally and ten pounds frequently, standing and/or walking for six hours in an eight-hour workday, and sitting for six hours in an eight-hour workday.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23). Accordingly, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was not disabled as defined in the Act.

In May 2014, PA Gemelli prepared a medical source statement, which was co-signed by Dr. Martin. (Dkt. 10 at 277-80). However, a closer look at the record - and the law - reveals that\n   neither PA Gemelli's nor Dr. Martin's opinion is entitled to the deference afforded to treating physician opinions.

At that time, PA Gemelli completed a medical source statement, which consisted of a four-page, check-box form. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 277-80). For \"exertional limitations,\" PA Gemelli noted that Plaintiff: could frequently lift and/or carry less than 10 pounds; stand and/or walk at least two hours in an eight-hour workday; sit for less than about 6 hours in an eight-hour workday; and that Plaintiff's ability to push and/or pull was limited in his lower extremities.

PA Gemelli opined that Plaintiff could never climb ramps, stairs, ladders, ropes, or scaffolds; could occasionally balance, kneel, and crouch; and could never crawl or stoop. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Further, PA Gemelli opined that Plaintiff could occasionally reach in all directions, and was unlimited in handling, fingering, and feeling.

Further, the ALJ assigned \"limited weight\" to the rating that Plaintiff was 67 percent temporarily disabled, because it was not supported by a functional assessment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In explaining why he assigned limited weight to these opinions, the ALJ pointed to several pieces of objective medical evidence contradicting the opinions of PA Gemelli and Dr. Martin, including: treatment notes from Dr. Ganesh; records from Syracuse Orthopedic Specialists, where Plaintiff established care in January 2014, well after the alleged onset date; results of electrodiagnostic testing in April 2014; records from East Hill Family Medical; results of an EMG and nerve conduction study ; and physical therapy records.

At Plaintiff's most recent visit with PA Gemelli in August 2014, PA Gemelli did not make note of any objective medical evidence supporting Plaintiff's neck and back complaints; rather, Plaintiff appeared in no distress, and he exhibited no edema. (Dkt. 10 at 314). In other words, the May 2014 medical source statement prepared by PA Gemelli and co-signed by Dr. Martin is not supported by any functional assessment or by PA Gemelli's treatment notes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Further, PA Gemelli's and Dr. Martin's opinions are not supported by other objective medical evidence in the record. In November 2013, Plaintiff underwent a consultative examination with Kalyani Ganesh, M.D. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 247-50). At the examination, Plaintiff complained of neck and back pain, but admitted that he had not participated in formal treatment since 2010, and he did not have a treating doctor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 247). Plaintiff also reported that he was able to cook, clean, and do laundry once a week, as well as shop once a week. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He was able to shower, bathe, and dress daily. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In assessing Plaintiff's general appearance, gait, and station, Dr. Ganesh noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   The claimaint appeared to be in no acute distress. Gait normal. Can walk on heels and toes without difficulty. Squat was\n   50%; effort was poor. Stance normal. Used no assistive devices. Needed no help changing for exam or getting on and off exam table. Able to rise from chair without difficulty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 248). Further, Dr. Ganesh's musculoskeletal assessment revealed that Plaintiff's:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Cervical spine show[ed] full flexion, extension, lateral flexion bilaterally, and full rotary movement bilaterally. No scoliosis, kyphosis, or abnormality in thoracic spine. Lumbar spine shows full flexion, extension, lateral flexion bilaterally, and full rotary movement bilaterally. SRL negative bilaterally. Full ROM of shoulders, elbows, forearms, and wrists bilaterally. Full ROM of hips, knees, and ankles bilaterally. No evidence subluxations, contractures, ankylosis, or thickening. Joints stable and nontender. No redness, heat, swelling, or effusion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 249). Dr. Ganesh noted that Plaintiff's prognoses was stable and concluded that \"[n]o gross physical limitations are noted to sitting, standing, walking, or the use of upper extremities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ attributed \"some weight\" to Dr. Ganesh's opinion based on her \"programmatic expertise,\" but found that other evidence in the record, including the diagnostic imaging and EMG tests in the record, revealed that Plaintiff had some limitations for lifting, carrying, and postural activities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20). It was proper for the ALJ to afford \"some weight\" to Dr. Ganesh's opinion and only \"limited weight\" to the opinions of PA Gemelli and Dr. Martin, considering that Dr. Ganesh's opinion was supported by information relevant to Plaintiff's functional assessment. In contrast, both treatment notes from PA Gemelli, as well as the medical source statement from PA Gemelli and Dr. Martin, lacked any meaningful functional assessment relating to Plaintiff's neck and back pain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Suarez v.

Plaintiff began treatment at SOS in January 2014. (Dkt. 10 at 261). At the initial visit with Warren E. Wulff, M.D., Plaintiff reported that \"the only care ... he gets is by visiting Emergency Rooms for pain medication.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). A physical exam revealed some moderate limitations: Plaintiff's gait was antalgic, but he was able to climb onto the examination table without pain; he held his head in flexion, but his spinal alignment revealed normal lordosis ; his cervical and lumbar range of motion was moderately limited; he had moderate tenderness over the right cervical paraspinal area and over the lumbosacral junction; he did not appear to be in acute distress; and his coordination was normal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 262). A February 3, 2014 MRI of Plaintiff's cervical spine revealed significant foraminal narrowing from C2-3 through C7-T1, and moderate spinal stenosis at C5-6 and C6-7. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 264). At an appointment with Helen Harris, PA-C (hereinafter, \"PA Harris\") at SOS on February 5, 2014, Plaintiff's coordination and gait were normal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 267). Plaintiff did not use an assistive device, and he held his head in neutral. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). PA Harris assessed neck pain and cervical spine stenosis, and reviewed Plaintiff's options for treatment, which included doing nothing, therapy, pain management, and surgery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff elected to proceed with pain management. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). PA Harris also noted a temporary impairment rated at 67 percent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   At a March 2014 visit with SOS, Plaintiff reported that he was in pain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 268). A physical examination revealed that Plaintiff had a normal gait, a full, painless range of motion in both hips, and minimally limited lumbar range of motion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 270). Plaintiff had mild tenderness over the right lumbar paraspinal area, and a straight leg raise test was negative bilaterally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). An April 2014 MRI of the lumbar spine revealed disc protrusions at L4-5 and L5-S1 on the right, and compression of the right S1 nerve root. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 272). Plaintiff followed-up with SOS in April 2014 following his lumbar MRI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 273). A physical examination was normal, aside from a minimally limited lumbar range of motion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 275). Under the heading \"Plan,\" it was noted that Plaintiff would continue with conservative treatment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiff continued treating with SOS in May 2014, and he appeared for his appointment using a cane. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 290). Plaintiff's gait was normal, and he was able to climb onto the examination table without assistance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). A physical exam was mostly normal, save for a notion that Plaintiff had minimally limited lumbar range of motion, and mild tenderness over the lumbar paraspinal areas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Under \"Plan,\" it was noted that Plaintiff would continue with conservative treatment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff's physical examinations at subsequent visits in August 2014 were similar. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 291-98). Records from August 26, 2014 note that Plaintiff was not able to \"walk on [his] heels\" or \"balance on toes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 297). Dr. Wulff noted that \"all [Plaintiff] really needs from me today is a disability statement.... I told him I think he can do only sedentary work at this time. He doesn't want to do anything else treatment-wise.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Wulff also noted that \"the percentage of temporary impairment is 75%.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Wulff did not issue any formal opinion relating to Plaintiff's functional limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In sum, records from SOS-particularly Plaintiff's physical examinations-were mostly normal, with some minimal limitations. Although Plaintiff's MRI revealed some abnormalities in Plaintiff's lumbar and cervical spine, the ALJ referenced these objective findings and concluded that Plaintiff had greater limitations for lifting, carrying, and postural activities than those assessed by Dr. Ganesh, and adjusted the RFC to include some limitations on those activities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20). In other words, the records from SOS support the ALJ's RFC assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiff contends that the ALJ failed to discuss certain pieces of evidence, including Plaintiff's paresthesia and numbness, failed to note that Plaintiff appeared to be in moderate pain, and failed to note that Plaintiff used an assistive device to walk.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   10 at 290, 293, 297). Similarly, while at some visits to SOS Plaintiff \"appear[e]d to be in moderate pain,\" the records also note that he was not in any acute distress. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 262, 297).

It is clear from the written determination that the ALJ reviewed the entirety of the record, and he cited to specific medical evidence conflicting with the opinions offered by PA Gemelli and Dr. Martin. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21). Accordingly, the ALJ properly evaluated the opinion evidence in the record.

The ALJ explained that the additional limitations in the RFC - which included climbing, kneeling, crouching, stooping, balancing, and crawling - had little to no effect on the occupational base for unskilled light work. (Dkt. 10 at 22). The ALJ pointed to guidance contained in SSRs 83-14 and 85-15, providing that limitations\n   on climbing, kneeling, crouching, stooping, balancing, and crawling do not significantly erode the occupational base.
