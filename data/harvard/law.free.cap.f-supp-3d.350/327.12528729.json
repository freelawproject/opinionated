(Doc. 1). Petitioner challenges the constitutionality of his prolonged detention by the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In response, Respondent contends that Petitioner is an \"arriving alien\" who is lawfully detained under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and is not entitled to release or a bond hearing.

For the reasons set forth below, the Court will grant in part Petitioner's writ of habeas corpus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Petitioner is a citizen and national of Haiti. (Doc. 6-1, pp. 3-5, Record of Deportable/ Inadmissible Alien). On November 6, 2016, Petitioner applied for admission to the United States at the San Ysidro, California, port of entry, and was apprehended by agents of the United States Customs and Border Protection. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He had no valid immigration documents and immigration officials found Petitioner to be inadmissible pursuant to section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 6-1, p. 8). Petitioner was taken into ICE custody pending his removal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 6-1, p. 8). When interviewed by Customs and Border Protection Agents, Petition stated that \"he would not be harmed if he is returned to his country of citizenship\" and that \"he has no fears and concerns of being removed from the U.S. and being returned to his country of citizenship.\" (Doc. 6-1, p. 4). On November 7, 2016, an expedited order of removal was issued. (Doc. 6-1, p. 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Petitioner subsequently applied for asylum. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 6-1, p. 12). On May 1, 2017, an immigration judge denied Petitioner's applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and withholding of removal under Article III of the Convention Against Torture Act, and ordered Petitioner removed from the United States. (Doc. 6-1, p. 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Petitioner appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 6-1, p. 13). On June 29, 2017, the BIA ordered that the record be returned to the Immigration Court as the audio recording of the removal proceedings was missing. (Doc. 6-1, p. 14). On August 16, 2017, the Immigration Court resolved the issue regarding the audio recording, and returned the case to the BIA for adjudication. (Doc. 6-1, p. 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 18, 2018, the BIA again returned the case to the Immigration Court. (Doc. 11, pp. 3-4; Doc. 12, pp. 3-4). On May 30, 2018, an immigration judge denied Petitioner's applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and withholding of removal under Article III of the Convention Against Torture, and ordered him removed from the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On June 18, 2018, Petitioner appealed this decision to the BIA, where it remains pending. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 12, 2017 and February 27, 2018, Petitioner requested parole pending the resolution of his immigration proceedings. (Doc. 11, p. 4; Doc. 12, p. 7). ICE denied each request for parole. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 28, 2018, Petitioner again requested parole pending the resolution of his immigration proceedings. (Doc. 12, pp. 29-30). On July 31, 2018, ICE conducted an interview and determined that parole was not appropriate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 32-35). In rendering this decision, ICE determined that Petitioner did not establish that he is not a flight risk, he did not establish that he has substantial ties to the community, and imposition of bond or other parole conditions would not ensure his appearance at required immigration hearings pending the outcome of his case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) governs the detention of \"aliens arriving in the United States,\" and mandates the detention of \"arriving aliens\" who, like Petitioner, do not possess valid entry or travel documents when they arrive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ahmed v.
