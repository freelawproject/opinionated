BROWNING, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court on the Plaintiff People's Trust Federal Credit Union's and Defendant National Credit Union Administration Board's Motion. The Court held a hearing on June 26, 2017. The primary issues are: (i) whether the Court should vacate the preliminary injunction hearing set for June 28, 2017, to allow for additional settlement talks; (ii) whether the Court should stay further proceedings in this case through the date of the new preliminary injunction hearing; and (iii) whether the Court should continue the temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") issued,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Memorandum Opinion and Order at 26,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204491635\">\n    2016 WL 4491635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12, filed August 8, 2016 (Doc. 26) (\" MOO\"), until after the Court holds the preliminary injunction hearing. The Court recorded its decision in this matter in the Order. As the Court promised in the Order, the Court now issues a Memorandum Opinion to explain its order. The Court denied the request to extend the stay, because, at the hearing, the intervenor -- Alliant Credit Union (\"Alliant CU\") -- did not agree to extend the stay, and, under rules 16 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Alliant CU has a right to have a preliminary injunction hearing or to refuse to modify a scheduling deadline. Accordingly, the Court did not vacate the scheduled preliminary injunction hearing and also denied the request to continue the TRO for\n   largely the same reasons. The Court thus denied the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court described the facts leading to this case and the early procedural history in the MOO.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MOO at 2-14,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204491635\">\n    2016 WL 4491635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-5.

Accordingly, the Court will describe the state litigation and the proposed settlement agreement. The Court will then describe the earlier federal litigation involved in this case. Since 2012, both Chetco CU's liquidation and the Foreclosure Action have progressed. In July, 2015, as trial approached in the Foreclosure Action, disagreements arose between the interest holders. Specifically, shortly before the August 17, 2015, trial setting of the Foreclosure Action, People's Trust asked the NCUA Board and Alliant CU to approve the proposed settlement agreement in the underlying foreclosure action between People's Trust and the debtors in the Foreclosure Action (the \"Settlement Agreement\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, at 4-5.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion for TRO at 4-5.

Motion at 1. In the Motion, People's Trust contends that a continuance of the TRO is justified, because NCUA -- the other party to the TRO -- has agreed to it, so \"neither NCUA nor People's have a need to move forward with the hearing currently set for June 28, 2017.\" Motion at 2. People's Trust also argues that a stay and continuance is required, because it believes \"it is in all parties' best interest to continue negotiating unresolved issues for settlement of this case,\" and that it believes having the preliminary injunction hearing would jeopardize a global settlement.

People's Trust joined the conversation to clarify that it opposes a preliminary injunction hearing, because the Court would base any preliminary injunction on a statute that only the NCUA Board can invoke, and neither the NCUA Board nor People's Trust want the statute invoked.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 6:3-7:21 (Jontz).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court tried to assess Alliant CU's interest in the preliminary injunction hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 7:22-25 (Court);\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 9:5-20 (Court, Keleher). People's Trust explained its view that Alliant CU had no interest in the TRO or a preliminary injunction hearing, because People's Trust had no reason to proceed with the arbitration now that the NCUA Board and People's Trust had reached an agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 8:1-8 (Jontz). In the NCUA Board's opinion, Alliant CU should have no interest in a preliminary injunction hearing, because People's Trust has ceased trying to settle the Foreclosure Action on the original terms and Alliant CU would not be a party to the arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 8:20-9:4 (Hisey). Alliant CU cited three reasons for holding the hearing: (i) Alliant CU's settlement negotiations have reached an impasse; (ii) the delays in the preliminary injunction hearing frustrate Alliant CU; and (iii) Alliant CU had not known that People's Trust and the NCUA Board had reached a deal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 9:21-10:15 (Keleher). Alliant CU took the position that an agreement about the loan could not compromise Alliant CU's collateral without its consent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 10:25-11:5 (Keleher). Alliant CU stated that, if the NCUA Board and People's Trust have reached an agreement, Alliant CU wants to see the stipulated preliminary injunction order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 11:5-11-14 (Keleher).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Court observed that Alliant CU's main desire is that the other two parties \"put together a preliminary injunction rather than continuing to extend the stay,\n   and continue the temporary restraining orders,\" and the Court asked the parties if they would be willing to agree to a preliminary injunction order. Tr. at 11:2-13 (Court). People's Trust and the NCUA Board agreed to try to agree to a preliminary injunction order so that a hearing on a preliminary injunction would not be necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 16:2-7 (Jontz);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18:13-17 (Hisey);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:11-13 (Court)(\"If y'all work out a preliminary injunction then you can submit it and that would take care of the hearing.\"). The Court subsequently orally denied the Motion, \"because there is not an agreement on it,\" and because Alliant CU has \"a right to either have a hearing or get a preliminary injunction in place.\" Tr. at 18:18-25 (Court). The Court stated that it would hold the preliminary injunction hearing on September 28, 2018, at 8:30 A.M. and that the parties should work to determine how long the hearing would take.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 19:18-20:25 (Court, Clerk).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    5.\n    <em>\n     The Agreed Order and Preliminary Injunction\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The day following the hearing, June 27, 2017, the parties submitted and the Court entered the Agreed Order and Preliminary Injunction at 1-2, filed June 27, 2017 (Doc. 53)(\"Agreed Order\").
