Dkt. 7. After holding oral argument, the Court took the motion under advisement. Upon review, the Court now issues the following decision DENYING the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 1, 2018, the Abortion Complications Reporting Act (\"the Act\") went into effect in Idaho. Codified as Idaho Code section 39-9501 et seq., the Act requires that all medical providers who perform abortions-including hospitals, licensed health care facilities, and medical practitioners-file a written report with the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare (\"IDHW\") concerning any direct or indirect complications stemming from an abortion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants (\"the State\") contend that the Act was implemented to collect valuable information about abnormal events that occur because of an abortion and that this information is necessary to protect public health and safety. Planned Parenthood, on the other hand, asserts that animus was the motivating factor behind the Act and that the reporting requirements are unconstitutional. Planned Parenthood now seeks a preliminary injunction enjoining the State from enforcing the Act during the pendency of this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that: (1) they are likely to succeed on the merits; (2) they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) the balance of equities tips in their favor; and (4) an injunction is in the public interest.\n   <em>\n    Short v.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Success on the merits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Planned Parenthood proposes that the Act's constitutional violations fall into four main categories: vagueness, equal protection, due process, and null and void privacy requirements. In support of each proposition, Planned Parenthood discusses at length the various complications outlined in the Act and whether they are truly medical complications. In response, the State likewise spends a great deal of time discussing the finer points and nuances within the Act. These are assuredly valid arguments, and the details have been insightful to the Court, but at this stage of the litigation, the Court seeks to determine-broadly-whether\n   there is sufficient evidence to support a finding in Plaintiff's favor. The details will be dealt with later in the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    1. Vagueness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   First, Planned Parenthood argues that the Act is unconstitutionally vague. In short, this is the crux of the case. Generally speaking, Planned Parenthood alleges that the Act is so confusing in what it requires, and so broad in its scope, that a reasonable person would have a difficult time understanding what they must do to adequately comply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Act requires that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Every hospital, licensed health care facility or individual medical practitioner shall file a written report with the department regarding each woman who comes under the hospital's, health care facility's or medical practitioner's care and reports any complication, requires medical treatment or suffers death that the attending medical practitioner has reason to believe, in the practitioner's reasonable medical judgment, is a direct or an indirect result of an abortion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%2039-9504\">\n    Idaho Code \u00a7 39-9504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1). The Act further defines complication as \"an abnormal or a deviant process or event arising from the performance or completion of an abortion, as follows:\" and then lists 37 complications.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%2039-9503\">\n    Idaho Code \u00a7 39-9503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) et seq.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Planned Parenthood contends that many of these so-called complications are not complications at all, but normal minor side effects,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   not true medical conditions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   not specific to abortions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   not possible in an abortion,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   not related to abortions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   or almost all encompassing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Along with its concerns that many of the listed items bear little connection to abortions, Planned Parenthood contends that by saying a provider must report any of these issues if they arise \"directly or indirectly\" from an abortion, there is no way to know an appropriate timeframe-e.g. does an infection that arises a week later need to be reported-or what even qualifies as \"indirect.\" Planned Parenthood provides the affidavit of Dr. A\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   who states that the Act is so confusing, even as a medical professional, she has no idea what the Act actually requires [of her].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In response, the State asserts that Planned Parenthood has left out the crucial qualifying statement of the Act that requires that these complications only need be reported if \"in the practitioner's reasonable medical judgment\" they stemmed from an abortion. The State further points out that under the definition of complication, the incident must be \"an abnormal or deviant process or event\" and therefore the Act does not, as Planned Parenthood suggests, require that practitioners report anything and everything but only complications that are\n   <em>\n    abnormal\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    in their professional opinion\n   </em>\n   arose directly or indirectly from an abortion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Planned Parenthood takes issue with this reading of the statute and asserts that a provider does not have discretion in determining whether a complication is a complication (as each is explicitly laid out in list form as a complication), but that the provider or practitioner only has discretion in determining if the complication arose as a result of an abortion. The State counters that there is inherent discretion in determining if a complication is a complication with the preceding language in the definition that the medical condition be \"abnormal or deviant.\" Thus, according to the State, a practitioner would never need to report simple bleeding or a light fever, but only heavy or excessive bleeding and a high fever that persist for more than 24 hours. The State adds that some discretion is built into the individual complications themselves (for example \"heavy\" is not defined, so a practitioner has discretion in determining if the bleeding is truly heavy/excessive or not). Admittedly, Planned Parenthood uses this exact example as why the Act is vague rather than discretionary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   It is somewhat difficult to accept the State's argument that there is discretion in determining what is a complication when the wording of the Act specifically states that \" 'Complication'\n   <em>\n    means\n   </em>\n   an abnormal or a deviant process or event arising from the performance or completion of an abortion,\n   <em>\n    as follows.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%2039-9503\">\n    Idaho Code \u00a7 39-9503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) (emphasis added). In other words, the statute does not appear to give a practitioner discretion in determining if a complication is abnormal, but instead\n   <em>\n    explicitly tells them what complications are considered abnormal\n   </em>\n   and must be reported. This, however, slightly conflicts with the State's position in briefing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   at oral argument,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and most interestingly, with the recently published directions for reporting under the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Abortion Complications Reporting Form Instructions outline that \"[i]f a woman reports one or more of the following items to you and,\n   <em>\n    based upon your reasonable medical judgment, it is an abnormal or a deviant process or event arising from the performance or completion of an abortion\n   </em>\n   , you must report it ...\" Dkt. 14-1, at 2 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Thus, the instructions seem to indicate that if a woman reports one of the 37 listed complications, the practitioner has the discretion to determine both 1) if it is abnormal or deviant and 2) if it arose from an abortion. Said differently, under the first interpretation of the Act, if a woman reports an injury to her uterus, the practitioner\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   report it; however, under the second, the practitioner would have the initial discretion of determining whether that injury was abnormal or deviant. The Court understands the State's argument; however, it is still difficult to reconcile it with the actual words of the statute that a \"complication means ... as follows\" which appear to take away the initial discretion and instead tell a practitioner what is considered abnormal or deviant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As the State noted at oral argument, the parties are \"diametrically opposed\" on this issue of whether there is discretion in the actual determination of a complication. Undoubtedly this topic will play an integral role in the remainder or this case, but at this juncture, the Court need not reach a determination on that point, but simply ascertain whether Planned Parenthood has carried its burden of proving there are questions of vagueness in the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In support of its proposition that the Act is not vague, the State has submitted numerous affidavits-including from a medical practitioner, a midwife, and a member of the state board of medicine-in which each individual states that they do not find the Act confusing at all, and that based upon their experience and judgment, they do not foresee any difficulties in the reporting requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, the State considers Planned Parenthood's argument that it cannot understand what constitutes an abnormal complication somewhat disingenuous as it [Planned Parenthood] lists many of the exact same conditions on its own website as complications.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court finds this argument somewhat compelling. Although Planned Parenthood might not agree that some of the 37 listed items are worthy of reporting, it is difficult to accept that the Act is vague or that Planned Parenthood does not understand-medically-what the complications are, as it addresses many of the same issues on its website. Additionally, if some of the complications-like stroke-rarely if ever occur following an abortion, that does not make them vague, but (for lack of a better word) superfluous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finally, the parties are divided on what weight, if any, the Court should give to the District Court of the Southern District of Indiana's recent decision\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   to issue a preliminary injunction on a similar statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Planned Parenthood contends that the statutes are extremely similar and that this Court should follow the Indiana Court, by finding that Planned Parenthood is likely to succeed on its constitutional vagueness challenge, and grant an injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   For its part, the State asserts that the two Acts differ slightly, but that this small distinction makes all the difference. The State alleges that Indiana defined \"abortion complication\" as \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   adverse physical or psychological condition arising from the induction or performance of an abortion,\" and provided a non-exclusive list of 26 examples of the types of conditions that qualify.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2016-34-2-4\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 16-34-2-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .7 (emphasis added). The Indiana Court enjoined this law because it found the phrase \"any adverse physical or psychological condition\" vague and noted that, because the term \"includes\" was inserted before the list of conditions, that list could not be construed as an exclusive list.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The State contrasts this to the Act in Idaho where it is not just\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   adverse condition, but only those that are listed, and argues that because the Act does not use the word \"includes\" before its list of conditions, the list itself is exclusive. The Court agrees. While the two Acts are indeed similar, the impetus for the Indiana Court's decision is not present here. While there may be other reasons the Act is vague-perhaps the nature of the complications themselves, or the aforementioned \"discretion\" disagreement-it cannot be said that the same vagueness exists here as to the exclusivity of the list. As will be discussed below, the Court finds that irreparable harm will not occur in this case\n   in the absence of an injunction. Therefore, even though there are similarities in the two statutes, the Court must take a different approach here then that taken by the Court in Indiana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In conclusion, it appears Planned Parenthood is being a little myopic in its position regarding vagueness. While a lay person may not understand exactly how much bleeding (for example) is considered \"heavy,\" such a determination is not as difficult for a medical professional-particularly someone who performs abortions-to understand. Thus, the requirements are not so much vague, as they are technical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On the other hand, the State's assertion that all the listed complications are easy to understand is a stretch. Some of the complications appear to be only tangentially related to abortion procedures, and more refined language may have better informed practitioners of what exactly they must report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, there is the polarizing issue of discretion. Disagreement between the parties alone does not rise to the level of vagueness, however there does appear to be a chance of success on the merits of Planned Parenthood's vagueness challenge. The Court finds that this prong of the inquiry is met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   That said, the Court will briefly address Planned Parenthoods other constitutional challenges to help narrow the scope of this case moving forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    2. Equal Protection\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Planned Parenthood asserts that the Act is a discriminatory law that singles out only one type of medical procedure (abortion)-and those who perform them-when there are numerous other procedures (some vastly more complicated or dangerous) that could result in the same \"complications\" but require no reporting. Under an equal protection analysis, Planned Parenthood relies on\n   <em>\n    Lazy Y Ranch Ltd. v. Behrens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3893653\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/546/580/#p589\">\n    546 F.3d 580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 589 (9th Cir. 2008), and asserts that the Act categorizes them and impermissibly imposes a different and unique burden on them without any legitimate reason.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Cleburne v.

Citing various debates that took place during the Idaho legislative sessions, Planned Parenthood asserts that the motivation behind the Act's passage was animus and that the State has no legitimate basis for collecting information about abortions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The State acknowledges that abortion is a constitutionally protected right, but asserts that the Supreme Court has specifically held that an abortion can be treated differently than other medical procedures because it is fundamentally different.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

The licensed professionals who work at facilities where abortions are performed are, however, subject to regulation and monitoring by licensing boards, such as the Idaho Board of Medicine and the reports filed under the Act must be made available to the Board of Medicine in case there are indications that a physician may not be following the standard of care or is potentially putting patient safety at risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Lastly, the Court notes that Planned Parenthood's animus argument stems from the comments of a single Idaho legislator who opined that the penalties associated with the Act were too harsh and were the Act related to a subject other than abortion,\n   they [the state legislature] wouldn't approve of such measures. This single opinion about penalties does not rise to the level of animus as required under the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Upon review, the State's reasons for implementing the Act appear rationally related to a legitimate government interest. Additionally, there is no evidence that the State implemented that Act out of animus-to Planned Parenthood specifically, or abortion providers generally-as the Act applies to all medical practitioners.

Because the categories are vague and discretionary, the reports will be ineffective and erratic in their results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Furthermore, Planned Parenthood points out that there is already a statute-implemented in 1977-that requires the attending physician to file a report with the IDHW following each abortion performed in the State of Idaho. This statute-\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%2039-261\">\n    Idaho Code \u00a7 39-261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -requires that the doctor document whether there were any complications under the following six categories: 1) hemorrhage, 2) infection, 3) uterine perforation, 4) cervical laceration, 5) retained products, and 6) \"other\"-essentially a \"catch-all\" category. The IDHW compiles this data annually and provides it (as a statistical report) to the Idaho legislature and the public at large.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court need not address this challenge in full as it has already determined that the State has met its burden in establishing that there is a legitimate, rational reason for the Act-public health and safety-and that it was not motivated by animus. The motivations appear neither arbitrary nor irrational in violation of substantive due process principles. Furthermore, the fact that the statistics may not provide a perfect picture of abortions in Idaho does not render the statute unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355778\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/312/#p319\">\n    509 U.S. at 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355778\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/312/#p319\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Courts are compelled under rational-basis review to accept a legislature's generalizations even when there is an imperfect fit between means and ends.\").

Privacy Null and Void\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Finally, Planned Parenthood argues that the Act is unconstitutional because its privacy provisions are null and void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Under the Act, \"[t]he statistical report shall not lead to the disclosure of the identity of any medical practitioner or person filing a report under this section nor of a woman about whom a report is made.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%2039-9504\">\n    Idaho Code \u00a7 39-9504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4).

The Legislature amended the\n   Idaho Public Records Act in 2015 to explicitly provide that after January 1, 2016:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   [a]ny statute which is added to the Idaho Code and provides for the confidentiality or closure of any public record or class of public records shall be placed in the Public Records Act.

Because the Act at issue here was created after January 1, 2016, Planned Parenthood contends its privacy provisions are null and void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The State asserts that this is an incorrect reading of the Idaho Public Records Act. The Court agrees. The Public Records Act specifically provides some types of records that are exempt from disclosure including \"[a]ny public record exempt from disclosure by federal or\n   <em>\n    state law\n   </em>\n   or federal regulations to the extent\n   <em>\n    specifically provided for\n   </em>\n   by such law or regulation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%2074-104\">\n    Idaho Code \u00a7 74-104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) (emphasis added). Here, because the Act-a state law-specifically provides that the reports are not public records and are to remain confidential, they are exempt from disclosure under section 74-104(1) of the Public Records Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Second, the State explains that even if there was a conflict between the Act and the Public Records Act regarding whether the reports were exempt from public records act requests, two canons of statutory construction establish that the Act's directives govern. The first canon provides that, \"[t]o the extent of a conflict between an earlier and later statute, the more recent expression of legislative intent prevails.\"\n   <em>\n    State of Idaho v.

App. 2010). Since the Act is the more recent statute (enacted in 2018) as opposed to the Public Records Act (enacted in 2015), the Act's directive that the reports shall not be deemed public records and shall remain confidential governs. The second canon provides that \"[w]here two statutes deal with the same subject matter, the more specific will prevail.\"\n   <em>\n    Betterton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11923375\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/127/562/\">\n    127 Idaho at 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11923375\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/127/562/\">\n    903 P.2d at 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).

Irreparable harm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Under this second prong of the preliminary injunction inquiry, Planned Parenthood broadly asserts that because the rights at issue are constitutional rights, if the Act is not enjoined, its practitioners will suffer irreparable harm. Planned Parenthood also specifically notes that if information from the reports becomes public, providers and/or patients could suffer physical harm and that its providers could be subjected to penalties for failing to comply with the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   A plaintiff may obtain an injunction only where he or she can \"demonstrate immediate threatened injury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    Caribbean Marine Servs. Co. v.

This however, is extremely unlikely. As the Court has already noted, the confidentiality provisions of the Act are enforceable. There is no reason to assume that any information about a patient or provider will become public knowledge. And perchance it does, there are available remedies. The Act specifically instructs those who provide the reports to withhold identifying information about the patient, Idaho Code section 39-9504(3), and in fact criminalizes the improper dissemination of information found in the reports, Idaho Code section 9506(2). Here, there is only a limited chance-not the requisite \"likelihood\" standard-that this harm will occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Third, Planned Parenthood alleges that without an injunction, its providers may be subject to penalties and professional discipline for not complying with the Act. While understandable, this concern is only a possibility-again not rising to the level of \"likelihood\" as required-but must be addressed in more detail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As a threshold matter, the Court notes that this is only a \"harm\" if Planned Parenthood or its providers willfully disobey the provisions of the Act. Planned Parenthood alleges that if its practitioners do not understand the Act or misconstrue a provision or complication, they could be subject to penalties. This interpretation, however, is not entirely correct. The only circumstance in which the Act imposes a penalty is when a practitioner willfully fails to file a report when a complication has occurred (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%2039-9506\">\n    Idaho Code \u00a7 39-9506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3) ), or files a false report (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%2039-9506\">\n    Idaho Code \u00a7 39-9506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) ). Thus, Planned Parenthood will not be fined for its disagreements about what exactly constitutes any particular complication so long as they still file the report and do not falsify information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Most important to the Court's decision today is the fact that this possible harm may never arise during this litigation due to the time requirements built into the statute itself. The Act outlines that no provision therein \"shall be applicable until ten (10) days after the requisite forms are first created or until the effective date of this chapter, whichever is later.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%2039-9505\">\n    Idaho Code \u00a7 39-9505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, the Act went into effect on July 1, 2018, but the forms were not published until August 30, 2018. Dkt. 14. The \"later\" date of August 30, 2018, is therefore the date with which calculations begin. Second, the Act requires that that the reports be filed \"within ninety (90) days from the last date of treatment or other care or consultation for the complication.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%2039-9504\">\n    Idaho Code \u00a7 39-9504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Therefore, even assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that one of Planned Parenthood's providers performed an abortion on exactly September 9, 2018,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a complication arose and was dealt with the same day,\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   that practitioner or provider would not be required to file a report under the Act until December 8, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the absolute earliest that anyone would be \"forced\" to file a report-outlining a complication that arose from an abortion-or face penalties, is still almost seven weeks from entry of this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Furthermore, if no complications arise, there is no need to report. Although the Court recognizes the limits of statistics, it is interesting to review the Bureau of Vital Records and Health Statistics July 2018 report concerning abortion complications. This report compiles the number of complications that arise from abortions under the six areas identified in the 1977 Statute. The report notes that of all the abortions performed in Idaho in the last five years less than one half of one percent (approximately .4%) reported complications. Obviously, the Act at issue here includes many more categories of complications, but as Planned Parenthood frequently notes, abortions are an overall safe procedure for the women who seek them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In conclusion, personal information will not be released to the public and will not result in any harm. There is also no harm that will ensue from penalties under the Act (such as fines, professional sanctions, or license suspensions) as these will only occur if a practitioner fails to report a clear complication or files a false report. Even then, the earliest that a report need be filed is December 8, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   There is, as always, the possibility that harm\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   occur; however, the mere possibility is not enough.

Balancing of equities and D.

Rather, the Act requires medical practitioners to report such things as \"heavy or excessive bleeding\" and \"blood clots\" when-and\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    when-those conditions are \"an abnormal or a deviant process or event arising from the performance of completion of an abortion.\" Dkt. 12, at 8-9.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    \"If you apply the complication in context to the remainder of the act, that reasonable medical judgment will be exercised.

Under the Act, however, if a provider determines that the particular situation was not abnormal it need not be reported. Thus, reasonable medical minds could differ on exactly what needs to be reported.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    When the Court inquired of the State how it would treat different (honest and professional) interpretations as to whether something was or was not abnormal-or a direct or indirect result of an abortion-it admitted that it would rely on the practitioner's judgment. Presumably because the discretionary aspects of the Act would be difficult, if not impossible, to monitor or fine, the State recognizes that there might be slight discrepancies in reporting. The State noted that it would only \"come after\" someone who failed to report or falsely reported. By all accounts, it appears the State's interest is in collecting data, not fining or sanctioning practitioners.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    The first day the reporting requirements were in effect (i.e. 10 days after the forms became available).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Because again, if there was follow up treatment for a condition, the clock would not begin until that \"treatment or other care of consultation for the complication\" was complete.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    The Court is not implying that practitioners should always wait until the last possible moment to file the report, but simply notes that under the circumstances present here, there is a large window of time before a report even needs to be filed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Thus, even if Planned Parenthood disagrees with some of the complications as outlined in the Act, because by all accounts complications seem infrequent, it will not be overly burdensome to err on the side of caution and simply report what is required by the Act during the pendency of this suit. Compliance with the Act will not result in any adverse consequences and is not irreparable harm; any \"harm\" will be self-inflicted (i.e. penalties from actively not complying with the Act through failure to file or the filing of a knowingly false report).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    The Court is not implying that this case will be fully resolved before that point, simply that the harm is more remote and frankly may not even happen during the pendency of this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
