Initially, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff last met the insured status requirements of the Act on June 30, 2014. (Dkt. 8-2 at 24). At step one, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff had not engaged in substantial gainful work activity since February 28, 2012, the alleged onset date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At step two, the ALJ found that Plaintiff suffered from the severe impairments of diabetes, chronic kidney disease, gastroparesis, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and borderline personality disorder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25). The ALJ further found that Plaintiff's medically determinable impairments of cannabis use, alcohol use, hypertension, left foot pain, and lower back pain were non-severe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At step three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of any Listing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26). The ALJ particularly considered the criteria of Listings 6.03, 9.00, 1.00, 2.00, 4.00-6.00, 8.00, 11.00, 12.00, 12.04, 12.06, and 12.08 in reaching his conclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff retained the RFC to perform light work as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1567\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and 416.967(b), which involves:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   lifting and/or carrying 20 pounds occasionally and ten pounds frequently, standing and/or walking for six hours in an eight-hour workday, and sitting for six hours in an eight-hour workday.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-32). Accordingly, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was not disabled as defined in the Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32-33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Remand of this Matter for Further Proceedings is Necessary\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff asks the Court to reverse or, in the alternative, remand this matter to the Commissioner, arguing: (1) the ALJ's assessment of Plaintiff's physical RFC did not rely on any medical opinion evidence, and he therefore substituted his own judgment for a competent medical opinion; (2) the ALJ failed to account for Plaintiff's stress-related limitations in assessing her mental RFC; (3) the ALJ's step five finding was not supported by substantial evidence, because he failed to consult a vocational expert; (4) the ALJ failed to consider the impact of Plaintiff's chronic hospitalizations on her ability to work; and (5) the ALJ improperly held Plaintiff's noncompliance with treatment against her, without considering the reasons for her noncompliance. (Dkt. 10-1 at 18-24). For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that the ALJ erred in failing to obtain any opinion evidence from an acceptable medical source, and decided the physical portion of Plaintiff's RFC based on his own interpretation of the medical record. This error necessitates remand for further administrative proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The RFC Finding is Unsupported by Substantial Evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In deciding a disability claim, an ALJ is tasked with \"weigh[ing] all of the evidence available to make an RFC finding\n   that [is] consistent with the record as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Matta v.

(Dkt. 8-7 at 219). Plaintiff reported that her participation in the activities of cooking, cleaning, and laundry varies; that she does not do any shopping; and that she showers, bathes, cares for her child, and dresses daily. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Dr. Toor's musculoskeletal exam revealed full flexion, extension, and rotary movement of the cervical spine, but limited flexion, extension, and lateral flexion of the lumbar spine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 220). Plaintiff's straight leg raise tests were positive both sitting supine and bilaterally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff had a full range of motion in her shoulders, elbows, forearms, wrists, hips, and knees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Her left ankle plantar flexion and dorsiflexion were limited, but she had a full range of motion in her right ankle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff's joints were stable and non-tender. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). A neurologic exam revealed tingling and numbness in both of Plaintiff's feet, and 5/5 strength in her upper and lower extremities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Similarly, an examination of Plaintiff's extremities revealed tenderness in her feet. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Based on all of this information, Dr. Toor opined that Plaintiff had \"moderate to severe\" limitations in standing, walking, bending, lifting, or squatting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He further opined that Plaintiff had moderate limitations sitting for a long time, and that her pain interfered with her physical routine and balance.

The ALJ then assessed that Plaintiff retained the RFC to perform light work, in that she: can lift and/or carry 20 pounds occasionally and ten pounds frequently; stand and/or walk for six hours in an eight-hour workday, and sit for six hours in an eight-hour workday; and occasionally stoop, kneel, crouch, crawl, and balance, but should avoid climbing ropes, ladders, and scaffolds.

The ALJ's first reason for rejecting Dr. Toor's opinion - that Plaintiff's lower back pain, left foot pain, and hypertension were not severe - is self-serving and does not address any of the factors enumerated above. Moreover, it is well-established that an ALJ is required to consider functional limitations that arise from non-severe impairments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parker-Grose v.

App'x 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 18 (2d Cir. 2012) (\"A RFC determination must account for limitations imposed by both severe and nonsevere impairments.\"). Accordingly, the fact that Plaintiff's lower back pain, left foot pain, and hypertension were non-severe does not mean the ALJ was free to disregard Dr. Toor's opinion regarding the functional limitations associated with these impairments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The ALJ's second reason for rejecting Dr. Toor's opinion refers to other evidence in the record relating to Plaintiff's diabetes,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that Plaintiff is not compliant in taking her diabetes medications, that her abdominal pain was out of proportion to her clinical findings, and that she recently\n   reported improvement in her blood sugar levels. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). However, the ALJ does not explain how these facts contribute to his discrediting Dr. Toor's assessed physical limitations. The ALJ's failure to adequately explain his reasoning is particularly significant in this case, where Dr. Toor's evaluation is the only medical opinion in the record as it relates to Plaintiff's physical limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Moreover, and as Plaintiff correctly argues, in rejecting the remaining portions of Dr. Toor's opinion, the ALJ did not rely on any opinion evidence from an acceptable medical source, and therefore determined Plaintiff's RFC based on his own interpretation of the medical record. (Dkt. 10-1 at 18). The Commissioner argues in response that the ALJ is not required to base his RFC finding on a medical opinion that mirrors that finding and, in fact, an ALJ is not required to base his RFC on a medical opinion at all. (Dkt. 13-1 at 13). In support of this argument, the Commissioner cites to a recent, unpublished Summary Order issued by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals,\n   <em>\n    Monroe v. Comm'r of Soc.

Unlike the physician in\n   <em>\n    Monroe\n   </em>\n   , Dr. Toor did not have a lengthy treatment history with Plaintiff. As a consultative physician, Dr. Toor examined Plaintiff on one occasion, and issued a four-page report memorializing his opinion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8-7 at 218-21). Dr. Toor does not have any treatment notes on which the ALJ could rely in formulating Plaintiff's physical RFC.
