Plaintiff also asserts discrimination, misconduct, and excessive delay. However, he does not seek damages. Instead, he appears to seek review of two prior decisions by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (\"USCIS\"), United States Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") in order to \"enter into the United States,\" either on the grounds of humanitarian parole or on the basis of his status \"as a long standing legalization seeker.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1, Compl. at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

In 2002, plaintiff applied for permanent residency in an I-485 Application to Adjust Status \"and was permitted to enter into the United States through Parole Letter in the year of June, 2005.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In 2007, plaintiff \"was called for an interview by the District Director of New York Immigration Office,\" and \"[l]ater they sent [a] denial letter.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff further stated, \"I think I did not get the Justice.

According to plaintiff, one month later he was advised to have open heart surgery, but decided that he needed to see his mother and family before undergoing a nine-hour surgical procedure.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.) Plaintiff provides few details about his original application and grounds for adjustment of status or the final outcome after the \"denial letter\" and the dismissal of his appeal in 2009.
