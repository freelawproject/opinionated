The Court held a hearing on September 20, 2018. The primary issue is whether the Court should strike Claimant Torence Haigler's Answer, filed February 15, 2018 (Doc. 3)(\"Haigler Answer\"), and Claimant Toderick Smith's Answer, filed February 15, 2018 (Doc. 4)(\"Smith Answer\"), because the Claimants lack statutory standing. The Court grants the motion on the condition\n   that, if Haigler and Smith (\"the Claimants\") do not cure the deficiencies in their pleadings within ten days of the entry of this order, the Court will strike their Answers. The Court will allow the Claimants ten days to cure deficiencies in their pleadings, because it believes that allowing the Claimants a limited period to cure the deficiencies is not inconsistent with the language of Rule G of the Supplemental Rules for Admiralty or Maritime Claims and Asset Forfeiture Actions, will not thwart Supplemental Rule G's underlying purposes, and, given the equities, is consistent with the intent of Supplemental Rule G.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 15, 2017, Plaintiff United States of America filed its Verified Complaint for Forfeiture In Rem.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1 (\"Complaint\"). The res, or properties, that are the subject of this action are $20,000.00 in United States currency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 2i, at 1. Haigler claims ownership of $7,000.00 of the money,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Haigler Answer at 1, and Smith claims ownership of $7,000.00 of the money,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Smith Answer at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Complaint alleges that, on July 19, 2017, Border Patrol Agent Israel Torrones stopped a 2014 black Ford Fusion at the United States Border Patrol checkpoint located on I-10 west, mile marker 120.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 7, at 2. Smith, a United States citizen, was the driver, and Haigler and Brando Pettus, also United States citizens, were the occupants of the car.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 7, at 3. While Torrones questioned the car's occupants, another Border Patrol Agent, Jose Meza's trained drug detection canine, \"Veeto,\" alerted positively on the car for the odor of an illegal controlled substance, after which Torrones sought and obtained Smith's consent for a canine inspection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 8, at 2. Smith moved the vehicle to a secondary inspection area, and Smith, Haigler, and Pettus all exited the vehicle while Meza and Veeto conducted a canine drug inspection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 9, at 2. Smith, Haigler, and Pettus all admitted to smoking marijuana recently, and all denied -- twice -- that they were traveling with contraband or large amounts of money.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 9, at 3. Haigler, the vehicle's owner, consented to Meza conducting a hand search of the vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 10, at 3. From the glove compartment, Meza recovered a plastic bag containing a large amount of United States currency, and each occupant again denied the presence of money in the car.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 10, at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Once Meza informed the car's occupants that he had discovered the bag of money, Smith stated, \"Oh yeah, we're going to buy a car.\" Complaint \u00b6 11, at 3. Meza asked why the occupants had not informed him of the money previously, and Haigler said, \"I don't know. We were going to buy a car.\" Complaint \u00b6 11, at 3. Agents then separated the car's occupants from one another, after which they provided conflicting accounts of how much money was in the bag, how much each of them had contributed, and where the money came from.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 12, at 3.

The United States moves to strike the Claimants' Answers, because the Claimants lack statutory standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 1. The United States argues that the Claimants filed only Answers, but not verified claims under penalty of perjury, as Supplemental Rule G(5)(a) requires, and that, accordingly, the Court should strike their Answers pursuant to Supplemental Rule G(8)(c).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Claimants do not file a response.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 1 (\"Counsel for Plaintiff attempted to contact Claimants\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , Torence Haigler and Toderick Smith, via letter regarding their position on this motion.

The United States explained that, after the United States filed its Complaint, Haigler and Smith filed Answers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 2:11-15 (Kotz). The United States asserted that it provided notice to both Claimants by serving them with the Complaint, the Notice, and a letter that informed them that they would have to file a claim under oath as Supplemental Rule G(5)(A) requires.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 2:16-20 (Kotz).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The United States noted that the Claimants filed answers on February 15, 2018, but filed no other pleadings, prompting the United States to move to strike their Answers for failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 2:20-25 (Kotz). The United States argued that, by failing to file a verified claim, the Claimants lack statutory standing because of their failure to comply with Supplemental Rule G(5).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 3:3-6 (Kotz). The Court asked the United States whether there are cases with the same facts where a claimant has filed an answer in court, but has not filed a claim, and whether the correct remedy would be to strike the answers in those cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 3:7-13 (Court). The United States asserted that striking the answers would be the correct remedy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 3:11, 14-18 (Kotz).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court next asked the United States what would happen if the Claimants want to file an untimely claim after the hearing, notarized and under oath.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 3:19-22 (Court). The United States asserted that, to do so, the Claimants would need to ask for leave of the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 3:23-24 (Kotz). The Court next asked if the Claimants would have to ask for leave of the Court to file an administrative claim, and the United States asserted that the administrative claim is a separate matter, and the Claimants already have submitted claims in that matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 3:25-4:5 (Court, Kotz). The United States argued that, notwithstanding the administrative proceeding, Supplemental Rule G(5) requires the Claimants to file a verified claim in the Court and then to follow that filing with an answer, and that the administrative claim cannot satisfy that requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 4:3-15 (Kotz). The Court next asked the United States what the Claimants' relationship is to the case, and the United States responded that they were in the vehicle from which the property at issue was seized.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 4:16-22 (Court, Kotz). The Court sought clarification that the Claimants were not charged when the property was seized, and the United States confirmed that they were not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 4:21-23 (Court, Kotz).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court stated that it appeared to the Court that the Notice was delivered by first class mail to both individuals and that there was no response, and so the Court was inclined to grant the Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 5:3-12 (Court). The Court put on the record that the Court and the United States waited past 3:30 p.m., thirty minutes after the hearing was scheduled to begin, and no one appeared on the Claimants' behalf, and no one contacted the Court's Courtroom Deputy to arrange to appear by telephone or otherwise participate in the hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 5:20-25 (Court).

Under these circumstances, the Court believes that the equities do not warrant that it require strict compliance with Supplemental Rule G at this stage of the proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. 51 Pieces of Real Prop., Roswell, N.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1830224\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/17/1306/#p1318\">\n    17 F.3d at 1318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (considering whether the notice to the claimants was good, whether the claimant timely attempted to assert an interest, whether the government encouraged the delay or misguided the claimant, and whether the claimant purposefully waited before filing a claim in the property in determining whether the equities weighed in favor of granting the claimant additional time);\n   <em>\n    United States v. 2007 Chrysler 300 Touring VIN:2C3KA53G27H883668\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201119701\">\n    2011 WL 1119701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (considering the same factors).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Moreover, Supplemental Rule G(8)'s advisory committee notes state: \"As with other pleadings, the court should strike a claim or answer only if satisfied that an opportunity should not be afforded to cure the defects under Rule 15.\" Supp. R. G(8) advisory committee notes. The advisory committee notes suggest a policy underlying Supplemental Rule G(8) of not striking a meritorious claim if the claimant's claim or answer may be cured of its defects. Although it is not clear that the Claimants\n   can cure their failure to file a claim by amending their Answers to include their signatures under penalty of perjury, the Court concludes that its allowance of ten days to the Claimants to attempt to cure the defects in their pleadings is in accordance with the advisory committee notes' intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. 2007 Chrysler 300 Touring VIN:2C3KA53G27H883668\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201119701\">\n    2011 WL 1119701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12 (granting Claimants ten days to cure the deficiencies in their pleadings).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   If the Claimants do not cure the deficiencies in their pleadings within ten days of the entry of this Memorandum Opinion and Order, the Court will strike the Claimants' Answer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. 2687 S.
