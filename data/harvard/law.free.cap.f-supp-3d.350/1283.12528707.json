COOKE, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   THIS MATTER is before me upon Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (\"Motion\") (ECF No. 31). Defendants Mendez Fuel Holdings LLC (\"MFH\") and Michael Mendez (\"Mendez\") filed a Response in Opposition to the Motion (ECF No. 33), and Plaintiff timely filed a Reply (ECF No. 36). I have carefully considered the parties' motion papers, the record, and the relevant legal authorities. For the reasons set forth herein, Plaintiff's Motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   From March 6, 2014, to December 7, 2017, Plaintiff Jairo Goussen was an employee at a gas station operated by Defendants in Miami, Florida.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Compl.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 1, at \u00b6 9. The nature of Plaintiff's employment is hotly contested here. Defendants assert that Plaintiff was the manager of the gas station's deli, with \"free rein\" to operate the deli as he saw fit,\n   <em>\n    Resp. in Opp'n\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 33, at p. 5, while Plaintiff insists that he was merely \"a regular employee\"-specifically, a \"cashier, cook, [and] customer service representative.\"\n   <em>\n    Jairo Goussen Aff.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 32-4, at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 8. What is not contested is that Plaintiff earned a salary of $650 per week.\n   <em>\n    See Pl.'s Stmt. of Material Facts\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 32, at \u00b6 4;\n   <em>\n    Michael Mendez Dep.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 32-1, at p. 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff seeks relief under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"), claiming that he \"worked an average of 62.5 hours a week for Defendants,\" but \"was never paid the extra half time rate for any hours worked over 40 hours.\"\n   <em>\n    Compl.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 1, at \u00b6 14. Plaintiff further claims that Defendants' alleged failure to pay overtime wages was willful, thus extending the statute of limitations for his FLSA claim from two years to three years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15. In the instant Motion, Plaintiff seeks summary judgment on several elements of his claim. First, Plaintiff asks the Court to find as a matter of law that Defendant Michael Mendez, who owns and operates Defendant MFH, was Plaintiff's \"employer\" as that term is defined in the FLSA, and that Mendez is therefore individually liable to Plaintiff for any unpaid overtime wages.\n   <em>\n    Mot.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 31, at pp. 3-5. Second, Plaintiff asks the Court to find that he was not exempt from entitlement to overtime pay under the FLSA's executive, administrative, professional and combination exemptions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 7-12. Third, Plaintiff asks the Court to find that he did indeed perform overtime work for which he was not paid, and therefore that \"liability has been established, and ... the matter can proceed to a damages trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In their Response to Plaintiff's Motion, Defendants argue that \"[i]t is a disputed material fact [whether] Michael Mendez is an individual employer under the FLSA,\" as \"it is disputed [whether] Michael Mendez personally runs the day to day operations of [MFH].\"\n   <em>\n    Resp. in Opp'n\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 33, at p. 3. Defendants assert that Plaintiff's duties at the gas station deli \"were primarily managerial in nature,\" and that \"there are genuine issues of material fact as to ... whether his role created an exempt status.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 5, 13. Unsurprisingly, Defendants further deny that liability has been established as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 13. Finally, although Defendants do not explicitly state as much, they appear to seek a finding as a matter of law that any alleged FLSA violations were not willful, and that Plaintiff's suit, filed on January 2, 2018, is therefore partially barred by the standard two-year statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 13-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In his Reply, Plaintiff reasserts his claims and argues that \"[t]he issue of willfulness is a question of fact for the jury to decide and not appropriate for disposition by the Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Reply\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 36, at p. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Plaintiff has thus failed to establish Defendants' liability, and his request for summary judgment on this point is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    G. The Court Will Not Determine at This Stage Whether Any Alleged Violation of the FLSA Was Willful\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In their Response to the Motion, Defendants note that Plaintiff's Complaint was filed on January 2, 2018, while his claims presumably extend back to early 2014, when he began working for Defendants.\n   <em>\n    Resp. in Opp'n\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 33, at pp. 13-14. Thus, Defendants argue that even if Plaintiff were to establish that he performed overtime work for which he was not paid, his claim would be partially barred by the FLSA's statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20255\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Additionally, Defendants appear to argue, although they do not do so explicitly, that the Court should rule as a matter of law that any alleged violations were not willful, and therefore the standard two-year statute of limitations applies, as opposed to the three-year period for willful violations.\n   <em>\n    See Resp. in Opp'n\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 33, at pp. 13-14 (arguing that \"Plaintiff will fail in providing any evidence to meet the 'willful' threshold to survive Summary Judgment\"). Plaintiff responds as if Defendants had indeed moved for summary judgment on this point, arguing that \"[t]he issue of willfulness is a question of fact for the jury to decide and\n   not appropriate for disposition by the Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Reply\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 36, at p. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   On this point, I agree with Plaintiff. \"The issue of willfulness under \u00a7 255(a) is a question of fact for the jury not appropriate for summary disposition.\"\n   <em>\n    Morrison v.

Fla. 2007). Having determined that Plaintiff has failed to establish that Defendants violated the FLSA for purposes of the instant Motion, I will not decide whether or not any hypothetical violations were willful. To the extent that Defendants move for summary judgment on this point, their motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (ECF No. 31) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n    <em>\n     in part\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n    <em>\n     in part\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . The Court finds as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   A. Defendant Michael Mendez was Plaintiff's \"employer\" under the FLSA;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   B. There is a genuine factual dispute as to whether Plaintiff was exempt from overtime wages as an executive employee;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   C.
