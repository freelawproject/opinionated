Defendant explained that an outside company, DISA, handled Defendant's drug testing, including the random selection of which employees would be drug tested each month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff claims that he felt that he was being drug tested more than other employees based on speaking with several co-workers, who told Plaintiff that they were not tested as often. Plaintiff, however, has provided no evidence other than his own speculation that (1) he was randomly drug tested more often than other employees, and even if he had been, (2) that he was targeted because he is African-American.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff's subjective perception of his mistreatment based on his race is insufficient to cast doubt on Defendant's explanation for Plaintiff's drug testing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Charles v.

On January 2, 2014, Plaintiff received a verbal reprimand at a work site regarding Plaintiff's absences from work. Plaintiff's supervisors called Plaintiff from where he was working over to the side of the road 50 feet away, and they spoke for fifteen to twenty minutes.

Plaintiff also admits that his supervisors did not raise their voices or make any exaggerated movements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff has not provided any evidence that his co-workers overheard the discussion, and he does not refute that they were near the highway and railroad tracks, which were very loud. Plaintiff also does not point to evidence that would suggest his race played a part in Defendant's motivation for speaking with him about his attendance. That Plaintiff felt singled out and embarrassed, without any evidence suggesting that race was a factor in Defendant's actions, is not an actionable race discrimination claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3064404\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/512/338/#p348\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Next, with regard to Plaintiff's claim that he and co-workers discovered a noose in the bolt trailer, and Defendant did not properly investigate how the noose got there and the serious racial implications of the noose, Plaintiff fails to show that Defendant's handling of the situation was affected or influenced by improper motives. On January 23, 2014, the yard foreman, Barry Fox, sent Plaintiff and three other employees, Plaintiff's uncle Ronald Brown, Tosha Roots, and Mark Brooks, to the bolt trailer to sort the bolts. That job was given to employees when work was slow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   When Plaintiff entered the trailer, he and his co-workers saw the slip-knotted rope, which was nailed to the side of the shelf and hanging like a hangman's noose. Plaintiff asked the yard foreman to take down the noose because it was intimidating. Plaintiff and his uncle then reported it to the safety manager, who prepared the following memo:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Yesterday (01/23/2014) Dennis Riggs reported that Mr. Ronald Brown had brought a small piece of tattered rope that had a slip knot and loop on it which Mr. Brown interpreted to be a hangman's noose to Mr. Fox's (Yard Foreman) attention, stating that it was directed towards him and people of color. Mr. Fox brought it to Mr. Riggs's attention (superintendent) who reviewed the small rope which was discovered in the bolt trailer. Mr. Riggs felt it was probably used to hold a door open and had no other intention other than just that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Mr. Ronald Brown and Mr. Jesse Brown felt it was directed towards them as they felt it was meant towards people of color. Mr. Riggs felt that since no other rope of this kind had been found in the past and literally anyone could have used it as a slip knot for the door as he didn't believe It was a threat of any kind, since there have been no previous incidents of this kind on the company grounds in the past.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   In addition, it was determined that we would keep an eye out for such items of this nature and items of any threat within our workplace.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Note: The yard is not a typical workplace on a day to day basis for any company employee with the exception of the yard foreman who manages the day\n   to day needs of our operations regarding materials for our field projects.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   (Docket No. 47 at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiff contends that Defendant's response to the noose was insufficient and demonstrates race discrimination.

However, even when accepting as true that an employee of Defendant nailed the noose to the bolt trailer's wall, and that employee intended the noose to be a racial threat, Plaintiff has not provided any evidence to refute that Defendant investigated the incident and determined that the person responsible for the noose could not be identified, determined that it was an isolated incident, and although it appeared that the noose could have been fashioned for a legitimate purpose, Defendant would continue to keep a look-out for such an item going forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   An employer is only negligent if it \"knew or should have known about the [Title VII-violative conduct of its employees], but failed to take prompt and adequate remedial action.\"\n   <em>\n    Andreoli v.

We asked Jessie to tell us his story as to what happened that morning.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Jessie said Steve came in to the safety meeting in the RCC trailer and went to the back of the trailer. He said normally foreman go to the front of the trailer but Steve came in a little bit late so he went to the back of the trailer. When the meeting was over Steve bumped into Jessie when he was leaving the trailer. Jessie said \"Watch where you are going'. Steve responded with \"F-you Jessie\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Jessie took a few steps toward Steve. According to Jessie, to discuss it with him and Steve punched Jessie In the eye, Jessie said he didn't get a chance to respond to this because he was grabbed right away, as was Steve by people in attendance at the meeting. I told Jessie that it was a good thing that he didn't respond because he would have been terminated also. I asked Jessie how he felt. He indicated that he felt fine. I told Jessie if he ever felt threatened, in any way that he was immediately to speak with a foreman or supervisor, or bring it into the office. He said the biggest problem was that he was embarrassed by what happened in front of the approximately 20 guys in the trailer. Chris and I both told him that from our interviews with the people that were on site, it indicated to us that it wasn't him that should be embarrassed, they all thought that Steve was the fool.

Plaintiff further claims that if Riggs were African-American, he would not have been rehired. Plaintiff further faults Defendant for allowing Riggs to leave before the police arrived, by not drug testing Riggs, by not alerting Plaintiff's emergency contacts, and not providing Plaintiff with transportation for medical treatment. Plaintiff finally claims that because of the altercation and ultimately permitting Riggs to return to work, along with the noose incident, conversation about his absences, and drug testing, he had no alternative but to quit his job with Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   As with Plaintiff's claim that Defendant did not perform an adequate investigation into the noose incident, the basis for Plaintiff's complaint about how Defendant handled the fight rests solely on his own subjective perceptions at to what Defendant should have done. Defendant immediately suspended both parties, took witness statements, and then spoke with Plaintiff about his version of events. Plaintiff has not pointed to evidence, other than his own beliefs, that his race was an issue in the altercation, or that Defendant had previously handled similar situations in a different way, and treated white employees more favorably.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, Defendant terminated the white employee who struck Plaintiff, and permitted Plaintiff to return to work, even though Plaintiff and his uncle both admit that Plaintiff stepped toward Riggs and had to be pulled away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiff's displeasure with Defendant's actions do not support a claim that Defendant acted with discriminatory intent or Defendant failed to take prompt remedial action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Knabe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"405192\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/114/407/#p412\">\n    114 F.3d at 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A]n employer, in order to avoid liability for the discriminatory conduct of an employee, does not have to necessarily discipline or terminate the offending employee as long as the employer takes corrective action reasonably likely to prevent the offending conduct from reoccurring.\" (citation omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiff argues that when Defendant rehired Riggs, Defendant demonstrated its racial animus toward Plaintiff and perpetuated a hostile environment, which provided him with no alternative other than to leave his job. Defendant relates that it rehired Riggs because he completed an anger management class, was a skilled foreman, and asked for his job back.
