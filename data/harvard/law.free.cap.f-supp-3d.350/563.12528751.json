In their motion these defendants contend that there are no material facts in dispute and, as a matter of law, it owes no funds to the plaintiff, Union Insurance Company.

STIPULATED FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 16, 2004, Clifford Gatlin (\"Gatlin\"), who had been employed as a sandblaster and foundry worker, filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Hinds County, Mississippi. Gatlin alleged that his work environment had been contaminated with silica dust, causing him to develop silicosis, a serious health condition caused by exposure to inhaling silica dust over a period of time. Gatlin sued, in Hinds County Circuit Court, his employer and other defendants, including Custom Aggregates\n   &amp; Grinding, Inc. (\"Custom\"). Custom was one of the companies that had supplied to Gatlin's employer sandblasting material that allegedly contained the injurious silica.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During the relevant period during which Custom was supplying materials to Gatlin's employer and during which time Gatlin was an employee there, Custom was insured by the following four companies: 1) Great River Insurance Company (whose successor in interest is Union); 2) The Travelers Indemnity Company of Connecticut; 3) Zurich North America; and 4) Kemper Insurance Company (collectively, \"Insurers\"). These insurers had policies in effect with Custom at different times over the relevant period. None was in effect concurrently. Each annual policy, regardless of which insurer issued it, carried primary liability limits of One Million Dollars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   All four of these insurers entered into a joint defense agreement whereby each insurer agreed to contribute to the legal fees and expenses incurred by Custom in defense of the Gatlin lawsuit. The four companies agreed to a formula, which was included in the joint defense agreement, that allocated a percentage for each insurer to pay based on the proportionate length of time of coverage that each had provided to Custom during the relevant period (also referred to as \"time on the risk\"). The continuing tort, it was determined, spanned approximately 104 months. The Insurers agreed to a percentage allocation of costs/liability as follows: Great River/Union 22.86%; Kemper 22.86%; Zurich 5.71%; and Travelers 48.57 %.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The various subsidiaries and affiliates of the Travelers Companies had insured Custom for the longest period, and therefore, Travelers was obligated to pay the largest part of the settlement or verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On July 13, 2007, the Insurers were informed that trial was set for October 15, 2007.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   With mediation scheduled for September 27, 2007, and the trial less than a month away, Travelers and its adjusters, together with Union and the other carriers insuring Custom, pursued a potential settlement, with each carrier attempting to obtain authority for a total from all carriers of 1.5 million dollars. Travelers was a participant in this effort and on September 24, 2007, the adjuster for Travelers, Claudette Savwoir, informed the other insurers that she had requested authority for her share of up to 1.5 million dollars from her superiors. This, according to Union, was proof that up to that point, Travelers considered a settlement above one million to be within policy limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Travelers though, contends that around the time of mediation, Travelers and the other insurers discussed several legal arguments and defenses that had not been, but needed to be, developed. This, Travelers submits, is proof that Travelers did not believe a settlement valuation above $1,000,000 was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The parties participated in mediation on September 27, 2007, but were unable to settle the claims against Custom. Custom's co-defendant, Precision Packaging, settled with the plaintiffs at the mediation, on confidential terms. At the conclusion of the mediation, Custom was the only remaining defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On September 28, 2007, Travelers' adjuster, Claudette Savwoir authored an email to defense counsel, Forman, Perry, Watkins, Krutz &amp; Tardy, regarding several legal defenses and arguments that Travelers was pushing and that Travelers said\n   should have been developed a long time ago. On October 1, 2007, Claudette Savwoir and Gerald Begley, in-house counsel for Travelers, called Custom's representative Suzy McDonald and advised it was Traveler's position that only $1 million in total indemnity was available to Custom for the Gatlin lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On October 2, 2007, Custom's defense counsel made to Gatlin an offer of $1,000.000, which was rejected. Negotiations continued over the next several days. On October 3, 2007, a member of the defense team from Forman, Perry, Watkins, Krutz &amp; Tardy emailed Travelers' counsel Gerald Begley that Custom had actually sold a lot more sand to Gatlin's employer than plaintiff knew about and that Gatlin's demands would go higher once this error was realized. On October 4, 2007, with the trial set for eleven days later on October 15, 2007, Travelers issued a \"Policy Limit Notification Letter\" to Custom, reiterating its position that a single per occurrence limit of one million dollars total was available from all carriers collectively, and informing all involved that Travelers would only offer 48.57 % of one million dollars or $485,700. While Travelers agreed to continue to honor its defense obligations, Travelers stated it did not agree to indemnify Custom for any amount above its 48.57 % share of the $1 million dollar limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On October 9, less than a week from the date of trial, which was set for October 15, settlement was reached between Custom and Gatlin, for the sum of $1.75 million dollars. Although the carriers had earlier agreed on the percentage each should pay, they disagreed on the combined policy limit and, therefore, on the sum to which each insurer's percentage should be applied. Union, Zurich and Kemper considered that the entire $1,750,000.00 settlement agreement was within combined policy limit. Travelers took the position that the carriers' liability was limited to a total of one million dollars. Travelers, then, instead of contributing a 48.57 % share of the 1.75 million dollar settlement amount, for a total of $849,975.00, limited its settlement contribution to $485,700.00, or 48.57% of its one million dollar policy limit, a difference of $364,275.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Kemper paid its proportionate share of the 1.75 million dollars under the formula. Union and Zurich, though, paid more than what they believed to be the just shares they owed pursuant to the allocation agreement. According to Union's amended complaint [doc. no. 8 at pp. 5-6], these two carriers did this \"[t]o consummate the settlement agreement and to avoid the pending trial with its attendant risk to the insured ...\" Defense counsel had informed the carriers that Custom could be exposed to as much as a $5 million to $10 million dollar liability. Union asserts that these additional payments were not voluntary, and were made under protest and with reservation of rights against Travelers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The settlement agreement was paid as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-29\">Great River, predecessor in interest to Union $691,500 Kemper $400,050 Zurich $172,750 Travelers $485,700</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Union contends that what\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   have been paid is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-31\">Great River, predecessor in interest to Union $400,050 Kemper $400,050 Zurich $ 99,925 Travelers $849,975</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Settlement was funded and consummated, and the Gatlin litigation was dismissed in Hinds County Circuit Court by final judgment with prejudice on April 6, 2009. Travelers contends that Union, Zurich and Kemper made the decision to negotiate above $1,000,000 and that Travelers did not consent to the decisions being made during the settlement negotiations. Union, on the other hand, claims that Travelers was kept informed by emails throughout the negotiations. In any event, when the settlement was reached on October 9, 2007, all parties were aware of Traveler's position that it would only be responsible for $485,700.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Union, the Plaintiff herein, filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment [Docket No. 1] with this Court on May 8, 2009 and, with leave of the court, an Amended Complaint for Declaratory Judgment [Docket No. 8] on August 21, 2009.

Voluntary Payment Doctrine\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Travelers, in its motion for summary judgment, asserts that the payments made above $1,000,000 for settlement of the Gatlin litigation, were 'voluntary payments' and Union cannot look to Travelers for recompense. Accordingly, this Court first must look to whether Union's payment toward the settlement of the\n   <em>\n    Gatlin\n   </em>\n   case was a voluntary payment. If the payment was voluntary, Union is not allowed to recoup the purported \"excess\" monies it paid in settlement of that lawsuit and the court need not inquire further. Summary Judgment would then be granted in favor of Travelers. \"[A] voluntary payment cannot be recovered back ...\"\n   <em>\n    Genesis Ins. Co. v. Wausau Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9097061\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/343/733/#p736\">\n    343 F.3d 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 736 (5th Cir. 2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   By contrast, if the purportedly \"excess\" payment made by Union was not voluntary, this court must proceed to its next inquiry- whether the $ 1.75 million dollar settlement amount exceeds the maximum aggregate liability amount for all four insurers combined and, if so, what amount, if any, is Travelers required to pay to Union? If either question cannot be resolved without deciding issues of material fact, the case must be submitted to a fact-finder. Both sides, however, contend that there are no material issues of fact to adorn this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   A major case which discusses the voluntary payment doctrine is\n   <em>\n    Genesis Ins. Co. v. Wausau Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , decided by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. There, two insurers, Genesis Insurance Company and Wausau Insurance Company (hereafter \"Genesis and Wausau\"), agreed to pay for the defense and expenses of their insured, The President Casino (hereafter \"President\"). A customer had been seriously injured on the property of President by a casino-owned shuttle being driven by a casino employee. Both the automobile liability policy issued by Genesis and the premises liability policy issued by Wausau were implicated.\n   <em>\n    Genesis Ins. Co. v. Wausau Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9097061\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/343/733/#p736\">\n    343 F.3d 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   President and Genesis contended that their contributions to the settlement in that case had not been voluntary, but were the product of compelling circumstances created by Wausau. Wausau, they argued, by notifying the other companies of its intention to deny coverage with respect to a premises liability claim less than a month and a half before trial, had deprived both President and Genesis of the ability to mount an adequate defense. They claimed, therefore, they had been forced into participating in the settlement. The district court had disagreed, holding that, as a\n   matter of law, a \"lack of timely notice\" does not shield them from the voluntary payment doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision that Wausau's conduct did not compel President and Genesis to \"throw their hats into the settlement ring.\"\n   <em>\n    Genesis\n   </em>\n   at 738. The appellate court amplified that the voluntary payment doctrine requires: (1) that there be no prior agreement by the parties to litigate coverage following settlement (e.g., parties agree that one will pay but they reserve the right to resolve coverage issues later); and (2) payments must not be made by virtue of legal obligation, by accident/mistake or made under compulsion.\n   <em>\n    Genesis\n   </em>\n   at 738 (citing\n   <em>\n    McDaniel Bros.

State Farm investigated the accident, and after determining that its insured would be liable for all damages and injuries, State Farm then made a demand on the other insurer, Allstate, to contribute to a settlement. Allstate refused. After negotiating and settling with all parties,\n   State Farm thereafter sued Allstate for one-half of the $2,380.00 amount paid by State Farm in total settlement of all claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In that suit, Allstate responded that State Farm had been a volunteer as to the payment of $1,190.00, one-half of the total settlement, because State Farm's contract of insurance contained an 'other insurance' clause. That clause, contended Allstate, provided that in the event there is another insurer against the same loss, State Farm would be liable for no more than its proportionate share, based on the relative policy limits of the two companies. In that litigation, the two insurers had equal liability limits, so each would have been responsible for one-half of the loss. If State Farm was not contractually obligated to pay but one-half of the total, Allstate reasoned, the other half it paid was purely voluntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Mississippi Supreme Court disagreed, stating that Allstate had lost sight of its obligation to its insured, as stated in its own policy. The Court there stated that both insurance companies \"had entered into solemn contracts for a premium to defend the insured ... against any and all claims, and to act in his [the insured's] best interest in negotiating and settling all claims made against him.\" That duty, the Court said, \"transcends any hypertechnical right of either insurer to pay only in strict accord with the 'Other Insurance' clause of each contract.\"\n   <em>\n    State Farm v. Allstate\n   </em>\n   at 669. The court continued, \"[s]urely, Allstate should not be allowed to take advantage of its own wrong.

Explains Travelers, INA (a) did not participate in negotiations, (b) discontinued paying legal defense costs and (c) refused to pay any part of the settlement.

This court now undertakes to determine whether the settlement amount was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Guidant II\n   </em>\n   , in evaluating the reasonableness of the settlement, the court noted that Guidant presented ample evidence, through affidavits, correspondence, interrogatories and deposition transcripts, that the settlement amount was reasonable. In that case, the injuries sustained by the plaintiffs were quite serious. Based on the plaintiffs' injuries and medical expenses, lost wages and the blindness to one plaintiff that resulted from the car wreck, a jury verdict could have exceeded the policy limits in that case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff in the underlying case, Gatlin, sustained extremely serious injuries, and extraordinary medical expenses, including the cost of a double lung transplant, the cost of which was in excess of a half million dollars, such that a jury could have exceeded not only the $1 million that Travelers contends was the maximum aggregate policy limit covering Custom, but in the opinion of the defense attorneys a jury verdict could have exceeded the 1.75 million dollar settlement amount. Plaintiff's expert report opined that Gatlin's damages were significantly in excess of the $1.75 million settlement amount. According to the estimates of the defense attorneys retained by the insurance companies, the value of the case was between $5 million and $10 million dollars, which would also have exceeded the $4 million amount that Union claims was the maximum aggregate policy limit. Given\n   these undisputed facts, this court is persuaded that the settlement amount was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The court must next look to whether the settlement amount of $1.75 million dollars was within policy limits. This court is persuaded that it was, based on the reasons more thoroughly discussed later in this opinion. Therefore, Union's payment was not voluntary, and Union may seek contribution for its overpayment from Travelers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Breach of contract by Insured\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Travelers argues that it is not obligated to indemnify Custom, its insured, because Custom breached its insurance contract with Travelers by settling without Travelers' consent. Travelers' insurance contract includes a \"right to defend,\" clause which stipulates that Travelers has the \"right and duty to defend any 'suit' seeking those damages\" (referring to bodily injury), and a consent-to-settlement clause stating that \"no insureds will, except at their own cost, voluntarily make a payment, assume any obligation, or incur any expense, other than for first aid, without our consent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Travelers asserts that Customs' breach alleviates its liability under the contract. Travelers further states that at the time of settlement, certain strategies had been unexplored that would have lowered the amount of liability down to the one million dollar mark, rendering the $1.75 million settlement as excessive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Travelers claims that because it notified all insurers and Custom prior to the settlement that it would only be liable for $485,700, it did not consent to any settlement requiring a higher payment amount. Travelers argues that in the October 4\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   letter it sent to Custom, copying the other insurers, Travelers stated that it would pay no more than its pro rata share of the policy limits ($485,700), but would continue paying its portion of defense costs and aggressively defend Custom at trial. Travelers also discussed trial strategies and what it considered to be unexplored defenses with Custom's defense attorneys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    St. Paul Property and Liability Ins. Co. v. Nance\n   </em>\n   , a Mississippi case, is cited by Travelers to show that settlement without permission of the insurer is a breach of contract, and that Custom settled without its permission, thereby breaching its contract with Travelers and relieving Travelers of its payment obligation. In that case St. Paul's insured, who had been injured in an automobile accident, settled with the tortfeasor (for partial payment of damages) in exchange for release of the tortfeasor's liability. The insured then collected from his own insurer under his uninsured motorist coverage. The Mississippi Supreme Court said in\n   <em>\n    St. Paul\n   </em>\n   , the insured's settlement and release of the tortfeasor \"is a breach of the insured's contract with its UM [uninsured motorist] carrier, precluding recovery on the UM contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7534408,7534352,7534323\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/577/1238/\">\n    577 So.2d 1238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1242 (Miss. 1991) (citing\n   <em>\n    United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v.

Unlike the instant case, however, the insured in the\n   <em>\n    St. Paul\n   </em>\n   case settled with the tortfeasor without ever notifying the insurer or giving the insurer an opportunity to participate in negotiations or settlement. Travelers, in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , was notified of the settlement negotiations and participated in settlement efforts until shortly before trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Additionally, the\n   <em>\n    St. Paul\n   </em>\n   case was a subrogation case, not one for contribution. In a subrogation case, the insurer\n   steps into the shoes of the insured, and has no more rights than the insured. St. Paul was denied recovery because it only had the same rights as the insured, and the insured had already released the tortfeasor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1242. In the instant case, Union brings this lawsuit based on its own right to contribution.\n   <em>\n    St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co. v. Nance\n   </em>\n   is not helpful to Travelers' position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Travelers also cites two Fifth Circuit cases based on Texas law for the proposition that an insurer may escape liability on the basis of a settlement-without-consent clause. The first of these is\n   <em>\n    Motiva Enter., LLC v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2779555\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/445/381/#p386\">\n    445 F.3d 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 386 (5th Cir. 2006). The Court there said, it is not clear whether under Texas law, an insurer must demonstrate prejudice before it can avoid its obligations under a policy where the insured breaches a consent-to-settle provision. In that case, though, the Court found that the insurer did actually suffer prejudice. In\n   <em>\n    Motiva\n   </em>\n   , the insurer was originally involved with settlement negotiations, but was excluded from those negotiations before they were concluded.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2779555\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/445/381/#p386\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2779555\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/445/381/#p386\">\n    445 F.3d 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 386 (5th Cir. 2006). The\n   <em>\n    Motiva\n   </em>\n   court found that exclusion from the settlement process prejudices the insurer as a matter of law, and allowed the insurer to escape liability for that reason.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2779555\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/445/381/#p386\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2779555\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/445/381/#p386\">\n    445 F.3d at 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The same cannot be said in the instant case. Union was a participant in the negotiations until almost the very last moment, and cannot show how it was prejudiced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Travelers also cites the Fifth Circuit case of\n   <em>\n    Ideal Mut. Ins. Co. v. Myers\n   </em>\n   , for the principle that an insured is required to cooperate with the insurer and the insured cannot make any agreement which would operate to impose liability upon his insurer or would deprive the insurer of the use of a valid defense. In that case, the insured was the estate of an aircraft pilot who had been killed in a plane crash.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2779555\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/445/381/#p386\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1573921\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/789/1196/#p1202\">\n    789 F.2d 1196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1202 (5th Cir. 1986), The insurer was denying coverage to a passenger who died in the plane crash with the pilot, contending that certain conditions of the policy had been violated. Nevertheless, the pilot's estate settled the wrongful death action that had been brought by the passenger's estate, without obtaining consent to settle from the insured. The\n   <em>\n    Ideal\n   </em>\n   Court found that the actions of the pilot's estate in settling with the passenger's estate did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   discharge\n   <em>\n    Ideal\n   </em>\n   from its obligations under the policy, because the actions in settling the claim did not prejudice the insurance company nor deprive it of any policy defense. This case is not helpful to Traveler's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Travelers also references a recent 5th Circuit case based on Louisiana law which cited the\n   <em>\n    Motiva Enteprises\n   </em>\n   case, and ruled that the breach of the consent-to-settle clause in an insurance contract caused prejudice to the insurer and relieved the insurer's obligation to pay under the insurance contract.\n   <em>\n    Danrik Constr. Inc. v. American Casualty Co. of Reading Pa.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=314%20Fed.%20Appx.%20720\">\n    314 Fed. Appx. 720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 724 (5th Cir. 2009) (not for publication). A construction contractor caused damage on construction projects and requested liability coverage from insurer. Insurer began adjustment process and agreed to pay an amount less than plaintiffs demand for settlement. Contractor settled with plaintiffs without insurer's consent, then sued the insurer for payment. The Court said the\n   <em>\n    Motiva\n   </em>\n   case \"suggests that whether a court will excuse a breach of a consent-to-settle clause depends on the circumstances of the situation\" and in the instant case there was no \"time is of the essence\" situation that would excuse contractor's settlement without consent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=314%20Fed.%20Appx.%20720\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=314%20Fed.%20Appx.%20720\">\n    at 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   These cases indicate that whether a breach of the consent to settle clause provides\n   a defense against the contract for Travelers hinges on 1) whether Travelers had a meaningful opportunity to participate in the settlement negotiations, 2) if it suffered prejudice based on the breach, and 3) if exigent circumstances existed that would cause the court to excuse a breach of a consent-to-settle clause by the insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   It appears from the record that Travelers had a full opportunity to participate in the settlement negotiations. A reading of the emails between all insurers, Custom and the attorneys, indicates that further pressing of a settlement of $1,000,000 was futile because of the plaintiff's position. Plaintiff had rejected the last offer of $1 million dollars. The last demand by Plaintiff was for $4 million dollars. Custom, the attorneys and other insurers also seemed to think a jury trial would yield a much higher judgment against Custom. This seems like settlement negotiations in which Travelers had an opportunity to participate, but its assessment of the settlement value diverged too greatly from all other parties for them to come to an agreement with Travelers. These circumstances weigh in favor of a determination that a Mississippi court would decide that a breach of the consent-to-settle clause, if there was a breach, is excused because of the exigent circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Union argues that Travelers' consent to settlement was implicit in Travelers' payment of almost half a million dollars toward the settlement. Union also contends that despite Travelers eleventh-hour withdrawal from the settlement negotiations, Travelers had led Custom and the other insurers to believe it would participate by explicitly pursuing a $1,500,000 settlement authorization. After Travelers stated it would only pay $485,700, Custom and the other insurers continued to copy Travelers on emails concerning the progression of the settlement negotiations. Finally, Union argues that the very short time to trial and the attorneys' high valuation of the claim if it went to a jury, obligated Union to put the insured's best interest above its own and settle the case. (Custom's defense attorneys at Forman, Perry, Watkins Krutz &amp; Tardy valued the claim at between $5,000,000 to $10,000,000.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   This court finds that the alleged breach of contract by Custom is not a defense to Travelers' contribution to Union. This is a defense that could, arguably, be asserted as a basis for failing to indemnify Custom, but Travelers makes no claim here against its insured. If Travelers really thought it could escape liability because of the failure of the insured to obtain consent, it would have refused to pay\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   amount toward the settlement, or would seek contribution from its insured. This, Travelers has not done.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Combined Policy Limits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Key to Travelers' position is the assertion that the maximum liability owed under all of the policies combined was only one million dollars. Travelers contends that Gatlin's injuries constitute only a single occurrence, and the policies each have a per occurrence limit of $1 million dollars. This issue is more thoroughly discussed in this court's analysis of Union's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   This court is not persuaded to grant Traveler's motion for summary judgment. As previously discussed, Union's payment was not a 'voluntary payment' as Travelers contends; and Union is entitled to seek contribution from Travelers for its overpayment, provided the $1.75 million dollar settlement amount was reasonable and within policy limits. This court has already determined that the settlement amount was reasonable. The only remaining inquiry,\n   therefore, is whether the settlement amount was within policy limits. This will be more thoroughly examined in this court's analysis of Unions motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   I. UNION'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Voluntary Payment Doctrine and Agreement to Litigate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Union has also filed a motion for summary judgment [Docket No. 33], basing its request for judgment as a matter of law on many of the same arguments that are outlined in Travelers' motion for summary judgment, but urging different conclusions. First, Union argues that the voluntary payment doctrine does not apply to its payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Union correctly argues that Mississippi recognizes that one insurance carrier, like Union, which overpays its portion of a settlement in order to protect a mutual insured, like Custom, can seek contribution from the underpaying carrier. Union cites\n   <em>\n    Guidant Mutual Ins. Co. v. Indemnity Ins. Co. of North America\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7063721\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/13/1270/\">\n    13 So.3d 1270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 2009) and\n   <em>\n    State Farm v.

Union submits that the overpayment to the Gatlin Settlement was not voluntary, because, consistent with the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Guidant\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, Union was legally obligated to overpay to protect its insured. This court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   With the very real possibility that a huge judgment could be rendered against their insured, and with the trial only a few days away, Union perceived an obligation to protect its insured from a judgment in excess of policy limits. Ironically, Union's actions in funding the settlement above its pro rata share, also protected Travelers from a potential \"bad faith\" claim. This court previously has determined that Union's payment was not voluntary, based on the factors outlined in\n   <em>\n    Guidant. v. Indemnity\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7063721\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/13/1270/\">\n    13 So.3d 1270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 2009) (\n   <em>\n    Guidant I\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Indemnity v.

As previously discussed, two factors are to be considered under the\n   <em>\n    Genesis\n   </em>\n   test to determine whether a payment was voluntary: 1) that no prior agreement existed between the parties to litigate coverage following settlement (e.g., parties agree that one will pay, but they reserve the right to resolve coverage issues later); and 2) payments must be voluntary, that is, not made by virtue of legal obligation, by accident/mistake or made under compulsion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 738.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In the\n   <em>\n    Genesis\n   </em>\n   case, the court said, that a mutual agreement between President, Wausau, and Genesis to litigate their respective liabilities among themselves after settling the Baker litigation would preclude the application of the volunteer payment doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McLean v.

The damage may have \"occurred\" or been \"triggered\" along a continuous timeline during which several successive polices were in effect. See William R. Hickman and Mary R.

Furthermore, each insurer followed this agreement in calculating which portion of defense costs they paid.

Allocation of Indemnity: pro rata allocation v. all sums method\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Once it is determined which policy years and which policies are implicated, the next logical step is to determine the allocation of the risk between the successive insurers. Union asks in its Complaint that this court establish the allocation method that should be used to determine each insurer's liability. In progressive or continuous injury situations, it is impractical or impossible to determine how much of the damage actually took place during a respective policy period; thus the courts generally take one of two major approaches to the allocation issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   One approach is often referred to as the \"joint and several\" or \"all sums\" method. Under this method, any policy on the risk for any portion of the period in which the insured sustained bodily injury is \"jointly and severally obligated to respond in full, up to its policy limits, for the loss\"\n   <em>\n    Boston Gas Co. v.

The benefit to the insured under the \"all sums\" method is that the insured only has to deal with one insurance company.

The insurers agreed to and did prorate their liability based on the ratio of their years of coverage to the total number of years triggered by exposure. This issue then, has also been agreed to by the parties, for purposes of the Gatlin litigation against Custom; thus, there is no controversy for this court to decide concerning this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Indemnity Limit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The key issue disputed between the parties is the indemnity limit for the total combined policies of all insurers for the period of exposure. Travelers contends this amount is $1 million dollars. Union contends this amount is at least $4 million dollars. If Travelers is correct, it owes nothing to Union, because its pro rata share of $1 million dollars has been paid. If Union is correct on this point, Travelers must reimburse Union the $291,450 that Union seeks by way of contribution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Contrary to the parties' requests, however, the issue to be decided is not whether the maximum aggregate liability is $1 million dollars or $4 million dollars. The inquiry this court must make is whether the maximum aggregate liability is at least $1.75 million dollars; that is, whether the $1.75 million dollar settlement amount was within policy limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   This question has to be answered in order to determine the amount toward which Travelers was required to pay 48.57%. Asked differently, was Travelers responsible for paying 48.57% of the $1.75-million-dollar settlement amount? If so, Travelers' share would have amounted to $849,975.00, and Union is entitled to summary judgment in its favor. Alternatively, has Travelers paid all it owes because the settlement amount exceeded policy limits, in which case Travelers' motion for summary judgment should be granted?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <strong>\n    a. One Million Dollar Combined Policy Limit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   There are at least three positions outlined by the briefs of the parties on this issue. The first is Traveler's position that all carriers together jointly owed only a single occurrence limit, or $1 million indemnity to Custom. This is hard to reconcile, however, since the parties agreed that this continuous exposure toxic tort transpired over 104 months and that it triggered nine consecutive primary liability policies. Each of those triggered policies had a single occurrence limit of $1 million dollars; yet Travelers contends only one such limit is shared by all insurers, limiting coverage to only $1 million dollars total available to Custom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Travelers cites cases in support of its position, but those cases have little relevance here. Those cases did not arise in the context of a progressive disease or continuing tort, such as what this court is dealing with here. As the Court stated in\n   <em>\n    Forty-Eight Insulations\n   </em>\n   , \"[a] cumulative, progressive disease does not fit the disease\n   or accident situation which the policies typically cover.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1298141\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/633/1212/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1298141\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/633/1212/\">\n    at 1222\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Nine Million Dollar Combined Policy Limit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Some courts have applied a form of \"horizontal stacking\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   to the various policies implicated when exposure to a toxic tort spans across several years and several policies. The maximum combined liability is arrived at by 'stacking', or adding, the single occurrence limits of each of the policies, which are triggered by the continuous exposure toxic tort. In the instant case, the nine consecutive policies with $1 million dollar occurrence limits would result in indemnity coverage of nine million dollars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Several states have seemingly adopted this approach, including California, Pennsylvania and Maryland.

This would obligate Travelers to indemnify Custom for up to four million dollars, which represents the $1 million dollar limit for each of the four years of coverage Travelers provided to Custom over the exposure period. Under this approach, the 1.75 million dollar settlement amount was well within the combined policy limits of all the carriers and within the indemnity limit for Travelers. Under this scenario, Travelers would owe contribution to Union for $291,450, the amount Union paid toward the settlement on Travelers' behalf. Union also asks for interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Not so surprisingly, however, neither party advocates for this approach, as it would establish the highest indemnity limits for the insurers of all the theories advanced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Four Million Dollar Combined Policy Limit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The third position is that advocated by Union on the limits of liability issue. Union calls this approach a \"compromise\" between what it terms Travelers' \"frugal\" position (with a combined indemnity limit of $1 million dollars), and the horizontal stacking position (with a combined indemnity limit of $9 million dollars). This approach would create a combined maximum limit of $4 million dollars available to Custom under the policies for the Gatlin litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Union relies on the language of the landmark toxic tort case decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit,\n   <em>\n    Ins. Company of North America v. Forty-Eight Insulations, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1298141\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/633/1212/\">\n    633 F.2d 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 1980). This was an early asbestosis case, in which Forty-Eight Insulations, a manufacturer of asbestos products was facing huge potential liability because of numerous lawsuits filed by workers and consumers around the country who had inhaled asbestos fibers and developed lung cancer, asbestosis, and other serious illnesses. The company had purchased products liability insurance from five different companies over a twenty-year period, and for a period before 1955, was self-insured or without other insurance. The Court was faced with deciding which insurance companies were obligated to provide a defense and, in the event of judgment, which would be responsible for paying that judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The appellate court, in\n   <em>\n    Forty-Eight Insulations\n   </em>\n   , made two important decisions relative to long term toxic torts: 1) that bodily injury occurs at the time of exposure to a toxin, thus implicating and any and all insurers providing coverage during the exposure period; and 2) that the pro rata method is used to allocate liability, proportionate to the length of each insurer's coverage during the period of exposure, or \"time on the risk.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The Sixth Circuit did not address indemnity limits in the body of the opinion; in a footnote, however, the Court acknowledged that stacking created problems combined with the exposure theory. The\n   combined aggregate limits of the twelve polices at issue in\n   <em>\n    Forty-Eight Insulations\n   </em>\n   totaled $5.6 million dollars. The Court stated: \"The problem is that if inhalation of each asbestos fiber is deemed to be a separate \"bodily injury,\" this results in the \"stacking\" of liability coverage to produce coverage that is many times $5.6 million.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at fn. 28. This, the Court continued, \"amounts to giving Forty-Eight much more insurance than it paid for.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at fn. 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The appellate court agreed with the district court's decision that stacking of liability coverage should be limited. The appellate court also endorsed the district court's statement that \"no insurer should be liable in any one case to indemnify Forty-Eight for judgment liability for more than the highest single yearly limit in a policy that existed during the period of the claimant's exposure for which judgment was obtained\".\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4010993\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/451/1230/#p1243\">\n    451 F.Supp. 1230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1243 (E.D.Mich. 1978).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at fn. 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals also stated the following in footnote 28:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   The initial exposure to asbestos fibers in any given year triggers coverage. However, under the terms of the policies, additional exposure to asbestos fibers is treated as arising out of the same occurrence. Thus, on its face, the liability of each insurer is limited to maximum amount \"per occurrence\" provided by each policy. We have no problem with the district court's extending the policy language so that each insurer would face\n   <em>\n    no more liability per claim than the maximum limit it wrote during any applicable year of coverage\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <em>\n    INA v. Forty-Eight Insulations, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1298141\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/633/1212/\">\n    633 F.2d 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   fn. 28 (6th Cir. 1980). (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Travelers, though disagreeing with Union's interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Forty Eight Insulations\n   </em>\n   , has labeled this approach \"stacking by insurer\". Under this theory, in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , each of the carriers that insured Custom would owe indemnity limits of no more than one occurrence limit \"per carrier.\" Having insured Custom for approximately four years of the exposure period, for \"$1 million dollars for each of those years, Travelers would owe any amount up to one million dollars in indemnity limits toward the Gatlin settlement. Union, having insured Custom for only two years of the exposure period at $1 million dollars per year, would likewise, owe up to a maximum of $1 million dollars in indemnity limits toward the Gatlin settlement. Similarly, the other two insurers, Kemper and Zurich, would each owe up to a $1 million dollar limit, regardless of how many years each insured Custom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   This approach has some inequities built into it. Under this scenario, it matters not how long the insurer was on the risk; its entire combined policy period would be considered but a single occurrence, and that insurer would only be liable for the equivalent of one years' policy limit. This seems unfair to those insurers who were only on the risk for a short period of time. For example, an insurer who was on the risk for one out of twenty years of exposure would have the same indemnity limit as an insurer who was on the risk for nineteen of the twenty years of exposure. It could also be quite unfair to the insured. If an insured contracted with the same insurer for each of twenty consecutive years, and bought a $1 million dollar policy each year, $1 million dollars would be all the coverage available to that insured, even though potential plaintiffs were sustaining \"continuous or repeated exposure\" to harmful conditions across that entire twenty-year period. The insured's coverage would depend on how many carriers\n   from which the insured bought policies, and not how much insurance was purchased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Comparison of the Approaches\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The following represents the indemnity limits for the two insurers that are party to this suit under each of the three methods under discussion.\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-157\"><strong>Insurance</strong> <strong>Years of</strong> <strong>Policy</strong> <strong>Indemnity Limit</strong> <strong>Indemnity Limit</strong> <strong>Indemnity Limit</strong> <strong>Carrier</strong> <strong>Coverage</strong> <strong>limit/yr</strong> <strong>Travelers' Approach</strong> <strong>Union's Approach</strong> <strong>Horizontal stacking</strong> Travelers four $1 million $485,700.00 $1 million $4 million Union two $1 million $228,600.00 $1 million $2 million Aggregate nine $1 million ea. $1 million $4 million $9 million</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   If this court accepts Travelers' theory regarding the indemnity limit, Travelers did not underpay for its portion of the settlement. Under Traveler's theory, the indemnity limit for all carriers combined was only $1 million dollars, and any amounts paid above that were voluntary payments, because neither Union nor any other insurer was legally obligated or legally liable to pay that. Under the\n   <em>\n    Guidant\n   </em>\n   ruling, a payment is voluntary if it is not within policy limits, or the payor is otherwise not legally obligated to pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Under either of the other two theories, the settlement amount was within policy limits and Travelers owes contribution to Union for what Union overpaid. Both of the other approaches involve some degree of 'stacking' of coverage. Without any stacking, the policies do not provide the insured with the amount of insurance paid for. Custom paid for nine separate $1 million dollar policies, and according to these very insurers, Gatlin suffered injury in each of those years, based on their adoption of the exposure trigger. Yet, Travelers would only indemnify Custom for the limit of one policy, or for one occurrence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   The effect, under the Travelers theory, is as if there was only one long, nine-year policy and Gatlin's injury was only one 'occurrence' for that entire nine-year period. In that case, according to Travelers' position, Custom would be limited to the $1 million dollar \"per occurrence\" limit under the policy for the Gatlin lawsuit. While the insured is capped at the $1 million dollar limit for one occurrence and facing potential excess judgments, the four insurers are able to diffuse their liability, paying only a prorated share each of that $1 million limit. This hardly seems to provide to Custom the protection for which it paid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    IMO Industries v. Transamerica Corp.\n   </em>\n   , the New Jersey Superior court was faced with an insurer who had issued a multi-year policy. Like Travelers in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , the insurer in the\n   <em>\n    IMO\n   </em>\n   case posited that the progressive injury should be treated as only one occurrence for the entire multi-year policy period; thus the insured would only be entitled to a one-time maximum \"per-occurrence\" amount.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1298141\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/633/1212/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4245605\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/437/577/#p614\">\n    437 N.J.

The New Jersey court rejected that theory, saying, \"[i]n a case of progressive indivisible injury, courts may reasonably treat the progressive injury \"as an occurrence within each of the years of a multi-year policy.\"\n   <em>\n    IMO Industries, Inc. v. Transamerica Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4245605\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/437/577/#p614\">\n    437 N.J.

IMO Industries, an insured in that case, did not dispute that the plain language of the policies would impose\n   per-occurrence limits on a term basis rather than an annual basis. IMO Industries, however, advocated that for asbestos cases, every year of a multi-year policy should be treated as if a separate annual limit is available. The court agreed; the court allowed stacking by years even though there was only one insurer. In the instant case, Custom purchased nine annual policies, and a strong argument can be made that it is entitled to the benefit of its bargain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Some degree of stacking comes closer to giving Custom what it paid for, and still allows the carriers to distribute the liability among the insurers, proportionately. All courts dealing with the long-tail progressive injuries recognize that these are difficult issues, and most general liability policies do not adequately provide for how to deal with them. As courts and commenters have stated, 'stacking' is an attempt to provide equity over time. See\n   <em>\n    Boston Gas Co. v. Century Indemnity Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670054\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/454/337/#p350\">\n    454 Mass. 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 351,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=910%20N.E.2d%20290\">\n    910 N.E.2d 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 302 (2009) (quoting Jones,\n   <em>\n    An Introduction to Insurance Allocation Issues in Multiple-Trigger Cases\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20Vill.%20Envtl.%20L.J.%2025\">\n    10 Vill.

It would certainly seem to be a more equitable outcome than what Travelers proposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Forty-Eight Insulations, supra\n   </em>\n   , the Court expressed concerns that, because under the \"exposure\" trigger, each breath of asbestos was a separate bodily injury, stacking could conceivably result in almost infinite bodily injuries, resulting in multiplying coverage many times over. That Court's suggestion, that the indemnity for each insurer could be limited to the policy limit for one year, was in response to that concern. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, however, did not rule that the indemnity limit should be so interpreted; it merely stated in a footnote, that it had no problem with the district court choosing to deal with the issue by limiting each insurer's liability per claim to the maximum limit it wrote during any applicable year of coverage.\n   <em>\n    INA v. Forty-Eight Insulations, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1298141\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/633/1212/\">\n    633 F.2d 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   fn. 28 (6th Cir. 1980).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Infinite liability exposure has not been an issue, however, where courts have utilized the horizontal stacking approach. These courts focus on the \"occurrence\" term of the contracts of insurance and treat the entire year's exposure as one occurrence, thereby limiting the indemnity for any claimant to the yearly maximum amount under the policy for each year of his or her exposure. The Supreme Court of New Jersey explained it thusly.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n   [W]hen progressive individual injury or damage results from exposure to injurious conditions for which civil liability may be imposed, courts may reasonably treat the progressive injury or damage as an occurrence within each of the years of a [Comprehensive General Liability] policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <em>\n    Benjamin Moore &amp; Co. v.

In the example used\n   <em>\n    in Forty-Eight Insulations\n   </em>\n   , the annual policy limits totaled $ 5.6 million dollars when added together.

The Travelers policy contains the following language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-174\">\n   1. Insuring Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-175\">\n   a. We will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend any \"suit\" seeking those damages. We may at our discretion investigate any \"occurrence\" and settle any claim or \"suit\" that may result. But:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-176\">\n   (1) The amount we will pay for damages is limited as described in LIMITS OF INSURANCE (SECTION III; and\n   (2) Our right and duty to defend end when we have used up the applicable limit of insurance in the payment of judgments or settlements under Coverages A or B or medical expenses under Coverage C.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   <em>\n    Travelers' Insurance Policy\n   </em>\n   [doc. no. 31-2 at p. 9].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Section III referenced in the insuring agreement states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-179\">\n   SECTION III-LIMITS OF INSURANCE\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-180\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-181\">\n   5.

The Declarations page of the policy states that the \"each occurrence limit\" is $1,000,000.00.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 4. \"Bodily injury\" according to the policy, \"means bodily injury, sickness or disease sustained by a person, including death resulting from any of these at any time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Travelers, according to the above terms of its policy, commits to pay up to $1 million dollars for bodily injury arising out of a single occurrence, not an amount up to $485,700.00. The insurers agreed that the plaintiff in the Gatlin litigation suffered exposure across the nine-year period. Gatlin, therefore, had at least one occurrence during the time that Travelers insured Custom. As stated previously, no other insurer was on the risk during this same period that Travelers insured Custom. Travelers would be obligated to indemnify Custom for up to $1 million dollars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   The policy language also includes a statement under Section III -- Limits of Insurance that \"[t]he limits of this Coverage Part apply separately to each consecutive annual period and to any remaining period of less than 12 months, starting with the beginning of the policy period shown in the Declarations...\"\n   <em>\n    Travelers' Insurance Policy\n   </em>\n   [doc. no. 31-2 at p.14]. It seems then, that the policy terms require that for each new policy year, the coverage starts over and another \"occurrence\" creates another obligation to pay up to $1 million dollars. The policy language only purports to limit liability under each particular annual policy. Thus, even if there is only one occurrence, the insured should be entitled to recover up to the \"each occurrence limit\" of that particular policy. That \"each occurrence limit\" is $1 million dollars according to the terms of the policy. Based on the language of the policy, this court does not agree with Travelers that the indemnity limit for Custom relative to the Gatlin litigation was only $1 million dollars from all insurers combined\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Some courts, using the exposure theory, have found that if there was any exposure during a policy year, the entire exposure for that policy period constitutes but \"one occurrence.\" In the instant case, Gatlin's exposure spanned approximately nine years. If all nine policies are implicated without any limitations, the indemnity limit would be $9 million dollars, and the $1.75 million dollar settlement amount is certainly within policy limits. In that event, summary judgment should be granted in favor of Union. If the court chose to apply the \"per carrier\" limitation mentioned in the\n   Forty\n   <em>\n    -Eight Insulations\n   </em>\n   footnote, as advocated by Union, the indemnity limit would be $4 million dollars, and the $1.75 million dollar settlement amount is well within policy limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   This court, however, need not decide between the two theories and determine whether $4 million dollars or $9 million dollars is the total indemnity limit for all carriers combined. For all the reasons stated, this court is persuaded that $1 million dollars is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the indemnity limit, and that limit is at least $4 million dollars, based on the theories of\n   <em>\n    Forty-Eight Insulations\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1298141\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/633/1212/\">\n    633 F.2d 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Porter v.

Furthermore, this court concludes that the liability limit of each individual carrier, based on the language of the policies (which according to the record contained very similar language to that of Travelers), was no less than that carrier's one year liability limit of $1,000.000.00. Travelers, individually, had an indemnity limit of no less than $1 million dollars, and all carriers combined had an indemnity limit of no less than $4 million dollars. Travelers, therefore, was responsible for a 48.57% of the $1.75 million dollar settlement, or $849,975.00, an amount which is also within its individual limits. Travelers underpaid its share of the Gatlin settlement by $364,275.00. Union paid $291,450.00 of that difference. Zurich paid the remaining portion, but is not a party to this lawsuit\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   The parties agree that there are no material facts at issue in this lawsuit and this court has so determined.
