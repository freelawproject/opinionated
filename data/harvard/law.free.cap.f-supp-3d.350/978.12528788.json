Martinez, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The case arises, sadly, from the suicide of a Colorado resident, Martin Fisher (\"Fisher\"), fourteen months after Plaintiff Amica Life Insurance Company (\"Amica\") issued him a life insurance policy. The policy contains a two-year suicide exclusion, which is lawful under a regulation promulgated by an administrative agency created by an interstate compact to which Colorado is a party. A Colorado statute, however, nullifies suicide exclusions longer than one year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2010-7-109\">\n    Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 10-7-109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If Colorado may validly delegate authority to an administrative agency to develop insurance standards that may conflict with Colorado insurance statutes, then Amica's two-year exclusion is valid. Otherwise, Amica's exclusion is invalid and Amica owes the death benefit to Fisher's beneficiary, Defendant Michael P. Wertz (\"Wertz\"). Invoking this Court's diversity jurisdiction,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Amica brought this lawsuit for declaratory judgment that it properly denied payment of Fisher's death benefit in light of the interstate two-year exclusion. Currently before the Court on Amica's motion for summary judgment. (ECF No. 67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The proper outcome ultimately turns on the extent of the Colorado Legislature's authority under the Colorado Constitution to delegate regulatory power to an administrative body. This Court therefore\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   certified the question to the Colorado Supreme Court per Colorado Appellate Rule 21.1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amica Life Ins.

Colo. 2017) (ECF No. 73) (\"\n   <em>\n    Wertz\n   </em>\n   \" or \"Prior Order\"). Precisely three weeks later, the Colorado Supreme Court declined to accept the certified question. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 75.) That court thus returned a weighty question of Colorado constitutional law to the undersigned, whose decisions, particularly regarding state law, bind no one but the parties before him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court then accepted supplemental briefs from the parties (ECF Nos. 81, 82, 86-1) as well as an\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   brief from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\"NAIC\") in support of Amica (ECF No. 79-1); an\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   brief from the Interstate Insurance Product Regulation Commission (\"Interstate Commission\" or \"Commission\"), also in support of Amica (ECF No. 80-1); and Wertz's response to these\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   briefs (ECF No. 85). The Court reviewed these briefs and called for limited further briefing on certain matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (ECF No. 89.) All parties and\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   filed briefs in response. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 90-93.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court has thoroughly studied all of these materials, including the parties' original summary judgment briefs (ECF Nos. 67, 70, 72), the legal authorities cited by the parties and\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   , and what appears to be the only treatise on interstate compacts,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Michael L.

The Court concludes-to its surprise-that the Colorado Legislature may validly delegate to an administrative agency the power to promulgate a regulation that modifies a statute. Moreover, there is no barrier to the Colorado Legislature delegating such authority to an interstate administrative agency, so the two-year exclusion applicable to Fisher's policy is valid and Amica properly denied payment of the death benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For ease of the seemingly inevitable appellate review, the explanation that follows is not confined to the legal question of what the Colorado Legislature may validly delegate to an administrative agency, but also repeats verbatim much of the Prior Order, including rulings regarding certain factual disputes. In other words, the purpose of this order is to address all matters resolved through the Prior Order and all matters left open there, so that one need only read this order to understand the full dispute and the Court's holdings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Two-Year Suicide Exclusion Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Colorado enacted the Insurance Compact in 2004, with an effective date of August 4, 2005. (ECF No. 67 at 3, \u00b6 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Colorado Legislature designated the state insurance commissioner as Colorado's representative at the Interstate Commission.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2024-60-3001\">\n    Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 24-60-3001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Preamble. The Interstate Commission itself became operational in June 2006. (ECF No. 67 at 4, \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On January 24, 2007, the Commission published notice of its intent to adopt its Individual Term Life Insurance Product (\"ITLIP\") Standards. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, \u00b6 18.) Amica claims that, on May 1, 2007, the Commission provided notice of the pending ITLIP Standards to \"the chairs, ranking members, and members of the Colorado General Assembly's (i) House Business Affairs and Labor Committee and (ii) Senate Business Labor and Technology Committee.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) Wertz denies this. (ECF No. 70 at 3, \u00b6 21.) The Court will address whether Wertz's denial creates a genuine issue of material fact in Part V.B, below. Regardless, the parties agree that the House and Senate committees named above were the proper committees to which the Interstate Commission was required to provide notice. (ECF No. 67 at 6, \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Interstate Commission held a public hearing regarding the ITLIP Standards on May 16, 2007. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, \u00b6 24.) That is also the date of the last written comment the Commission received regarding the ITLIP Standards. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The ITLIP Standards were formally adopted by the Interstate Commission on June 1, 2007, with a declared effective date of September 6, 2007. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) The ITLIP Standards declare that any suicide exclusion in an approved policy must be no longer than two years from the date the policy is issued. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) Colorado has never opted out of that Uniform Standard-or, for that matter, any Uniform Standard. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13, \u00b6\u00b6 83-84.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Fisher's Policy, His Suicide, and Wertz's Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In October 2011, the Interstate Commission approved an individual term life insurance product submitted by Amica. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, \u00b6 55.) That product, as approved, excluded death benefits if death of the insured was caused by suicide within two years from the policy's issuance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.) In such a circumstance, Amica's only obligation was to refund the policy premium. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On January 28, 2014, Amica issued to Fisher one of the aforementioned life insurance policies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.) Fisher committed suicide about fourteen months later, on March 12, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11, \u00b6 71.) On May 1, 2015, Defendant Wertz, who was Fisher's named beneficiary under the policy, submitted a claim for the death benefit, citing Colorado Revised Statute \u00a7 10-7-109. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12, \u00b6 72.) That section reads in relevant part as follows: \"The suicide of a policyholder after the first policy year of any life insurance policy issued by any life insurance company doing business in this state shall not be a defense against the payment of a life insurance policy....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, Wertz believed Colorado's one-year exclusion applied, not the policy's Commission-approved two-year exclusion. Amica stood by the two-year exclusion, denied\n   Wertz's claim, and refunded the premium. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Anticipating that Wertz would file suit, Amica filed a declaratory judgment action in this Court in June 2015. (ECF No. 1.) Wertz answered and affirmatively defended that the two-year suicide exclusion violated Colorado law and must be declared unenforceable. (ECF No. 24 at 4, \u00b6 20.) Wertz also counterclaimed for reformation of the policy, breach of contract, and common-law bad faith breach of insurance contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   At first, the parties agreed \"the material facts of this matter were not in dispute\" (ECF No. 39 \u00b6 2) and the resolution \"depended entirely upon a question of law\" (ECF No. 45 at 1), namely, which source of authority controls: Colorado Revised Statute \u00a7 10-7-109 or the ITLIP Standards? Amica therefore filed what was, in effect, a motion for judgment on the pleadings to resolve the question of law. (ECF No. 25;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 49 at 3 n.1.) Amica naturally argued that Colorado had enacted the Insurance Compact and, in so doing, declared that the Interstate Commission's duly promulgated Uniform Standards have the force and effect of law; therefore, the ITLIP Standards apply. Wertz's primary response was that the Compact, or at least its application in this case, violates the Colorado Constitution. Specifically, Wertz argued that the Compact is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power, violates separation-of-powers principles, and violates the guarantees of equal protection and freedom from special legislation. (ECF No. 30-1 at 3-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In reply, Amica relied heavily on the Compact's opt-out provisions. (ECF No. 33 at 5-6.) Amica characterized the ability to opt out as \"the ultimate safeguard against the exercise of unbridled discretion by the Commission\" (ECF No. 33 at 5), thus mollifying the Colorado Supreme Court's charge that \"individuals be protected against the unnecessary and uncontrolled exercise of...discretionary power\" by bodies to whom legislators have delegated rulemaking authority.\n   <em>\n    Cottrell v. City &amp; Cnty. of Denver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10438082\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/636/703/#p709\">\n    636 P.2d 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 709 (Colo. 1981).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Two months after Amica filed its reply, and before this Court had decided Amica's motion, Wertz filed a motion to amend his answer and counterclaims. (ECF No. 39.) Wertz there claimed \"ongoing investigation and research under further inquiry\" which has led him to \"believe[ ] that the Commission failed to promulgate the [ITLIP Standards] in accordance with the Compact's terms.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) Therefore, according to Wertz, the ITLIP Standards might be invalid under the Compact's own terms. Wertz claimed that this would \"impact the constitutionality of the Compact statute.\" (ECF No. 39 \u00b6 2.) Another implication, of course, would be that this Court might not need to reach the constitutional questions, should Wertz turn out to be correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court resolved Amica's and Wertz's respective motions by denying the former without prejudice and granting the latter. (ECF No. 49.) The Court reasoned that \"the constitutionality of the Compact is a weighty issue that this Court should avoid if there is a colorable possibility that the case can be decided on other grounds, such as the potential procedural irregularity that Wertz raises.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) The Court therefore sent the parties to discovery on the question of \"the procedural regularity of the [ITLIP] Standards.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   That discovery is now closed, and Amica has filed its motion for summary judgment, claiming no genuine dispute of material fact on the procedural regularity of the ITLIP Standards, and renewing its argument that those Standards control over\n   Colorado Revised Statute \u00a7 10-7-109. (ECF No. 67.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    V. ANALYSIS OF FACTUAL DISPUTES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Timeliness of Wertz's Challenge\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Insurance Compact requires that any action seeking judicial review of a Uniform Standard be brought within thirty days of promulgation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2024-60-3001\">\n    Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 24-60-3001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , art. VII, \u00a7 7. The ITLIP Standards were promulgated on June 1, 2007. Wertz raised his current counterclaim theory-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that the Interstate Commission did not give proper pre-promulgation notice of the ITLIP Standards to the Colorado Legislature-for the first time on January 21, 2016. (ECF No. 39.) Amica accordingly argues that \"any procedural challenge\" to the ITLIP Standards is now foreclosed as untimely. (ECF No. 67 at 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   There are colorable counterarguments to this position. For example, is a challenge in the context of a dispute between insurer and beneficiary the same as \"judicial review\" under the Insurance Compact (which presumably has in mind an action against the Interstate Commission directly)? Or, may the Colorado Legislature, consistent with due process, create a statute of limitations as short as thirty days? But Wertz does not raise these arguments. In fact, he entirely ignores Amica's timeliness argument. The Court therefore deems him to have conceded that his challenge to the procedural regularity of the ITLIP Standards is untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Lack of a Genuine Dispute of Material Fact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Alternatively, the Court finds that there is no genuine dispute of material fact over whether the Interstate Commission provided proper pre-promulgation notice of the ITLIP Standards to the Colorado Legislature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The sole relevant factual dispute-genuine or otherwise-is whether the Interstate Commission actually\n   <em>\n    sent\n   </em>\n   notice of the ITLIP Standards to the Colorado Legislature ahead of those Standards' promulgation. Amica offers the affidavit of Karen Schutter, the Interstate Commission's executive director. (ECF No. 67-1 at 1, \u00b6 1.) Schutter claims to be an authorized records custodian for the Commission. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, \u00b6 6.) Schutter says that the requisite notice to the Colorado Legislature was sent on May 1, 2007 (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14), which obviously predates the ITLIP Standards' promulgation on June 1, 2007. Schutter attaches to her affidavit a document (\"Exhibit D\") that appears to be a sort of cover letter, directed to all relevant state legislative committees and announcing the Interstate Commission's consideration of the ITLIP Standards, among others. (ECF No. 67-1 at 31.) Schutter does not claim that Exhibit D was the notice itself, but rather describes it as the \"content of the notice\" sent to the Colorado Legislature. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Wertz's response is essentially twofold. First, Wertz points out that the Interstate Commission, in response to his records request, stated that the May 2007 notice to state legislatures has already been destroyed pursuant to the Commission's five-year\n   records retention schedule. (ECF No. 70 at 3, \u00b6 21.) Thus, he attacks Exhibit D- although, surprisingly,\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   on authenticity grounds. He does not, for example, dispute that Exhibit D embodied the \"content of the notice.\" He instead simply asserts,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Exhibit D to the Schutter Affidavit does not establish that the Commission sent the requisite Legislative Notice on May 1, 2007, or any other time prior to adopting the ITLIP Standards. Nor does Exhibit D establish that the Commission sent the requisite Legislative Notice to the proper members of the Colorado General Assembly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2024-60-3001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2024-60-3001\">\n    at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (repeating the same arguments).) Second, Wertz notes that Schutter began her employment with the Interstate Commission in December 2008, after the May 2007 notice was allegedly sent, and therefore she lacks personal knowledge regarding that matter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Wertz's arguments are somewhat misdirected. In Colorado, administrative action is entitled to a presumption of regularity.\n   <em>\n    Marshall v. Civil Serv. Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12343015\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/401/96/#p101\">\n    401 P.3d 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 101 (Colo.

Aug. 21, 2017). If Wertz had brought a timely judicial review challenge directly against the Interstate Commission, Wertz would have borne the burden to rebut the presumption of regularity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203594017\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   3 Charles H. Koch, Jr. &amp; Richard Murphy,\n   <em>\n    Administrative Law &amp; Practice\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9:13 (3d ed., Feb. 2017 update). Wertz offers no reason why he does not bear the same burden as to his counterclaim against Amica based on the alleged irregularity of the ITLIP Standards, nor does the Court independently discern any reason.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court holds, therefore, that the burden of proof rests on Wertz, just as it would in a normal action for judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In that light, it was Wertz's burden in his summary judgment response brief to present the evidence by which a reasonable jury could conclude that the May 2007 legislative notice was never sent. Viewing Wertz's response generously, it appears he proffers only two items of evidence: (1) the Interstate Commission's admission that it no longer possesses the actual May 2007 notice; and (2) the fact that the Commission was able to produce legislative notices sent in 2008 and 2010, both of which also should have been destroyed under the Commission's five-year retention schedule (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 70 at 19 n.1)-apparently insinuating that the retention schedule explanation as to the May 2007 notice is suspect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court holds that these two items, viewed together and in the light most favorable to Wertz, are no more than a scintilla of evidence that the Interstate Commission failed to provide pre-promulgation notice of the ITLIP Standards to the Colorado Legislature on May 1, 2007. In other words, no reasonable jury could find that Wertz carried his burden on this question. Accordingly, there is no\n   <em>\n    genuine\n   </em>\n   dispute of material fact as to pre-promulgation notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The \"Consider Fully\" Clause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Wertz also advances a rather creative alternative argument that the ITLIP Standards were invalidly promulgated. His argument is grounded in the following two sentences of the Insurance Compact:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Before the Commission adopts a Uniform Standard, the Commission shall give written notice to the relevant state\n   legislative committee(s) in each Compacting State responsible for insurance issues of its intention to adopt the Uniform Standard. The Commission in adopting a Uniform Standard shall consider fully all submitted materials and issue a concise explanation of its decision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2024-60-3001\">\n    Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 24-60-3001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , art. VII, \u00a7 2. Wertz interprets the second sentence to mean that the Interstate Commission must \" 'consider fully' all materials submitted in response\" to the notice given in the first sentence. (ECF No. 70 at 20.) Therefore, he says, \"[n]otice must be sent in a timeframe that allows sufficient time for the legislature to react and respond.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) But, he continues, the notice was allegedly sent on May 1, 2007, and the Colorado Legislature's 2007 session ended on May 4, 2007. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, the Commission supposedly violated its \"consider fully\" duty by not giving the Colorado Legislature time to submit any response or comment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Wertz's interpretation simply has no support in the statutory language. The second sentence quoted above speaks of the rulemaking process generally. It has nothing to do with waiting for a particular legislature to submit written materials. This argument therefore fails as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. ANALYSIS OF LEGAL DISPUTES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Matters Not in Question\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Given the foregoing, the constitutional question cannot be avoided. In approaching that question, the Court first notes the following.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Despite the many arguments made by the parties and\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   , this case is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   about:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \u2022 Whether the Colorado Legislature may delegate rulemaking authority to an administrative agency.

Again, it may.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   \u2022 Whether the ITLIP two-year suicide exclusion is consistent with the authority delegated to the Interstate Commission. Momentarily setting aside the question of conflict with a pre-existing state statute, the Court has been given no reason to doubt that the Interstate Commission's delegated authority permits it to establish a two-year suicide exclusion as part of its Uniform Standards.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   \u2022 Whether the ITLIP two-year suicide exclusion is a good idea or bad idea as compared to a different time limit, such as Colorado's statutory one-year limit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   question before the Court is whether the Colorado Legislature may delegate to an interstate authority the discretion to promulgate regulations that, in effect, amend or repeal state statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Framing the Dispute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court's inquiry may be broken down into two sub-questions.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     First\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , may the Colorado Legislature delegate to a\n   <em>\n    Colorado\n   </em>\n   administrative agency the discretion to promulgate regulations that substantively modify state statutes? If so, the Court's judgment must be for Amica because no party has advanced any reason why the Colorado Legislature cannot delegate to an interstate agency the same authority it could delegate to a Colorado agency. But if not, then,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     second\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , does the power to enter into interstate compacts nonetheless give the Colorado Legislature authority to delegate administrative rulemaking power to an interstate agency that it could not delegate to a Colorado agency?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court ultimately concludes that the answer to the first question is \"yes.\" However, the parties and\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   have spent the bulk of this case arguing over the second question. Even when the Court solicited supplemental briefs specifically regarding the first question (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 89),\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   responded by insisting that the first question is irrelevant-indeed, an entirely mistaken inquiry-and so the Court should focus solely on the second question (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 91, 92). Amica has similarly argued that the first question is unnecessary to resolve because, in its view, the answer to the second question is obviously \"yes.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 72 at 4-5; ECF No. 81 at 3 n.1.) Accordingly, the Court will first explain why it believes the answer to the second question is \"no.\" The Court will then explain why the answer to the first question is \"yes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    C. May the Colorado Legislature Delegate Rulemaking Authority to an Interstate Administrative Agency that it Could Not Delegate to a Colorado Administrative Agency?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Article III of the Colorado Constitution reads,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   The powers of the government of this state are divided into three distinct departments,-the Legislative, Executive and Judicial; and no person or collection of persons charged with the exercise of powers properly belonging to one of these departments shall exercise any power properly belonging to either of the others, except as in this Constitution expressly directed or permitted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Article III is sometimes interpreted to mean that \"[o]nly the legislature has the power to amend laws,\"\n   <em>\n    Miller Int'l, Inc. v.

For present purposes, the Court will take them at face value. Even taking them at face value, however, Amica and\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   argue that interstate compacts operate in a different legal dimension, where things of legal significance can happen that normally cannot happen, such as where a legal authority normally deemed subordinate to a constitution or statute nonetheless takes precedence. Indeed, particularly under\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   's argument, a state's power to enter interstate compacts frees it entirely from relevant state constitutional restraints, giving it power to achieve\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   goal via an interstate compact as long as it does not violate federal law. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 67 at 21-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   As the Court will explain below, Amica's and\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   's authorities do not demonstrate that interstate compacts function outside the normal channels of legal authority and constitutional review. Rather, these authorities show that\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   Congress has\n   <em>\n    approved\n   </em>\n   an interstate compact, then the compact is deemed to be federal legislation and overrides any conflicting state authority by virtue of the Supremacy Clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. art. VI, \u00b6 2 (\"This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.\"). The Insurance Compact is not congressionally approved, and likely need not be, given that Congress has specifically declared insurance to be a matter primarily of state, not federal, concern.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201012\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As to compacts that do not receive congressional approval, such as the Insurance Compact, the case law shows that they are treated as contracts between the states. This may limit the sorts of arguments one compacting state may assert vis-\u00e0-vis another compacting state, but it does not prevent a citizen aggrieved by a particular compact from challenging the state's authority under the state constitution to enter into the compact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Court summarizes the relevant authorities chronologically.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Green\n    </em>\n    (U.S. 1823)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Amica cites\n   <em>\n    Green v.

In isolation, this language appears to be saying that \"legislative power\" is an immutable supra-constitutional concept that inherently includes the power to delegate, even if the relevant state constitution says otherwise. But the Supreme Court immediately backed away from such implications by couching its statement in the fact that\n   <em>\n    interstate waters\n   </em>\n   were at issue, thus implicating the court's original jurisdiction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   If this Court, in the exercise of its original jurisdiction, were to enter a decree requiring West Virginia to abate pollution of interstate streams, that decree would bind the State.

The obligation would be fixed by this Court on the basis of a master's report. Here, the State has bound itself to control pollution by the more effective means of an agreement with other States. The Compact involves a reasonable and carefully limited delegation of power to an interstate agency. Nothing in its Constitution suggests that, in dealing with the problem dealt with by the Compact, West Virginia must wait for the answer to be dictated by this Court after harassing and unsatisfactory litigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147999\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/341/22/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147999\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/341/22/\">\n    at 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147999\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/341/22/\">\n    71 S.Ct. 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It is, instead, a commentary on the practical implications of the U.S. Supreme Court's original jurisdiction over controversies between two or more states. Because states must obey Supreme Court orders, states must have\n   <em>\n    power\n   </em>\n   to obey, regardless of the terms of their respective constitutions.

Justice Reed concurred in the result and wrote separately, insisting that the federal Compact Clause,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 3 (\"No state shall, without the consent of Congress,...enter into any agreement or compact with another state....\"), should be construed to mean that \"[t]he interpretation\n   of the meaning of [a federally approved] compact controls over a state's application of its own law through the Supremacy Clause and not by any implied federal power to construe state law.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147999\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/341/22/\">\n    341 U.S. at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147999\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/341/22/\">\n    71 S.Ct. 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Perhaps no other justice signed on to Justice Reed's opinion because his proposal does not solve the problem.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The question in\n   <em>\n    Dyer\n   </em>\n   was not interpretation of a compact but interpretation of a state constitution. Justice Reed's reasoning only works if one assumes that the federal Compact Clause grants to the states the power to do things forbidden under their respective constitutions. In other words, as long as a state legislature approves a compact that Congress also approves, the state constitution becomes irrelevant. This, however, gives the legislature power to override the constitution that created it. An aggrieved party's only hope would be to obtain a court order preventing the legislature from voting to accept the compact, or preventing the governor from signing it into law. Without such an order, then adoption of the law would be the end of it. The compact would become federal law superior to the state constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Justice Jackson also concurred in the\n   <em>\n    Dyer\n   </em>\n   judgment, but his reasoning ultimately creates the same problem as Justice Reed's. Justice Jackson said that West Virginia should simply be estopped from claiming a state constitutional infirmity:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   Estoppel is not often to be invoked against a government. But West Virginia assumed a contractual obligation with equals by permission of another government that is sovereign in the field [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the federal government]. After Congress and sister States had been induced to alter their positions and bind themselves to terms of a covenant, West Virginia should be estopped from repudiating her act. For this reason, I consider that whatever interpretation she may put on the generalities of her Constitution, she is bound by the Compact....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147999\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/341/22/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147999\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/341/22/\">\n    at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147999\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/341/22/\">\n    71 S.Ct. 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If this were an appropriate application of estoppel, then once again a state legislature would have power to supersede its own constitution. Advocates of a compact would need only to push it through the legislative process and secure the governor's signature. The compact would then be immune to state constitutional challenges due to a type of apparent agency manifested to other compacting states and the federal government, thus justifying estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The foregoing analysis refutes Amica's and\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   's insistence that\n   <em>\n    Dyer\n   </em>\n   's reasoning was entirely independent from the fact that Congress approved the compact.

Amica seems to be saying that allowing Colorado's one-year suicide exclusion to control despite the Interstate Commission's two-year exclusion is effectively the\n   same as allowing Colorado to unilaterally change the terms of the Insurance Compact. The analogy does not work in these circumstances. A ruling in favor of Wertz would not change the terms of the Insurance Compact. It might change Colorado's relationship to the Insurance Compact, although, as already noted, this Court's ruling only binds the parties before it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   It also may call into question whether Interstate Commission-approved policies are truly enforceable as written in Colorado.

In both cases, legislation is at issue, and a state legislature can allow one statute to supersede another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Again, however, the dispute between Amica and Wertz is not a conflict of statutes. It is a conflict of a preexisting Colorado statute and an administrative regulation promulgated by an interstate agency created by a Colorado statute.\n   <em>\n    McComb\n   </em>\n   has nothing to say on this specific scenario, although perhaps it implies that interstate compacts and everything that flows from them (potentially including administrative regulations) take precedence over conflicting state statutes-otherwise, an interstate compact could not achieve its desired effect. It is nonetheless difficult to be sure that\n   <em>\n    McComb\n   </em>\n   meant to go this far, given that the question was not before the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Interestingly,\n   <em>\n    McComb\n   </em>\n   applied Pennsylvania law to invalidate a regulation promulgated by the interstate commission administering the Interstate Compact for Placement of Children, because the regulation conflicted with the compact itself, which had been enacted in Pennsylvania.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10539473\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/934/474/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10539473\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/934/474/\">\n    at 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, the commission administering the compact had issued a regulation interpreting the compact to apply to circumstances when a child was being transferred across state lines to live with that child's parent. The Third Circuit found this interpretation untenable in light of the language of the compact itself. But this provides no guidance on whether an interstate administrative body's regulation can supersede some other state statute.

In analyzing this question, the Arizona court first observed that, \"[b]y adopting the [compact], enacting [the enabling legislation], and delegating a representative of this state to participate in the activities of the [interstate commission charged with administering the compact], Arizona has implicitly agreed to accept and abide by rules or regulations duly promulgated by the [commission].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 518.

But if Amica means to say that all of this is true\n   <em>\n    even if the legislature exceeded its constitutional authority to delegate when it enacted the Compact\n   </em>\n   , then all the concerns discussed above regarding Justice Reed's and Justice Jackson's\n   <em>\n    Dyer\n   </em>\n   concurrences return. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part VI.C.3.) To accept this principle would be to grant state legislatures power to override their own constitutions simply by managing to enter into a compact before a judicial challenge could stop it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   10.\n   <em>\n    Synthesis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   As is clear above, Amica's and\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   's position reduces to the argument that an interstate compact is impervious to state constitutional challenge once enacted- enacted, ironically, through the procedure set down in the state constitution. Amica and\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   would endorse the assertion in the\n   <em>\n    Interstate Compacts\n   </em>\n   treatise that \"[t]he subject matter and powers specified in an interstate compact are not...limited by any specific state constitutional restrictions; rather as with any 'contract,' the subject matter is largely left to the discretion of the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Interstate Compacts\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1.2.1, at 16 (footnote omitted). The treatise goes on, mincing no words in its assertion that \"[o]nce a state enacts a compact, the terms of the compact and any rules and regulations authorized by the compact to the extent provided in the agreement, supersede any substantive state laws that may be in conflict regardless of [whether Congress approves].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3.4, at 103.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Whether any of this is true\n   <em>\n    in a dispute between compacting states\n   </em>\n   is not a matter before this Court.

First, imagine an \"interstate legislation compact,\" which provides that legislation drafted and proposed by an interstate commission may be enacted into law by the state legislature without the governor's signature, or with only the vote of one house of the state legislature (assuming there are two), or with less than a majority of state legislators voting in favor. Under Amica's and\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   's view, there is nothing wrong with such a compact because it exists in \"a 'space' between what is purely state authority and what is purely federal authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Interstate Compacts\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1.2.1, at 11. But it is undeniably, in effect, a sea-change amendment to the state's constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Second, and less dramatically, imagine an interstate civil procedure compact designed to standardize the rules of civil court proceedings as much as possible across states. This presents questions unique to Colorado and other states with similar constitutions. In Colorado, unlike in the federal system, the power to make rules of court procedure is granted by the state constitution to the judicial branch: \"The supreme court shall make and promulgate rules governing the administration of all courts and shall make and promulgate rules governing practice and procedure in civil and criminal cases....\" Colo. Const. art. VI, \u00a7 21. This authority is exclusive, and a legislative enactment that purports to establish or modify procedural court rules is void.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Borer v. Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9233495\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/91/375/#p380\">\n    91 P.3d 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 380 (Colo. 2004). From Amica's and\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   's vantage point, however, the state constitutional restriction is immaterial-so long as the state legislature enacts the compact and the governor signs it, the matter is settled and the state constitution is irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   This Court cannot predict how the Colorado Supreme Court would ultimately rule in any challenge to this hypothetical interstate civil procedure compact. That said, the Court is confident the Colorado Supreme Court would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   throw up its hands and declare the matter unreviewable on solely account of the interstate-compact nature of the legislation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    D. May the Colorado Legislature Delegate Comparable Power to a Colorado Agency?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The Court thus returns to the first question (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Part VI.B, above): may the\n   Colorado Legislature delegate to a Colorado administrative agency the discretion to promulgate regulations that substantively modify state statutes? And, to be clear, the ITLIP Standards\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   substantively modify Colorado Revised Statute \u00a7 10-7-109. The relevant portion of that statute reads, \"The suicide of a policyholder after the first policy year of any life insurance policy issued by any life insurance company doing business in this state shall not be a defense against the payment of a life insurance policy....\" The ITLIP Standards effectively amend the language to include an exception for insurance policies approved by the Interstate Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The Effect of\n    <em>\n     Liebhardt\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   As noted, the Colorado Supreme Court has previously declared that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   a regulation must further the will of the legislature and may not modify or contravene an existing statute.

But again, they remain the best evidence of what the Colorado Supreme Court would do and so, if needed, this Court would predict that the rule of\n   <em>\n    Liebhardt\n   </em>\n   is indeed the rule the Colorado Supreme Court would adopt if squarely presented with the question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   In this light, the Court holds that the Colorado Legislature may delegate to a state administrative agency the legal authority to modify existing state statutes, and such a delegation need not be expressly stated in the relevant legislation.

Rev. Stat. \u00a7 24-60-3001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , art. XVI, \u00a7 1. And even if this did not amount to an express delegation, it is obvious from the structure and stated purposes of the Insurance Compact that the Interstate Commission will sometimes promulgate Uniform Standards that do not match the corresponding standards in compacting states' existing insurance statutes. Legislative history, moreover, suggests that the Colorado Legislature fully understood that the purpose of the Compact was to allow the Uniform Standards to control over any state statute that would dictate a different rule. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 80-1 at 7 (quoting a state senator's statement in a hearing on the Insurance Compact that it would \"bypass our state law\" on matters within its purview); ECF No. 81 at 10 n.7 (summarizing information provided by the Colorado insurance commissioner to the Colorado Senate regarding the Compact, including a frequently asked questions handout stating that the \"Compact replaces conflicting state law for products approved by the commission\").) In short, the Colorado Legislature's adoption of the Insurance Compact could also be construed as the type of implied authorization to modify existing Colorado statutes that, according to\n   <em>\n    Liebhardt\n   </em>\n   , is not\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   unconstitutional under the Colorado Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Applying The\n    <em>\n     Cottrell\n    </em>\n    Test\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Even if a particular delegation is not\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   unconstitutional, it must still pass muster under the Colorado Supreme Court's\n   <em>\n    Cottrell\n   </em>\n   test, which is Colorado's application of what is generally known in administrative law as the \"nondelegation doctrine.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cottrell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10438082\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/636/703/#p709\">\n    636 P.2d at 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n   [T]he test is ... whether there are sufficient statutory standards and safeguards\n   and administrative standards and safeguards, in combination, to protect against unnecessary and uncontrolled exercise of discretionary power.

Wertz acknowledges that the Legislature may nonetheless opt out at any time, but notes that any such opt-out would be prospective only, so some Colorado consumers might still be subject to Uniform Standards that went into effect in the meantime. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   The legislative opt-out procedure is not optimal, but the Court cannot say it is inadequate.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cottrell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10438082\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/636/703/#p709\">\n    636 P.2d at 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (upholding rate-setting regime that \"provide[d] adequate, although not optimal, protection from abuse\"). Moreover, although it is probably the most important procedural protection, it is not the only procedural protection. Wertz does not address why the legislative opt-out procedure, in combination with all of the other procedural safeguards, fails to \"to insure that administrative action will be rational and consistent in the first instance and that subsequent judicial review of that action is available and will be effective.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10438082\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/636/703/#p709\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10438082\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/636/703/#p709\">\n    at 709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   \"[V]iolation of the nondelegation doctrine has been an argument frequently invoked but seldom sustained.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10438082\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/636/703/#p709\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10438082\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/636/703/#p709\">\n    at 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In Colorado, \"the legislative department of government does not abdicate its lawmaking function when it describes what job must be done, who must do it, and the scope of his authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Lowrie\n   </em>\n   , 761 P.2d at 781 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the Court finds that the Insurance Compact would satisfy the\n   <em>\n    Cottrell\n   </em>\n   test if the agency receiving the delegated authority was a Colorado administrative agency. There is no reason, then, why the Colorado Legislature could not have delegated the same authority to an interstate administrative agency. Consequently, the Insurance Compact does not violate Colorado's nondelegation doctrine. In turn, the two-year suicide exclusion in the ITLIP Standards is valid and controlling in these circumstances and Amica properly refused to pay the death benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Lingering Questions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   The foregoing analysis is in some ways unsatisfying because of its implications. At least from a nondelegation perspective,\n   <em>\n    Liebhardt\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cottrell\n   </em>\n   together suggest that the Colorado Legislature could create an \"All-Statutes Review Commission\" with power to supplant the entire Colorado Revised Statutes with administrative regulations, assuming adequate standards and safeguards. In other words, the Legislature\n   could relegate itself to a purely veto role. Perhaps the Colorado Supreme Court would deem that a bridge too far-perhaps, as a matter of law, no standards or safeguards are adequate when the Legislature delegates its entire police power-but nothing in\n   <em>\n    Liebhardt\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Cottrell\n   </em>\n   logically dictates as much.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   The interstate compact context also raises interesting questions. If\n   <em>\n    Liebhardt\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cottrell\n   </em>\n   reflect administrative law in other states, then uniform state-law advocates have been approaching their task the wrong way. Drafters of model legislation should instead draft an interstate compact embracing a particular subject and lobby for the interstate compact's adoption in the various states. Then a regulatory body created by the compact could adopt, modify, and repeal substantive standards that otherwise would have been in a model act, all without having to return to any state's legislature to lobby for further approval. Indeed, one could imagine an \"Interstate All-Statutes Review Commission\" that effectively acts as an interstate legislature. But that is a matter, if ever, for another day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   <strong>\n    VII.
