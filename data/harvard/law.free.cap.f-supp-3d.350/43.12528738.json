The agents' search uncovered a hoard of child pornography on various computers and digital storage devices. A federal grand jury subsequently indicted Monroe for allegedly producing, receiving, and possessing such materials in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202251\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 2252.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The trail of digital breadcrumbs that led to Monroe's door began with several pornographic videos downloaded from an internet file sharing service by an unknown user. Pursuant to \u00a7 2703(d) of the Stored Communications Act, the Government obtained orders from two federal magistrate judges from the District of Columbia requiring the Georgia-based file sharing service to disclose the unique internet protocol (\"IP\") address for any device that had downloaded the illicit files. The Government later learned from an internet service provider that the disclosed IP address was assigned to an individual at Monroe's residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Monroe has moved for an order suppressing \"all evidence obtained as a result of the unlawful acquisition of [his] IP address.\" (Def.'s Mot. to Suppress 1, ECF No. 24.) He argues that the \u00a7 2703(d) disclosure orders were void\n   <em>\n    ab\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    initio\n   </em>\n   because the District of Columbia magistrate judges lacked jurisdiction over the alleged crime. Relying on the Supreme Court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Carpenter v.

Neither argument is tenable. Thus, for the reasons stated below, Monroe's Motion to Suppress (ECF No. 24) is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In September 2015, agents from Homeland Security Investigations (\"HSI\") and personnel from the U.S. Department of Justice's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, High Technology Investigative Unit (\"CEOS-HTIU\") jointly investigated an internet-based bulletin board dedicated to the advertisement, distribution, and production of child pornography.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Search\n   Warrant Appl. Aff. of James V. Richardson (\"Richardson Aff.\") \u00b6\u00b6 6, 10, ECF No. 25-5.) The bulletin board is located on \"The Onion Router\" or \"TOR,\" a network which masks users' location and usage data to avoid surveillance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) Only members can download content from the bulletin board; a prospective member must post pornographic content to the site to access additional privileges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Investigators identified and captured content from numerous board posts throughout the autumn and early winter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) These posts included links to URLs\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   enabling members to view and download video files. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1/4/16 Appl. for \u00a7 2703(d) Order (\"1/4/16 Appl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 5-6, ECF No. 25-3; 12/7/15 Appl. for \u00a7 2703(d) Order (\"12/7/15 Appl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 5-6, ECF No. 25-1.) HSI agents working at the CEOS-HTIU in Washington, D.C. accessed the bulletin board in an undercover capacity, downloaded the suspect video files from the posts' URLs, and reviewed the files to confirm their illicit content. (Richardson Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 10-11; 12/7/15 Appl. \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The video files posted to the bulletin board were stored or \"hosted\" on servers maintained by a separate, cloud-based file sharing site (\"FSS\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Richardson Aff. \u00b6 12.) In the ordinary course of its business, the FSS maintains records about users who upload or download content to its servers, including the IP addresses of devices associated with such events.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16; 12/7/15 Appl. \u00b6 7.) The FSS maintains its operations and stores its data in Atlanta, Georgia. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   12/7/15 Appl. at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In early December, the Government applied to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202703\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) for an order compelling the FSS to produce its records for eleven URLs linking to video files depicting child pornography. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202703\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) A District of Columbia magistrate judge granted the application. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order 1, ECF No. 25-2.) The order required the FSS to disclose, among other records: (1) the IP address of any device that uploaded or downloaded content from the target URLs; and (2) the dates and times these files were uploaded or downloaded. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Attach. A.) The Government followed an identical investigative process to support an application for a \u00a7 2703(d) order for records related to eighteen more URLs on January 6, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   1/4/16 Appl.) The January application was also granted. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order 1, ECF No. 25-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The records produced in response to the orders revealed that two particular IP addresses downloaded or attempted to download the illicit content hosted by the FSS' servers on October 27, 2015 and December 31, 2015. (Richardson Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 17, 27.) Using publicly available search tools, the Government identified the internet service provider that controlled these IP addresses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18, 28.) The internet service provider, in response to Department of Justice subpoenas, disclosed that in both instances the IP address was assigned to a subscriber at Monroe's Warwick, Rhode Island residence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19, 29.) Government agents conducted further surveillance and investigated\n   the home's occupants, including Monroe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 10, 2016, the Government set forth the substance of these facts in an application for a search warrant for the Warwick residence. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Appl. for Search Warrant, ECF No. 25-5.) The application was submitted to and approved by a magistrate judge for the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Search &amp; Seizure Warrant, ECF No. 25-5.) Agents executed the search warrant two days later, uncovering the cache of child pornography. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aff. of James V. Richardson in Support of an Appl. for Cr. Compl. 2-3, ECF No. 1-2). Monroe made incriminating statements to government agents during a contemporaneous interview. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mem. &amp; Order 9-19, ECF No. 29 (denying motion to suppress statements made during interrogation in Monroe's home).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II.
