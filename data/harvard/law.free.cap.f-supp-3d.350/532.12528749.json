C. FELDMAN, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the Court is the plaintiffs' motion to remand. For the following reasons, the motion is DENIED, and Louisiana Citizens is DISMISSED without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This lawsuit arises out of the purchase and installation of alleged Chinese drywall in a residence located in New Orleans, Louisiana following Hurricane Katrina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In October of 2006, Cedric and Raquel Richmond purchased a residence located at 7021 Cove Drive in New Orleans that had sustained water damage during the storm. At the time of the purchase, the water-damaged drywall had been removed, but new drywall had not yet been installed. The following year, the property underwent renovations, including the installation of new drywall. Cedric Richmond, acting as general contractor, purchased approximately 180-190 sheets of drywall from Lowe's stores located in New Orleans. During the renovation process, Mr. Richmond secured a Builder's Risk insurance policy from Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, which expired in 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   About ten years later, when the Richmonds attempted to sell the property, a home inspector alerted them to the possibility that it contained \"Chinese drywall.\" In response, they retained Driskill Environmental Consultants, LLC to conduct another inspection. On June 14, 2017, Driskill inspected the residence and issued a report stating that there was \"extensive, advanced corrosion to copper ground wiring, copper pipe water supply lines, and the A/C evaporator coils.\" The report concluded that a majority of the drywall installed in the property was defective and that removal was required. At the time this report was issued, the property was insured by a Homeowners' Policy issued by Louisiana Citizens. The Richmonds later\n   determined that National Gypsum Services Company had manufactured the drywall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 14, 2018, the Richmonds, who are citizens of Louisiana, sued National Gypsum Services Company; Lowe's Home Center, Inc.; and Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Corporation in the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans, asserting redhibition and negligence claims against National Gypsum and Lowes's, a products liability claim against National Gypsum, and insurance coverage claims against Louisiana Citizens. In particular, the Richmonds' petition seeks compensation for the \"significant damages\" that the property has sustained and alleges that the defendants are liable for:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   sums paid ... by the Petitioners for the remediation of the subject Property; all expenses occasioned by the remediation of the subject Property; all expenses incurred by Petitioners with respect to maintenance, repair, and preservation of the subject Property since purchase of the drywall; interest on all payments made in connection with remediation of the subject Property; general and special damages arising out of the defective drywall; diminution in value of the subject Property due to the Chinese drywall; and all of Petitioners' attorney's fees incurred with respect to the investigation and pursuit of this action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The petition contains neither a prayer for a specific amount of monetary relief, nor a general allegation that the amount in controversy is below the threshold for federal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   National Gypsum timely removed the lawsuit to this Court on August 6, 2018; Lowe's consented, but Louisiana Citizens, a citizen of Louisiana, did not. The plaintiffs now move to remand the case on the ground that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because the jurisdictional amount in controversy requirement is not satisfied and they share Louisiana citizenship with Louisiana Citizens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The plaintiffs reveal in their motion to remand that they had entered into a contract to sell the property for $190,000 in April of 2017, which fell through after the discovery of the alleged defective drywall. They further relate that they eventually sold the property to another buyer in June of 2018 for $127,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, the Richmonds each attach an affidavit to their motion, stipulating that the amount in controversy does not exceed $75,000 and renouncing their right to recover in excess of this amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Although the plaintiff challenges removal in this case, the removing defendant carries the burden of showing the propriety of this Court's removal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manguno v.

Thereafter, he notes, the Louisiana Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the insurance company's application for a supervisory writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The plaintiffs emphasize that, because the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans (the court in which they filed their state court petition) is under the \"purview\" of the Louisiana Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, it is not bound to follow\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   (a Louisiana Fifth Circuit decision) or\n   <em>\n    In re Chinese Manufactured Drywall Prods. Liab. Litig.\n   </em>\n   (a federal district court decision). Moreover, the plaintiffs contend that the removing defendants cite no \"binding\" authority establishing that the plaintiffs are barred from recovering based on coverage exclusions in a homeowners' policy. The removing defendants counter that the plaintiffs' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Finger\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   is misplaced. The Court agrees and notes that decisions of a state trial court provide no precedential guidance to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   First, this Court, sitting in diversity, must interpret Louisiana law as would the Louisiana Supreme Court if faced with the same issue -- not as would a Louisiana trial court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Chinese Manufactured Drywall Prods.

Liab. Litig.\n   </em>\n   , that Court declined to follow the\n   <em>\n    Finger\n   </em>\n   court's holdings as to the \"faulty materials\" exclusion and the \"corrosion\" exclusion.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4177130\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/759/822/#p848\">\n    759 F.Supp.2d at 845-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As to the faulty materials exclusion, the\n   <em>\n    Finger\n   </em>\n   court held that because the drywall was intended to \"act as an aesthetic or 'finishing' material for a home,\" and there was no allegation that it was hung incorrectly, it did not constitute a faulty material under the policy. No. 09-8071,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%201222273\">\n    2010 WL 1222273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7-8 (La. Civ. D. Ct. Mar. 22, 2010). In refusing to follow\n   <em>\n    Finger\n   </em>\n   's approach, the\n   <em>\n    Drywall\n   </em>\n   Court noted that courts, not litigants, are tasked with interpreting the meaning of insurance policies, and \"\n   <em>\n    Finger\n   </em>\n   failed to provide an explanation as to how it came to define faulty materials, only citing conclusions reached in the plaintiff's own memorandum and testimony, and the testimony of the insurer's corporate representative.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Chinese Manufactured Drywall Prods. Liab. Litig\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4177130\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/759/822/#p848\">\n    759 F.Supp.2d at 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the Court looked to case law from other jurisdictions that addressed \"faulty materials\" exclusions in insurance policies; embracing a \"broad definition of faulty materials under common usage of a defect or imperfection in a physical thing,\" the Court concluded that the Chinese drywall was a \"faulty material\" under the policy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4177130\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/759/822/#p848\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4177130\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/759/822/#p848\">\n    at 845-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addition, the Court declined to follow\n   <em>\n    Finger\n   </em>\n   's holding as to the \"corrosion\" exclusion, instead concluding that this provision precludes coverage for damages caused by high sulfur content drywall.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4177130\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/759/822/#p848\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In so holding, the Court looked to\n   <em>\n    Central Louisiana Electric Co., Inc. v. Westinghouse Electric Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7529080\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/579/981/\">\n    579 So.2d 981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La. 1991) for guidance and reasoned that\n   <em>\n    Finger\n   </em>\n   's approach was inconsistent with \"what the Louisiana Supreme Court would do if faced with the corrosion exclusions at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 847.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Finally, as noted above, although this Court recognizes that the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans, in\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   , denied a homeowners' insurance company's motion for summary judgment in a Chinese drywall coverage dispute, it also finds that, in the absence of reasoning, the\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   judgment provides little guidance. Moreover, the Court notes that the Louisiana Fourth Circuit's subsequent denial of this insurance company's writ application informs no precedential value.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nabors Offshore Corp. v. Caterpillar Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 2016-0003 (La.

In reaching this conclusion, the Court emphasizes that the possibility of recovery must be \"reasonable,\" not merely theoretical.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smallwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1319446\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/568/#p573\">\n    385 F.3d at 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
