The Supreme Court of the United States of America -- in the course of approving the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit's use of the waiver rule -- noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-21\">\n   It does not appear that Congress intended to require district court review of a magistrate's factual or legal conclusions, under a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   or any other standard, when neither party objects to those findings. The House and Senate Reports accompanying the 1976 amendments do not expressly consider what sort of review the district court should perform when no party objects to the magistrate's report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 94-625, pp. 9-10 (1976)(hereafter Senate Report); H.R. Rep. No. 94-1609, p. 11 (1976), U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1976, p. 6162 (hereafter House Report). There is nothing in those Reports, however, that demonstrates an intent to require the district court to give any more consideration to the magistrate's report\n   than the court considers appropriate. Moreover, the Subcommittee that drafted and held hearings on the 1976 amendments had before it the guidelines of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts concerning the efficient use of magistrates. Those guidelines recommended to the district courts that \"[w]here a magistrate makes a finding or\n   <em>\n    ruling\n   </em>\n   on a motion or an issue, his determination should become that of the district court, unless specific objection is filed within a reasonable time.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jurisdiction of United States Magistrates, Hearings on S. 1283 before the Subcommittee on Improvements in Judicial Machinery of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 94th Cong., 1st Sess., 24 (1975)(emphasis added)(hereafter Senate Hearings). The Committee also heard Judge Metzner of the Southern District of New York, the chairman of a Judicial Conference Committee on the administration of the magistrate system, testify that he personally followed that practice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , at 11 (\"If any objections come in, ... I review [the record] and decide it. If no objections come in, I merely sign the magistrate's order.\"). The Judicial Conference of the United States, which supported the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard of review eventually incorporated in \u00a7 636(b)(1)(C), opined that in most instances no party would object to the magistrate's recommendation, and the litigation would terminate with the judge's adoption of the magistrate's report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Senate Hearings, at 35, 37. Congress apparently assumed, therefore, that any party who was dissatisfied for any reason with the magistrate's report would file objections, and those objections would trigger district court review. There is no indication that Congress, in enacting \u00a7 636(b)(1)(C), intended to require a district judge to review a magistrate's report to which no objections are filed. It did not preclude treating the failure to object as a procedural default, waiving the right to further consideration of any sort. We thus find nothing in the statute or the legislative history that convinces us that Congress intended to forbid a rule such as the one adopted by the Sixth Circuit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.
