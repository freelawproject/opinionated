ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The bulk of Duke's subpoenas were issued to obtain Ms. Qayumi's medical and educational records, which she did not produce in discovery. Her medical and education history were directly at issue in the case, and it was reasonable for Duke to obtain them by subpoena. Duke has presented evidence that the fees charged were reasonable and Ms. Qayumi has provided no evidence to the contrary. The Court finds that these fees were reasonable under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Because Duke's subpoenas were reasonable, the narrow legal issue before the Court is whether private process server fees are recoverable under \u00a7 1920(1), which provides that \"[f]ees of the clerk and marshal\" are taxable as costs. There is a longstanding circuit split on this issue,\n   <em>\n    Schwarz &amp; Schwarz of Va., LLC v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's\n   </em>\n   , No. 6:07-cv-00042,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%20452743\">\n    2010 WL 452743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (W.D. Va. Feb. 8, 2010) (collecting cases), and the Fourth Circuit has not expressed its view-even, as best the Court can tell, in an unpublished decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Eighth Circuit does not allow recovery of private process service fees as costs because \u00a7 1920 contains no provision for the taxation of those expenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fifth Circuit also disallows taxation of private service fees, unless exceptional circumstances require the use of a private server.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Second, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits read \u00a7 1920(1) and \u00a7 1921(a)(1)(B), which authorizes marshals to collect and courts to tax as costs fees for serving a subpoena or summons, together to mean that prevailing parties can recover private fees to the extent those fees do not exceed the marshal's fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Ninth Circuit\n   allows taxation of private service costs in the amount incurred and does not expressly limit recovery to the amount the marshal would have charged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Nor have the district courts sitting in the Fourth Circuit reached consensus on the issue. Putting aside those cases where such costs were allowed without discussion,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   the courts in this circuit remain divided.
