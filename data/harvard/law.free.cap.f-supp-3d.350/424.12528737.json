They filed this case seeking to compel Affinity's insurer, defendant StarStone Specialty Insurance Company, to defend and indemnify them in the\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   suit. Because the\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   claims did not arise out of the rendering or failure to render medical professional services, they are not covered by Affinity's policy with StarStone, and the Court will grant StarStone's motion for judgment on the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Affinity's policy with Homeland is the first line of defense,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 22-1 at 11, and the StarStone policy is an \"umbrella\" plan that applies only if the Homeland policy is exhausted on, or is inapplicable to, a covered claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 19-1 at 15, 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After Mr. Gugenheim filed suit, both Homeland and StarStone denied coverage.

Because Homeland, the primary carrier, denied coverage for the Gugenheim suit and the Court has agreed that the Homeland policy excludes coverage, the first condition has been satisfied.

No item on this list of examples has anything to do with billing, payment, insurance, Medicaid reimbursement, or any financial or business aspect of patient care; instead, each listed activity entails some aspect of looking after a patient. The only listed service not directly involved in patient care is \"committee activities for accreditation, quality assurance, peer review, and standards review,\" Doc. 19-1 at 33 (\u00a7 V(K) ), which is also unrelated to billing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Billing is different in kind from all of these activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   This plain reading of the policy language is supported by case law.
