Schroeder, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case originated as a challenge to North Carolina's Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20N.C.%20Sess.%20Laws%203\">\n    2016 N.C. Sess. Laws 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , commonly known as House Bill 2 (\"HB2\"), which required, among other things, that public agencies ensure that multiple occupancy restrooms, showers, and other similar facilities be \"designated for and only used by\" persons based on the \"biological sex\" listed on their birth certificate. That law was repealed during the pendency of this action, and Plaintiffs eventually filed a Fourth Amended Complaint (Doc. 210), claiming that the repealing law,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20N.C.%20Sess.%20Laws%204\">\n    2017 N.C. Sess. Laws 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , commonly known as House Bill 142 (\"HB142\"), violates their Fourteenth Amendment rights, as well as Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"Title IX\") and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"Title VII\") (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 35). In short, Plaintiffs, who include persons who identify as transgender, allege two principal forms of injury. First, they contend that they are injured by legal uncertainty as to which restrooms, showers, and changing facilities they are permitted to use. Second, they contend that they are injured both by HB142's preemption of attempts by any local government to \"enact or amend an ordinance regulating private employment practices or regulating public accommodations,\" HB142 \u00a7 3\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"Section 3\"); and also by HB142's prohibition of attempts by any state agency or political subdivision to \"regulat[e]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   ... access to multiple occupancy restrooms, showers, or changing facilities, except in accordance with an act of the General Assembly,\" HB142 \u00a7 2 (\"Section 2\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Before the court are motions to dismiss by Senator Phil Berger and Speaker Tim Moore (\"Intervenor-Defendants\"), proceeding in their official capacities as heads of the General Assembly's two chambers (Doc. 221), and by the University of North Carolina (\"UNC\") and its President, Margaret Spellings (together, the \"UNC Defendants\") (Doc. 222).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court held a hearing on the motions on June 25, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the court finds that Plaintiffs lack standing as to their substantive due process (Count 1), Title IX (Count 6), and Title VII (Count 7) claims based on alleged legal uncertainty caused by HB142, but do have standing to pursue their equal protection (Count 2) claims relating to the preemption provisions of Sections 2 and 3, except as to President Spellings. Further, the court declines to dismiss Plaintiffs' contingent claims involving HB2 (Counts 3, 4, and 5) at this time and reserves ruling on Plaintiffs' nominal damages (Counts 6 and 7) claims for alleged Title VII and IX violations during the time HB2 was in effect. As to Count 2, the court finds that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim based on Section 2, but succeed in stating a claim based on Section 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As a result, the UNC Defendants' motion to dismiss will be granted except as to Plaintiffs' contingent claims involving HB2 in Counts 3, 4, and 5, and as to Plaintiffs' claims for nominal damages in Counts 6 and 7 for the alleged Title VII and IX violations that occurred while HB2 was in effect. Intervenor-Defendants' motion to dismiss will be granted except as to Plaintiffs' equal protection claims based on Section 3 in Count 2, and as to Plaintiffs' contingent claims involving HB2 in Counts 3, 4, and 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The facts are found in the 403 numbered paragraphs of Plaintiffs' 103-page Fourth Amended Complaint, which is construed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, as well as those matters of which the court can take judicial notice. Considered together, they demonstrate the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. HB2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On February 22, 2016, the Charlotte City Council amended, by a vote of seven to four, its existing non-discrimination ordinances, making it unlawful to discriminate on the basis of \"marital status, familial status, sexual orientation, gender identity, [and] gender expression.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 127 at 12-13 (alteration in original);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 210 \u00b6 200.) The amendment also repealed prior rules that exempted \"[r]estrooms, shower rooms, bathhouses, and similar facilities which are in their nature distinctly private\" from the city's\n   prohibitions against sex discrimination. (Doc. 127 at 12 (alteration in original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Charlotte ordinance prompted a quick reaction from then-Governor Patrick McCrory and the General Assembly. Governor McCrory had informed the Charlotte City Council members before passage of the ordinance that the State would likely take immediate action upon the ordinance's passage, since it would \" 'chang[e] basic long-established values and norms' surrounding 'public restrooms' \" and present \"possible danger from deviant actions by individuals taking improper advantage of a bad policy.\" (Doc. 210 \u00b6 205.) On February 23, 2016, Speaker Moore announced that he and fellow Republicans would seek \"a legislative intervention to correct [the Charlotte City Council's] radical course.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 206.) On March 23, 2016, the General Assembly convened for a special session, during which members of the House Judiciary IV Committee - the committee that first considered HB2 - were allegedly given only minutes to read HB2 before voting on whether to send the bill back to the House for a full debate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 211-215.) After three hours of debate, the House passed HB2. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 216.) The bill proceeded to pass unanimously in the Senate, following a walk-out by all Democratic Senators. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 217.) Governor McCrory signed the bill into law later that day, and it became effective immediately. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 220.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   HB2 affected North Carolina law in several ways. First, it modified the State's non-discrimination laws. Previously, the State had prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, age, sex, and handicap.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HB2 \u00a7 3.1. Part III of HB2 modified this language to prohibit discrimination on the basis of \"biological sex,\" defined as \"[t]he physical condition of being male or female, which is stated on a person's birth certificate,\" rather than simply \"sex.\" HB2 \u00a7\u00a7 1.2-1.3, 3.1 (modifying\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20143-422.2\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 143-422.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). It also extended these non-discrimination provisions, which had previously applied only to the State, to private employers and places of public accommodation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20143-422.2\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 3.1-3.3. Part III also precluded state common-law causes of action for violations of those non-discrimination provisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20143-422.2\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Second, Parts II and III of HB2 preempted all local ordinances that conflicted with the new non-discrimination standards, including the Charlotte ordinance that prompted HB2's passage.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20143-422.2\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 2.1-3.3. Third, Part I of HB2 explicitly set new rules for the use of restrooms and changing facilities operated by state agencies. Specifically, Part I provided that all public agencies, including local boards of public education, must \"require\" that \"every multiple occupancy bathroom or changing facility ... be designated for and only used by persons based on their biological sex,\" defined as the \"physical condition of being male or female, which is stated on a person's birth certificate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20143-422.2\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1.2-1.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Before HB2 was passed, Plaintiffs maintained, transgender individuals used the bathrooms they believed aligned with their gender identity without apparent fear of prosecution under state law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 103 at 20-21, (noting that \"the status quo was working for transgender people in that they could make these judgments [about which bathrooms to use]\"), and at 70 (Governor's counsel speculating same).) Under Part I of HB2, North Carolina law explicitly regulated which bathrooms were available for use by transgender individuals - the bathrooms that matched the gender listed on their birth certificates. HB2 \u00a7 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs filed this action on March 28, 2016. (Doc. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Preliminary Injunction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On May 16, 2016, Plaintiffs moved to preliminarily enjoin Defendants from enforcing Part I of HB2, the so-called \"bathroom\" provisions. (Doc. 21.) After a hearing, the court issued an 83-page decision on August 26, 2016, granting the motion as to three individual Plaintiffs employed by UNC. (Doc. 127). In doing so, the court noted that for \"transgender individuals who used facilities that did not match the sex listed on their birth certificate[s],\" HB2 foreclosed any argument that they believed they had permission to enter facilities that matched their gender identity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.) The court found that the three individual Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their Title IX claim because the Department of Education (\"DOE\") had issued guidance that \"sex\" under Title IX included gender identity such that covered institutions must treat transgender individuals consistent with their gender identity, which the Fourth Circuit held in\n   <em>\n    G.G. ex rel.

(Doc. 127 at 45.) The court also found that Plaintiffs had not shown that they were likely to succeed on their equal protection claim and reserved ruling on their due process claims. (Doc. 127 at 59-60, 79-81.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs subsequently filed a Second Amended Complaint on September 21, 2016, (Doc. 151) and a Third Amended Complaint on November 21, 2016 (Doc. 183).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In 2017, the DOE withdrew its interpretative guidance, which led the Supreme Court to vacate the Fourth Circuit's judgment in\n   <em>\n    G.G.\n   </em>\n   and remand the case for further consideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gloucester Cty.

HB142\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As part of an apparent compromise to secure the repeal of HB2, the Charlotte City Council repealed its non-discrimination ordinance on December 21, 2016,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   shortly before the General Assembly met in special session to consider the repeal of HB2. (Doc. 210 \u00b6\u00b6 227-33.) During this special session, a bill which would have been a \"clean repeal\" of HB2 - repealing HB2 with no further conditions - was introduced but was referred to a committee and never considered. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 235.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On March 30, 2017, HB142 was passed and signed by Governor Roy Cooper, who had been elected the prior November. (Doc. 210 \u00b6\u00b6 224, 244.) In order to pass the bill quickly, the Senate employed a process known as \"gut and amend,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and neither\n   the full House nor the full Senate heard public comment before voting on HB142.

Section 2 amends Chapter 142 of the North Carolina General Statutes by adding a new article, Article 81A, \u00a7 143-760, which reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   State agencies, boards, offices, departments, institutions, branches of government, including The University of North Carolina and the North Carolina Community College System, and political subdivisions of the State, including local boards of education, are preempted from regulation of access to multiple occupancy restrooms, showers, or changing facilities, except in accordance with an act of the General Assembly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%209882602\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2.

(Doc. 208.) The motion was granted (Doc. 209), and Plaintiffs filed their Fourth Amended Complaint on September 7, 2017. (Doc. 210.) The Fourth Amended Complaint asserts that HB142 \"is the culmination of a series of actions by North Carolina lawmakers targeting LGBT individuals, and particularly transgender individuals, for discrimination\" and alleges that HB142 \"violates fundamental guarantees of equal protection and due process in the U.S. Constitution and statutory prohibitions on discrimination based on sex under Title IX and Title VII.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Specifically, Count 1 brings a substantive due process claim against Governor Cooper, Attorney General Joshua Stein, Department of Administration Secretary Michelle Sanders, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Mandy K. Cohen, Department of Transportation Secretary James H. Trogdon (each sued in their official capacity; hereinafter the \"Executive Branch Defendants\") and Spellings, claiming that (1) HB142 is void for vagueness because it does not inform transgender individuals whether they will be subject to prosecution for using the restrooms or facilities that align with their gender identity and (2) that these Defendants have taken no action to clarify whether transgender individuals will be subject to prosecution for using the restrooms or facilities that align with their gender identity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 297-312.) Count 2 brings an equal protection claim against the Executive Branch Defendants and Spellings, claiming that the preemption of state agencies regulating access to restrooms or other single-sex, multiple user facilities, as well as the preemption of new or amended local non-discrimination protections, constitute discrimination on the basis of sex because these preemptions deprive transgender individuals of the ability to seek greater protections at the local level on the same basis as other groups, are being applied in a discriminatory manner, and were passed with discriminatory intent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 313-44.) Counts 3, 4, and 5 challenge HB2, alleging violations of equal protection, the right to privacy, and liberty and autonomy in the right to refuse unwanted medical treatment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 345-90.) Count 6 brings a Title IX claim against UNC, claiming that UNC is a recipient of federal funds and that it is discriminating\n   on the basis of sex by failing to ensure that transgender individuals may use restrooms and changing facilities consistent with their gender identity without fear of prosecution. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 391-98.) Count 7 brings a Title VII claim against UNC on behalf of Plaintiff Joaqu\u00edn Carca\u00f1o - a transgender man - claiming that UNC employs him and that it is discriminating against him on the basis of sex, as described in Count 6. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 399-403.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On October 18, 2017, Plaintiffs and Executive Branch Defendants filed a joint motion for the entry of a consent decree. (Doc. 216.) The proposed consent decree states that \"[u]nder H.B. 142, and with respect to public facilities that are subject to Executive Branch Defendants' control or supervision, transgender people are not prevented from the use of public facilities in accordance with their gender identity\" and that \"Executive Branch Defendants as used in this paragraph shall include their successors, officers, and employees.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) Further, the proposed consent decree states the Executive Branch Defendants \"are hereby permanently enjoined from enforcing Section 2 of H.B. 142 to bar, prohibit, block, deter, or impede any transgender individuals from using public facilities under any Executive Branch Defendant's control or supervision, in accordance with the transgender individual's gender identity\" and that an individual who uses a public facility under the control of the Executive Branch cannot be prosecuted for the otherwise lawful use of the facility that conforms with the individual's gender identity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Lastly, the proposed consent decree states that the parties shall \"bear their own fees, expenses, and costs with respect to all claims raised by Plaintiffs against the Executive Branch Defendants\" and stipulates to the dismissal of the remaining claims against the Executive Branch Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On October 23, 2017, Intervenor-Defendants\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the UNC Defendants filed separate motions to dismiss. (Docs. 221, 222.)

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The court will first address the motion for leave to file the declaration of Ericka Myers, as Plaintiffs claim that the court should consider that declaration in connection with the motions to dismiss.

Motion for Leave to File Declaration of Ericka Myers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In her declaration, Myers states that her eight year-old daughter is transgender, in that \"she was assigned the sex male at birth,\" but \"she has known from a young age that she is a girl.\" (Doc. 237-1\n   \u00b6 4.) Myers explains that her daughter has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that her treatment includes living all aspects of her life as a female. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.) However, her daughter's elementary school, in the New Hanover County School District in North Carolina, bars her daughter from using the girls' restroom because she is transgender. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 7.) According to Myers, the school's principal has explained that this is because she believes that HB142 makes it illegal for a transgender student to use a restroom that does not match her birth-assigned sex - or at least that HB142 \"permits schools\" to deny such use. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) While Myers' daughter has been told that she can \"use the nurse's restroom or the restroom in the teacher's lounge,\" she has declined to \"use either of these restrooms because she feels humiliated and singled out as different when she is the only student forced to use them.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) As a result, and because boys in the boy's restroom have told her to \"get out because she is in the wrong place,\" her daughter has \"struggled to be recognized as her true self,\" \"often holds her urine throughout the school day, and uses the restroom as soon as she gets home.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the court can consider the Myers declaration in resolving the pending motions to dismiss because \"[w]hen standing is raised as a basis to dismiss, the court 'may consider evidence outside the pleadings without converting the proceeding to one for summary judgment.' \" (Doc. 237 at 4 (quoting\n   <em>\n    White Tail Park, Inc. v.

Sept. 27, 2011) (\"Fourth Circuit authority ... appears to permit the use of such affidavits ....\"). Plaintiffs argue that the Myers declaration provides additional evidence that HB142 causes injury. (Doc. 237 at 5-6.) They also point out that no Defendant actually opposes the request for leave to file the declaration, but instead argue only that the court should not consider the declaration when ruling on the motions to dismiss and that the declaration does not support Plaintiffs' standing claims. (Doc. 242 at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The UNC Defendants \"do not oppose the filing of the declaration, but do oppose Plaintiffs' request that the Court consider [the] declaration when ruling\" on their motion to dismiss. (Doc. 240 at 1.) They argue that extrinsic evidence, such as that presented in the Myers declaration, is not relevant to their motion to dismiss, as \"[t]he question before the Court is ... the adequacy of the allegations in the Complaint.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) This is because the UNC Defendants claim to have brought a facial challenge to standing only, and \"[a] court may 'look beyond the complaint'\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   '[i]n a factual challenge.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wikimedia Found. v.

They further argue that the Myers declaration is \"immaterial because it recounts events that occurred after the filing of the complaint\" and otherwise has no connection to the UNC Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Intervenor-Defendants argue that the Myers declaration would not help the court in determining standing because the harm described in the declaration is caused by the officials in the New Hanover School District, rather than by any Defendant in this case. (Doc. 241 at 3.) They also contend that \"the mere fact that certain school officials not before the Court may have mistakenly identified HB 142 as a basis for their restroom policy cannot establish that HB 142 legally caused the alleged harms, nor that a favorable decision in this case would redress those harms.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Fourth Circuit recently explained the distinction between facial and factual challenges to standing as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   In a facial challenge, the defendant contends that the complaint fails to allege facts upon which standing can be based, and the plaintiff is afforded the same procedural protection that exists on a motion to dismiss. In a factual challenge, the defendant contends that the jurisdictional allegations of the complaint are not true. In that event, a trial court may look beyond the complaint and in an evidentiary hearing determine if there are facts to support the jurisdictional allegations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Wikimedia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276507\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/193/#p208\">\n    857 F.3d at 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations, internal quotation marks, and alterations omitted). In a facial challenge, accordingly, where the plaintiff receives the presumption that all facts alleged in the complaint are true, the sole question before the court is whether \"\n   <em>\n    the complaint\n   </em>\n   alleges sufficient facts to invoke subject matter jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Kerns v.

It is only in an evidentiary hearing for a factual challenge, where \"the presumption of truthfulness normally accorded a complaint's allegations does not apply,\" that \"the trial court [has] the discretion to go beyond the allegations of the complaint ...

Since HB142 has no enforcement mechanism - and indeed does not prohibit any possible course of conduct on the part of Plaintiffs - Plaintiffs rely on a theory of injury wherein HB142's preemption of regulation of restroom access \"except in accordance with an act of the General Assembly,\" along with the fact that there is no applicable act of the General Assembly affirmatively permitting access, \"creat[es] a permanent state of legal uncertainty\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 312) that makes it impossible for transgender individuals to determine whether they will be prosecuted under\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   statutes, such as North Carolina's second-degree trespass law (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 302-12);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2014-159.13\">\n    N.C.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 127 at 25-27 (\"Although UNC has not changed the words and symbols on its sex-segregated facilities, the meaning of those words and symbols has changed as a result of [HB2].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2014-159.13\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2014-159.13\">\n    at 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .).) Under HB2, multiple occupancy bathrooms were required to be designated for use only by persons of the same \"biological sex,\" where that term was defined as \"[t]he physical condition of being male or female, which is stated on a person's birth certificate,\" HB2 \u00a7\u00a7 1.2-1.3. But HB2 has been repealed. Its replacement, HB142, requires nothing of the kind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Indeed, HB142 returns Plaintiffs to the status quo ante - the very position that, until now, they have consistently asserted to be their preferred remedy in this case. (Doc. 103 at 6-8, 20 (stating at preliminary injunction hearing that \"[t]here was no record prior to the passage of [HB2] of problems being caused in North Carolina ... by transgender people using restrooms and changing facilities consistent with their gender identity,\" that \"the status quo was fine,\" and that \"[t]he status quo was working for transgender people in that they ... could use common sense\" about which restrooms to use).) Plaintiffs' repeated assertions along these lines also accord with their inability to cite a single case in North Carolina of a transgender individual being prosecuted for using the restroom that corresponded to his or her gender identity, despite the fact that at least \"some transgender individuals have been quietly using bathrooms and other facilities that match their gender identity\" for years. (Doc. 127 at 3.) Given that HB142 repealed HB2 and its biological-access language, the status quo that the Plaintiffs requested - at least insofar as it relates to state and local interpretation of legal access to gender-specific restrooms - has been restored. The relief sought by Plaintiffs earlier in this litigation cannot now transform into an injury in fact that gives rise to standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In response, Plaintiffs argue that as a result of the series of events giving rise to (and including) this litigation, there is a heightened political animosity towards transgender individuals regarding their access to bathrooms, such that the likelihood of the State's trespass laws being used against them has increased. Along these lines, Plaintiffs point to statements of certain legislators and politicians who have claimed that the State's trespass laws prohibit transgender access to restrooms not matching one's biological sex. (Doc. 210 \u00b6\u00b6 74, 246.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   What this argument attempts to do, however, is graft Plaintiffs' fears about the State's enforcement of its trespass laws onto HB142. As an initial matter, it is far from clear that such a threat is sufficiently imminent. As noted above, Governor Cooper has represented the opposite conclusion (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.), and he, the Attorney General, and the rest of the Executive Branch Defendants are urging the entry of a consent decree in this action that would expressly and permanently preclude their prosecution of a transgender individual for \"us[ing] public facilities ... when such use conforms with the individual's gender identity,\n   and is otherwise lawful.\" (Doc. 216-1 at 5 (also requesting that it be ordered and adjudged that \"[u]nder H.B. 142, and with respect to public facilities that are subject to Executive Branch Defendants' control or supervision, transgender people are not prevented from the use of public facilities in accordance with their gender identity\").) In addition, and independent of any consent decree request, the Governor has already issued an Executive Order providing - among other protections - that \"State agencies, boards, commissions, and departments under the jurisdiction of the Office of the Governor will not adopt policies or regulations barring, prohibiting, blocking, deterring, or impeding any individual who lawfully uses public facilities under their control or supervision, in accordance with that individual's gender identity.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   N.C.

If Plaintiffs fear that\n   <em>\n    some other law\n   </em>\n   will be enforced against them unconstitutionally, their remedy is to challenge that law - either facially or as applied to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In addition, as to their constitutional claims, Plaintiffs fail to show that any alleged uncertainty injury - i.e., the potential enforcement of some other law against them - could be redressed by a favorable decision of this court. As it pertains to those claims, the Fourth Amended Complaint simply pleads for this court to strike down HB142 and/or find it unenforceable against Plaintiffs. Even if the court granted this relief in full, it would not redress Plaintiffs' stated fears about the application of state trespass laws against them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   For all these reasons, therefore, the court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to plausibly allege an injury in fact fairly traceable to an act of any Defendant that is capable of being redressed by a favorable decision of this court in this case. Plaintiffs' constitutional claims based on a theory of legal uncertainty must therefore be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plaintiffs' Title IX (Count 6) and Title VII (Count 7) claims against UNC are similarly based on the theory that Plaintiffs are harmed by UNC's failure to take action to ensure that Plaintiffs may use restrooms and changing facilities consistent with their gender identity. (Doc. 210 \u00b6\u00b6 395-98, 403.) Having found that this alleged uncertainty does not create an injury in fact, the court finds that UNC has not harmed Plaintiffs by refusing to take the affirmative step of informing Plaintiffs that they will not be subject to prosecution for using the restroom that aligns with their gender identity. This conclusion is bolstered by representations by UNC Defendants' counsel at the motion hearing that they consider themselves preempted by HB142 from regulating individuals' access to restrooms consistent with their gender identity. As a result, Plaintiffs' Title IX and Title VII claims will also be dismissed for lack of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Injury by Preemption of Non-Discrimination Policies and Ordinances\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Plaintiffs' second claim of injury is that they are harmed by HB142's Section 2, which preempts regulation concerning access\n   to restrooms and other facilities by state agencies, departments, and other political subdivisions of the State of North Carolina, as well as by Section 3's preemption of new or amended local government ordinances regulating access to public accommodations and private employment practices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 313-44.) Plaintiffs argue that these barriers prevent transgender individuals from being able to access the legislative process and petition their local governments, as well as school boards, universities, and other branches of government, for non-discrimination protections. (Doc. 233 at 20-21.) They argue that these barriers are themselves injuries in fact. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20 (\"Encountering the barrier is the injury that confers standing.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Intervenor-Defendants argue that Plaintiffs still have the right to advocate for their preferred policies at the state level under HB142, even if they will not be able to affect policy change at the local level, and that HB142 does not create an unequal barrier for Plaintiffs because anyone trying to enact a policy regulating private employment practices or public accommodations, or attempting to persuade a state agency to regulate access to restrooms, will face the same barriers Plaintiffs face. (Doc. 234 at 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The UNC Defendants argue that HB142 - and thus the barriers about which Plaintiffs complain - is not traceable to them because the \"University and President Spellings neither drafted, proposed, voted on, passed, enacted, signed, nor ratified HB 142. Nor do they have the legal power to 'clarify' it.\" (Doc. 223 at 10.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Generally, if a plaintiff can demonstrate that he or she has the intention to take a particular lawful action that \"has been thwarted by official action\" that was discriminatory, that plaintiff has demonstrated an injury in fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vill. of Arlington Heights v.

First, Plaintiffs claim that, if not for HB142's prohibition on local anti-discrimination ordinances and regulations, they \"would advocate for local\n   ordinances that prohibit discrimination in employment and public accommodations based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\" (Doc. 210 \u00b6\u00b6 83, 121, 156, 170, 192.) Second - although they need not show this in order to adequately demonstrate standing - Plaintiffs have claimed that at least some of the localities where they reside (specifically, Carrboro, Chapel Hill, and Orange County) would pass ordinances that \"prohibit discrimination in employment and public accommodations on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity\" if they were permitted to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 81, 170, 190.) Finally, Plaintiffs allege that HB142 discriminates against them on the basis of their transgender status. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 278.) Just as a plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Arlington Heights\n   </em>\n   demonstrated an injury in fact by asserting that his attempt to find housing closer to his employment was thwarted by discriminatory official action, Plaintiffs here assert that HB142 has thwarted their attempts to lobby for, and receive the benefits of, protective ordinances or regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/252/#p264\">\n    429 U.S. at 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/252/#p264\">\n    97 S.Ct. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While HB142 does not prohibit Plaintiffs' efforts at advocacy, it plainly makes them meaningless by prohibiting even the prospect of relief at the local level.

(Doc. 233 at 40, 43.) Plaintiffs argue that Section 3 has a disparate impact on transgender individuals because it prevents the passage of local ordinances that would protect transgender individuals from discrimination. (Doc. 233 at 40-43.) They argue that this preemption has a disparate impact because pre-existing ordinances prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, or any other ground continue to be valid.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43-44.) Plaintiffs then argue that HB142 was passed with discriminatory intent because: (1) it follows, and cannot be considered without reference to, HB2, which was passed in response to Charlotte's adoption of an anti-discrimination ordinance protecting transgender individuals; (2) statements from certain North Carolina legislators demonstrate that HB142 was not intended to repeal HB2's prohibition on transgender individuals' restroom use in accordance with their gender identity; (3) HB142 was introduced, debated, passed, and signed within a single day, which departs from the normal procedural sequence and \"signals discriminatory intent;\" and (4) it has a disproportionate impact on transgender individuals.

Plaintiffs' argument as to Section 2 centers on the theory that providing \"separate 'men's' and 'women's' restrooms\" by \"maintaining or posting [gender-specific] signs\" constitutes regulation of bathroom access, and therefore that transgender individuals are being treated unequally when entities like UNC disclaim the ability to regulate bathroom access as to transgender individuals. (Doc. 233 at 8 n.1, 38, 43.) But while Plaintiffs are correct that Section 2 prevents state entities like UNC from regulating access to restrooms, the court is unpersuaded that the mere provision of separate male and female facilities\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   regulation of restroom access, in the relevant sense. As the UNC Defendants point out, a regulation is an authoritative rule with the force of law, and \"[o]ne would not normally describe a [gender-specific] sign outside a bathroom\" as meeting this description. (Doc. 235.) Although gender-specific bathroom signs might properly have been considered to have the force of law under HB2, which specifically gave legal import to such signs (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 127 at 26 (\"[T]he meaning of those words and symbols [outside bathrooms] has changed as a result of [HB2].\") ), HB2 has been repealed in full. Its replacement, HB142, imbues gender-specific bathroom signs with no such legal import. And Plaintiffs do not point to any institutional rule or policy on the part of UNC or any other state entity that purports to assign legal import to gender-specific bathroom signs. Plaintiffs' argument also contradicts Plaintiffs' admission that they do not challenge the historical convention of using \"men's\" and \"women's\" labels for such facilities. As a result, despite Plaintiffs' claims to the contrary, it does not appear that state entities like UNC are \"regulating\" access to restrooms at all, much less regulating that access in a way that impacts Plaintiffs disparately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Further, as outlined earlier in this opinion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Part II.B.1., it is not a harm to Plaintiffs that they lack an affirmative statement from the UNC Defendants that Plaintiffs are permitted to use the restrooms and facilities that align with their gender identity. Nothing in the language of Section 2 can be construed to prevent transgender individuals from using the restrooms that align with their gender identity, as Plaintiffs claim some had apparently been doing successfully prior to the passage of HB2. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 127 at 3, 11 (noting that the record showed that, prior to the passage of HB2, \"transgender individuals ha[d] been quietly using facilities corresponding with their gender identity\"); Doc. 103 at 70 (Governor's counsel stating, \"my guess is that some transgender individuals will continue to use bathrooms that they always used and nobody will know\").) In addition, the UNC Defendants stated at the motion hearing that they are preempted from forbidding transgender individuals from using the restrooms that are consistent with their gender identity. Because Plaintiffs have not shown that Section 2 disparately impacts them, their equal protection claim against Section 2 fails.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076266\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/239/648/#p654\">\n    239 F.3d at 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"To succeed on an equal protection claim, a plaintiff must first demonstrate\n   that he has been treated differently from others with whom he is similarly situated.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   However, the court does find that Plaintiffs have plausibly pleaded that the preemption of new or amended local \"ordinance[s] regulating private employment practices or regulating public accommodations\" in Section 3 impacts them disproportionately. Just like Section 2, Section 3 is facially neutral. Further, as Intervenor-Defendants point out, it appears that the State normally has the authority to centralize its decision-making powers by withholding the power to make certain decisions from local governments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Town of Boone v.

This is because protective statutes and ordinances that preexist HB142 - such as Charlotte's ordinance prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex - continue to be valid. Thus, Plaintiffs plausibly allege they lack the protections that individuals in other vulnerable groups enjoy.

As a result, Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the foreclosure of new or amended local non-discrimination ordinances relating to public accommodations impacts them disparately.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11316380\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/385/#p391\">\n    393 U.S. at 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11316380\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/385/#p391\">\n    89 S.Ct. 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A]lthough the law on its face treats Negro and white, Jew and gentile in an identical manner, the reality is that the law's impact falls on the minority.

Plaintiffs allege that HB2 was passed in response to the Charlotte ordinance that granted anti-discrimination protections to transgender individuals (Doc. 127 at 13) which is some evidence that it - and now HB142, which similarly precludes Charlotte-style ordinances - was motivated, at least in part, by discriminatory intent.

Nor do Intervenor-Defendants offer any possible governmental purpose for HB142's preemption provisions in their briefing, noting only that the law is the result of \"a complex bipartisan compromise.\" (Doc. 234 at 3 n.1.) It is in fact Plaintiffs who hint at the most plausible purpose for HB142's preemption provisions: that they are intended to prevent an uneven patchwork of anti-discrimination laws across the State, in order to head off the sort of uproar that led to - and followed - the passage of HB2. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   210 \u00b6 331.) To this notion, Plaintiffs respond:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   [T]he government cannot assert an interest in consistent statewide obligations given that (1) H.B. 142 in fact leaves in place local government non-discrimination ordinances that were enacted prior to the passage of H.B. 2 ... and cities have announced their intent to continue enforcing them; (2) H.B. 142 does not preempt local governments, school boards, universities, or other state agencies or branches of government from enacting non-discrimination rules or regulations with regard to their own employees or students, or with respect to the services they provide to citizens; (3) H.B. 142's \"preemption\" is specified to end in December 2020. In addition, there is no greater need for state-wide uniformity with respect to antidiscrimination laws than there is with respect to numerous other laws as to which North Carolina does not prohibit local regulation and as to which there are significant differences in regulations of conduct among different parts of the state ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As a result, Plaintiffs argue, any governmental purpose for HB142's preemption provisions resting on statewide uniformity can only be a \"pretext\" for the same sort of discrimination that was more explicit in HB2. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Given the lack of briefing from Defendants on this issue, the lack of any clearly stated purpose for the law, the plausible arguments made by Plaintiffs in opposition to the conceivable purpose of statewide uniformity, and the standard of review at this early pleading stage, the court finds that - while the question is a close one - Plaintiffs have \"allege[d] facts sufficient to overcome the presumption of rationality\" as to Section 3 at this time.\n   <em>\n    Giarratano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3737132\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/521/298/#p303\">\n    521 F.3d at 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wroblewski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10521660\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/965/452/#p459\">\n    965 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   460 );\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mary's House, Inc. v.

Nominal Damages Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs allege that, regardless of the outcome of their claims against HB142, they have claims for nominal damages against the UNC Defendants for \"violations of their Title IX and Title VII rights ... that occurred while HB2 was in force.\" (Doc. 233 at 11 n.3.) In their brief, Plaintiffs relegate this claim to a footnote and decline to make any argument or cite any cases in support of their position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The complaint is no more illuminating. (Doc. 210 \u00b6\u00b6 18, 391-403.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The UNC Defendants contend that under Titles VII and IX, a defendant can be liable only for its own conduct, or the conduct of its agents. (Doc. 223 at 29.) They note that, under this principle, Plaintiffs may not \"seek damages from the University 'for the harms caused by H.B. 2's violation of' \" Titles IX and VII because the UNC Defendants played no part in the enactment of HB2 and because Plaintiffs' Fourth Amended Complaint does \"not suggest that the University in fact enforced HB 2 against any of [the Plaintiffs].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting Doc. 210 \u00b6 18).) The UNC Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that any adherence to HB2 would have violated Titles IX and VII, as both statutes permit the maintenance of separate bathrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities on the basis of sex. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The briefing on these claims is wholly inadequate for proper resolution.
