McCarthy (Dkt. 33) which concluded that the search warrant for Defendant's residence lacked probable cause, but nonetheless denied Defendant's motion to suppress (Dkt. 21) based upon the good faith standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Leon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/\">\n    468 U.S. 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/\">\n    82 L.Ed.2d 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). This Court has conducted, as it must, a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the suppression motion. Because the officers executing the search of Defendant's residence reasonably relied on the search warrant in good faith, this Court denies Defendant's motion to suppress and does not reach the issue of whether the warrant was supported by probable cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ganias\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323719\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/199/#p209\">\n    824 F.3d 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 209 (2d Cir. 2016) (\"Because we conclude that the agents acted in good faith, we need not decide whether a Fourth Amendment violation occurred.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant was initially charged by way of criminal complaint on January 19, 2018, with possession with intent to distribute cocaine and marijuana; possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime; and possession of defaced firearms, all stemming from a search by law enforcement that occurred on December 12, 2017. (Dkt. 1). A grand jury returned an Indictment on April 4, 2018, charging Defendant with nine counts of firearms and drug trafficking crimes. (Dkt. 12). The undersigned referred the case to Judge McCarthy for all pre-trial matters pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A) and (B). (Dkt. 14). On June 4, 2018, Defendant filed pretrial motions, including a motion to suppress evidence recovered from the search of his residence on December 12, 2017. (Dkt. 21). Judge McCarthy held oral argument on the motions on July 16, 2018 (Dkt. 26) and directed the parties to provide additional materials relevant to Defendant's motion to suppress, including the opportunity to review audio recordings of a confidential informant and an affidavit from Defendant relating to his expectation of privacy in the search location (1364 Pierce Avenue, upper apartment). (Dkt. 27). Judge McCarthy further directed the Government to provide an unredacted transcript of\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   testimony supporting the search warrant, and to provide Defendant with a redacted version, or an explanation as to why it believed it was unable to provide this information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 21, 2018, Judge McCarthy issued a Report and Recommendation concluding, among other things, that Defendant's motion to suppress should be denied. (Dkt. 33). Judge McCarthy found that while the search warrant lacked probable cause for the search of Defendant's residence at 1364 Pierce Avenue (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-6), the search was valid pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   good faith exception, in that the affidavit was not \"so lacking in probable cause for the search of the residence so as to render reliance upon it unreasonable\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Both the Government and Defendant have filed objections and responses to Judge McCarthy's Report and Recommendation. (Dkt. 34; Dkt. 36; Dkt. 40; Dkt. 41). The Government objects to Judge McCarthy's finding that the search warrant lacked probable cause. (Dkt. 34). In the alternative, the Government contends that should the Court agree with Judge McCarthy's conclusion that the search warrant lacked probable cause, the Court should adopt Judge McCarthy's recommendation that the\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   good faith exception applies. (Dkt. 41). Defendant objects to Judge McCarthy's finding that the\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   good faith exception applies and argues that the evidence must be suppressed. (Dkt. 36; Dkt. 40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant's motion to suppress stems from a search warrant executed at his residence, located at 1364 Pierce Avenue, upper apartment, in Niagara Falls, New York. (Dkt. 29). The search warrant authorized the search of three locations for evidence of drug trafficking: (1) Defendant's person; (2) Defendant's residence at 1364 Pierce Avenue; and (3) a 2006 black Land Rover Range Rover, which law enforcement had observed Defendant operating and which was involved in at least two controlled purchases of narcotics. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-3). Acting New York State Supreme Court Justice Richard C. Kloch, Sr. signed the search warrant on December 6, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). In addition to the information contained in the search warrant affidavit, Justice Kloch also received\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   testimony relevant to the search warrant application. (Dkt. 33 at 5). This\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   testimony is not referenced by or incorporated into the search warrant or its application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 29). As a result, in his Report and Recommendation, Judge McCarthy determined that the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   testimony could not be considered in connection with any probable cause review (Dkt. 33 at 5), and the Government does not object to Judge McCarthy's ruling on that issue. (Dkt. 34 at 2 n.1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Rosa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052478\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/626/56/#p64\">\n    626 F.3d 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 64 (2d Cir. 2010) (holding the court may not \"rely on unincorporated, unattached supporting documents to cure an otherwise defective search warrant\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The basic facts contained in the search warrant application are as follows. Utilizing a confidential informant, law enforcement engaged in three controlled purchases of narcotics over the months of October, November, and December 2017. (Dkt. 29 at 3-4). During the first controlled purchase in October 2017, law enforcement observed the confidential informant at the purchase location, where he/she entered a black Range Rover operated by Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). After a short time, the confidential informant exited the vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Following the controlled purchase, the confidential informant turned over to law enforcement a knotted plastic bag containing a quantity of white powder that the confidential informant stated he/she had purchased from Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ), A portion of the white powder substance field-tested positive for the presence of cocaine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During the second controlled purchase in November 2017, law enforcement observed \"a black male\" exit the residence at 1364 Pierce Avenue, enter a black Range Rover, and proceed directly to the location of the controlled purchase. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ), At the purchase location, the confidential informant entered the black Range Rover and a short time later, exited the vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Following the controlled purchase, the confidential informant turned over to law enforcement a knotted plastic bag containing a quantity of white powder that the confidential informant stated he/she had purchased from Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). A portion of the white powder substance field-tested positive for the presence of cocaine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During the third controlled purchase in December 2017, law enforcement observed the confidential informant at the purchase location, where he/she entered the passenger side of a silver Jeep. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). After a short time, the confidential informant exited the vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Following the controlled purchase, the confidential informant turned over to law enforcement a knotted plastic bag containing a quantity of white powder that the confidential informant stated he/she had purchased from Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). A portion of the white powder substance field-tested positive for the presence of cocaine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The search warrant concludes by requesting authorization to search Defendant, his vehicle, and his residence at 1364 Pierce Avenue for cocaine, as well as items which tend to show the possession, storage and sale of cocaine, including money, cellphones, written articles, papers, and ledgers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A December 12, 2017 search of 1364 Pierce Avenue resulted in the seizure of evidence of drug trafficking and firearms crimes. (Dkt. 21 at 25 \u00b6 7; Dkt. 34 at 3). Defendant argues that this evidence should be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Probable Cause for the Search Warrant\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Fourth Amendment guarantees \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\" U.S. Const. amend.

Specifically, the Government cites to the following facts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (1) the defendant was the listed owner of the premise[s] in public records; (2) surveillance of the defendant traveling directly from the premise[s] to a controlled buy; (3) the vehicle used by the defendant to conduct two of the controlled buys was seen parked at the premise[s] during both day and evening hours; and (4) the registered owner of the target vehicle had furniture delivered to the premise[s].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7). The Government contends that while the \"most significant fact bearing on the nexus requirement is the November 2017 controlled buy when [Defendant] was surveilled leaving the premise[s], entering the target Range Rover vehicle, and traveling directly to the location where the transaction took place,\" the Report and Recommendation ignored the natural and reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the additional facts presented to Justice Kloch, including the close association of the Range Rover involved in the controlled buys that was owned by a woman apparently residing with Defendant at the Pierce Avenue residence.

A number of the facts relied on by the Government are plainly relevant to the showing that Defendant lived at 1364 Pierce Avenue-but they do not necessarily establish probable cause to believe that evidence of drug trafficking would be found there.

There is no information contained in the search warrant affidavit in this case that officers followed Defendant back to his residence after he engaged in drug trafficking transactions, or any facts supporting that evidence specific to the controlled purchases was secreted in Defendant's home-information that may support a reasonable inference that evidence of the crimes, such as proceeds of drug trafficking, might be found there. Rather, at least weeks had passed between the surveillance at the Pierce Avenue property and the search. In other words, the observance of a vehicle that at one point contained evidence of a crime, outside of a house shortly after the crime was committed (like the vehicle in\n   <em>\n    Travisano\n   </em>\n   ), creates a different inference than law enforcement's observation of a vehicle used by Defendant to perpetrate alleged drug crimes parked next to Defendant's residence during unspecified day and evening hours.

Moreover, investigators do not need to observe a defendant bringing drugs into or out of a residence to be searched to establish probable cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

For instance, there is no information as to how the controlled buys were arranged, when the controlled buys were arranged (in comparison to the timing of the actual sales), or the length of surveillance conducted on the Pierce Avenue residence prior to observing Defendant's exit before the November 2017 controlled buy. This Court understands why Judge McCarthy concluded that probable cause was lacking for the search warrant. Nonetheless, this Court must be deferential to Justice Kloch's probable cause determination, and the case presents a close call.

There is no indication that they were included in the warrant affidavit to mislead the issuing judge; for example, the warrant affidavit does not include any additional information relevant to searching for heroin, and it is abundantly clear from the warrant application that Defendant allegedly deals in cocaine-not heroin. Further, the statement that Defendant stored cocaine at his house, at least on one occasion, is supported by the November 2017 surveillance. These statements are, at best, typographical errors, and do not amount to false statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As to the claimed omission that on two occasions the believed controlled substance did not test positive for cocaine and the statement that all of the controlled purchases were recorded, Defendant either misstates the facts or relies on information that became known to the investigative team following the signing of the warrant application. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 41 at 8-9 (laboratory reports at issue were from controlled buys not included in the warrant application; first lab report revealed that substance tested positive for cocaine but did \"not meet the laboratory standard for quantification\"; and second lab report was issued on January 10, 2018, after the affiant submitted the search warrant application to Justice Kloch);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 (affidavit states that October and November 2017 controlled buys were recorded; affiant did not mislead Justice Kloch by asserting that he reviewed the content of the October 2017 recording; and Government only learned of inadvertently deleted October 2017 recording when providing discovery) ). In other words, none of these statements suggest bad faith on the part of the affiant, nor is there any support for the notion that exculpatory evidence was somehow withheld from Justice Kloch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As to the affiant's\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   testimony that Defendant was the only occupant of 1364 Pierce Avenue, it is true that the discussion between Justice Kloch and the affiant is somewhat unclear in terms of the status of Defendant's occupancy of certain parts of the premises to be searched. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 45 at 7-8; Dkt. 41 at 10). However, it is abundantly clear from the search warrant application that a Michelle Montgomery also occupied the property. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 29 at 3 (\"Your deponent did make contact with Ashley Furniture Store in Amherst, New York and confirmed that the furniture delivery was for a Michelle Montgomery. The above listed Range Rover that [Defendant] has been observed regularly operating is also registered to Michelle Montgomery....\") ). Accordingly, Defendant has not shown that the affiant deliberately misled Justice Kloch on this point. Instead, it appears that the affiant was attempting to explain to Justice Kloch that the premises contained one residential apartment, but it also contained business space in the lower level that Defendant was renovating, and that Defendant had control over the entire structure. (Dkt. 45 at 7-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendant further contends that, contrary to what the affiant told Justice Kloch, the informant did not have personal knowledge of renovations occurring at the Pierce Avenue property, because \"to have personal knowledge\" the informant \"would have had to have been inside the building.\" (Dkt. 36 at 7). Defendant has failed to show that the informant did not have personal knowledge of renovations taking place. There is nothing in the record suggesting that the informant was not inside the building, or even that one would have needed to be inside to learn that renovations were taking place from, for instance, observing contractor traffic outside the building. In any event, this was hardly critical information necessary for issuance of the search warrant.

The affidavit explains that in November 2017, surveillance observed Defendant leave the 1364 Pierce Avenue property. (Dkt. 29 at 3). Following his departure from 1364 Pierce Avenue, Defendant proceeded directly to\n   the scene of the controlled purchase. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Investigators then observed Defendant engage in a suspected narcotics transaction in his vehicle with the confidential informant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Following the controlled purchase, the confidential informant confirmed that he/she had purchased cocaine from Defendant, and the suspected narcotics tested positive for cocaine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). These facts, in conjunction with information from the October 2017 and December 2017 controlled purchases, the fact that Defendant was living at the residence and owned it, and that the Range Rover was used for drug trafficking and stored at the residence, make the investigators' reliance on the warrant reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kortright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%204406352\">\n    2011 WL 4406352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (where defendant dealt drugs on a handful of occasions, but there was no evidence linking his apartment to drug trafficking, declining to suppress evidence where reasonably, well trained officer would not have known the search of apartment was illegal). In other words, there is some information connecting Defendant's residence to drug trafficking activity, and it was reasonable for investigators to infer that Defendant left 1364 Pierce Avenue in November 2017 with cocaine. Indeed, as evidenced by Judge McCarthy's Report and Recommendation, and Justice Kloch's probable cause determination leading to issuance of the warrant, reasonable minds can disagree as to whether probable cause supported issuance of the warrant, but at the very least, a reasonably well trained law enforcement officer would not know, under the circumstances, that the search was illegal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Moreover, although the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   testimony may not be relied upon to evaluate the sufficiency of the warrant for probable cause because it was not referenced in the warrant, it is relevant to the determination of whether the officers acted in good faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052478\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/626/56/#p64\">\n    626 F.3d at 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It is up to Defendant to meet his initial burden to articulate a basis for suppression and present a\n    <em>\n     prima facie\n    </em>\n    case for exclusion of evidence.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     United States v. Bayless\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7773078\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/921/211/#p213\">\n     921 F.Supp. 211\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 213 (S.D.N.Y. 1996). Since Defendant has not raised this issue, and since the record is not sufficiently developed as to each of the items seized and whether they were seized pursuant to the warrant or on some other basis, such as evidence in plain view, the Court specifically does not address whether evidence was seized outside the scope of the warrant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
