CHUANG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Arthur Stutzman of St. Mary's County, Maryland has filed a civil action against Maryland State Police Troopers Evan Krenik and Marcus Manning alleging that during a traffic stop on the night of January 7, 2016, Defendants arrested him without legal justification and used excessive and unreasonable force in handcuffing, moving, and transporting him after that arrest. Stutzman asserts claims for violations of his rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 26 of the Maryland State Constitution, as well as state common law claims of false arrest, battery, and gross negligence. Presently pending before the Court is Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, or, in the Alternative, Motion for Summary Judgment. Upon review of the submitted materials, the Court finds that no hearing is necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. Md. Local R. 105.6. For the reasons set forth below, the Defendants' motion is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 7, 2016, Stutzman was driving on Maryland State Route 5 south of its junction with Maryland State Route 231. He noticed Manning in a police car zigzagging through traffic, tailgating another vehicle, and speeding at approximately 90 miles per hour, even though the posted speed limit was 55 miles per hour. The police car's emergency lights were not activated. After Manning drove by him, Stutzman called the Maryland State Police (\"MSP\") barracks in La Plata, Maryland and reported Manning's apparently reckless driving. Stutzman then followed Manning, catching up to him at a red traffic light. He got Manning's attention by flashing his headlights and asked Manning to pull into a nearby gas station, where he confronted Manning peacefully about his driving. Manning \"acted dismissively\" and drove away from the gas station. Am. Compl. \u00b6 13, ECF No. 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As Stutzman drove home from the gas station, Manning pulled behind him and activated his police lights to signal for Stutzman to pull over. Stutzman asserts that he \"had not been speeding or breaking any traffic laws\" and that the stop was in retaliation for his \"reprimand\" of Manning.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16. Rather than stopping at Manning's signal, Stutzman continued driving toward his home and called the MSP barracks to report where he was driving and to \"request assistance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-20. Because of Manning's \"aggressive behavior,\" Stutzman believed that Manning was angry that Stutzman had\n   confronted him and was therefore afraid to be alone with Manning.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After Stutzman and Manning arrived at Stutzman's home, Manning got out of his vehicle and began to yell at Stutzman. Other state and county police officers arrived as well, including Krenik. Both Defendants were visibly angry at Stutzman. At that point, Defendants decided to arrest Stutzman for fleeing or eluding the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Stutzman is 59 years old and suffers from a severe physical disability due to spinal conditions and multiple surgeries and thus walks and moves \"in a way manifesting genuine physical disability.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. When Krenik arrested him, Stutzman requested that Krenik handcuff him with his hands in front of his body because he has \"metal and screws\" in his lower back, \"thoracic issues,\" and he had had two prior cervical surgeries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. Krenik refused. Stutzman explained that he could not physically put his hands behind his back, stated that doing so would injure him, and again asked to be handcuffed in front. Krenik again refused. As Krenik went to handcuff Stutzman with his hands behind his back, Stutzman screamed in pain. Stutzman remained \"in visibly obvious and severe pain\" as they walked to Krenik's vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. When Krenik ordered him to sit in the front passenger seat, Stuzman told Krenik that he would not be able to get into the front seat with handcuffs behind his back without incurring injury and asked to be transported in the backseat of another police cruiser. Although another police officer offered to have Stutzman transported while lying down in the back of his police cruiser, Krenik refused to allow it. When Stutzman tried to get into Krenik's vehicle, he physically could not place his legs into the car and was in obvious and severe pain. Krenik then tried to force Stutzman's legs into the car, injuring Stutzman and causing him to scream out in pain and begin to cry. Krenik then took Stutzman out of the vehicle, applied a second set of handcuffs to him from behind, and placed Stutzman in the back of another police cruiser, lying down, to be transported to the police station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During the ride, Stutzman was in such \"excruciating pain\" that the police car stopped at one point.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35-38. When Stutzman told Krenik that the transport was causing him such pain, Krenik yelled at him and ordered that the car to continue. At the station, Krenik booked Stutzman. Booking took several hours, during which Stutzman was seated on a stool and handcuffed in a way that caused severe pain in his arms. Although Stutzman told Krenik about the pain caused by the stool and handcuffing, Krenik refused to allow him to sit elsewhere and slowed down the booking process. Krenik used \"a sarcastic and intimidating tone of voice\" throughout booking and ordered a drug test that Stutzman considered frivolous.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. Stutzman was charged with fleeing or eluding a police officer, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Transp.%20%C2%A7%2021-904\">\n    Md. Code Ann., Transp. \u00a7 21-904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (West 2010). He was fined $500, received a suspended sentence of 180 days of imprisonment, and received a disposition of probation before judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to Stutzman, as a result of his treatment during the arrest, handcuffing, and transport to the station, he has suffered \"additional, serious, disabling, and permanent injury to his back and worsening of his pre-existing condition, including but not limited to one disc bulging and another disc pressing on a nerve.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 38. Since the arrest, Stutzman has experienced deterioration in his mobility, chronic back pain that has not responded to pain management, chronic headaches, and lower neck and shoulder pain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 29, 2017, Stutzman filed this case in this Court. On March 9, 2018,\n   Stutzman filed an Amended Complaint, in which he alleges that Defendants violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution (Count 1) and under Article 26 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights (\"Article 26\") (Count 5) to be free from an unreasonable seizure and excessive force. He also asserts state law tort claims of false arrest (Count 2), battery (Count 3), and gross negligence (Count 4). Stutzman seeks compensatory and punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In their Motion, Defendants seek dismissal of all counts of the Amended Complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 56. First, they argue that Stutzman's claims in Counts 1, 2, and 5 alleging an unreasonable seizure and false arrest fail to state a claim because the facts as stated in the Amended Complaint establish that Manning had probable cause to arrest him. Second, they argue that the probation before judgment disposition of the fleeing-or-eluding charge against Stutzman necessarily established probable cause and thus bars consideration of the unreasonable seizure and false arrest claims. Third, they argue that Stutzman has failed to allege sufficient facts to support the excessive force, battery, and gross negligence claims in Counts 1, 3, 4, and 5 and that the facts as alleged actually establish that Defendants used reasonable force. Finally, Defendants assert the defenses of federal qualified immunity to the claims in Count 1 and Maryland statutory immunity to the claims in Counts 2-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   To defeat a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the complaint must allege enough facts to state a plausible claim for relief.\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

In response, Defendants argue that the facts as alleged in the Complaint establish that Defendants had probable cause to arrest Stutzman for fleeing or eluding a police officer, that the state court's imposition of a probation before judgment disposition in Stutzman's criminal case establishes probable cause as a matter of law, and that Stutzman is judicially estopped from asserting these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Maryland courts construe Article 26\n   <em>\n    in pari materia\n   </em>\n   with the Fourth Amendment, such that its comparable provisions are essentially equated to the Fourth Amendment's protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

Here, Stutzman had a physically disabling spinal condition and visibly walked in a manner that revealed his disability, so he requested to be handcuffed with his hands in front of his body because he was physically unable to put his arms behind his back. Nevertheless, Krenik forced Stutzman's hands behind his back and handcuffed him as Stutzman screamed in pain. Although Stutzman stated that he could not physically sit in the front seat of a police cruiser when handcuffed in that manner, Krenik grabbed his leg and attempted to force Stutzman into the front seat of the vehicle, even though another cruiser was available that would have allowed him to sit or lie down in the back seat. Stutzman was in such severe pain that he screamed and began to cry. When Stutzman was finally placed in the back seat of a cruiser, he remained in excruciating pain during the transport to the station, but Krenik refused to allow Stutzman to sit more comfortably or to change the positioning of the handcuffs. As a result of the handcuffing and transport, Stutzman's mobility and chronic pain have worsened. These facts are sufficient to state an excessive force claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519112\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/995/1331/#p1341\">\n    995 F.2d at 1342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Consideration of the\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factors bolsters this conclusion. The offense for which Stutzman was arrested was a misdemeanor, fleeing or eluding a police officer, which is punishable by \"imprisonment not exceeding 1 year or a fine not exceeding $1,000 or both\" for a first offense.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Transp.%20%C2%A7%2021-904\">\n    Md. Code Ann., Transp. \u00a7 21-904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Although Stutzman plainly violated this statute by failing to stop his car for several miles, he did not create a public danger by driving at a reckless speed, leading Manning on a high-speed chase, or taking evasive maneuvers. At the time of the arrest, Stutzman did not pose a risk or threat to the safety of others, since he was stopped at his home and was surrounded by state and county police officers. Furthermore, Stutzman was not actively attempting to resist the police officers or evade arrest. Indeed, during the proceedings in state court, Manning acknowledged that Stutzman was cooperative and did not resist arrest. Audio Recording,\n   <em>\n    State v. Stutzman.\n   </em>\n   Under these conditions, Stutzman could plausibly assert that under the totality of circumstances, Krenik's use of force, particularly his decision to handcuff Stutzman's hands behind his back despite his physical condition, was not \"objectively reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p394\">\n    490 U.S. at 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p394\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in an unpublished opinion, observed that \"While there is a general consensus among courts to have addressed the issue that otherwise reasonable force used in handcuffing a suspect may be unreasonable when used against a suspect whom the officer knows to be injured, these cases involving handcuffing uniformly concern suspects who either have visible injuries or are cooperating in their arrests.\"\n   <em>\n    Beckles v.

Thus, while the First and Second Circuits may diverge from other circuits in that they do not allow an excessive force claim based on an uncooperative suspect's claim that an invisible injury requires handcuffing in the front, they do not dispute the \"general consensus\" that when a police officer has reason to know of an arrestee's injury from a claim by a cooperative suspect, or by any suspect with a visible injury, the officer's refusal to handcuff the individual in the front so as to avoid a resulting further injury would violate the arrestee's constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Viewing the allegations in the Amended Complaint in the light most favorable to Stutzman, the Court concludes that the facts sufficiently allege a violation of clearly established law. Stutzman has alleged that he had a debilitating injury that would be aggravated by handcuffing in the back. Krenik had reason to know about this condition because Stutzman told Krenik at least three times that he was injured and told him that handcuffing him behind his back would further injure him. Krenik was also put on notice when Stutzman screamed out in pain, and exhibited obvious and severe pain, throughout the encounter. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Hunt\n   </em>\n   , Stutzman was cooperative, did not resist arrest, and did not pose a threat to the safety of the officers or any others at the time of the arrest. Finally, even if Stutzman had not been cooperative, viewed in the light most favorable to Stutzman, the Amended Complaint has alleged a visible injury by stating that Stutzman walked and moved \"in a way manifesting genuine physical disability.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 29. Because Stutzman has alleged facts that state a claim of a violation of clearly established law, the Court will not dismiss the claim at this stage based on the defense of qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Second, Defendants argue that Stutzman has not alleged facts that, if true, would support a finding of malice or gross negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As to the pleading standard, procedural matters relating to pleading are governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, not state law.\n   <em>\n    Swift &amp; Co. v. Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1046131\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/107/170/#p172\">\n    107 F.2d 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 172 (4th Cir. 1939). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) allows plaintiffs to allege malice generally.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) (\"Malice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind may be alleged generally.\"). Although plaintiffs must state a plausible claim for relief, Rule 9(b) provides that there is no such heightened pleading standard for malice in federal court.\n   <em>\n    Mayfield v. Nat'l Ass'n for Stock Car Auto Racing, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3748592\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/674/369/#p377\">\n    674 F.3d 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 377 (4th Cir. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   As for the sufficiency of the factual allegations, the Amended Complaint alleges sufficient facts to support findings of gross negligence and malice. As discussed above, because Stutzman has stated a claim that Krenik's use of force was unreasonable and violated the Fourth Amendment, he has alleged facts sufficient to state a claim for gross negligence.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   part III.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Under Maryland law, malice \"refers 'to conduct characterized by evil or wrongful motive, intent to injure, knowing and deliberate wrongdoing, ill-will or fraud.' \"\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"419111\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/384/245/\">\n    863 A.2d at 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Shoemaker v. Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1704408\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/353/143/\">\n    353 Md. 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1704408,1704411,1704423\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/725/549/\">\n    725 A.2d 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 559 (1999) ). In\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Appeals of Maryland held that an inference that a police officer acted with malice during a traffic stop of a luxury car driven by an African American man was warranted where the stop was longer than necessary, the officer requested a canine search of the plaintiffs car without justification, and the officer yelled at the plaintiff, called him an uncooperative \"suspect,\" and asserted that he could search the car without permission.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 312. Here, Stutzman described a specific episode that supports an inference that Defendants acted with malice. He stated that immediately before Manning followed him and signaled for him to stop, Stutzman had observed Manning driving his police cruiser recklessly and had taken it upon himself to flash his lights at Manning, effectively pull the police cruiser over, and confront Manning\n   about his driving. He further asserted that Manning \"acted dismissively\" and drove off \"aggressively.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 13. In light of this highly unusual encounter, Stutzman's allegation that the traffic stop, arrest, and excessive force were retaliatory is plausible. Moreover, Stutzman alleged additional facts that support this conclusion, including that Defendants were \"visibly and audibly annoyed and angry\" during the encounter,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22, and that Krenik yelled at him, used a sarcastic and intimidating tone during booking, deliberately delayed the booking process at the station, and ordered a frivolous drug test. Taken together, these facts are more than sufficient to allege malice. Therefore, at this stage of the proceedings, Defendants are not entitled to statutory immunity from Stutzman's Maryland law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 16, is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. The Motion is granted as to the unreasonable seizure claims in Count 1 and Count 5 and the false arrest claim in Count 2. Those claims are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. The Motion is denied as to the excessive force claims in Count 1 and Count 5, the battery claim in Count 3, and the gross negligence claim in Count 4. Since all claims against Manning have been dismissed, Manning is DISMISSED as a Defendant. A separate Order shall issue.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
