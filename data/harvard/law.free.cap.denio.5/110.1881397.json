The statute creates a species of evidence unknown to the common law, and where it cannot be produced proof of the facts must be made in the usual manner.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-7\">Assumpsit on a promissory note, against the defendant as third endorser. The note was made by G. D. Wall, dated New Brunswick, N. J., June 12, 1840, and was for the payment $751,18 at the <em>State Bank </em>(N. J.) three months after date. It was endorsed by the payee and another person and then by the defendant. The only question was, whether the presentment for payment and notice of non-payment were sufficiently proved. The note was lost. It had been delivered by the holder to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, who testified that it had been lost or mis* laid, and that after a diligent search he could not find it. The copy annexed to the declaration had been made before the loss, and by that the contents of the note were established. The attorney stated that there was a notarial certificate attached to the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s cashier testified to the delivery of the note to the attorney and that it had not been redelivered: he said \u201c there was a protest in due form annexed to the note by a notary in New-York under his official seal and the usual certificate that notice was given to the endorsers.\u201d On cross-examination he said that the notary was Mr. Dyott, of New-York, who was still living. The defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the sufficiency of the proof, but the circuit judge overruled the objection and advised the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiffs, which they did accordingly. The defendant\u2019s counsel excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number><em>N. Hill, Jr. </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ai5\">moved for a nexv trial on a bill of exceptions. He argued the following points. 1. The secondary evidence of the notary\u2019s certificate was inadmissible. The certificate itself was an inferior grade of evidence, made competent only by statute. If that was, for any reason, unattainable, the facts should have been proved in the usual way, which might readily have been done, the notary being alive. <em>2. </em>The contents of the protest and certificate were not proved. A protest \u201c in due form,\u201d and \u201c the usual certificate \u201d mean nothing. 3. But a notary in New-York could not make a presentment of a note in New-Jersey, where this was payable. It was an official act which could be performed only within the state, under whose laws the notary acted. (2 <em>R. S. </em>283, \u00a7\u00a7 44 <em>to </em>46; 1 <em>Id. </em>102, \u00a7 14.) Again, the mode of charging endorsers is governed by the <em>lex loci contractus. </em>That in this case was the law of New-Jersey. <em>(Bank of Rochester </em>v. <em>Gray, 2 </em>Hill, 229.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b115-5\"><em>S. </em>Stevens, for the plaintiff. '</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b115-6\"><em>By the </em>Court, Beardsley, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AgYD\">This is not a case to which the provision malting notarial certificates presumptive evidence of certain facts, has any application; so that if the certificate had been produced and had been in due form it would not have been evidence. (2 <em>R. S. 2d ed. </em>283, \u00a7 46.) The section authorizes the notary to certify certain official acts\u2014the demand of payment and notice. But the note must have been demanded in New-Jersey; and this demand could not have been an official act of a notary in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">But the certificate of the notary was not produced, and although it was lost or destroyed, parol evidence of its contents was inadmissible. The statute makes the certificate presumptive evidence, which was itself an innovation upon the common law rule of evidence. As the certificate was not produced, the statute was not complied with, and the common law rule applied to the case. This was especially proper as the notary was living in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>state and might have been produced. In such a case secondary evidence of the certificate should never be received.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">There was no legal evidence of the genuineness of the certificate, or of its contents. But this is not material, the other reasons stated being sufficient to require a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">New trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
