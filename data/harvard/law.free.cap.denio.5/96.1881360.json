J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQO\">The defendant was entitled to double costs in 'the common pleas. (2 <em>R. </em>S. 617, \u00a7 24.) Under this section the defendant would have recovered \u201chis taxed costs, and one half thereof in addition,\u201d but by the act of 1840, the gross sum of twenty dollars was allowed for all fees and disbursements, \u201c without taxation.\u201d <em>(Laws of </em>1840, <em>p. </em>332, \u00a7 12.) This sum was allowed in lieu of single taxed costs, and the provision cannot be regarded as intended to deprive a party of double costs where he would otherwise be entitled to them. Double costs in such case, are once and one half the amount of the gross sum, instead of once and one half'the amount of a taxed bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">There was no error in the judgment of the common pleas, and it must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">Judgment affirmed</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
