Lawrence Gros and Nicholas Gros, all the costs, litigations, damages, <em>Sec. </em>connected with a claim of said Magdalena in and to the Nicholas Failing farm, (so called,) situate in Canajoharie; by their paying me the sum of two thousand and one h undred dollars, (of which I to-day received sixteen hundred dollars cash and their note for five hundred dollars,) and upon their paying all the just, legal and taxable costs, for which said Magdalena may be liable to her attorney and counsel. Now I agree to procure from her to said Groses, a quit-claim deed executed and acknowledged, in and to all said lands in dispute, which has yesterday been prepared, and further quit-claim assurances at their expense, if desired within her lifetime, to other persons in and to said lands; and I also agree within a reasonable time to cancel a mortgage given by her to me a few years since upon said land, to the end that it be cancelled of record. Nothing but taxable costs to be paid after a definite taxation and as then taxed. Dec. 22d, 1838.\u201d Mrs. Zimerman, on the same day, executed the quit claim deed which had been prepared, to L. and N. Gros. It was expressed to be in consideration of $2100, and contained the following clause: \u201cAnd it is nevertheless understood and agreed by the said party of the first part, [Mrs. Zimerman,] that the consideration money above mentioned is to be and is paid to Mr. Henry Failing, [the defendant,] in satisfaction of a certain mortgage given by me to said Henry Failing, sometime in the year 1835.\u201d On the same day on which the instrument respecting the compromise and the quit claim deed were executed, Mrs. Zimerman executed, under her hand and seal, an instrument in writing which recited that the defendant, as her agent had caused to be brought and prosecuted certain ejectment suits; that the same were compromised by him for her, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>that she had executed the aforesaid quit claim deed on the compromise, and that thereupon the defendant had executed cei tain \u2022 writings for her; after which it proceeded as follows: \u201cI hereby approve of said doings and all others done by said Failing for me; and said Failing is to retain the avails received by him on such settlement, and to be received in payment and satisfaction of his demands and claims against me on the mortgage given by me to him some years ago\u201d\u2014\u201c and any others he may have against me; and to have said mortgage cancel-led.\u201d It was shown that the mortgage was cancelled accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-5\">The plaintiff gave certain evidence having some tendency ti&gt; show that the mortgage was without consideration. The will of Magdalena Zimerman by which the plaintiff was appointed executrix was executed in July, 1839. It revoked all former wills.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-6\">The judge charged the jury that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the sum received by the defendant on the settlement of the ejectment suits with interest; that the power of attorney given in evidence was illegal and void, the testatrix having no right to authorize the defendant to prosecute actions of ejectment in her name for his own benefit; that the mortgage given by the defendant to the testatrix was void for the want of a pecuniary consideration, and that the plaintiff had the same right to take advantage of the want of consideration for the mortgage, which he would have had if there had been creditors of the testatrix. The defendant\u2019s counsel excepted. Verdict for the plaintiff. The circuit judge on a review of the case had directed a new trial, and the motion made here was in consequence of an appeal by the plaintiff which abrogated that order.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b315-7\"><em>N.

The doctrine of champerty and maintenance which formerly prevailed, is not now the law of this state.

But the transaction would' not have been illegal in any\" state of the law. The relation of the defend and the defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s testator, warranted the arrangement which was\u2019 made. <em>(Thalhimer </em>v. <em>Brinckerhoff, </em>3 <em>Cowen, </em>623.) The plaintiff could not impeach the consideration of the morfgage. The statute does not' apply to instrument's given in evidence\" for a Collateral\" purpose. (2 <em>R.

(2 <em>R. S. </em>406, \u00a777; <em>Noble </em>v. <em>Smith. </em>2 <em>John. </em>52; <em>Fink </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>18 <em>id. </em>145; <em>Case </em>v. <em>Boughton, </em>11 <em>Wend. </em>106 ; <em>Tallmadge </em>v. <em>Wallis, </em>25 <em>id. </em>107.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b316-7\"><em>By the Court, </em>Beardsley, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ax0\">It is not material to inquire in this c\u00e1se, how far, or in what respect, if at all, the old law of champerty and maintenance was abrogated or modified by the revised statutes; <em>(Mott </em>v. <em>Small, </em>20 <em>Wend. </em>212; <em>S. C. </em>22 <em>id. </em>403;) for if no change whatever was thus made, it would not follow' that' the power of attorney from the plaintiff\u2019s testatrix to the' defendant, was illegal and void, as was held at the circuit. The defendant was her son-in-law, and his wife might become entitled to the land by descent from her mother; ii was, therefore, not illegal\" for him to carry on suits in her name, at his own expense, for the recovery of such land, either with or without an agreement that he should be benefited by the recovery. This was so held by the court of errors, in the case of <em>Thalhimer </em>v. <em>Brinckerhoff, </em>(3 <em>Cowen, </em>623;) and the principle must be regarded as'iiicontestable. <em>(Campbell </em>v. <em>Jones, 4 Wend. </em>306.)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">So far as respects the' mortgage given to the defendant by the testatrix of the plaintiff, he stood in her stead, and might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>set up any matter to invalidate it which would be admissible in her favor if she were living- and' plaintiff in the suit. The common law would' not permit a mortgagor, or the-maker of any other sealed instrument, to impeach it by showing that it was made without an adequate consideration. But this rule has been modified by statute, for where a sealed obligation is directly in question, as the foundation of an action or a set-off, the obligor may avoid it by showing-the want- of a sufficient-' consideration. (2 <em>R. S. </em>406, \u00a7\u00a7 77, <em>78.) </em>This principle is inapplicable to the' present case, the mortgage not being directly in issue as the foundation of a recovery or of a defence by way of set-off. If the mortgage was in any way material in this case it was because the money received by the defendant, and for which the action was brought, had been paid to him in satisfaction of the mortgage debt due from the-plaintiff\u2019s-testatrix, So'that, if the plaintiff could show that-there was no such debt, the inference would'follow that the-money was received for the use' and benefit of the testatrix. But as the common law will not permit a mortgage to be thus invalidated, and\" the statute is inapplicable to such a case as this, no inquiry as to the consideration of this mortgage was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The testatrix was not shown to owe so much- as a dollar at her decease, so that the rights of creditors, whatever they may be in a case circumstanced like this, cannot be drawn in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The money for which this action was brought, was received by the defendant as payment on the mortgage given to him by the plaintiff\u2019s testatrix, or as a direct gift from her. There is no room on the evidence, for even a pretence that, in point of fact, the defendant received the money as belonging to the testatrix and to be paid over to her. By the original agreement, as shown by the power of attorney, the defendant was to carry on suits for the recovery of the land claimed, for his own \u201c special benefitand when the compromise of these suits was made, the testatrix, who was a party to that compromise, expressly declared by the quit-claim deed then executed by her, that the amount agreed to be paid for the land, was to be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>ceived by the defendant \u2022 in the present suit, in satisfaction of the mortgage she had previously given to him. The same thing was affirmed in the release or confirmation, executed by the testatrix under seal, at the time of making said compromise ; the words used in that instrument being, that said Failing is to retain the avails received by him on such settlement, and to be received, in payment and satisfaction of his demands and claims against me on the mortgage given by me to him some years <em>ago\u201d\u2014\u201c </em>and any others he may have against me, and to have said mortgage cancelled.\u201d There is much other evidence to the same effect; but, if the testatrix executed these instruments without fraud, the evidence was quite conclusive that both the testatrix and the defendant intended the twenty-one hundred dollars should be absolutely his own. He received the money, in form at least, as payment on the mortgage, and if the mortgage is to be held valid, the payment was equally so. But if the mortgage could be set aside as void for the want of consideration, or on any other ground, it would not follow, in every such case, that the money received upon it could be recovered back. The general rule is otherwise, for a payment voluntarily made, can in no case, except under peculiar circumstances, be recalled.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">New trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
