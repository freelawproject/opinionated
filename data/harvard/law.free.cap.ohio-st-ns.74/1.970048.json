Tenney, a notary public, before whom notice had been given to take depositions, issued a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>to the plaintiff in error, J. H. Schoepf, to appear before him and give testimony in the case then pending, wherein Josephine Pace was plaintiff and The Cincinnati Traction Company was defendant, and containing the following clause: \u201cand to bring with you any reports you may have control over, or in your pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>session, made by the motorman or conductor of a College Hill-Main car of The Cincinnati Traction Company, concerning any accident occurring May 17, 1902, because of which this suit was brought.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A9\">The plaintiff in error appeared before the said notary public on the sixteenth day of August, 1902, pursuant to the subpoena, and on examination tes-, tiffed that he was the claim agent of The Cincinnati Traction Company; that there was a standing order or rule which required every conductor or motorman in the employ of said company to report all accidents involving injuries to pedestrians, or passengers, damage to wagons or vehicles of any kind and the mechanical trouble of the cars, from which there could be any possible claim, or possible injury claimed, or damage to anybody\u2019s person or property; that these reports were made on blank forms and were to be sent to the witness; that the purpose of these reports was to enable the company to prepare itself to defend in case a suit should be begun against the company on account of alleged negligence resulting in such accident, and also to advise the company as to the extent of its liability and as to the cause of the trouble; and that it might have the information which was contained in those reports on file for the purpose of defending any such suit; and for advising, or rather submitting to, counsel for their opinion in regard to the cause of action which might be alleged against the company, and for use in any such suit. The witness also testified that such reports in regard to the alleged injury to this plaintiff and the accident resulting therein had been filed with him and were in his possession and under his control until the present suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>of Josephine Pace against the company was begun; and that two or three days after that suit was begun he forwarded the same to the company\u2019s counsel. When asked if he could obtain them by requesting them of counsel, he answered, \u201cYes, of course.\u201d When asked, \u201cWill you do so?\u201d he answered, \u201cNo, for the reason that they are privileged papers.\u201d Also on the examination of said witness before said notary, he was asked:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-5\">\u201cQ. 3.

Thereupon the said notary public ordered the plaintiff in error to be conunitted to jail until he should answer the said questions and produce the said reports.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-7\">Plaintiff in error began these proceedings by an application in the court of common pleas of Hamilton county for a writ of <em>habeas corpus. </em>On the hearing in the court of common pleas, the court found the facts as stated above, and as matter of law adjudged that the commitment for refusal to answer the questions as to who was the division superintendent in May, 1902, and to produce the said reports, should be sustained. The motion for new trial was overruled, and the court rendered judgment that Schoepf be remanded to the custody of the sheriff until he should name the division superintendent of the College Hill-Main line in May, 1902, and should produce the said reports.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AI\">The plaintiff in error filed his petition in error in the circuit court, together with the bill of exceptions and transcript of the proceedings in the court of common pleas; and in the circuit court the sheriff filed a cross-petition in error complaining of the judgment of the common pleas court that the witness was justified in his refusal to answer the five questions above stated. The circuit court held that these five questions should be answered, and ordered that Schoepf be remanded to the custody of the sheriff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>until lie should answer the question as to who was the division superintendent of the College Hill-Main line in May, 1902, and also the five questions above set forth, and also should produce the said reports.

Stat.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b49-5\">Davis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AxS\">It is earnestly argued in behalf of the defendant in error, and that also seems to be the view entertained by the circuit court and the court of common pleas, that a witness who is testifying in a deposition before a notary public may be compelled to produce any document which by any possibility may become pertinent on the trial of the case in which the deposition is taken. It is asserted that <em>In re Rauh, </em>65 Ohio St., 128, is authority for this proposition; and it is contended that the reports which had been made to the plaintiff in error, as the claim agent of the company, are admissions by the company, and that if the motorman and conductor who made these reports should testify on the trial, of the case, the company and its agents might be compelled to produce the reports for the possible purpose of contradiction. It is also asserted, although it is not even suggested how or why it might be so, that these reports may become evidence relat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>ing to the merits of the action and as such the company might be compelled to produce them for evidence or inspection. It is even seriously maintained that a party taking a deposition has a greater privilege under the law than he would have on the trial of his case, in that the witness must produce any document called for although he may believe that it is privileged, and in that the witness must answer impertinent and incompetent questions although he may believe that the answers would be privileged and although the answers would not be admissible if offered to the jury on the trial of the case. And here again it is claimed that the case of <em>Rauh, supra, </em>and other cases in this court and elsewhere, support this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">It was clearly pointed out in <em>Ex parte Jennings, </em>60 Ohio St., 319, that neither the officer who takes a deposition nor the court on the trial of the case, has power to punish a witness for disobedience of a subpoena or a refusal to answer except when the witness has been \u201clawfully ordered.\u201d Section 5252, Revised Statutes. And in that case and the Rauh case also it was said that when the witness undertakes to decide upon the question whether he has been \u201clawfully ordered\u201d he does so at his own peril. It is the same whether a question of privilege is involved or whether it is only a matter of incompetent or irrelevant evidence. It is true that in the Rauh case the qualifying clause, \u201cunless the interrogatory involves a question of privilege,\u201d was thrown in. It would have been clearer if that clause had been omitted or if it had been said \u201ca question of <em>conceded </em>privilege;\u201d but it is plain that when the privilege claimed is disputed the witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>takes- the same chances upon a refusal that he does upon a refusal to answer an incompetent question. Accordingly it was nowhere said in either of the decisions of this court already referred to, nor was it intended to he inferred, that a witness might be compelled to surrender to his adversary a coveted document, before the right to compel production of it had been submitted to the judgment of a competent tribunal; but the correlative proposition that a witness might take the chances of being sustained on a refusal to answer an incompetent or irrelevant question was distinctly asserted. It would seem, therefore, that the power of a notary public in the taking of depositions and the limitations imposed thereon have been clearly defined by the statutes and the previous decisions of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The counsel for the defendant in error concede in their brief that questions 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8, which the witness refused to answer upon advice of counsel, because they were immaterial, irrelevant and incompetent and because they call for hearsay testimony, \u201cwould be inadmissible if offered to a jury on the trial of the case, because of the rule against hearsay.\u201d Yet counsel still insist that the witness may be compelled by imprisonment to disclose facts which they admit could not be admissible on the trial. Prom what we have already said it results that the notary public had no such power. In <em>Ex parte Jennings, </em>it was said in the opinion, \u201cIndeed it does not seem to have been finally determined in any case that the personal liberty of the citizen is of so little importance that it should yield to a desire to gather food for idle gossip. \u2019 \u2019 But in the present case this is all that such a fruitless extortion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>testimony would result in, unless it would be to disclose to the plaintiff the names of witnesses for or against her adversary; and it is elementary that a party cannot be required to aid his opponent in that way. In answer to this it is urged that an objection to the relevancy or competency of evidence cannot be made by a mere witness, but it must come from a party to the action. However plausible this argument may seem, <em>Ex parte Jennings </em>conclusively shows that it is not universally sound. Besides, the witness in this case was an officer and representative of the defendant company, and it is through and by means of him that the plaintiff is here seeking to compel answers to questions and to compel the production of papers which are shown not to be in the possession or control of the witness, except constructively by virtue of his authority as an official of the defendant company. The common pleas court held that the witness was not in contempt for refusing to answer these questions and in this we think the judgment of that court was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Both the common pleas court and the circuit court held that the witness was in contempt for refusing to answer this question, viz.: \u201cWho was the division superintendent in May, 1902, of the division to which the College Hill-Main line belonged?\u201d The issues in the case of <em>Josephine Pace </em>v. <em>Cincinnati Traction Company </em>were made up more than two weeks before this deposition was taken. The petition and answer are a part of the record in this proceeding; and it does not appear that by any possibility the name of the division superintendent could be material or even relevant testimony. It is not alleged that the division superintendent was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>one of the agents of the defendant whose negligence in operating' the car resulted in the plaintiff\u2019s injury, and if it were so alleged, it does not appear in the record that the names of the division superintendent, the conductor and motorman would add anything more to the proof of negligence by the company than proof of the names of passengers on the car or of other persons who were witnesses to the accident. So it seems that the only purpose of this inquiry, as of all of the others, was to compel the defendant in the suit to disclose before the trial the sources of its information in regard to the case and the names of its possible witnesses. Under the circumstances and under the issues as they stand the question was clearly incompetent and the order by the notary that the witness should answer it, as well as the commitment for refusal to answer it was not \u201clawfully ordered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">But it is contended that if the question is not relevant now, it may become so by the time of the trial, because by that time the issues may be so changed that it may be vital. The witness has had no opportunity to judge of the relevancy of the question to such potential issues and he has not refused to answer it under any issue except as now made in the case. We apprehend that in this land personal liberty and security of property do not hang upon such a slender and precarious thread as counsel suggest</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">It was held in the case of <em>Rauh, supra, </em>that a notary public has power to punish a witness for contempt by imprisonment when the witness refuses to obey a subpoena <em>duces tecum, </em>directing him to bring with him any book, writing or other thing under his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>control, which, he may be compelled to produce as evidence. What may he be compelled to produce? And how may he be compelled to produce it? These questions are clearly answered by sections 5289 to 5298 inclusive, of the Revised Statutes. Section 5289 provides that the court may require the parties to an action \u201cto produce books and writings in their possession or power which contain evidence pertinent to the issues, in cases and under circumstances where they might heretofore have been compelled to produce the same by the ordinary rules of proceeding in chancery.\u201d The sections providing for inspections and copies of writings, for reference to a master and for action for discovery may be passed over as not material to the present discussion. Section 5289 limits the power to compel the production of books and writings, 1. To such as are pertinent to the issue and, 2. To cases and under circumstances where the parties might heretofore have been compelled to produce the same by the ordinary rules of proceeding in chancery. Under these limitations could the court compel the production of the reports which were made to this witness under the rules of his company and for the purpose stated?</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The rule in chancery as to compelling the production of documents for the purposes of evidence and inspection is generally recognized and clearly defined. It is to the effect that a plaintiff is entitled to a discovery of such facts or documents in the defendant\u2019s possession or under his control as are material and necessary to the plaintiff\u2019s case; but that this right does not extend to a discovery of the manner in which the defendant\u2019s case is to be estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>lished, nor to evidence which relates exclusively to the defendant\u2019s case. This rule is also applied conversely, to the defendant in an action. Wigram on Discovery, Prop. III, secs. 342-347; <em>Combe </em>v. <em>Loudon, </em>4 Y. &amp; C., 139, 155; 6 Ency. Pl. <em>&amp; </em>Prac., 791-792, 794, 795, 804-806. \u201cIt may be added that the principle of a bill of discovery was never considered to be applicable to third persons not parties so as to secure from them before trial a disclosure of possible evidence.\u201d 3 Wigmore on Evidence, sec. 1856, p. 2427. One question here is whether the reports which were sent to the witness and which were by him turned over to the counsel for the,corporation, relate to the plaintiff\u2019s case and are necessary and material in establishing her case. It lies upon the plaintiff to show this and we think that she has not done so. The efforts of the plaintiff appear to us to be directed toward \u201cfishing\u201d for the nature of the defense and the persons by whom it is to be established, rather than to obtain competent and necessary evidence to sustain the plaintiff\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Another question is, are the reports privileged? The statement of the witness that the reports were made in anticipation of a possible litigation and that they are in possession of counsel for use in the suit which did ensue stands uncontradicted and must therefore be taken as true. This clearly brings the documents within the rule as to privilege; and we see no reason to limit or modify the rule because the defendant is a corporation and obtained its information and made its memoranda for the purpose stated, through the usual agencies of a corporation. 23 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. Law (2 ed.), 99-100, notes 1, 2 and 3. <em>Davenport </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>166 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Pa. St., 480; <em>Carrol </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>82 Ga., 452; <em>Cully </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>35 Wash., 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel argue with a great deal of earnestness that they have the right to extort the reports from the defendant for the purpose of using them as admissions against interest.' While it does not appear what the reports contain, nor whether they contain any statements which would make against the defendant on th\u00e9 trial, it - is certain that the defendant has not made any statement to another which could be used.against it; for confidential communications between a principal and his agent are not admissions. <em>In re Devala, </em>22 Ch. Div., 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">We are of the opinion that the commitment of the witness for refusal to answer any of the questions, which he did refuse to answer, and for refusal to produce the reports was not \u201clawfully ordered;\u201d and accordingly the judgments of the circuit court and the court of common pleas are reversed and the petitioner</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">\n<em>Discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b56-8\">Shauck, C.
