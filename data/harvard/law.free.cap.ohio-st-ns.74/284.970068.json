He alleged that on October 4, 1902, the parties entered into a contract whereby the Company, which as its name indicates was a warehouseman, agreed to store in its warehouse his household goods of the value of $850.00 and to have the same insured in the sum of $500.00 while they should be in its possession; that he delivered the goods to the Company in pursuance to said contract; that it failed to procure any insurance whatever on them, and that on about January 10, 1903, a fire occurred to said warehouse and the goods were wholly destroyed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-10\">The Company answered admitting its corporate character; the reception of the goods for storage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>and their destruction by fire; and denying all the other averments of the petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-5\">On the trial of the issues to a jury the plaintiff\u2019 introduced evidence tending to show that having ordered that vans of the Company he sent for his goods, and the vans not having arrived, he hastened to the warehouse of the Company and inquired of a young man on duty in the office and apparently in charge of it where the manager was. He was told that the manager was up stairs and would he sent for. Shortly an employe of the Company named H. E. Smith, who was a stranger to Cox appeared in response to the summons and said that he was the manager. Cox then explained his insistence that the vans should he sent promptly for his goods because he had procured tickets for New York and the time for the departure of his train was near at hand and that before going he desired to see his goods properly in place in the warehouse and to effect their insurance. In response to the latter suggestion Smith said: \u201cLet us take care of that for you.\u201d After some conversation as to the character and rates of the proposed insurance Cox accepted the suggestion thus made to him and Smith said: \u201cWe cannot hand you the policy now hut will send it to you.\u201d Smith then made a written memorandum of the amount of the policy desired and of the New York address of Cox and added that as he had a hank account in Cleveland, he could send a check for the premium when he received the policy. A few days later a letter written on the head of the Company and bearing its name in the proper place for its signature, attested, \u201cper H. E. S.\u201d was sent to Cox at his New York address stating that insurance for $500.00 had been effected hut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>that the policy was not forwarded because of doubt as to the precise amount of insurance which he desired. The testimony offered by the Company was that Smith was not manager for it but in his absence acted in his stead; that it was not engaged in the business of insuring goods left in its care; that it had given Smith no authority to bind it by contracts of this character and that he did not report to it any insurance which he effected upon goods deposited with it. The value of the goods was proved by Smith as alleged. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff and the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was overruled. On petition in error the circuit court affirmed the judgment of the court of common pleas.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b326-5\"><em>Messrs.

To receive his statement as an admission of that authority would be to proceed in a circle.

Huffcut on Agency (2 ed.), 178.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-9\">All the testimony is to the effect that no officer of the defendant company knew that Smith was-engaged in the business of insuring its customer\u2019s goods, and this testimony remained uncontradicted, and the jury should have returned a verdict in accordance therewith.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-10\">The authority of an agent seems to be express, implied or apparent. Express authority, of course, speaks for itself. Implied authority is in addition to that which is expressed, and is authority to do-those things usually and necessarily incident to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>expressed powers. 1 Am. <em>&amp; </em>Eng. Ency. Law (2 ed.), p. 988.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-5\">It is manifest in this case that Mr. Smith had no express authority to do the act claimed, inasmuch as all the testimony shows he was simply a bookkeeper employed for that purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-6\">In order, then, to hold the defendant company, it was necessary to establish that the act was within his implied or apparent authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-7\">It cannot be said under the testimony in this case that the act of insuring the goods was usually and ordinarily connected with the business of storing goods, in view of the fact that the evidence discloses that such a thing was never done. Therefore, the power could not have been implied as a part of the business.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-8\">Was the act, then, within the apparent authority of Smith?</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-9\">A liability upon the basis of an act committed within an agent\u2019s apparent authority rests in its last analysis upon the doctrine of estoppel. The apparent authority which will bind the principal binds him because there has been some act of commission or omission on his part which the law will not permit him to deny, and by which the rights of other persons have been affected. 1 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. Law (2 ed.), p. 989; Tiffany on Agency, p. 183.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-10\">There was nothing in this case in the way of an act of omission or commission on the part of the defendant company by which Smith was held out as having any authority in regard to insuring goods; but it is manifest that in so agreeing to insure, Smith was not acting within the course of his employment as bookkeeper, was not serving his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>principal, and was not acting within the scope of his authority. The reasonable conclusion is that in agreeing to insure the plaintiff\u2019s goods, he was the plaintiff\u2019s and not the defendant\u2019s agent. <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Peninsular Club, </em>56 Mich., 82; <em>Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>73 Mich., 86; <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>109 Mass., 519; <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Dooley, </em>120 N.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQQ\">It cannot be claimed upon the evidence that the Storage Company was accustomed to insure goods left in its care, nor that Smith had express authority to make the particular contract set out in the petition or like contracts for insurance with others who deposited their goods with the Storage Company. Nor can it be said that such authority was implied in the sense that the making of the contract to insure was indispensable to the execution of his authority to receive goods for the Company on bailment. Nor should there be any dissent from the legal proposition which counsel for the Company advances in support of the criticisms of the rulings of the trial judge as to the competency of evidence and his instructions to the jury, viz., that the authority of an agent cannot be proved by his own declarations. But the question by which the liability of the Storage, Company must be determined is, was it within Smith\u2019s apparent authority to make the contract counted upon in the petition? It does not seem important that Smith was not in fact the Company\u2019s manager, for he appeared in that capacity at the time of this transaction when the manager was absent, and it is clear that in the absence of the manager he was authorized to act in his stead in the reception of goods for storage. His authority would not have been greater if he had regularly occupied the position of manager for the Company. Counsel for the Company insist that in determining whether Smith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>had such apparent authority to make the contract for insurance that Cox might rely upon it, it is the conduct of the Company that is to be considered. The soundness of this proposition should be conceded for it is supported by the decided cases and by the reasons involved. The Company fixed the character of its business and employed Smith in the capacity in which he was presented to those who appeared in response to its invitation to the public to store goods with it for hire. It was not an employment of a transient character or to represent it in the conduct of an isolated transaction, but in the general conduct of a business of established and defined character and scope. In the relation into which the parties were brought by the regular and usual conduct of that business the bailee, though not authorized to issue policies of insurance, was authorized to secure insurance upon goods stored with it even without the express assent of the bailor and to effect such insurance for the benefit of both parties to the contract of bailment. If insurance is effected by the bailee apparently for his own exclusive benefit he will nevertheless by legal construction be held to be a trustee for the bailor as to the surplus. The frequency with which this authority is exercised by bailees of the character of plaintiff in error is suggested by the reported cases. A number of them are cited in the briefs submitted in the present case and they are in entire accord with respect to the doctrine stated. It is to the relation into which the parties were thus brought by the express and confessedly authorized contract of bailment in connection with the facts found in the statement of the case that we are to apply the rules of law respecting the apparent authority of an agent. A correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>.statement of the matured view of that subject will show that it does not have exclusive regard to the immunity of the principal without consideration of the rights of those who accept his invitation to enter into contract relations with him. That view is comprehensively and accurately stated in <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>Milwaukee and Wyoming Investment Co., </em>46 Neb., 480. \u201cWhere a principal has by his voluntary act placed an agent in such a situation that a- person of ordinary prudence, conversant with business usages, and the nature of the particular business, is justified in assuming that such agent is authorized to perform on behalf of his principal a particular act, such particular act having been performed the principal is estopped as against such innocent third person from denying the agent\u2019s authority to perform it.\u201d It is an obvious limitation upon the liability of the principal that he who deals with the agent must act in good faith, respecting every restriction upon the agent\u2019s authority of which he may have notice. The most careful scrutiny of the record in the present case discovers no suggestion of the want of usual prudence or good faith on the part of the bailor. . The rulings of the trial judge respecting the competency of evidence and instructions to the jury are consistent with these views and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b334-6\">Price, Crew, Summers, Spear and Davis, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
