Judge Smith found, <em>inter alia: </em>\u201cAmong the statements made by Mrs. Pacifici * * * upon the basis of which the policy was issued, were that there was no business or professional activity to be conducted on the premises and that the premises then were a two family dwelling.\u201d More specifically, she stated, in answer to a question, that \u201cthe premises are occupied by two families.\u201d Appellant contends that these several statements constituted misrepresentations. We reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">For we think the insured was entitled to suppose that the words in the questions in the application were but a repetition of what would seem to her substantially similar words in the policy. Pertinent, then, are the following conclusions of Judge Smith, with which we agree:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">\u201cThere is, however, merit in defendants\u2019 contention that an untutored layman * * * might well be expected to consider that her situation, renting one apartment of what is undoubtedly built and equipped as what the public considers a two family dwelling to a number of roomers rather than to a family unit, came within the business property exception of property rented in part to others if a two family dwelling usually occupied in part by the insured. If the insurer desired to exclude rental to roomers of one apartment of a two family dwelling occupied in part by the insured it could easily have done so by language understandable by its insured. In these circumstances the ambiguity will be resolved against the insurer, which chose the language. Gaunt v. John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co., 2 Cir., 160 F.2d 599. * * <em>* </em>The policy as written is ambiguous in its definition of business property and might well be construed by a layman not to exclude coverage of business use such as rental to roomers of part of a two family dwelling usually occupied in part by the insured.\u201d So the insured could reasonably believe that she answered correctly that the \u201cpremises are occupied by two families,\u201d and that \u201cno business activity\u201d was \u201cto be conducted on the premises.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
