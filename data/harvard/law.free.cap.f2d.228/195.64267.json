The facts are clearly stated by the district court in its Findings of Fact. 129 F.Supp. 92, 93,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-16\">\u201cJames Irby, plaintiff, on November 12, 1953, while employed by and working at the defendant\u2019s place of business in Mobile, Alabama, suffered an epileptic seizure which caused him to fall from a three-foot platform,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> where he was engaged in his work for the defendant; and in said fall he suffered a dislocation of the sixth vertebra, causing pressure on the spinal column resulting in complete paralysis from the neck down. He had suffered from epilepsy and resulting seizures for at least a year prior to the date of the injury. The epileptic seizure which he suffered on November 12, 1953, was in nowise related to his employment by the defendant. The disability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>which he now suffers resulted directly from the fractured neck which he received in the fall, and is not a result of epilepsy. The court therefore finds that the injury arose in the course of the plaintiff\u2019s employment by the defendant, and the sole question to be determined is whether or not said injury was caused by an accident arising out of plaintiff\u2019s employment by the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Under the Alabama authorities,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the district court decided the issue against the plaintiff, appellant here, saying that, \u201cThe proximate cause of Irby\u2019s injury was set in motion by the epilepsy, and not by the employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">As we read the numerous Alabama cases which have passed upon the term \u201carising out of his employment\u201d, culminating in Massey v. United States Steel Corp., Ala., 86 So.2d 375, in the light of the authorities from other states, an accident arises out of an employment when there is a causal connection between the accident and the conditions under which the work is performed, or when it arises out of a hazard existing in or increased by the employment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The Alabama Supreme Court has repeatedly pointed out that the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act should be liberally construed in favor of the employee, though it has cautioned against going to such an extreme as to convert the act into one simply to insure the life and health of the employee.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-17\">No Alabama case has been called to our attention, and we have found none, where an employee was injured by a fall caused by an epileptic fit, heart attack, or fainting spell. Counsel have cited to us many such cases from other states, in some of which the resulting injury has been held compensable and in others non-compensable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellee seeks to distinguish some of those cases holding the injury compensable, on the ground that the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act involved required simply that the <em>injury </em>arise out of the employment, while the Alabama Act requires that the injury be caused by an <em>accident </em>arising out of the employment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-18\">The word \u201caccident\u201d is used sometimes from the point of view of the cause, on other occasions as referring to the effect, but usually to describe the event.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> By express statutory definition,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the word \u201caccident\u201d in the phrase now being considered was used to describe the event, the \u201cunexpected or unforeseen event\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-19\">The event was the fall and, of course, the fall included the last three feet thereof and the striking of appellant\u2019s head and body against the ground with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>consequent injury. We are clear to the effect, therefore, that there was a direct causal connection between the conditions under which the appellant worked and the accident which caused his injury. To hold otherwise, we think, would be to make the Alabama rule contrary to the current of modem authority.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">The Alabama Supreme Court has often noted that the benefits of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law are not limited to those in perfect health.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If appellant\u2019s fall had been unexplained or had been caused simply by slipping, there would be no question that his consequent injuries were compensable.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We recognize that in idiopathic falls the question is different, because the origin of the fall is personal and therefore requires definite and affirmative employment contribution.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> That causal connection, however, appears from the facts of this case. The district court found that \u201cThe disability which he now suffers resulted directly from the fractured neck which he received in the fall, and is not a result of epilepsy.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The severity of the fall and the angle and position at which ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>pellant struck the ground were directly influenced by the last three feet of his fall, one of the conditions of his employment. In our opinion, therefore, appellant\u2019s injury was caused by an accident arising out of his employment. The judgment is, therefore, reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to fix the compensation and enter judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b244-9\">.

The currently controversial question is whether the effects of an idiopathic fall to the level ground or bare floor should be deemed to arise out of the employment.\u201d 1 Larson\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, Sec. 12.11.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">In discussing \u201cfalls from heights\u201d, Professor Larson says, \u201cThe earliest case, Wicks v. Dowell &amp; Company (2 K.B.225), decided in 1905, awarded compensation when an epileptic fell into the hatchway of a ship near which he stood in the course of his employment. But, at this stage of development of the law, a fall downstairs was distinguished and held outside the coverage of the Act [Butler v. Burton-on-Trent Union, 106 L.T.N.S. 824, 5 BWCC 355 (1912)]. The story from this point on is one of a gradual decrease in the requisite height of the fall. In the Baltimore Dry Docks case [Baltimore Dry Docks &amp; Shipbuilding Co. v. Webster, 139 Md. 616, 116 A. 842 (1922)], the fall was forty-five feet from a ship under construction; in the Santacros [c] e case [Santacroce v. Sag Harbor Brick Works, 182 App.Div. [442], 169 N.Y.S. 695 (1918)], it'was fifteen feet, from the top of a brick pile; in the Granier case [Gonier v. Chase Companies, 97 Conn. 46, 115 A. 677, 19 A.L.R. 83 (1921) ], it was eleven feet from a scaffold; in Carroll v. What Cheer Stables Co. [38 R.I. 421, 96 A. 208, L.R.A.1916D, 154 (1916)], it was five feet, from the seat of a hack; and finally in the Milwaukee Electric case [Milwaukee Electric Ry. &amp; Light Co. v. Industrial Comm., 212 Wis. 227, 247 N.W. 841 (1933)], it was perhaps twenty-two inches, from the third or fourth step of a stairway.\u201d 1 Larson\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, Sec. 12.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">As to idiopathic falls onto level floor, see 1 Larson's Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, Sec. 12.14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b246-11\">.
