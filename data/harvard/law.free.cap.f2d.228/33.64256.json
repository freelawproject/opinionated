Appellant was indicted with another man for housebreaking and larceny. His co-defendant pleaded guilty. Upon appellant\u2019s trial two other men appeared as witnesses for the Government. The motion for a new trial is based upon a recantation by one of these witnesses and a supporting affidavit by the co-defendant, who did not testify at the trial. The District Court held a hearing on the motion and heard the testimony of the recanting witness and of the co-defendant. At the conclusion of the hearing the trial judge stated that he did not believe the testimony. Upon that basis he overruled the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">A motion for a new trial upon the ground of newly discovered evidence is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court. Where, as here, that court listens to the testimony, observes the witnesses, and concludes that the testimony is not worthy of belief, its exercise of its discretion, unless abused, will not be disturbed by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">The order of the District Court is Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
