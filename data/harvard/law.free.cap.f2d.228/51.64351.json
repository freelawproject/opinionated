She got a divorce from appellant in Nevada January 19, 1954, and married appellee Wise September 15, 1954. On November 24, 1954, our District Court amended its judgment of January 13 by striking the award of alimony. Though this amendatory judgment relieving appellant of his obligation to pay alimony was entered \u201cby consent\u201d, he afterwards filed the present suit for a declaratory judgment that the Nevada divorce is void. The District Court did not err or abuse its discretion in dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
