Spriggs, Sr., sued the Secretary of the Interior and Mary Bradford O\u2019Neal Candler to have them declared trustees for him of certain lands in the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming, and for related relief. As Mr. Spriggs puts it in his brief, he sought a declaratory judgment determining his rights under certain deeds. He claimed the rights by reason of legal services to Mary Bradford O\u2019Neal Candler in connection with her lands, in payment for which she had attempted to deed him an interest therein. The difficulty is that the \u25a0 lands with respect to which he seeks to impress a trust or to obtain other relief at the hands of the Secretary are within Indian Allotments made under the General Allotment Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Allotments are Nos. 125, 947, 948, 2123 and 2124. Also involved are lands within Allotment No. 950 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which, as we shall see, present a somewhat different problem.</p>\n<p id=\"Az9\">Mary Bradford O\u2019Neal Candler is a Shoshone Indian of three-fourths white blood. Through descent and testamentary disposition she acquired interests in said Allotments Nos. 125, 947, 948, 2123 and 2124. Under the allegations of the complaint the legal title to these interests is either in the United States in trust under the provisions 'Of th\u00e9 General Allotment'Act, supra, n. I,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as the Secretary contends, or in Mary Bradford O\u2019Neal Candler, as Mr. Spriggs contends. If the former, that is, if the lands are still governed by the terms of the General Allotment Act, then Mr. Spriggs\u2019 suit to establish an interest therein is one against the United States to which it has not consented. See Minnesota v. United States, 305 U.S. 382, 386, 59 S.Ct. 292, 294, 83 L.Ed. 235, where it is said with respect to Indian allotted lands, \u201cthe United States owns the fee of these parcels\u201d and is an indispensable party to a proceeding against property in which the United States has an interest. If, as Mr. Spriggs urges on the basis of the history of these lands as set forth in his complaint, the title is unrestricted in Mary Bradford O\u2019Neal Candler, the District Court did not obtain jurisdiction to grant the relief he seeks because personal service within the District of Columbia was not had upon Mary Bradford O\u2019Neal Candler, who was an indispensable party. The question whether the land is restricted could not be determined in her absence. Moreover, she holds the beneficial interest under a quitclaim deed executed by appellant which purported to convey these lands to the Government,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a deed which appellant seeks to cancel by this suit. The service upon Mary Bradford O\u2019Neal Candler in- Wyoming did not give the District Court jurisdiction because the land is not within the District of Colum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>bia. See Maben v. Norvell, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 165, 214 F.2d 263; Gaines v. Gaines, 81 U.S.App.D.C. 260, 261-2, 157 F.2d 521, 522-3; Rule 4(f), Fed.Rules Civ.Proc., 28 U.S.C.A.; \u00a7 13-108, D.C.Code 1951. The District Court properly concluded, therefore, that it lacked jurisdiction. 119 F.Supp. 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">As to Allotment No. 950 the court held, as the Secretary concedes to be correct, that all restrictions on the land in this Allotment had been removed by a fee patent No. 658,744 issued to Lilly Passedoah on January 11, 1919. This patent conveyed the legal title in fee simple to the then owner, through whom defendant Candler claims. It is also conceded that a subsequent conveyance of this land by Mr. Spriggs to the United States at its request, in trust for Mary Candler, the same person as defendant Candler,' after' a conveyance by her to him, was upon' the mistaken view that the land was restricted and that the earlier deed to him accordingly\u2019 was invalid.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The cloud which appears thus to have been cast upon his title to this tract through \"mistake may no doubt be\u2019 removed by legislation,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or possibly by appropriate litigation. The present suit, however, does not serve the purpose because, as hereinabove shown, Mary Bradford O\u2019Neal Candler has not been personally served with process in this jurisdiction. Even were w\u00e9 to assume that some relief would be possible against the Secretary\u2019 were defendant Candler before the court, she- is at\u00ed indispensable party, for Mr. Spriggs claims through her and she holds the beneficial interest under Spriggs\u2019' quitclaim deed to the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Construing the judgment of the District Court as one dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction it is</p>\n<p id=\"AoP\">Affirmed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b80-9\">. Act of February 8, 1887, 24 Stat. 388, as amended, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 331 et seq. (1952), 25 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 331 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b80-10\">. The trust patents of Allotments Nos. 125, 947 and 948 are dated October 19, 1907, of Nos. 2123 and 2124,- May 11, 1916, and of No, 950, October 19, 1907.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b80-11\">. The original term of restrictions on alienation was authorized to be extended, and was extended, under the provisions of the Act of June 21, 1906, 34 Stat. 326, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 391 (1952), 25 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 391, and Executive Orders thereunder.

The deed was dated March 31, 1930, and was received by the Government on April 5, 1930. Appellant alleges that the request by the Government for this deed -.was based upon an erroneous determination that the lands were restricted and that a prior deed by Mary Bradford O\u2019Neal Candler to appellant was therefore invalid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b81-6\">. This land was included in the deed of March 31, 1930.. See note 4' supra. However, the Government\u2019s concession applies only to Allotment No. 950, not to the other five allotments covered by the same deed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"Amc\">. -At oral argument counsel for the Secretary intimated this possibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"Ay0\">.
