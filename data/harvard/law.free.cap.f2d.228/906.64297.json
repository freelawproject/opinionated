Appellant\u2019s motion was based upon the claim that the evidence upon which he was convicted was inconsistent with the indictment. The indictment charged that appellant, in the course of a bank robbery, \u201cdid put in jeopardy the life of Fred W. Pluskat, by the use of a dangerous weapon, * * The evidence showed that it was actually appellant\u2019s co-defendant who held Pluskat at gun point.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-21\"> Assuming that this claim was of a kind that could properly be made in a motion to vacate sentence, it was without merit. As the district court pointed out, a complete answer to the appellant\u2019s contention is the law that makes a principal of an aider and abettor. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-22\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
