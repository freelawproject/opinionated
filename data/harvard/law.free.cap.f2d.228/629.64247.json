He further testified that he could not read without glasses, that he did not have any .glasses at that time, and told the adjuster that he could not read the paper. \u201cQ. What did he tell you it said? A. He said, \u2018Oh, this is just six weeks\u2019 compensation you were off that you will get a check for $150.00 in a few days\u2019, if \u2022nothing didn\u2019t turn up.\u201d On cross-ex.-amination he testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-8\">\u201cNow, how much of that did Mr. Masters read to you and how much he didn\u2019t read to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-9\">\u201cA. He didn\u2019t read that where I agreed to sign my compromise for :$150.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-10\">\u201cQ. He didn\u2019t read the last sentence: T agree to compromise my claim in the amount of $150.00\u2019; you say he didn\u2019t read that?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-13\">\u201cA. He didn\u2019t read that.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-14\">\u201cQ. Did he read the rest of it? \u201cA. I don\u2019t know whether he did or not, I couldn\u2019t read it, I was just taking his word for what he told me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-15\">The adjuster testified in substance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-16\">\u201cI then prepared the compromise statement and had Mr. Dunn to read the statement fully. He never did say one word about being unable to read. In fact, he was fully able to read it and write his name in the indicated space on the contract, which he did. I told him at the time that the statement was a full and final agreement and that he would receive one hundred and fifty dollars in full payment of his claim, and that in addition all doctor bills which he had incurred would be paid by The Travelers Insurance Company. * * * Actually, I could not testify whether or not I read it to him or he read it. If I did read it to him he had a copy, and which he could follow. Two copies of the statement were prepared and he had a copy which he could follow.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-18\">It is true that the findings of the trial court are not as explicit or detailed as might be desired, but they should be liberally construed in support of the judgment. Triangle Conduit &amp; Cable Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 7 Cir., 168 F.2d 175, 179. The testimony of the appellee and that of the appellant\u2019s claim adjuster are diametrically opposed. The trial court found that the appellee \u201chas testified truly.\u201d If so, if appellee had a meritorious claim for compensation on account of a serious injury which was settled for a small sum through the efforts of appellant\u2019s claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>adjuster by a false representation relied upon by appellee that the settlement was simply for the six weeks' compensation during which appellee had been off from work, then, even according to the authorities relied upon by the appellant,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the settlement agreement should be set aside. We find no error in the record and the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-9\">.

He relied upon the defendant\u2019s agent as to its contents, and, he says that he thinks the agent told him that it was a compromise settlement for one hundred and fifty dollars for six weeks, that he, the agent, had discovered he owed him, did owe him,' for compensation at twenty-five dollars per week, and, he did not know he was sighing, nor could he read, nor did he read, the compromise settlement agreement, and,' that when the check for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>one hundred and fifty dollars was received, together with the statement, he immediately refused it, <em>took it to </em>his attorney, and, it was returned to the company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ate\">\u201cI believe, Gentlemen, that it is right that this case should be ruled by decree for the plaintiff, setting aside this agreed settlement.
