Sylvester, 2 Cir., 220 F.2d 758. The judgment, dismissing the complaint as to the other defendants, was entered on a verdict, the plaintiff having demanded a jury. The evidence was such that the judge could not properly have directed a verdict for the plaintiff (who indeed did not move for such a direction), so that the verdict is conclusive except for any errors committed in the conduct of the trial. The hypothetical questions addressed by the plaintiff personally to physicians as experts were not properly framed and were rightly excluded; indeed, it is difficult, to see what relevance they could have had, except so far as they touched upon the issue of \u25a0 damages, which it never became necessary for the jury to assess, since it found that the defendants' were not liable. Be that as it may, after an attorney appeared for her and had had a day to prepare, he called her again-to the stand and her examination direct and cross, extends over fifty pages of the typed minutes. Thus he had opportunity to reframe the hypothetical questions if they .were relevant at all, and-he made no such attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">At the close of the charge to which no exceptions were taken, the plaintiff said: \u201cI want to thank you very much for your charge, for your fairness, for your kindness\u201d ; and her attorney added: \u201cI go further; not only a fair charge but a very fair trial.\u201d The grant of a motion for a new trial was in the discretion of the judge, and the order denying it is not appealable. It is therefore apparent, as we, have said, that there is nothing in the record which we can review.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
