Jung Bay Nui and Jung Bay Kow brought an action for a judgment declaring them to be nationals of the United States. The actions were brought against James P. McGranery, Attorney General of the United States,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 903.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They could have been brought in the District Court for the District of Columbia or in the district court for the district in which Mook, Nui and Kow claimed a permanent residence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Actually, they were brought in the District Court for the Southern Dis trict of California. There they were consolidated for trial. However, the only issue tried was whether Mook, Nui and Kow claimed a permanent residence in the Southern District of California. The District Court for that district found that none of them claimed such a residence, thus, in effect, finding that venue was laid in the wrong district. Accordingly, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1406(a), that court ordered the actions transferred to the District Court for the District of Columbia. From these orders Mook, Nui and Kow have appealed. These orders were not final decisions, within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291, and were not appealable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">Appeals dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Aci\">.
