We must, therefore, put to one side our first impression that here are simple words that have plain meaning and consider the construction given them by the Secretary of Labor, because he contends in good faith that such plain and simple meaning is wrong. If he does, it is, of course, his duty to test out his theory if he deems it necessary in his administration of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">There is also presented an issue on this appeal arising from the application by the District Court of the provisions of \u00a7 3(o) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 203 (o). The court found that this case was controlled by an interpretation of this subsection which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-9\">\u201c(o) Hours Worked. \u2014 In determining for the purposes of sections 6 and 7 the hours for which an employee is employed, there shall be excluded any time spent in changing clothes or washing at the beginning or end of each workday which was excluded from measured working time during the week involved by the express terms of or by custom or practice under a bona fide collective-bargaining agreement applicable to the particular employee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">The opinion of the trial court, D.C., 124 F.Supp. 525, 526, concisely stated the facts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-11\">\u201cDefendant, a manufacturer of carbon paper, engaged in commerce and subject to this Act, had five employees in its coating department. They worked forty hours per week' and were paid in excess of minimum wages required by law. In addition thereto they spent five minutes each morning after arrival on defendant's premises and before commencing their work, in changing into their work clothes. At the end of their regular shift, some of them would take a bath and change clothes, consuming twenty minutes time, others would leave for their homes without doing so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-12\">\u201cIn an early stage of the case plaintiff sought the privilege of going on the premises and photographing these employees, the latter objected to being photographed, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>at the Court\u2019s suggestion, consented to by all counsel, the Court went personally to defendant\u2019s plant just prior to four o\u2019clock p. m. on a hot July day, and observed two employees working in the coating department at their machines. Their clothes were covered with grime and dirt, their bodies with perspiration and smears of ink, and it was apparent that, for their own pleasure, pride and convenience, a bath and change of clothes was necessary. For the economic welfare of their employer such a bath and change was immaterial, there were no dangerous acids or other matters in their clothing, nor was any particular type of clothing necessary in connection with their work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">The Government adds the statement that \u201cthe soil and stain from the ink would ruin the employees\u2019 clothes, the upholstery of their automobiles, and other things with which they might come into contact. They would thus incur expenses which they could ill afford.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">We think these statements adequately cover the evidentiary facts in the case, except for the statement of the trial court in his opinion, reported at 124 F.Supp. 525, at page 527, as to the terms of employment and the custom as to whether the clean-up time was compensable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-7\">\u201cAs it appears in the instant case that the employees were not organized, that they did not have with their employer a written or express \u2018collective-bargaining agreement applicable to the particular employee\u2019, question arises whether time spent in changing clothes or washing is excluded. It does appear, however, that there was a custom between employer and employees that such time should not be included, the employees taking the witness stand disclaimed any such contention, it appeared that they had never claimed the same nor agreed to the same, and apparently were utterly indifferent upon the question. They seemed more amused at the entire proceedings than interested therein, and absolute peace and harmony seemed to prevail upon their relationships to the employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b985-10\">We think the question whether the time spent in changing clothes and washing up is broader than as viewed by the trial court. We do not agree that this employment was expressly exempted under \u00a7 3(o) because it did not meet the requirements there that the custom of non-payment must arise \u201cunder a bona fide collective-bargaining agreement applicable to the particular employee.\u201d To come within this exemption the conditions must exist. As pointed out in Judge Hooper\u2019s opinion, there was no collective-bargaining agreement. However, we agree with the trial judge that if the answers to this question were dependent solely on \u00a7 3(o) \u201cthere would be a clear discrimination against the organized employees and in favor of employees which [sic] were not organized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b985-11\">We conclude that compensation for these activities is prohibited under \u00a7 4(a) (1) and (2) of the Portal to Portal Act, supra, since these are clearly \u201cactivities which are preliminary to or postliminary to said principal activity * * which such employee is employed to perform\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-12\">As stated above, this seems the clear and plain meaning of the words. But the Government contends that the activities here which might ordinarily be preliminary or postliminary to the principal activities are so necessary to enable the employees to return to their ordinary personal pursuits without inconvenience or expense that they become thereby part of the principal activity which the employees are employed to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-13\">The two principal cases relied on by the parties are Steiner v. Mitchell, 6 Cir., 215 F.2d 171, asserted by the Secretary to be authority for his position, and Mitchell v. King Packing Co., 9 Cir., 216 F.2d 618, equally strongly put forward by appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-14\">In the Steiner case, which dealt with changing clothes and showering of employees in a plant manufacturing wet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>storage batteries, the Court of Appeals for the.Sixth Circuit said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-4\">\u201cIt is undisputed that the manufacturing process in which appellants\u2019 employees are engaged requires the use of various chemicals and chemical compounds, including sulphuric acid, lead metal, lead oxide, lead sulphate and lead peroxide, which create conditions which are dangerous to the health of the workers. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-5\">\u201cThe only question presented for determination is whether the activities of the employees of appellants in changing clothes and taking shower baths at the plant, <em>on account of the hazardous conditions inherent in the nature of their work, </em>are so closely related to the duties which they are employed to perform as to constitute an integral part thereof and should be classed as \u2018principal\u2019 rather than \u2018preliminary\u2019 and \u2018post-liminary' activities within the meaning of Section 4(a) (2) of the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947\u201d. (Emphasis supplied.) 215 F.2d at page 172.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">In the King Packing Co. case the time which the Secretary claimed was com-pensable was spent by employees who were meat cutters in sharpening their knives outside the regularly scheduled shift. In commenting oh the distinction between the <em>indispensability </em>of an activity in connection with an employee\u2019s principal activities and its <em>preliminary </em>character, the opinion of the Ninth Circuit Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-7\">\u201cIf our conclusion that Congress enacted the Portal-to-Portal Act for the purpose of making non-com-pensable certain activities held to be compensable in the Mt. Clemens case [Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., 328 U.S. 680, 66 S.Ct. 1187, 90 L.Ed. 1515], and in so doing used the term \u2018preliminary\u2019 in the same sense that the Supreme Court of the United States used it, is valid, then \u2018assembling and sharpening tools\u2019 is a \u2018preliminary\u2019 activity. * * * In our view the terms \u2018preliminary\u2019 or \u2018postliminary\u2019 cannot be interpreted so as to exclude all activity \u2018indispensable to the performance of productive work.\u2019 To do so would deny effect to the intended meaning of the Portal-to-Portal Act. All of the activities designated as \u2018preliminary\u2019 by the Supreme Court in the Mt. Clemens case can be considered indispensable. See McComb v. C. A. Swanson &amp; Sons * * * D.C., 77 F.Supp. 716, 733.\u201d Mitchell v. King Packing Co., 216 F.2d at page 621.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b986-11\">Appellees here, we think, correctly point out that this King case is a stronger one for compensability than is the one here presented; for, as the court there recognized, the sharpening of the knives was a necessary or indispensable activity, even though preliminary. Here the clothes changing and bathing, while highly desirable, cannot be said to be indispensable to the effective performance of the work for which these employees were hired.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-12\">Both the Steiner case, 349 U.S. 914, 75 S.Ct. 603, and the King case, 349 U.S. 914, 75 S.Ct. 605, are now before the Supreme Court, certiorari having been granted April 25, 1955. Because, however, we feel action by that Court in neither of those cases would control here, we proceed to our decision based on the facts here present. Just as the Supreme Court stated in the Portal-to-Portal eases that a determination of whether clothes changing and walking time, and like activities, were, prior to the enactment of the Portal-to-Portal Act, supra, within the work week and thus compensable, was a question of fact,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> so here the determination as to whether the same ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>tivities are within the term \u201cprincipal activities\u201d is one of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">Another case strongly supporting ap-pellees\u2019 contention is Ciemnoczolowski v. Q. O. Ordnance Corp., 8 Cir., 1955, 228 F.2d 913, affirming 119 F.Supp. 793. There the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that the evidence supported the findings of fact of the trial court that the clothes changing and showering activities were not part of the principal activities of the employees, even though the employees there were required to conform to clothing standards to satisfy safety requirements of the employer, a manufacturer of high explosives. This, too, is a much stronger case for the compensability of such time than is here before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">Other lower court decisions are cited, as is also considerable legislative history, in the briefs of both parties.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Suffice it to say that neither court decisions nor the somewhat confused legislative history add anything to the solution of the problem before us. We consider this a simple fact question. Even assuming there may be activities actually performed before and after the regular productive shift that are so closely integrated and so essential and of such direct benefit to the employer as to cause them to be considered as a part of the principal activity which the employees are employed to perform, the correctness of which assumption we do not here decide, nevertheless on ample grounds, including a personal view of the plant and the operation itself, the trial judge said in formal Finding of Fact No. 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-7\">\u201cThe five employees involved herein at all times were paid in excess of minimum amounts provided by law for time actually expended in defendant\u2019s coating department. They consumed five minutes in changing clothes before beginning work and some of them, twenty minutes in taking a bath and changing clothes upon leaving work, all of this being for their own convenience, not being required by the employer and not being necessary for the performance of their duties for the employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AI1\">Based on this finding, the court then decided as a conclusion of law that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aax-dedup-0\">\u201cTime expended by employees in bathing and changes is not included as a part of the work week of the employees and is not compensable under the Fair Labor Standards Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b987-10\">This conclusion is clearly justified by the evidence and by the Findings of Fact by the Court. The Court\u2019s further conclusion that, if otherwise compensable, this time is excluded by virtue of \u00a7 3(o), was unnecessary to his judgment dismissing the action and denying the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-11\">The judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"Ah6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b983-16\">. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 217.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Ap2\">. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 215(a) (1), (2), and (5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AvKI\">.

Swift &amp; Co., 323 U.S. 134, at page 136, 65 S.Ct. 161, at page 163, 89 L.Ed. 124: \u201cWhether in a concrete case such time falls within or without the Act is a question of fact to be resolved by appropriate findings of the trial court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b987-8\">. See especially to support appellees\u2019 view, McComb v. C. A. Swanson &amp; Sons, D.C., 77 F.Supp. 716. Appellant distinguishes the other cases cited by appel-lee and by the trial court on the ground that they construed and applied only \u00a7 2 of the I\u2019ortal-to-I\u2019ortal Act, supra, which appellant contends is different in language and purpose from \u00a7 4 here in issue. Section 2 wiped out all existing liability for compensation for any activities which were not made compensable by the agreement or custom between the parties. Section 4, as we have seen, established for the future the formula of preliminary and postliminary to the principal activity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
