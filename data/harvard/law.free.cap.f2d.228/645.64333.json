D.C.Code 1951, \u00a7\u00a7 22-2201, 22-1801. The defendant admitted he entered George Wasserman\u2019s office and took property from a safe there. He contended he did so with Wasserman\u2019s consent. The ownership of the property was made a major issue in the case, and the court\u2019s charge dealt with the matter at length. The court instructed the jury to the effect that Wasserman\u2019s consent could not excuse the defendant if the property belonged to a corporation and not to Wasserman.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-25\"> This was error. An intent to steal is an essential ingredient of the crimes charged. If the defendant entered the place and took the property with the consent of a man he believed to be its owner, the defendant had no intent to steal.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-26\">The defendant\u2019s trial counsel, unlike his present counsel, failed to point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>out exactly why the charge was wrong. He said: \u201cit is counsel\u2019s position that if the defendant Mills did it with the consent of Wasserman that he is. not guilty.\u201d This statement required a qualification that counsel did not add, to this effect; \u201cprovided the defendant believed Was-serman to be the owner of the property.\u201d But in Screws v. United States counsel had taken no exception to an erroneous charge, and the Supreme Court said; \u201cwhere the error is so fundamental as not to submit to the jury the essential ingredients of the only offense on which the conviction could rest, we think it is necessary to take note of it on our own motion.\u201d 325 U.S. 91, 107, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 1038, 89 L.Ed. 1495. The error in this case was fundamental. It follows that we must reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">In the opinion of a majority of this court, the District Court did not err in denying a motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
