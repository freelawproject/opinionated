The plaintiff, Sharpies\u2019 insurance carrier, settled the damage claims arising from the accident and brought the present action against the defendant, Cope\u2019s insurance carrier, for a declaration that the defendant was primarily liable to pay the damage claims and for a judgment against the defendant for the amount thus paid by the plaintiff. The district court entered judgment for the plaintiff and the defendant appeals. We have carefully considered the defendant\u2019s contentions but find them wholly without merit. The questions involved were fully considered and correctly decided by the district court in the opinion filed by Chief Judge Kirkpatrick. 108 F.Supp. 221. We need add nothing thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-16\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
