Miessner filed an appeal to the Patent Office Board of Appeals from an examiner\u2019s rejection of a claim in his patent application, and paid the required appeal fee of $25.00. He later learned that on the same day\u2014 whether before or after he took the appeal does not appear \u2014 the examiner withdrew the final rejection by allowing the appealed claim. This action gave him the relief sought by the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-24\">On the theory that he had paid the fee of $25.00 by mistake because the appeal became unnecessary on the day he filed it, Miessner requested the Commissioner of Patents to refund the money. The Commissioner refused, whereupon Miessner brought this suit against the United States to recover the amount of the fee. He appeals from the District Court\u2019s order of dismissal entered pursuant to the Government\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-25\">It is provided in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 42 that \u201c* x x the Commissioner may refund any sum paid by mistake or in excess of the fee required by law.\u201d Appellant argues that this statute manda-torily requires the repayment of money paid by mistake; that the fee here involved was paid by mistake; that therefore he is entitled to judgment against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>the United States. If the quoted statutory provision is mandatory \u2014 which we do not decide \u2014 it is still the function of the Commissioner to decide whether the sum sought to be recovered was paid by mistake. Here the Commissioner decided \u2014 correctly, we think \u2014 the appeal fee was not paid by mistake. That being true, he was not obliged to make the refund, and the United States cannot be held liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">FAHY, Circuit Judge, concurs on the ground the District Court lacked jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
