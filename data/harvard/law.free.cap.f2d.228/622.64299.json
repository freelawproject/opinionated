The incident happened, according to the record, on October 16, 1945, but the case was not tried for approximately nine years. In the argument counsel for appellee was interrogated as to the delay and stated it was due to appellee\u2019s circumstances in the service and otherwise, and there is no plea of limitations. The matter was heard by the Court below without a jury and resulted in judgment for appellee in the sum of $10,000 \u2014 $5,000 for pain and suffering and a similar amount for disability and loss of earnings. Both the issues of fact and the law were fully considered and, we think, correctly decided by the lower Judge in an able opinion reported in Hopper v. Ross, D.C., 123 F.Supp. 371; and the judgment appealed from is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b670-29\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
