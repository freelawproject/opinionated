Construction of the sentence entered by one of its courts is primarily the ultimate responsibility of the Louisiana Supreme Court. It has determined <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the sentence was clearly intended to be, and therefore is, consecutive. If, in view of this action, any matter is left open for us in construing the sentence, we would ourselves agree with the Louisiana Courts; the intent is clear that sentence on the second charge is to commence after expiration of the service of sentence on the first, and so on down through the charges following in numerical sequence.
