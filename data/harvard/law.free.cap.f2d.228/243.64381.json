That holding, we think, was proper, since the letters \u201cfax\u201d not only appear as the final syllable of such common words as Fairfax and Halifax, but also,' as shown by the record, form the final syllable of \u00e1 number of trade-marks which have been registered to various companies for medicinal preparations, the app\u00e9llant\u2019s case, therefore, must depend not upon any proprietary interest in the syllable \u201cfax,\u201d but upon whether any one or more of the registrations relied on'by it is of such a nature that its use on the goods specified concurrently with appellee\u2019s Use of \u201cLip-ofax\u201d on its goods \u25a0would be likely to result in confusion in the trade. In determining that question, the marks must be considered' individually rather than collectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The registration principally relied on here by the appellant is No. 439,113 for the word- \u201cTimofax\u201d as a trade-mark for a \u201cfungicidal preparation for external use only.\u201d The appellant points out that \u201cTimofax\u201d and \u201cLipofax\u201d are both three syllable, words having the final syllable \u201cfax\u201d and a middle letter \u201co\" and each having \"i\" as the middle letter of its first syllable. However, each mark must be considered as a whole and, when so considered they are clearly distinguishable' both in appearance and sound. \u2019 While- prior decisions may serv\u00e9 as gen\u00e9ral guides, the' question of confusing similarity between any two particular marks must be determined in the final analysis largely on the basis of opinion. United-Carr Fastener Corp. v. Capewell Mfg. Co., 189 F.2d 1000, 38 C.C.P.A:, Patents, 1153, and authorities there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">It is noted that \u201cLipofax,\u201d as indicated by the specimens included in appellee\u2019s application, is in the form of tablets which are \u201cTo be dispensed only by or on the prescription of a physician,\u201d while \u201cTimofax\u201d is a fungicidal preparation which is used externally only. In view of that difference in the goods to which the two marks are applied, and of the significant differences between'the marks themselves, we are' of the opinion that their concurrent use would not be likely to result in confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">The remaining registrations relied on by appellant are as follows: No. 399,607, \u201cBorofax,\u201d for a borated ointment for external use; No. 399,608, \u201cSketofax,\u201d for an insectifuge to prevent the attacks of mosquitoes, gnats, sandflies, etc.; No. 399,610, \u201cTannafax,\u201d for a product used in the treatment of burns and scalds; No. 500.078, \u201cCarofax,\u201d for an ointment used in the treatment of bums and scalds; No. 500,080, \u201cMenthofax,\" for an ointment for the treatment of muscular pains, sprains and painful joints; and No. 440,859, \u201cLubafax,\u201d for a surgical lubricant.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">The registrations just listed are not discussed individually in the appellant\u2019s brief. The one which most closely approaches' the appellee\u2019s mark, \u201cLipofax,\u201d is \u201cLubafax.\u201d While those two marks have certain definite similarities, the goods to which they are applied, namely, medicinal tablets and a surgical lubricant, .are quite different, and we agree with the Examiner-in-Chief that their use on the goods specified would not be likely to result in confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">The remainder of appellant's marks are not thought to require separate discussion. All of them are applied to preparations for external use, and none of them approximates the appellee\u2019s mark as closely.as do .\u201cTimofax\u201d and \u201cLuba-fax.\u201d We therefore agree with the Patent Office tribunals that such marks are not confusingly similar to \u201cLipofax.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">The decision appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">JACKSON, J., retired, recalled to participate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
