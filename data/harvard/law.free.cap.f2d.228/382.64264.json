The contention is that Richard Yaw \u201cknowingly and fe-loniously aided and abetted\u201d one Peltier in acquiring them. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. It is not questioned that Peltier did acquire them \u201con or about November 30, 1954\u201d in violation of the statute and the sole question here is whether there is evidence that Richard aided and abetted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Peltier\u2019s acquiring them. Here the charge is not aiding and abetting the \u201csale\u201d of the ten packages of cigarettes, a separate offense, nor of a \u201ctrafficking\u201d in such cigarettes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">There is no testimony whatever that Richard Yaw ever saw or even knew of the existence of Peltier. Richard, a lad of 19 years of age, was the younger brother of Robert Yaw. On September 30, 1954 at about 3 o\u2019clock P.M. one Cho, an undercover police officer, sought to acquire some marihuana cigarettes from Richard. Richard, who did not know Cho was an officer, said he did not have any but advised Cho that his brother Robert might get some for him. Through Richard\u2019s communicating with Robert, Cho met him at seven o\u2019clock that evening. This was Richard\u2019s last connection with the transaction, Richard not being present at the evening meeting. Undoubtedly Richard could have been charged with aiding and abetting Cho in his subsequent acquiring of the cigarettes as a \u201ctransferee\u201d from Pel-tier, but this is not the charge of the indictment, Cho\u2019s name not appearing in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">When Cho met Robert that evening Robert had Peltier with him. Cho paid $10.00 to Peltier for ten cigarettes and the three drove in a car for some blocks and then stopped. Peltier left the car and disappeared. Returning, he handed Cho the cigarettes. The United States contends that though Richard never heard of Peltier, he nevertheless \u201cknowingly\u201d aided and abetted Peltier in becoming a \u201ctransferee\u201d acquiring the cigarettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\"> Even assuming this contention be correct, it is obvious that to sustain its burden of proof the United States must show that Peltier became a transferee and acquired the cigarettes <em>after </em>3 P.M. of September 30, 1954, when Richard first acted m the transaction of this there is no evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">When Peltier left the car he well may have gone to obtain the cigarettes from where he kept a supply of them which he had acquired a long time <em>before </em>3 P.M., September 30, 1954, Peltier\u2019s confession being that he acquired them \u201con or about\u201d that day. The phrase \u201con or about\u201d a date stated in the indictment as fixing the time of the crime, is held by the Second Circuit to be within a few weeks of the \u201con or about\u201d date. United States v. Tramaglino, 2 Cir., 197 F.2d 928, certiorari denied 1952, 344 U.S. 864, 73 S.Ct. 105, 97 L.Ed. 670. In the Third Circuit proof of a felonious sale of liquor on March 4th or 5th was held sufficient on an indictment charging it to have occurred \u201con or about the 11th day of March, 1921\u201d. Thompson v. United States, 3 Cir., 1922, 283 F. 895, 896. The Supreme Court, in Ledbetter v. United States, 170 U.S. 606, at page 612, 18 S.Ct. 774, at page 776, 42 L.Ed. 1162, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-13\">\u201cNeither is it necessary to prove that the offense was committed upon the day alleged, unless a particular day be made material by the statute creating the offense. Ordinarily, proof of any day before the finding of the indictment, and within the statute of limitations, will be sufficient.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-14\">It is significant that the United States did not produce Peltier as a witness, he having plead guilty and hence his testimony as to when he acquired the cigarettes could not incriminate him. A witness available to the prosecution to maintain its burden of proof which it does not produce or explain why it cannot, is presumed one who would testify against the Government.
