After filing findings of fact and conclusions of law, the District Court remanded the case to the Board for rehearing in accordance therewith. From this order the members of the Board appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AMS\">We think the remand should be without qualification so that the Board, after hearing additional evidence, may make the initial decision on the enlarged factual situation, subject of course to review by the District Court at the instance of any person aggrieved thereby. The order on appeal will be modified accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-22\">Remanded with instructions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-23\">.
