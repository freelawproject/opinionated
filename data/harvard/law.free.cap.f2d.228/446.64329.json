Petitioners\u2019 pertinent allegations are: The child was born out of wedlock in 1949. The natural father, who is white, has never supported the child and his whereabouts are unknown. The mother, a housewife, is white; she consents to adoption by the stepfather, a Negro, whom she married in 1951. The child has no income or property and has lived with petitioners since their marriage. The stepfather is a taxicab driver by occupation. He and his wife have supported and carefully reared the child as their own.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-25\">The District Court referred the petition to the Board of Public Welfare for investigation and recommendation pursuant to former \u00a7 16-201 of the District of Columbia Code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Noting that the \u201cal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>legations of the petition are true,\u201d the Board reported the following additional information. Two children have been born of petitioners\u2019 marriage. The couple are \u201cequally fond of the three children,\u201d all of whom \u201cappear well cared for.\u201d This observation was supported by letters of reference which indicated that \u201cpetitioners are happily married and are giving loving care to their three children.\u201d The stepfather attended law school for three years and expects to complete his studies as soon as he is financially able. He and his wife live in a Government housing project at a rental of $44 per month. Their home is adequately furnished and clean. Because of their refusal \u201cto sign the loyalty declaration required of all tenants in Federal Housing,\u201d their eviction was ordered in Municipal Court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The Board recommended \u201cthat the prayers of the petition be granted, if the court rules that a decision can be made while the eviction issue involving loyalty declaration is still unsettled.\u201d The District Court observed, in its memorandum opinion, that \u201cOrdinarily such an adoption [of a child born out of wedlock] should be not only approved but encouraged.\u201d But it felt constrained to deny adoption here because of \u201ctwo serious circumstances\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">\u201cIt appears from the report of the Department of Public Welfare that the parents * * * have refused to sign the loyalty declaration required of all tenants in [Federal housing] projects * * * \u201cAnother problem arises out of the fact that the stepfather is a colored man, while the mother and boy are white people. This situation gives rise to a difficult social problem. The boy when he grows up might lose the social status of a white man by reason of the fact that by record his father will be a negro if this adoption is approved. I feel the court should not fashion the child\u2019s future in this manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">We hold that denial of the adoption petition is erroneous and requires reversal. This proceeding is governed by former \u00a7 16-203 of the District of Columbia Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That section provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdMf\">\u201cAfter considering the petition, the consents, and such evidence as the parties and any other properly interested person may wish to present, the court may enter a final decree of adoption if it is satisfied (a) that adoptee is physically, mentally, and otherwise suitable for adoption by the petitioner; (b) that the petitioner is fit and able to give the adoptee a proper home and education; and (c) that the change will be for the best interests of adoptee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6K\">Under this statute, the \u201cprimary duty\u201d of the District Court is \u201cto determine the best interests of the infant.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Petitioners\u2019 refusal \u201cto sign the loyalty declaration\u201d \u2014 that they are not members of any of the organizations listed by the Attorney General under authority of Executive Order 9835, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 631 note <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2014 provides no support for a deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>mination that the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the child would be served by denial of the adoption. The courts may not regard such refusal as an adverse reflection upon character.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Nor can denial of the adoption rest on a distinction between the \u201csocial status\u201d of whites and Negroes. There may be reasons why a difference in race, or religion, may have relevance in adoption proceedings. But that factor alone cannot be decisive in determining the child\u2019s welfare.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It does not permit a court to ignore all other relevant considerations. Here we think those other considerations have controlling weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The child is living in the happy home of its natural mother and stepfather, receiving the same loving care they give to the two children born of their marriage. That it is in the best interests of the child to live in that home with Ue natural mother is obvious. It is equally plain that the child will continue to live there no matter what disposition is made of this case. Hence denial of adoption could only serve the harsh and unjust end of depriving the child of a legitimatized status in that home.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Reversed and remanded to the District Court with directions to grant the petition for adoption.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-26\">. The law in effect at the time this petition was filed required that (1) the \u201cpetitioner\u2019s spouse [join] in the petition or [consent] to the adoption\u201d; (2) the natural mother consent. D.C.Code, \u00a7\u00a7 16-201, 16-202 (1951), later repealed, 68 Stat. 246 (1954). The mother\u2019s joinder and notation of consent here were apparently an effort to comply with both requirements. The new adoption act passed in 1954 retains the requirement of consent but eliminates the necessity of joinder by a petitioner\u2019s spouse who is a natural parent of the adoptee. 68 Stat. 241, D.C.Code, \u00a7 16-211 (Supp.1954).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"ABd\">. That section, as part of the old adoption law, was repealed after the institution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>of this proceeding. This case is unaffected by the repeal. The 1954 adoption act provides that \u201c* * * all proceedings instituted and pending [on the date of enactment of this Act] shall be carried to their final determination in accordance with former sections 16-201 to 16-207 * * D.C.Code, \u00a7 16-225 (Supp.1954).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b495-10\">. This section, like \u00a7 16-201, was repealed after this suit began, but the validity of this proceeding is not impaired. Note 2, supra. In substance, former \u00a7 16-203 was re-enacted in the new adoption act. 68 Stat. 244, D.C.Code, \u00a7 16-218 (b) (Supp.1954).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b495-13\">.

This loyalty declaration was requested by the Public Housing authorities purporting to act under the Gwinn Amendment which provides that no housing unit constructed under the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended, \u201cshall be occupied by a person who is a member of an organization designated as subversive by the Attorney General * * 66 Stat. 403 (1952), 67 Stat. 307 (1953), 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1411c.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b496-7\">. Unlike some other statutes, the District of Columbia law does not prohibit interracial adoptions. See Comment, Moppets on the Market: The Problem of Unregulated Adoptions, 59 Yale L.J. 715, 722 n. 36 (1950). It merely requires a statement of the race of petitioner and the adoptee or his natural parents. D.C.Code, \u00a7 16-214 (Supp.1954), formerly \u00a7 16-201 (1951). Even under a statute, G.L.Mass.(Ter.Ed.) c. 210, \u00a7 5B, added by St.1950, c. 737, \u00a7 3, directing that a court \u201c \u2018when practicable must give custody only to persons of the same religious faith as that of the child\u2019 \u201d, it has been held that \u201cidentity of religion should [not] be the sole or necessarily the principal consideration.\u201d Petition of Gaily, 1952, 329 Mass. 143, 148, 107 N.E.2d 21, 24, 25. Cf. Petition of Goldman, 1954, 331 Mass. 647, 121 N.E.2d 843, certiorari denied 1955, 348 U.S. 942, 75 S.Ct. 363.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"Ar-\">. No guardian ad litem was appointed to represent the interests of the adoptee. D.Ct. Rule 50(c). See Barnes v. Paanakker, 1940, 72 App.D.C. 39, 43-44, 111 F.2d 193, 197-198. While such representation is not mandatory in every ease, In re Adoption of a Minor, 1941, 74 App.D.C. 50, 51, 120 F.2d 720, 721, it may be advisable procedure, where, as in this case, there are no adverse parties and, despite the favorable recommendation of the Board of Public Welfare, the District Court is disposed to deny the petition for adoption. Since we conclude here that all the evidence relevant to the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the child firmly points in the direction of adoption, we see no reason to remand now for the \u201cmere formalism\u201d of appointing a guardian.
