The voluminous record does not bear out this charge. Nevertheless, Judge Weinfeld, the trial judge, granted him a full hearing, at which both he and the attorney testified at length; and then the judge wrote a careful and reasoned opinion denying the motion. United States v. Sumpter, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 111 F.Supp. 507. Thereafter he has patiently considered and decided several applications for a rehearing. Appellant has had much more than an adequate hearing of a claim which is fundamentally without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
