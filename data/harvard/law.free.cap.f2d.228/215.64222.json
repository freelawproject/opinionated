We think, on the contrary, that the evidence fully supports the findings of fact, that the car was unlawfully used without the consent of the owner, and that it was unlawfully taken into possession and used by Roach in violation of the Texas statute invoked. Brickell v. State, 138 Tex.Cr.R. 101, 134 S.W.2d 262. .</p>\n<p id=\"b264-18\">The judgment was right. It is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-12\">. \u201cArt. 1841.
