They charged that the Director of the United States Geological Survey had furnished them with erroneous information, on which they had relied to their detriment in later selling certain stock at less than its true valu\u00e9. Their complaint, in separately stated causes of action, alleged both deceit and negligence. The trial judge dismissed the complaint. D.C.1952, 120 F.Supp. 894. The Second Circuit affirmed. Jones v. United States, 1953, 207 F.2d 563, certiorari denied 347 U.S. 921, 74 S.Ct. 518, 98 L.Ed. 1075, rehearing denied 1954, 347 U.S. 940, 74 S.Ct. 627, 98 L.Ed. 1089.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-20\">Later, plaintiffs-appellants brought the present suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Their complaint was couched in substantially the same terms as the cause of action for \u201cnegligence\u201d alleged in the prior one. It said that the Director failed to exercise due care and was negligent in-failing to furnish, plaintiffs'\u201cwith th\u00e9 actual data or estimate Of the ultimate recoverable reserves then in the custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>and record of the Survey at the time\u201d; it further alleged that they were entitled by law to the requested information under 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 488-489. The District Court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. 1954, 126 F.Supp. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Clearly, this second suit is barred as res judicata. The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed on that ground. Stoll v. Gottlieb, 1938, 305 U.S. 165, 172, 59 S.Ct. 134, 83 L.Ed. 104. We need not discuss the other points raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">So ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
