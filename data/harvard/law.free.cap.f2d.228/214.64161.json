No recoverable claim, however, was stated as to defendant. The judgment dismissing the intervention as to it is, therefore, affirmed with costs to defendant against the plaintiff-appellant because, having failed to prosecute it, its appeal is dismissed, and against the intervenor-ap-peliant because, as to the defendant, the judgment he appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-18\">Plaintiff\u2019s appeal is Dismissed. On in-tervenor\u2019s appeal the judgment is affirmed as to defendant and reversed as to plaintiff.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b263-12\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, Rule 24, Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. 28 U.S.C.; Hunt Tool Co. v.
