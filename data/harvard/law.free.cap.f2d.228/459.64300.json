(Oregon) and denied that of the appellant, Columbia Empire Telecasters, Inc. (Columbia). Columbia appeals. 66 Stat. 718, \u00a7 402, 47 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-18\">Columbia contends Oregon was not shown to be financially qualified. An element of Oregon\u2019s financing was to be a bank loan. The bank\u2019s commitment to make the loan depended upon its being guaranteed by each of Oregon\u2019s five directors, and it did not appear that they agreed to guarantee it. But it did appear that they favored the loan, and we think the Commission\u2019s inference that they would guarantee it was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-19\">The Journal Publishing Company, publisher of the Oregon Journal, and its wholly-owned radio subsidiary KPOJ, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Inc., owned 40% of the stock of Columbia and had an option to buy 7%%. They were entitled, by contract with other stockholders, to be proportionately represented on Columbia\u2019s board of directors. The chairman of Columbia\u2019s board was President and Director of the Journal Company and of KPOJ. Columbia\u2019s Treasurer was a Vice President, Assistant Secretary, and Director of KPOJ. KPOJ obtained the proposed transmitter site and location for Columbia. Columbia\u2019s proposed television station was to be identified as KPOJ-TV and called the Journal station. The Commission recognized that the Journal and KPOJ had an \u201coutstanding record of performance * * * in meeting and giving expression to the needs of the Portland community. The record shows that the programming of said stations and the operation of the newspaper have been responsive to the needs of the Portland community and that the needs of the community have been fulfilled on a continuing basis.\u201d The Commission found that \u201cmany of the local programs proposed by Columbia are television presentations of programs now broadcast by Station KPOJ which are, in some instances, also adaptations of Journal departments and projects; and the television station of Columbia would use the features and talent of the Journal and KPOJ, including the news gathering facilities of the Journal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Columbia complains that the Commission said KPOJ and the Journal had only a \u201crelatively small voice\u201d in Columbia\u2019s affairs, and also said the excellent record of KPOJ and the Journal was not a \u201cdecisional factor\u201d. But despite their large stock ownership, it did not appear that KPOJ and the Journal would actually control Columbia. Other stockholders elected a majority of the directors. As regards actual operating control, there is support for the finding of a \u201crelatively small voice\u201d. And the Commission apparently gave some consideration to the record of KPOJ and the Journal, since it found that neither Columbia nor Oregon was entitled to a preference in regard to \u201cawareness of and responsiveness to the needs of the community\u201d although it found that in regard to local ownership and stockholder participation in operation, which, as the Commission recognized, affect awareness and responsiveness, Oregon was entitled to preference.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The Commission found that Oregon was entitled to preference as to programming, including diversified expression of local activities and interests, and diversification of control of the media of mass communication. It found that Columbia was entitled to preference as to radio and television experience. It concluded that \u201cin view of Oregon\u2019s manifest superiority with respect to the critical factors of program proposals and diversification of control of the media of mass communications, * * * upon consideration of the entire record in this proceeding, the public interest, convenience and necessity would be best served by a grant of the application of Oregon Television, Inc. * * * \u201d Columbia says this conclusion with regard to \u201cdiversification of control of the media\u201d contradicts the Commission\u2019s finding that the Journal and KPOJ had only a \u201crelatively small voice\u201d in Columbia\u2019s affairs. We think not. However small their \u201cvoice\u201d in Columbia\u2019s affairs may have been, Columbia was not, as Oregon was, \u201cdissociated from existing media of mass communication\u201d, Scripps-Howard Radio v. Federal Communications Commission, 89 U.S.App.D.C. 13, 19, 189 F.2d 677, 683, and the Journal and KPOJ owned enough Columbia stock to \u201cbear upon the concentration of media\u201d. Plains Radio Broadcasting Co. v. Federal Communications Commission, 85 U.S.App.D.C. 48, 52, 175 F.2d 359, 363. Cf. 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 3.35(b), 3.240(b), and 3.-636(a) (2). We think this is what the Commission meant when it spoke of \u201cdiversification of the control of the media\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">We think it unnecessary to discuss Columbia\u2019s other contentions. We do not find that the Commission ignored factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>that required consideration or acted arbitrarily in choosing between the applicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">FAHY, Circuit Judge, concurs in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
