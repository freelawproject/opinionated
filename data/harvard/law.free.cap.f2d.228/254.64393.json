Matthew M. Adler, Ltd., 78 U.S.P.Q. 290, and Goldring, Inc., v. The Printz-Biederman Company, 89 U.S.P.Q. 285. In the former case the mark \u201cTowne Deb,\u201d \u201cTowne\u201d being disclaimed, was held to be confusingly similar to \u201cTownley,\u201d and in the latter case \u201cZip-Townster\u201d was held confusingly similar to \u201cTownley.\u201d However, the examiner was of the opinion appellant was estopped by laches from asserting that it would be damaged by the appellee\u2019s registration, and accordingly dismissed the petition for cancellation.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The Assistant Commissioner, without referring specifically to the decisions cited by the Examiner of Interferences, held that \u201cTownley\u201d and \u201cTown-Moor\u201d were not confusingly similar; that there were no other facts from which damage to the appellant could be presumed; and accordingly affirmed the action of the examiner without passing on the question of laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The primary question raised by this appeal is whether the marks involved are confusingly similar. If they are not, the decision appealed from must be affirmed; if they are, the question of laches must be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">It is to be noted that the word \u201cTown-ley,\u201d although it has allegedly acquired a secondary meaning as identifying appellant\u2019s goods, appears to be primarily a surname and would be recognized as such, whereas \u201cTown-Moor\u201d is apparently a coined mark. It is asserted by appellant that the final syllable of \u201cTown-ley\u201d is derived from the word \u201clea,\u201d and that \u201cTownley\u201d therefore means \u201ctown meadow\u201d and has substantially the same meaning as \u201cTown-Moor.\u201d Assuming, however, that the name \u201cTownley\u201d has the derivation suggested, we are of the opinion that it would not be generally understood as having any connection with a meadow. The word \u201clea\u201d is of comparatively rare occurrence and is not ordinarily associated with the \u201cley\u201d which forms part of many such common surnames as Buckley, Bradley, Foley, Stanley, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">The only similarity between the marks here under consideration resides in the word \u201cTown,\u201d and it is apparent from the record that that word is commonly used as a part of trade-marks or trade-names for various kinds of merchandise, including clothing. Under such circumstances appellant can have no exclusive right to the use of the word \u201cTown\u201d <em>per se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">While it is well settled that, in determining the question of confusing similarity, the marks involved must be considered as a whole, it has been repeatedly held that marks will not ordinarily be considered confusingly similar if they resemble each other only by the inclusion of a word which is in the public domain.

Van Camp Sea Food Co., Inc., 142 F.2d 274, 31 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1029 (Gem-of-the-Sea and Chicken of the Sea); Valpo Co. v. Solis, Entrialgo y Compania, 175 F.2d 457, 36 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1160 (Love Lane and Forbidden Love); Rite-Rite Mfg. Co. v. Rite-Craft Co., 181 F.2d 226, 37 C.C.P.A., Patents, 963 (Rite-Rite and Rite-Craft) ; In re Blue Lake Producers Cooperative, 194 F.2d 126, 39 C.C.P.A., Patents, 805 (Oregon\u2019s Finest and Oregon Fruit Products), and Schaffner &amp; Marx v. Empire Mfg. Co., 197 F.2d 558, 39 C.C.P.A., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Patents, 1042 (Dixie. Leader and Dixie Weave).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">As above noted, appellant\u2019s mark \u201cTownley\u201d has been held by former Assistant Commissioners to be confusingly similar to both \u201cTowne Deb\u201d and \u201cZip-Townster,\u201d but it does not appear that the common use of the word \u201cTown\u201d in trade-marks and trade-names was brought out in either of those cases. However, assuming those decisions are in conflict with that of the Assistant Commissioner in the instant case, they must be regarded as having been overruled thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Upon consideration of the instant marks in their entireties, and in accordance with the principles above noted, we are of the opinion that such marks are not confusingly similar, and that appellant\u2019s petition for cancellation of appellee\u2019s mark was therefore properly dismissed. It is accordingly unnecessary to consider the issue of laches as urged by appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The .decision appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">JACKSON, Judge, retired, recalled to participate.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-12\">.
