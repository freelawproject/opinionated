It concedes the use by it of the word \u201cCrown\u201d in connection with cakes known as \u201cginger snaps,\u201d and \u201cJamestown\u201d with cakes called \u201cjumbles,\u201d but denies that the trade has been deceived, or that any purchaser, either wholesale or retail, could have been misled by such use of these words.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">Confining our consideration to the precise issue presented by the pleadings, we are of opinion that the fair, result of the evidence shows that the respective businesses of these litigants are conducted, under distinct and wholly dissimilar corporate names and general trade-marks, the. plaintiff doing business as the Southern Biscuit Works, under a trade-mark consisting of a sheaf of wheat printed on a label in red, white, black and light blue; that in addition to this, as subsidiary word s3'inbols, the plaintiff has acquired the exclusive right to use the word \u201cCrown\u201d in connection with its soda cracker style of goods, and \u201cJamestown\u201d with a certain kind of cake known as \u201cdrops\u201d; that the defendant is operating under the corporate name of the Virginia Baking Company, and using a trade-mark consisting of the obverse of the great seal of the Commonwealth of Virginia on a red, white and blue label. It likewise employs the word \u201cCrown\u201d as a grade-symbol in connection with a small variety of cakes known as \u201cginger snaps.\u201d and the word \u201c Jamestown\u201d with cakes called \u201cjumbles.\u201d A \u201cjumble\u201d is four or five times as large, and is essentially a different cake from a \u201cdrop,\u201d having a hole in the center as large as the \u201cdrop\u201d itself. These several kinds of cakes are recognized in the trade as .distinctive classes of goods. The words \u201cCrown\u201d and \u201cJamestown\u201d are mere fanciful words and, standing alone, do not indicate \u201corigin and manufacture\u201d; nevertheless, in association with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>other words they have that effect and entitle the plaintiff to claim a trade-mark for the combination. <em>Manufacturing Co. </em>v. Trainer, 101 U. S. 51, 25 L. Ed. 993; <em>Corbin </em>v. Gould, 133 U. S. 308, 33 L. Ed. 611, 10 Sup. Ct. 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Conceding then the right of the plaintiff to the exclusive use of these words in the connection in which they occur and to the extent to which they have been appropriated and applied as against the defendant, the right is coextensive only <em>with such use. </em>If there be any foundation for the claim that it was the intention of the plaintiff to apply these trademarks to other products, it was an undisclosed purpose resting exclusively in the mind of the plaintiff, and could not affect the rights of the defendant who cannot be expected to anticipate that the plaintiff might in the future conclude to manufacture and place on the market a \u201cCrown\u201d ginger snap, or a \u201cJamestown\u201d jumble. The record affords no proof of misrepresentation or unfair dealing on the part of the defendant, and .the direct testimony adduced to show that the public has been misled by the alleged infringement of the plaintiff\u2019s trade-marks in the particulars complained of is extremely meagre and inconclusive. Indeed, we think it is apparent that none save the careless and inattentive could reasonably have been misled by the acts complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The doctrine in controversies of this sort is stated in <em>International Trust Company </em>v. <em>International Loan &amp; Trust </em>Company, 153 Mass. 271, 278, 26 N. E. 693, 695, 10 L. R. A. 758, as follows: \u201cIt is not sufficient that some person might possibly be misled, but the similarity must be such that \u2018any person, with such reasonable care and observation as the public generally are capable of using and may be expected to exercise, would mistake one for the other.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">In <em>White </em>v. Trowbridge, 216 Pa. 11, 61 Atl. 862, the court held: \u201cThe defendant will not be injoined from using certain trade-marks or labels, when they are not so similar to the ones used by the plaintiff, in appearance or in connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>of the words, as to deceive a person of ordinary intelligence,, using ordinary care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">In <em>Wrisley </em>v. <em>Iowa Soap </em>Co., (C. C. A.) 122 Fed. 796, the court said: \u201cBut he is not required to so distinguish his articles that careless and indifferent buyers will know by whom they are made or sold. His competitor has no better right to the monopoly of the trade of the negligent and indifferent than he has.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The rule is stated with equal emphasis by the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Coats </em>v. <em>Merrick Thread Co., </em>149 U. S. 562, 573, 37 L. Ed. 847, 13 Sup. Ct. 966, 970, Mr. Justice Brown, in delivering the unanimous opinion of the court in that case, observes: \u201cThere is no doubt a general resemblance between the heads of all spools containing a black and gold label, which might induce a careless purchaser to accept one for the other. Defendants, however, were not bound to any such degree of care as. would prevent this. . In short they could do little more than place their own name conspicuously upon the label, to rearrange the number by placing it in the border instead of the. center of the label, and to omit loops of the plaintiffs\u2019 periphery and\u2019 substitute their own star - between the numerals. Having done this, we think they are relieved from further responsibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">These decisions sufficiently illustrate the controlling principle in the present case, and, as applied to the evidence, are conclusive against the protensions of the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">The decree of the chancery court must, therefore, be reversed, the injunction dissolved, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
