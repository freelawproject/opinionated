Every person erecting, setting up, or using any such furnace or steam engine without the said permit, or in violation of any of the conditions, provisions, restrictions or regulations thereof, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof before the police justice, shall be fined not less than five nor more than twenty dollars, and each day\u2019s continuance of such misdemeanor shall be a separate offence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">On appeal to the hustings court, the ordinance was held to be in contravention of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, in that it vests in the city council arbitrary and unreasonable power.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Careful consideration of the condemned ordinance shows that it prescribes no fixed rules for the conduct of the businesses with which it undertakes to deal, applicable alike to all citizens who may bring themselves within its terms; but every person desiring to engage in such occupations must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>first obtain a permit from the city council, whose powers are undefined and absolute; and in default thereof shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. The ordinance prescribes no conditions upon which the permit may be granted, and furnishes no rules by which an impartial exercise of the power vested in the council may be secured. The discretion of that body is in no way regulated or. controlled, and is purely arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">It is no answer to these objections to say, \u201cthat it is time enough to complain of the ordinance when the power of the city council shall have been arbitrarily exercised.\u201d The test of the validity of a law is not what has been done, but what may be done under its provisions. As far as our investigation of the authorities has gone, they are practically unanimous in declaring invalid ordinances of this character as obnoxious to the equality and uniformity clause of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">The case of <em>Yick Wo </em>v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356, 30 L. Ed. 220, 6 Sup. Ct. 1064, is a controlling authority on the subject. For violation of ordinances of the city of San Francisco, in essentials similar to the ordinance under consideration, Yick Wo, a Chinese laundryman was convicted and fined. By <em>habeas corpus </em>proceeding the case was carried to the Supreme Court of the United States, where the ordinances were declared unconstitutional. Mr. Justice Matthews, in delivering the unanimous opinion of the court, on page 366, observes: \u201cThey seem to confer and actually do confer, not a discretion to be exercised upon a consideration of the circumstances of each case, but a naked and arbitrary power to give or withhold consent, not only as to places, but as to persons. So that, if an applicant for such consent, being in every way a competent and qualified person, and having complied with every reasonable condition demanded by any public interest, should, failing to obtain the requisite consent of the supervisors to 'the prosecution of his business, apply for redress by the judicial process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>of mandamus, to require the supervisors to consider and act upon his case, it would be a sufficient answer for them to say that the law had conferred upon them authority to withhold their assent, without reason and without responsibility. The power given to them is not confined to their discretion in the legal sense of that term, but is granted to their mere will. It is purely arbitrary, and acknowledges neither guidance nor restraint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-3\">The binding authority of that case is not affected by the suggestion that the San Francisco ordinances were aimed at Chinese laundrymen only. That, it is true, was one of the manifestations of the pernicious character of the legislation in the particular case; but the language of the ordinance there, as in this case, is general; and the decision of the court was not rested wholly on considerations of race discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">Without undertaking to review the authorities, we deem it sufficient to say that the question involved has been decided by the courts of last resort in many of the States, and the views expressed by the Supreme Court of the United States in the <em>Yick Wo case </em>have been steadfastly adhered to.
