H. Potts, the defendant\u2019s intestate, and C. W. Harris and B. E. Cogbill, and is owned by the Bank of Mecklenburg, of which the plaintiffs' are the receivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">The notice to sue relied on by the defendant was not a formal notice to the bank, but was contained in letters written by the defendant, as the administrator of E. H. Potts, deceased, to the cashier and president of the Bank of Mecklenburg. Neither the letters nor copies thereof were introduced in evidence, but the writer of the letters and the officers to whom they were written respectively testified to their contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">The defendant stated that some time after his decedent\u2019s death he was informed of the existence of the note sued on, and that it was held by the Bank of Mecklenburg. He about the same time learned that his decedent had made a settlement with Mr; Cogbill, one of the indorsers on the note, through his attorney, Mr. Faulkner, who was also president of the bank, in which his decedent had paid Mr. Cogbill his share of the note. The defendant thereupon wrote \u201cthe cashier of the bank at Boydton and explained the nature of the settlement and asked that such steps be at once taken by the bank as would release Mr. Potts\u2019 name on the note as surety. Subsequently I wrote to Mr. Faulkner as president-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>of the bank and urged that he take such action as would release Mr. Potts\u2019 name. I frequently talked with Mr. Faulkner with regard to his. bringing suit against Mr. Cogbill in order that the matter might be closed as I as administrator desired to close the administratorship of the Potts estate. The notices were in writing to Mr. Faulkner as president of the bank to bring suit or take such action against Cogbill so as to liberate Mr. Potts\u2019 name as surety.\u201d He further testified that he could not recall \u201cthe language of the different notices,, but they all urged the bank to take such action as was necessary to get Mr. Potts\u2019 name off the note.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">Mr. Overby, the cashier of the bank, in testifying to the contents of the letter to him, said that he could not state when he \u201creceived notice to bring suit, though it was some time after the maturity of the note. My recollection of the-contents of <em>notes </em>(notice), which was in writing, was to the effect that Mr. Gregory as administrator wished the bank to-take such steps as would relieve Mr. Potts\u2019 estate of any responsibility as endorser on note.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The testimony of the president of the bank, Mr. Faulkner,, as to the contents of the letters written to him is as follows: \u201cI remember on one occasion his (the defendant) writing to me in connection with some other matter that he wanted Mr. Potts\u2019 name gotten off the paper, and again last fall he not only spoke to me in person about it, but he wrote me a letter-especially on the point in which he stated that he wanted us to bring suit against Cogbill on the note. About the time I received this last letter, Mr. Cogbill had already gotten into-his troubles and I saw Mr. Gregory and asked him if he thought best to bring suit. He replied that he did not think that it was any use in bringing it now, that I had waited until too late.\u201d He further stated in reference to the conversations with the defendant and the contents of the letters received by him, that in every instance they were to the effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>that the defendant \u201cwished the bank to get Mr. Potts\u2019 name off the paper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Giving the defendant the benefit of the most favorable construction (as he is entitled to since the case is heard here as on a demurrer to the evidence) which can be placed upon his letters to the officers of the bank, as their contents are disclosed by the record, did they or either of them contain a clear and \u25a0explicit requirement for the bank \u201cforthwith to institute suit\u201d on the note?</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Unless the letters relied on as giving notice contained such a requirement to sue, the provisions of section 2890 of the Code were not complied with. That section is very stringent in its terms. The effect of failure to institute suit against \u25a0every party to such contract who resides in this State and is \u00a1not insolvent, after notice, is an absolute forfeiture of all \u25a0claims against every surety upon the contract. To the surety \u25a0giving the notice it is an absolute extinguishment of the debt. Code, sec. 2891. <em>Davis Admr. </em>v. <em>Snead, </em>33 Gratt. 705, 708-9. Before the creditor should be held to have forfeited all his rights under the contract against all the sureties for a failure to forthwith institute suit upon the contract, it ought \u25a0clearly to appear that the notice relied on to have that effect required suit forthwith to be instituted on the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Notice \u201cto take such action as was necessary to get Mr. Potts\u2019 name off the note,\u201d was not a. clear and explicit requirement to sue upon the note, as the surety might be relieved from liability on the note in various other ways. Neither was the direction or request in the letter to bring suit against Cog-bill, <em>one </em>of the parties to the note, a clear and explicit requirement to sue upon the note. The cases are numerous which hold that notice to discharge a surety must comply substantially with the statute and must show a clear, unequivocal and distinct demand upon or command to the creditor to institute suit upon the contract. See <em>Savage's Admr. </em>v. <em>Carleton, </em>33 Ala. 443; <em>Kaufman </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>29 Ind. 504; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number><em>Bates, &amp;c., </em>v. <em>State Bank, </em>7 Ark. 394, 46 Am. Dec. 293; <em>Parish </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>1 Hump. (Tenn.) 88; <em>Shimer </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>47 Penn. St. 268; <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Beardsly, </em>8 Wend. (N. Y.) 194; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Peterson, </em>64 Iowa 425, 20 N. W. 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">It follows from what has been said that we are of opinion that the notice relied on to bar the plaintiff\u2019s right against the defendant was not sufficient, and that the trial court erred in not so holding. Its judgment must, therefore, be reversed, and as all matters of law and fact were submitted to the trial court for its decision, this court will enter such judgment in favor of the plaintiffs as the trial court ought to have entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
