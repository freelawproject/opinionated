The only instructions given were asked by the defendant, and were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-8\">\u201cThe court instructs the jury that the fact that the directors of the defendant company requested the plaintiff, at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>meeting held July 27, 1908, to waive any claim for commissions, is not to be considered as an admission of the validity of such claim, unless made after the directors had knowledge of all the circumstances attending the sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">\u201cThe court instructs the jury that the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover in this action, unless they show by a preponderance of the evidence that they either consummated the sale referred to in the evidence, or were the procuring cause of said sale, that is, found the purchaser or introduced him to the defendant, or brought about the sale through their exertions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">\u201cIf the jury should believe that the attention of the purchaser was first called to said property by some person other than the plaintiffs, or their agents, and that the sale was subsequently consummated by the defendant without the aid or intervention of the plaintiff's, they must find for the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">\u201cThe court instructs the jury that the plaintiff's in this action are not entitled to recover of the defendant for any services which Mr. A. P. Page may have rendered as secretary of the defendant company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">The contention made by counsel for the defendant in their reply brief, that the plaintiff's cannot recover in this action for the reason that it was not shown at the trial that their contract, with the defendant gave them \u201cthe exclusive right of sale,\u201d is not, in our opinion, either upon reason or authority, sustained. The defendant corporation was a land company, engaged in the buying and selling of real estate for a profit, oAvning the property in question and other property, which it desired to sell, while the plaintiff's were licensed real estate agents or brokers, whose business was the selling of real estate for a commission on the purchase money realized by the owners of the property they sold; and in this and like cases, as the authorities practically agree, if the real estate agent or broker is the procuring cause of the sale, he is entitled to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>commission agreed on, or to recover for his services on a <em>quantum meruit; </em>and whether or not the agent or broker was the procuring cause of the sale is a question for the jury. <em>Arents </em>v. Casselman, 110 Va. 509, 66 S. E. 820, 23 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. L. (2nd ed.), 911, and authorities there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">\u2022 As-the evidence is to be considered here as upon a demurrer by the defendant thereto, we deem it only necessary t-o say, that there was evidence amply sufficient to sustain the verdict of the jury, giving credit to the witnesses for the plaintiffs rather than to those of the defendant, which verdict the learned judge of the trial court approved and entered judgment thereon; and, therefore, upon well settled principles, the judgment has to be affirmed. <em>Arents </em>v.
