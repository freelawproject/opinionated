That the property so denominated as stock in trade was delivered to the defendants, Adolph Aspegren and John Aspegren, as the original purchasers thereof, and the complaint in this action (meaning the original complaint) was framed and served upon the theory that the transfer of said stock in trade was covered by the clause in the agreement of the date of July 13, 1906, above set forth stipulating that title was to be taken to the Portsmouth Cotton Oil Refining Corporation, and this amended complaint is made and served to correct such theory and to allege, and the plaintiff does allege, that it, said plaintiff, makes no personal claim against, the defendant, Portsmouth Cotton Oil Refining Corporation, on account of any of the matters set up in the complaint or in this amended complaint; that the plaintiff intends to and will take such steps as are required by law and by the rules and practice of this court to discontinue this action as against said defendant, Portsmouth Cotton Oil Refining Corporation.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b787-4\">\u201cAnd the defendant further avers that upon the said motion and filing of said amended complaint leave was granted by the said Supreme Court of the State of New York, Niagara county, to the plaintiff, to discontinue its said action against this defendant, and the same was accordingly so discontinued, and the said action continued against said Aspegren and Company alone and is still pending in said court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b787-5\">\u201cAnd this the. said defendant is ready to verify; wherefore it prays judgment if the said plaintiff ought to be admitted against its own acknowledgment and admission by the pleadings and affidavit aforesaid, to say that the stock in trade men<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>tioned in its declaration herein was transferred and delivered to this defendant, and that this defendant undertook and promised to pay the plaintiff for the same, or became liable in any way to pay the plaintiff for the same.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b788-4\"><em>\u25a0J.

That agreement is fully set out in the case of <em>Oliver Refining Company </em>v. <em>Portsmouth Cotton Oil Refining Corporation and another, </em>109 Va. 513, 64 S. E. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">It is a concessum in this case that under that agreement the defendant in this case was the purchaser of and liable for \u201cthe stock in trade\u201d mentioned therein, and .which is the subject matter of this suit, but the principal ground of defense relied on is that the defendant was relieved from that liability by a subsequent agreement made in August, 1906, known as the \u201cMemorandum Agreement,\u201d and which is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-9\">\u201cMemorandum. \u2014 In the matter of the purchase of certain land and personal property by Portsmouth Cotton Oil Refining Corporation from the Oliver Refining Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-10\">\u201cThe parties to this agreement being about to pass the deeds relating to this property, and some unsettled matters not having been provided for, it is understood and agreed that those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>matters, to-wit, the matter of the repairs to the thirty-one (31) tank cars; of the repairs to the cooperage floor; and the matter of the commissions due to or claimed by Aspegren and Company for the sale of the said property, are to be hereafter adjusted between Aspegren and Company and the Oliver Refining Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-4\">\u201cIt is further understood that the taxes upon the land and property sold, for the year 1906, are to be prorated between the seller and the purchaser; that is to say, the Oliver Refining Company will pay the whole of the taxes on all of the property owned by it for the year 1906, and after an adjustment of the proportion to be paid by the Portsmouth Company said Portsmouth Company will repay to the Oliver Refining Company a proper proportion of the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-5\">\u201cPending the adjustment of these matters, the personal property on the premises mentioned in the contract of sale will be, and is hereby, delivered to Aspegren and Company as the original purchasers thereof; the amounts, if any, due to Aspegren and Company or the Portsmouth Cotton Oil Refining Corporation to be promptly paid to them, and the amounts, if any, found to be due the Oliver Refining Company, to be promptly paid to them.

This action of the court is assigned as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">The court properly refused to permit that plea to be filed.. The facts stated therein as to the proceedings had in the-Supreme Court of the State of New York in the case of <em>Oliver Refining Company </em>v. <em>Aspegren and </em>Company, <em>and Portsmouth Cotton Oil Refining </em>Corporation, did not amount to a retraxit, but was a mere discontinuance or dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s action against the Portsmouth Cotton Oil Refining\u2019 Corporation, and was no bar to a future action against that company. See <em>Coffman &amp; Richardson </em>v. Russell, 4 Munf. 207; Muse, &amp;c. v. <em>Farmers </em>Bank, 27 Gratt. 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The next question is: \u201cDid the memorandum agreement have-the effect of releasing the defendant from its liability to pay for \u201cthe stock in trade,\u201d under the agreement of July 13, 1906?</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">The construction of the memorandum agreement is not entirely free from difficulty, but looking at the language employed, the subject matter and the surrounding circumstances <em>(Bank of the Old Dominion </em>v. McVeigh, 32 Gratt. 530, 538), we do not think it was the intention that the defendant should' be released from its purchase of \u201cthe stock in trade\u201d under the-contract of July 13, 1906, and thereby to sell that property to Aspegren <em>&amp; </em>Co., but the object was to postpone the time for its delivery to the defendant until the parties could settle or adjust their differences; and that, in the meantime, Aspegren &amp; Co. should hold \u201cthe stock in trade,\u201d to secure the payment of any sum that might be found due them upon such-adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">The defendant not haying been released by that agreement from its contract to purchase \u201cthe stock in trade,\u201d was the-plaintiff entitled to recover the price and value thereof at the time it brought this action ?</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">If Aspegren &amp; Co. had been in the possession of \u201cthe stock in trade\u201d at that time, and the defendant had not received the benefit of its purchase, it may well be doubted whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>the plaintiff could have maintained this action. But that is not this case. It does not appear that Aspegren &amp; Co. ever had actual possession of \u201cthe stock in trade\u201d or ever exercised any control whatever over it. On the contrary, it clearly appears \u2014 indeed, it is agreed \u2014 that \u201cthe stock in trade\u201d was delivered at the defendant\u2019s plant by the plaintiff, and used by the defendant. The case made by the record, as it seems to us, is this: the plaintiff and Aspegren &amp; Co., acting for the defendant, entered into the agreement of July 13, 1906, for the sale and purchase of the cotton oil refining plant described in that contract and \u201cthe stock in trade;\u201d that when the parties in interest met to finally consummate their agreement by the proper conveyance and transfer of the property sold, and the payment of the consideration, they were unable fully to do so, on account of the difficulties and unsettled matters mentioned in the memorandum agreement; that \u201cthe stock in trade\u201d was not then delivered to the defendant, the purchaser thereof, nor paid for by it, but by agreement was to be delivered to Aspegren &amp; Co., to be held by them to secure the payment of such sum, if any, as might be found due upon the adjustment of the claim or claims asserted by them, and settlement for \u201cthe stock in trade\u201d was to await the adjustment of the unsettled matters mentioned in the memorandum agreement; that \u201cthe stock in trade\u201d was not.taken possession of by Aspegren <em>&amp; </em>Co., but was delivered by the plaintiff at the defendant\u2019s plant and used \u2014 that is, consumed by it; that the unsettled matters between the parties have never been adjusted; and that nearly three years after the memorandum agreement was entered into, the plaintiff instituted this action to recover the undisputed price and value of \u201cthe stock in trade.\u201d its property, and delivered by it at the defendant\u2019s plant and used \u2014 consumed\u2014by the latter. Upon this state of facts, the plaintiff was clearly entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">Errors are assigned to the rejection and admission of evidence. It is unnecessary to consider these assignments in de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>tail, but it will be sufficient to say that if all the evidence offered by the defendant and rejected by the court had been admitted, and all the evidence had been rejected which was offered by the plaintiff and admitted over the defendant\u2019s objection, it could not have affected the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">The giving, amending and refusing of instructions is assigned as erroneous. Since, upon the case made and offered to be made, no other verdict than the one found could have-been properly rendered upon correct instructions, the question whether or not the court erred in instructing the jury need not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
