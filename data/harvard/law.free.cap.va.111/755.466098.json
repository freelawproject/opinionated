B. (or A. B. and C. D.) to-wit: (Here describe the estate), this the day of .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">In construing this statute in <em>Raub </em>v. Otterback, 92 Va. 517, 23 S. E. 883 (where the estate Avas described as \u201ca <em>cotningent interest, in the red estate of Philip </em>Otterback, deceased, <em>lying in said </em>county\u201d), it was held that the return, \u201cExecuted upon the tract of land Avithin mentioned,\u201d Avas too vague and uncertain. The court obseiwes: \u201cThe lev}'- must contain such general description of the land, and with such substantial accuracy, as will connect it with the sale when made, so that purchasers may know the land, or interest therein, to be sold, and be able to form some estimate of its value; and, further, the levy should describe the land with such precision that it may be easily identified, when conveyed, by looking alone to the levy, Avithout the aid of extrinsic eAndence. <em>Robertson </em>v. Hoge, 83 Va. 124 [1 S. E. 667] ; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Dickson, </em>2 Hump. 395 [37 Am. Dec. 560]; <em>Waters </em>v. Duvall, 11 Gill &amp; Johnson 37 [33 Am. Dec. 693].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">The return in this case is: \u201cExecuted on the 17th day of December, 1908, Avithin the county of- MatheAvs, by levying the Avithin attachment on the following real estate of the defendant, the J. S. Hoskins Lumber Company, located in the county of Mathews in the Piankitank magisterial district of said county,- containing about three hundred and sixty acres, being the same land conveyed to said company by L. C. Garnett, Esq., special commissioner of Mathews county circuit court, by deed recorded in deed book 15, pp. 58-59 * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">This return identifies the land with sufficient certainty, both for purposes of sale and conveyance, without the aid of extrin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>sic evidence, and is a substantial, if not a literal, compliance with the statute. It is a familiar principle, that where a map, plan, survey or deed is referred to for a description of land, it is not to be regarded as extrinsic evidence, but part of the instrument itself. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>4 Hen. &amp; Munf. 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-3\">Thus, in <em>State Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>93 Va. 447, 25 S. E. 543, 544, the court, on page 453, says: \u201cWhere a map of land is referred to in a deed for the purpose of fixing its boundaries, the effect is the same as if it were copied into the deed. <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>145 U. S. 376 [33 L. Ed. 741, 12 Sup. Ct. 962] ; <em>Jeffries v. East Omaha Land Co., </em>134 U. S. 178 [33 L. Ed. 872, 10 Sup. Ct. 518].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">A more technical construction of section 2967 than is herein indicated would lead to inconvenience in practice, and often to a miscarriage of justice, without any resultant benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">For these reasons the judgment- of the circuit court must be reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings conformable to the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
