To a judgment rendered in such case, no writ of error lies on the ground that the constitutionality of the ordinance is drawn in question.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b701-9\">Error to a judgment of the Law and Equity Court of the city of Bichmond, on appeal from the court of the civil justice.

To this judgment the. present writ of error was awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">We are of opinion that the matter involved in this appeal is merely pecuniary, and being less than $300, this court is without jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">The plaintiff in error insists that it draws in question the constitutionality of the city ordinance under which he sought to justify his action. The constitutionality of this ordinance is not questioned. On the contrary, the court below, at the instance of .the plaintiff in error, instructed the jury that the ordinance was valid and constitutional, and no exception was taken to that instruction. This eliminated all question of the, validity of the ordinance from the case, and left the plaintiff in error with its full protection as a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">There is, therefore, no matter involved or drawn in question in the case that is not merely pecuniary, and the damages recovered being only $85.10, this court is without jurisdiction, and the writ of error must be dismissed as improvidently awarded.</p>\n<disposition id=\"b702-9\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</disposition>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
