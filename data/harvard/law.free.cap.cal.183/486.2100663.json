(Sec. 10, Direct Primary Law.)</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">Conceding the failure of petitioner to conform to this mandatory requirement of the law, relief from his default is sought by Mm at the hands of this court. We are forced to the conclusion that the courts have no power to grant relief in such a matter. Section 27 of the Direct Primary Law, the only provision authorizing any review by a court, is, to our minds, reasonably susceptible of no other construction than that it is inapplicable to any failure of the candidate or those proposing him as a candidate for nomination to comply with mandatory requirements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>the law essential to Ms candidacy. <bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It has to do solely with errors or omissions of others charged under the law with duties relative to the matter of the primary election, and the relief expressly provided for therein is an order requiring \u201cthe officer or person <em>charged with such error, </em>wrong or neglect to forthwith <em>correct the error, desist from the wrongful act or perform, the duty.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\">The order to show cause is discharged and the proceeding dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Angellotti, C.
