Before a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (\u201cthe circuit court\u201d), Pearson\u2019s co-defendant filed proposed <em>voir dire </em>questions, including: \u201cHave you, any member of your family, [a] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>friend, or [an] acquaintance been the victim of a crime? [ ] Do you know anyone who is employed in the police department, prosecutor\u2019s office[,] or other law-enforcement agency? [] Were you ever a member of a law-enforcement agency, either civilian or military?\u201d (Paragraph breaks omitted). The circuit court declined to ask any of these three proposed <em>voir dire </em>questions. Pearson excepted to the circuit court\u2019s declining to ask each of the three proposed <em>voir dire </em>questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">During <em>voir dire, </em>the circuit court asked: (1) \u201cDoes any member of the panel hold such strong feelings regarding violations of the narcotics laws that it would be difficult for you to fairly and impartially weigh the facts of this trial where narcotics violations have been alleged?\u201d; and (2) \u201c[W]ould any member of the jury panel be inclined to give either more or less weight to the testimony of a police officer than to any other witness in the case, merely because the witness is a police officer?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">At trial, all of the State\u2019s witnesses were members of the Baltimore City Police Department. Officer Christopher Faller (\u201cOfficer Faller\u201d) testified that on May 7, 2008, he and other law enforcement officers executed a search warrant for a residence at 1727 East Oliver Street in Baltimore City. Officer Faller testified that, inside the residence, Pearson was using a razorblade to \u201ccut[ ] a white rock substance.\u201d As an expert in \u201cchemistry and analysis of narcotics!,]\u201d Anthony Rumber (\u201cRumber\u201d) testified that the white rock substance tested positive for cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">The jury convicted Pearson of various drug-related crimes. Pearson appealed, and, by majority, a panel of the Court of Special Appeals affirmed, holding that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in declining to ask the three proposed <em>voir dire </em>questions. The Honorable Irma S. Raker dissented, opining that the circuit court abused its discretion in declining to ask during <em>voir dire </em>whether any prospective juror had ever been a member of a law enforcement agency. Pearson petitioned for a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>which this Court granted. <em>See Pearson v.

Specifically, Pearson argues that the \u201cvictim\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question is reasonably likely to reveal specific cause for disqualification. Alternatively, Pearson asserts that the \u201cvictim\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question would facilitate the exercise of peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The State responds that the circuit <em>court did not </em>abuse its discretion in declining to ask during <em>voir dire </em>whether any prospective juror had ever been the victim of a crime. Specifically, the State contends that the \u201cvictim\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question is not reasonably likely to reveal specific cause for disqualification. The State argues that the \u201cstrong feelings\u201d <em>voir dire </em>questions make the \u201cvictim\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question unnecessary.

This Court stated that the proposed <em>voir dire </em>question \u201cdid not relate to a [specific] cause [for] disqualification[.]\u201d <em>Yopps, </em>234 Md. at 221, 198 A.2d at 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Similarly, in <em>Perry v.

This Court also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-10\">A trial court\u2019s process of determining whether a proposed inquiry is <em>reasonably </em>likely to reveal disqualifying partiality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>or bias includes weighing the expenditure of time and resources in the pursuit of the reason for the response to a proposed <em>voir dire </em>question against the likelihood that pursuing the reason for the response will reveal bias or partiality. Here, the charges against [the defendant] were murder and conspiracy to commit murder.... Without abusing its discretion, the [trial] court could conclude under the circumstances here that there was not a reasonable likelihood of uncovering a disqualification based on some [prospective juror]\u2019s connection, even as a victim, to some other class of crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><em>Perry, </em>344 Md. at 220, 686 A.2d at 282 (some emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Here, consistent with existing case law, for three reasons, we conclude that a trial court need not ask during <em>voir dire </em>whether any prospective juror has ever been the victim of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">First, a prospective juror\u2019s experience as the victim of a crime lacks \u201ca <em>demonstrably strong correlation </em>[with] a mental state that gives rise to [specific] cause for disqualification.\u201d <em>Curtin, </em>393 Md. at 607, 903 A.2d at 931 (emphasis in original) (citation omitted). <em>See Perry, </em>344 Md. at 218, 686 A.2d at 281 (A prospective \u201cjuror\u2019s having had prior experience as a ... victim ... in a criminal proceeding of any kind ... is not <em>per se </em>disqualifying.\u201d); <em>Yopps, </em>234 Md. at 221, 198 A.2d at 267 (In a burglary case, this Court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to ask during <em>voir dire </em>whether any prospective juror or anyone in any prospective juror\u2019s family had ever been the victim of a burglary.). Thus, the \u201cvictim\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question (as well as the inevitable follow-up questions) \u201cmerely [allow the defendant to] \u2018fish[ ]\u2019 for information to assist in the exercise of peremptory challenges[.]\u201d <em>Washington, </em>425 Md. at 315, 40 A.3d at 1022 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Second, the \u201cvictim\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question may consume an enormous amount of time. <em>See Perry, </em>344 Md. at 219, 686 A.2d at 281 (The trial court noted that the \u201cvictim\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question \u201cprovokes [ ] a huge response which would require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>follow-up questions galore, and we would have to sit here and listen to each incident that the prospective juror has experienced over [his or her] lifetime[.]\u201d). Many (if not most) prospective jurors have been the victims of some kind of crime. Additionally (as Pearson concedes), the \u201cvictim\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question necessitates that the trial court ask at least two \u201cfollow-up\u201d questions of every single prospective juror who responds affirmatively.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In deciding whether to ask a proposed <em>voir dire </em>question, a trial court should \u201cweigh[] the expenditure of time and resources in the pursuit of the reason for the response to [the] proposed <em>voir dire </em>question against the likelihood that pursuing the reason for the response will reveal bias or partiality.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>344 Md. at 220, 686 A.2d at 282 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Third, this Court has already held that, on request, a trial court must ask during <em>voir dire </em>whether any prospective juror has \u201cstrong feelings about\u201d the crime with which the defendant is charged. <em>State v. Shim, </em>418 Md. 37, 54, 12 A.3d 671, 681 (2011). The \u201cstrong feelings\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question makes the \u201cvictim\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question unnecessary by revealing the specific cause for disqualification at which the \u201cvictim\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question is aimed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Despite this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Shim, </em>418 Md. at 54, 12 A.3d at 681, however, we conclude that, here, the \u201cstrong feelings\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question <em>(ie., </em>\u201cDoes any member of the panel hold such strong feelings regarding violations of the narcotics laws that it would be difficult for you to fairly and impartially weigh the facts of this trial where narcotics violations have been alleged?\u201d) was phrased improperly.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We realize that the \u201cstrong feelings\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question was phrased exactly as this Court mandated in <em>Shim, </em>418 Md. at 54, 12 A.3d at 681 \u2014 \u201cWhen requested by a defendant, and regardless of the crime, the [trial] court should ask the general question, \u2018Does any member of the jury panel have such strong feelings about [the charges in this case] that it would be difficult for you to fairly and impartially weigh the facts.\u2019 \u201d (Brackets in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">In retrospect, however, it is apparent that the phrasing of the \u201cstrong feelings\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question in <em>Shim </em>clashed with existing precedent. <em>See State v. Green, </em>367 Md. 61, 79, 785 A.2d 1275, 1285 (2001) (\u201c[I]t is sometimes advisable to correct a decision ... if it is found that the decision is clearly wrong and contrary to other established principles.\u201d (Citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). Specifically, the phrasing of the \u201cstrong feelings\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question in <em>Shim </em>was at odds with <em>Dingle v. State, </em>361 Md. 1, 21, 5, 759 A.2d 819, 830, 821 (2000), in which we held that the trial court abused its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>discretion in asking during <em>voir dire </em>such compound questions as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">Have you or any family member or close personal friend ever been a victim of a crime, and if your answer to that part of the question is yes, would that fact interfere with your ability to be fair and impartial in this case in which the state alleges that the defendants have committed a crime?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">This Court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">[T]he procedure followed in this case shifts from the trial [court] to the [prospective jurors] responsibility to decide [prospective] juror bias. Without information bearing on the relevant experiences or associations of the affected individual [prospective juror]s who were not required to respond, the [trial] court simply does not have the ability, and, therefore, is unable to evaluate whether such [prospective juror]s are capable of conducting themselves impartially. Moreover, the [defendant] is deprived of the ability to challenge any of those [prospective juror]s for cause. Rather than advancing the purpose of voir dire, the form of the challenged inquiries in this case distorts and frustrates it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 21, 759 A.2d at 830 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">Just like the phrasing of the <em>voir dire </em>questions in <em>Dingle, id. </em>at 5, 759 A.2d at 821, the phrasing of the \u201cstrong feelings\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question in <em>Shim </em>\u201cshifts from the trial [court] to the [prospective jurors] responsibility to decide [prospective] juror bias.\u201d <em>Dingle, </em>361 Md. at 21, 759 A.2d at 830. In other words, as with the <em>voir dire </em>questions\u2019 phrasings in <em>Dingle, id. </em>at 5, 759 A.2d at 821, the phrasing of the \u201cstrong feelings\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question in <em>Shim </em>required each prospective juror to evaluate his or her own potential bias. Specifically, under <em>Shim, </em>418 Md. at 54, 12 A.3d at 681, each prospective juror decides whether his or her \u201cstrong feelings\u201d (if any) about the crime with which the defendant is charged \u201cwould [make it] difficult for [the prospective juror] to fairly and impartially weigh the facts.\u201d That decision belongs to the trial court, not the prospective juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Thus, we hold that, on request, a trial court must ask during <em>voir dire: </em>\u201cDo any of you have strong feelings about [the crime with which the defendant is charged]?\u201d We abrogate language in <em>Shim, </em>418 Md. at 54, 12 A.3d at 681, to the extent that this Court required a trial court to phrase the \u201cstrong feelings\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question in a way that shifted responsibility to decide a prospective juror\u2019s bias from the trial court to the prospective juror, <em>i.e., </em>\u201c \u2018Does any member of the jury panel have such strong feelings about [the charges in this case] that it would be difficult for you to fairly and impartially weigh the facts.\u2019\u201d <em>Shim, </em>418 Md. at 54, 12 A.3d at 681 (emphasis added) (brackets in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">To be clear, we amend this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Shim, id. </em>at 54, 12 A.3d at 681, only in the context of the phrasing of the \u201cstrong feelings\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question in <em>Shim. </em>We reaffirm this Court\u2019s essential holding in <em>Shim </em>that, on request, a trial court must ask during <em>voir dire </em>whether any prospective juror has \u201cstrong feelings\u201d about the crime with which the defendant is charged. <em>Id. </em>at 54, 12 A.3d at 681. We simply recognize that, in <em>Shim </em>and its parent cases, the \u201cstrong feelings\u201d <em>voir dire </em>questions\u2019 phrasings were at odds with <em>Dingle, </em>361 Md. at 21, 759 A.2d at 830. <em>See Thomas, </em>369 Md. at 214, 204, 798 A.2d at 573, 567 (This Court held that the trial court abused its discretion in declining to ask a <em>voir dire </em>question that the defendant phrased as follows: \u201cDoes any member of the jury panel have such strong feelings regarding violations of the narcotics laws that it would be difficult for you to fairly and impartially weigh the facts at a trial where narcotics violations have been alleged?\u201d (Footnote omitted)); <em>Sweet v.

We note that, although <em>Thomas, Sweet, </em>and <em>Shim </em>postdate <em>Dingle, </em>in none of the three cases did this Court supersede <em>Dingle; </em>in <em>Thom</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>as, <em>Sweet, </em>and <em>Shim, </em>this Court did not address any issue regarding the \u201cstrong feelings\u201d <em>voir dire </em>questions\u2019 phrasings.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">At the risk of pointing out the obvious, we stress that we do not hold that a prospective juror is automatically disqualified simply because the prospective juror responds affirmatively to the \u201cstrong feelings\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question.

Specifically, the State argues that the \u201cmember of a law enforcement agency\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question is not reasonably likely to reveal specific cause for disqualification. The State asserts that the \u201cundue weight\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question makes the \u201cmember of a law enforcement agency\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">In <em>Davis v. State, </em>333 Md. 27, 31, 33, 633 A.2d 867, 869, 870 (1993), this Court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to ask during <em>voir dire </em>\u201c \u2018whether anyone on the jury has been a member or is a member of the law enforcement community or whether they have a close relative or friend who is such a member[.]\u2019 \u201d All of the State\u2019s witnesses were members of law enforcement agencies, <em>see id. </em>at 32, 633 A.2d at 869-70; thus, \u201cthe sole issue [wa]s the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>credibility of\u2019 members of law enforcement agencies. <em>Id. </em>at 35, 633 A.2d at 871 (internal quotation marks omitted). This Court stated: \u201cThe fact that a prospective juror is employed as, related to, or associated with a law enforcement officer does not establish that the prospective juror has any undue bias or prejudice that will prevent [the prospective juror] from fairly and impartially determining the matter before\u201d the prospective juror. <em>Id. </em>at 37, 633 A.2d at 872 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">In a dissenting opinion that Judge John C. Eldridge joined, then-judge Robert M. Bell opined that the trial court abused its discretion. <em>See id. </em>at 56, 633 A.2d at 881 (Bell, J., dissenting). Judge Bell stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">[W]here the sole issue ... is the credibility of [one] police officer as [o]pposed to [the defendant,] a <em>voir dire </em>question concerning law enforcement employment or association may well lead to the disqualification for cause of one or more of the prospective jurors.

[T]he trial court\u2019s refusal to make the requested inquiry denied the [defendant] the ability to challenge [prospective] jurors for cause, [and left] the trial [court] without meaningful information concerning [prospective] juror bias [and prejudices] on which to act, and [shifted] to the prospective jurors themselves the responsibility for making the ultimate decision as to their ability to serve on the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 56-57, 633 A.2d at 881-82 (Bell, J., dissenting) (some alterations and first ellipsis in original) (footnote and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Seven years later, in <em>Dingle, </em>361 Md. at 8-9, 759 A.2d at 823, this Court held that the trial court abused its discretion in asking compound questions during <em>voir dire. </em>Writing for this Court, then-Chief Judge Bell approvingly quoted multiple excerpts from his dissent in <em>Davis </em>regarding the law enforcement association question, stating: (1) \u201cwhile not dispositive of a [prospective jurorj\u2019s qualification to serve, as the dissent in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number><em>Davis </em>pointed out, the [prospective jurorj\u2019s professional, vocational, or social status \u2018does tend to prove bias; that a [prospective juror] has been, or is, a member of the group to which the principal witness for the State belongs is relevant to the determination of that [prospective jurorj\u2019s partiality or bias[,]\u2019\u201d <em>Dingle, </em>361 Md. at 16, 759 A.2d at 827 (quoting <em>Davis, </em>333 Md. at 61, 633 A.2d at 884 (Bell, J., dissenting)); and (2) \u201c[t]he dissent in <em>Davis </em>got it right when it pointed out: \u2018Under the rationale underlying the majority\u2019s view of voir dire, taken to its logical conclusion, all that would be necessary to empanel a legally sufficient jury is that the trial court ask the prospective jurors whether they could be fair and impartial ____\u2019\u201d <em>Dingle, </em>361 Md. at 18, 759 A.2d at 828 (quoting <em>Davis, </em>333 Md. at 63, 633 A.2d at 885 (Bell, J. dissenting)) (paragraph break omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Here, mindful of this Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Dingle </em>and <em>Davis, </em>we conclude that, where all of the State\u2019s witnesses are members of law enforcement agencies and/or where the basis for a conviction is reasonably likely to be the testimony of members of law enforcement agencies, on request, a trial court must ask during <em>voir dire: </em>\u201cHave any of you ever been a member of a law enforcement agency?\u201d Where all of the State\u2019s witnesses are members of law enforcement agencies and/or where the basis for a conviction is reasonably likely to be the testimony of members of law enforcement agencies, a prospective juror\u2019s experience as a member of a law enforcement agency has a demonstrably strong correlation with a mental state that could give rise to specific cause for disqualification. <em>See Curtin, </em>393 Md. at 607, 903 A.2d at 931 (citation and emphasis omitted). Thus, a defendant is entitled to know whether a prospective juror has worked in the law enforcement field if all of the State\u2019s witnesses and/or the witnesses whose testimony is reasonably likely to be the basis for a conviction are members of the law enforcement community.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">We reject the State\u2019s contention that <em>Davis </em>remains good law, as to the propriety of examining jurors on law enforcement experience. In <em>Dingle, </em>this Court quoted approvingly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>from the dissent in <em>Davis </em>in several instances, essentially incorporating the viewpoint of the <em>Davis </em>dissent, on the law enforcement question, into <em>Dingle. See, e.g., Dingle, </em>361 Md. at 16, 18, 759 A.2d at 827, 828 (quoting <em>Davis, 333 </em>Md. at 61, 63, 633 A.2d at 884, 885 (Bell, J., dissenting)). Under <em>Dingle, </em>the practice of simply asking during <em>voir dire </em>whether prospective jurors can be fair and impartial is improper. Because, in <em>Dingle, </em>we were confronted with an issue that was distinct from the issue in <em>Davis </em>\u2014 i.e., <em>Dingle </em>did not involve the propriety of the \u201cmember of a law enforcement agency\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question \u2014 we did not expressly overrule <em>Davis </em>in <em>Dingle. </em>Here, directly addressing the issue of the propriety of the \u201cmember of a law enforcement agency\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question, having favorably incorporated in <em>Dingle </em>the view expressed by the dissent in <em>Davis, </em>we now overrule the holding in <em>Davis, </em>333 Md. at 31, 33, 633 A.2d at 869, 870, regarding the propriety of the \u201cmember of a law enforcement agency\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question. <em>See Green, </em>367 Md. at 79, 785 A.2d at 1285. In <em>Davis, 333 </em>at 37, 633 A.2d at 872, we undertook broad consideration of a <em>voir dire </em>question involving whether \u201ca prospective juror is employed as, related to, or associated with a law enforcement officer[.]\u201d Here, we hold only that, where all of the State\u2019s witnesses are members of law enforcement agencies and/or where the basis for a conviction is reasonably likely to be the testimony of members of law enforcement agencies, a trial court must, upon request, inquire as to whether a prospective juror him or herself is a member of a law enforcement agency. Thus, we overrule <em>Davis </em>only to the extent that a trial court must now, upon request, inquire into a prospective juror\u2019s membership in a law enforcement agency in the circumstances outlined above.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Just as with the \u201cstrong feelings\u201d question, we stress that we do not hold that a prospective juror is automatically disqualified just because the prospective juror responds affirmatively to the \u201cmember of a law enforcement agency\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question. After the prospective juror is individually questioned by the attorneys or upon request by the trial court, the trial court determines whether or not the prospective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>juror\u2019s having been a member of a law enforcement agency constitutes specific cause for disqualification. We also do not hold that a trial court is alleviated of the obligation to ask the <em>voir dire </em>question asked by the circuit court in this case: \u201c[W]ould any member of the jury panel be inclined to give either more or less weight to the testimony of a police officer than to any other witness in the case, merely because the witness is a police officer?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In sum, where all of the State\u2019s witnesses are members of law enforcement agencies and/or where the basis for a conviction is reasonably likely to be the testimony of members of law enforcement agencies, on request, a trial court must ask during <em>voir dire: </em>\u201cHave any of you ever been a member of a law enforcement agency?\u201d Here, all of the State\u2019s witnesses were members of the Baltimore City Police Department. The basis for the convictions was the testimony of members of the Baltimore City Police Department; Officer Faller testified that Pearson was using a razorblade to \u201ccut[ ] a white rock substanceL,]\u201d and Rumber testified that the white rock substance tested positive for cocaine. Thus, for the above reasons, we are satisfied that the circuit court abused its discretion in declining to ask during <em>voir dire </em>whether any prospective juror had ever been a member of a law enforcement agency.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>In addition to providing Pearson with the benefit of the holdings in this case, we determine that our holdings shall apply prospectively as of the date on which this opinion is filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

Because we resolve on other grounds the issues regarding the \"victim\u201d and \"member of a law enforcement agency\u201d <em>voir dire </em>questions, we do not address Pearson\u2019s contention that Matyland should discontinue limited <em>voir dire </em>by allowing <em>voir dire </em>to facilitate the intelligent use of peremptory challenges. Further, it would be imprudent for us to address this far-reaching issue without the benefit of study regarding the possible ramifications. We are unaware of any such study, and, in response to questions from the Honorable Glenn T. Harrell, Jr. at oral argument, both parties stated that they were unaware of any such study, aside from anecdotal evidence regarding California\u2019s transition to limited <em>voir dire </em>in criminal cases. To gather more information on the important issue of whether to maintain limited <em>voir dire, </em>we would refer the issue to the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure for its consideration and recommendation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b392-6\">. Specifically, the trial court would need to ask: (1) what the crime was of which the prospective juror had been the victim; and (2) whether the prospective juror\u2019s experience would prevent the prospective juror from fairly and impartially weighing the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b392-7\">. Thus, we are unpersuaded by Pearson's reliance on hypothetical situations in which: (1) a drug dealer had assaulted a prospective juror\u2019s son; and (2) a drug user had stolen from a prospective juror. If either experience constituted specific cause for disqualification, then the prospective jurors would respond affirmatively to the \"strong feelings\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question. An appellate court presumes that prospective jurors are honest in deciding whether to respond affirmatively to a <em>voir dire </em>question. <em>See generally Dillard v. State, </em>415 Md. 445, 465, 3 A.3d 403, 415 (2010) (\u201cJurors generally are presumed to follow the [trial] court\u2019s instructions^]\u201d (Citation omitted)); <em>see also Curtin, </em>393 Md. at 617 n. 1, 903 A.2d at 936 n. 1 (Bell, C.J., dissenting) (\"My experience, ten years, as a trial judge, is that the vast majority of [prospective jurorjs take seriously the oath and endeavor mightily, even at the risk of embarrassment, to answer truthfully the questions put to them.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b393-6\">. Although Pearson does not specifically contend that the \"strong feelings\" <em>voir dire </em>question was phrased improperly, the issue of the \"strong feelings\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question\u2019s phrasing is before this Court. An appellate court \"reviewfs a] trial [courtj's rulings on the record of the voir dire process as a whole for an abuse of discretion\u201d \u201cto determine whether the matter has been fairly covered.\u201d <em>Washington, </em>425 Md. at 313-14, 40 A.3d at 1021 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). Indeed, here, the State embraced this principle by: (1) consolidating all of the questions presented into one: \"Did the trial court act within its discretion in conducting voir dire?\u201d; and (2) contending that the \"strong feelings\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question makes the \u201cvictim\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question unnecessary. We agree with the State\u2019s contention \u2014 assuming that the \"strong feelings\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question is phrased properly. For the below reasons, here, the \"strong feelings\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question was phrased improperly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b396-9\">. As discussed above, the circuit court abused its discretion in phrasing the \u201cstrong feelings\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question improperly; nonetheless, we address Pearson\u2019s contention that the circuit court abused its discretion in declining to ask during <em>voir dire </em>whether any prospective juror had ever been a member of a law enforcement agency. Generally, where an appellate court reverses a trial court\u2019s judgment on one ground, the appellate court does not address other grounds on which the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>court\u2019s judgment could be reversed, as such grounds are moot. <em>See, e.g., King v.

Here, we decide whether, on request, a trial court must ask during <em>voir dire </em>whether any prospective juror has ever been a member of a law enforcement agency, as: (1) the public interest will clearly be hurt if this Court does not decide the issue, which involves the right to an impartial jury; (2) the issue is likely to recur frequently, as the \"member of a law enforcement agency\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question is proposed regularly; and (3) recurrence of the issue would involve a trial court's duty to ask the \"member of a law enforcement agency\u201d <em>voir dire </em>question on request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b401-6\">. To be clear, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in declining to ask during <em>voir dire </em>whether any prospective juror\u2019s acquaintance had ever been a member of a law enforcement agency. As Pearson conceded at oral argument, the proposed <em>voir dire </em>questions were \"overbroad[.]\u201d <em>See Perry, </em>344 Md. at 218, 686 A.2d at 281 (\"It is even less tenable to argue that a [prospective] juror is disqualified simply because of the experience of a member of the prospective juror\u2019s family or on the part of a close personal friend.\u201d). Where an overbroad proposed <em>voir dire </em>question encompasses a mandatory <em>voir dire </em>question, however, a trial court should: (1) rephrase the overbroad proposed <em>voir dire </em>question to narrow its scope to that of the mandatory <em>voir dire </em>question; and (2) ask the rephrased <em>voir dire </em>question. <em>See Shim, </em>418 Md. at 55, 12 A.3d at 681 (\"A proposed <em>voir dire </em>question need not be in perfect form, and the [trial] court is free to modify the proposed question as needed.\u201d (Citations omitted)). And although we determine that the circuit court abused its discretion in this case, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>recognize that in ruling the circuit court judge applied the holding in <em>Shim </em>and the <em>Davis </em>majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b402-8\">HARRELL, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"at-dedup-0\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">I concur in the judgment only. In my view, this case should be the vehicle by which this Court embraces what Judge Raker called for in her concurring opinion (which I joined) in <em>State v. </em>Thomas, 369 Md. 202, 217-19, 798 A.2d 566, 574-576 (2002) \u2014 expansion of the purpose and use of voir dire to aid in the intelligent exercise of peremptory challenges. The Court\u2019s opinion in the present case declines explicitly (Maj. op. at 357 n. 1, 86 A.3d at 1236 n. 1) Pearson\u2019s invitation to join the vast majority of states and all of the federal circuits, which follow the intelligent exercise approach.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As Pearson\u2019s brief observes, only California (and, qualifiedly, Pennsylvania) remains as strict as Maryland in its limited use of voir dire solely in aid of discovering grounds for strikes for cause. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Nancy S.

I am more sanguine and energetic in my belief that the Court, without delay, should draw upon the experiences of the 48 states and the federal circuits that have gone before us to adopt a suitable format of the \u201cintelligent use\u201d approach in Pearson\u2019s case.
