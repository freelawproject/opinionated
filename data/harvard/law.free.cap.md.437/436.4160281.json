On 14 February 2013, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals suspended indefinitely Kourtesis from the practice of law in the District of Columbia, and ordered further that pending disciplinary charges filed against him in the District be held in abeyance due to his self-professed disability preventing him from defending himself (or assisting his counsel in the defense) against the charges. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>10 March 2013, the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland, through Bar Counsel, filed, pursuant to Maryland Rules 16-751 and 16-773, a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action, attaching to the Petition a certified copy of the 14 February 2013 Order of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">On 20 March 2013, we issued a Show Cause Order. Bar Counsel responded on 17 May 2013, asking that reciprocal sanction (indefinite suspension) be imposed against Kourtesis in this State. In response, Kourtesis urged us to refer the matter to a judge of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (where Respondent maintains an office for the practice of law) for an evidentiary hearing prior to acting on the request by Bar Counsel for his indefinite suspension. We hold that a separate hearing to determine his fitness to practice law in this State is inappropriate at present. Rather, we order that Kourtesis be placed on inactive status, the most analogous remedy in this State, until further order by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">I. UNDISPUTED FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">A. Proceedings in the District of Columbia</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">On 25 May and 12 July 2012, counsel for the Board on Professional Responsibility filed \u201cSpecifications of Charges\u201d against Kourtesis in the District of Columbia based on allegations arising from his representation of certain clients in personal injury matters.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On 7 August 2012, Kourtesis filed his Answer. Prior to a merits adjudication of these charges, Kourtesis petitioned in December of 2012 for his suspension and the abeyance of the pending disciplinary charges due to his disability, pursuant to a special procedure in the District of Columbia. D.C. Bar Rule XI, \u00a7 13(e), which governs this procedure, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>If, in the course of a disciplinary proceeding, the attorney claims to be suffering from a disability because of mental or physical illness or infirmity, or because of addiction to drugs or intoxicants, which makes it impossible for the attorney to present an adequate defense, the Court shall enter an order immediately suspending the attorney from the practice of law until a determination is made of the attorney\u2019s capacity to practice law in a proceeding under subsection (c) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">As grounds for his motion, Kourtesis asserted that he suffered from depression, making it impossible (indefinitely) to defend himself in the disciplinary matters or to assist his counsel in the defense against the charges. Pursuant to D.C. Board Rule 15.3(a)(iii),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Kourtesis included, in support of his assertion, letters from Walker Lyerly, M.D., who diagnosed Kour-tesis as having a Major Depressive Disorder, and Dan Schwarz, Psy.D. (a licensed clinical psychologist), who diagnosed Kourtesis with Major Depression, Recurrent, Moderate. Both letters asserted that Kourtesis\u2019s depression rendered him unable to assist his counsel in defending himself in the disciplinary proceedings in the District of Columbia. Additionally, Kourtesis filed a signed \u201cAcknowledgement of Disability,\u201d dated 12 December 2012, in which he acknowledged that \u201cduring the period of \u2018March, 2010 \u2014 Present,\u2019 I suffered from a disability ... by reason of \u2018depression.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>On 31 December 2012, the Board on Professional Responsibility, acting through its Chair and under D.C. Bar Rule XI, \u00a7 13(c),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> petitioned the District of Columbia Court of Appeals \u201cto immediately suspend\u201d Kourtesis, pursuant to D.C. Bar Rule XI, \u00a7 13(e), on the grounds of his \u201cmotion for suspension and abeyance of disciplinary matters due to disability, and supporting documentation, filed with the Board pursuant to D.C. Bar R. XI, \u00a7\u00a7 13(c) and (e) and Board Rule 15.3.\u201d In this petition, the Board on Professional Responsibility stated that it did not oppose Kourtesis\u2019s motion, but noted additionally:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-4\">Bar Counsel\u2019s response asserts that it \u201clacks knowledge\u201d of how [Kourtesis]\u2019s alleged disability affects his ability to defend himself, but it \u201cadmits that [Kourtesis] has provided medical support for this claim.\u201d Bar Counsel also notes that [Kourtesis]\u2019s counsel has confirmed that [Kourtesis] appears not to be able to assist counsel with his defense of these disciplinary matters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Upon consideration of the Board on Professional Responsibility\u2019s petition, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals ordered, on 14 February 2013:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>[Kourtesis] is indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in the District of Columbia, effective immediately, and that any pending matters be held in abeyance pursuant to D.C. Bar Rule XI, \u00a7 13(e) until further order of the court pursuant to D.C. Bar Rule XI, \u00a7 13(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">The Order provided further that his \u201creinstatement to the District of Columbia Bar shall be in accordance with the provisions of D.C. Bar Rule XI, \u00a7 13(g).... \u201d Subsection (g) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">Reinstatement of Incapacitated Attorney. An attorney suspended under this section may apply for reinstatement once a year, or at such shorter intervals as the Court may direct in its order of suspension or any modification thereof. Upon the filing of such application, the Court may take or direct such action as it deems appropriate, including the examination of the attorney by such qualified medical experts as the Court shall designate. In its discretion, the Court may direct that the expense of such an examination shall be paid by the attorney, and that evidence be presented establishing proof of the attorney\u2019s competence and learning in the law, which may include certification by the bar examiners of the attorney\u2019s successful completion of an examination for admission to practice. An application for reinstatement under this subsection shall be granted by the Court upon a showing by the attorney, by clear and convincing evidence, that the disability has ended and that the attorney is fit to resume the practice of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">D.C. Bar Rule XI, \u00a7 13(g) (emphasis added). <em>See also </em>D.C. Bar Rule XI, \u00a7 16(b) (\u201cReinstatement of attorneys suspended for disability. An attorney who has been suspended indefinitely because of disability under section 13 of this rule may move for reinstatement in accordance with that section, but reinstatement shall not be ordered except on a showing by clear and convincing evidence that the disability has ended and that the attorney is fit to resume the practice of law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">At the 5 December 2013 show cause hearing in the reciprocal proceedings initiated in Maryland, Kourtesis\u2019s counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>reported that Kourtesis had not filed for reinstatement in the District of Columbia, but planned on seeking reinstatement at some non-specific time in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">B. Reciprocal Proceedings in Maryland</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">On 10 March 2013, the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland (\u201cBar Counsel\u201d) filed, pursuant to Maryland Rules 16-751 and 16-773, a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action, attaching a certified copy of the 14 February 2013 Order by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. We issued a Show Cause Order. On 17 May 2013, Bar Counsel responded, asking that a reciprocal sanction (indefinite suspension) be imposed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">In his Verified Response to Show Cause Order, Kourtesis argued that no reciprocal action should be imposed upon him in Maryland because exceptional circumstances exist under Rule 16-773(e)(3) and (5). These subsections provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">(e) Exceptional circumstances. Reciprocal discipline shall not be ordered if Bar Counsel or the attorney demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">(3) the imposition of corresponding discipline would result in grave injustice [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">(5) the reason for inactive status no longer exists.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIo\">Kourtesis argues first that the circumstances which led to his submitting voluntarily to indefinite suspension of his license to practice in the District of Columbia \u201cwere all related to a perfect storm of emotional issues in which he was ensnared.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>According to Kourtesis\u2019s counsel at oral argument, the perfect storm has passed now and, thus, the reason for his suspension no longer exists. Because the exceptional circumstances exception of Rule 16-773(e)(5) applies assertedly, Kourtesis requests that this Court refer the matter to a judge of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (a jurisdiction in which he maintains an office) for an evidentiary hearing prior to acting on the request by Bar Counsel for his suspension. Kourtesis averred additionally that the exceptional circumstances exception of Rule 16-773(e)(3) (\u201cgrave injustice\u201d) applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">On 5 December 2013, this Court held a hearing to consider the petition, show cause responses, and argument of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Maryland Rule 16-773 governs \u201creciprocal\u201d attorney grievance cases. \u201cUpon receiving and verifying information from any source that in another jurisdiction an attorney has been disciplined or placed on inactive status based on incapacity, Bar Counsel may file a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action in the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 16-751(a)(2).\u201d Md. Rule 16-773(b). The Court issues a show cause order pursuant to subsection (c). After the parties respond to the show cause order, the Court \u201cmay immediately impose corresponding discipline or inactive status,\u201d may assign the matter to a judge for a hearing, \u201cor may enter any other appropriate order.\u201d Md. Rule 16-773(f). At the current juncture in the present case, the parties have responded to the show cause order and the Court is confronted with determining an appropriate order. Subsection (f) provides this Court with a wide-range of options for an appropriate response.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>A. Deference to the Factual Findings or Adjudications of the Originating Jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">In \u201creciprocal\u201d attorney grievance cases, this Court gives deference generally to the factual findings or adjudications of the originating jurisdiction pursuant to Md. Rule 16-778(g), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">Conclusive effect of adjudication. Except as provided in subsections (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this Rule, a final adjudication in a disciplinary or remedial proceeding by another court, agency, or tribunal that an attorney has been guilty of professional misconduct or is incapacitated is conclusive evidence of that misconduct or incapacity in any proceeding under this Chapter. The introduction of such evidence does not preclude the Commission or Bar Counsel from introducing additional evidence or preclude the attorney from introducing evidence or otherwise showing cause why no discipline or lesser discipline should be imposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-6\"><em>See also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Whitehead, </em>390 Md. 663, 668-69, 890 A.2d 751, 754 (2006) (citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Weiss, </em>389 Md. 531, 886 A.2d 606 (2005); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Cafferty, </em>376 Md. 700, 703, 831 A.2d 1042, 1045-46 (2003)). \u201cIn that regard, this Court\u2019s cases are clear, pursuant to Rule 16-773(g), we do not relitigate factual matters or a final adjudication by another appropriate tribunal in a disciplinary [or remedial] proceeding.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Haas, </em>412 Md. 536, 545-46, 988 A.2d 1033, 1039 (2010) (citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sabghir, </em>350 Md. 67, 68, 710 A.2d 926, 926 (1998); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gittens, </em>346 Md. 316, 325, 697 A.2d 83, 88 (1997); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Willcher, </em>340 Md. 217, 221-222, 665 A.2d 1059, 1061 (1995); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sparrow, </em>314 Md. 421, 550 A.2d 1150 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">In the present case, although the District of Columbia Court of Appeals has not adjudicated finally the disciplinary charges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>against Kourtesis, the court reached an interlocutory adjudication that Kourtesis is indefinitely incapacitated, <em>ie., </em>unfit \u201cto practice law because of mental infirmity or illness,\u201d <em>see </em>D.C. Bar Rule XI, \u00a7 13(c).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In keeping with the spirit of the comity principles expressed in Md. Rule 16-773(g), we adopt the District of Columbia\u2019s judicial determination that Kourtes-is was (and remains) incapacitated indefinitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">B. Determining the Appropriate Reciprocal Sanction or Remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">In determining the appropriate sanction or remedy in reciprocal cases, this Court has \u201ca <em>duty </em>to \u2018assess for itself the propriety of the sanction imposed by the other jurisdiction.\u2019\u201d <em>Whitehead, </em>390 Md. at 672, 890 A.2d at 756 (citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Steinberg, </em>385 Md. 696, 704 n. 9, 870 A.2d 603, 608 n. 9 (2005); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Ayres-Fountain, </em>379 Md. 44, 57, 838 A.2d 1238, 1246 (2003)). \u201c[W]e are prone, but not required, to impose the same sanction the original jurisdiction imposed.\u201d <em>Id., </em>390 Md. at 671, 890 A.2d at 756 (citing Weiss, 389 Md. at 546, 886 A.2d at 615). Thus, when considering the appropriate sanction or remedy in a reciprocal attorney grievance case, \u201c \u2018we look not only to the sanction imposed by the other jurisdiction <em>but to our own cases as well.\u2019</em>\u201d <em>Id., </em>390 Md. at 672, 890 A.2d at 756 (emphasis added in <em>Whitehead) </em>(quoting <em>Weiss, </em>389 Md. at 548, 886 A.2d at 616) (some internal quotation marks omitted). Although we will reach often the same conclusion as the original jurisdiction and impose an identical sanction or remedy, <em>see id., </em>390 Md. at 672-73, 890 A.2d at 757 (citing <em>Willcher, </em>340 Md. at 220, 665 A.2d at 1060; <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Roberson, </em>373 Md. 328, 357, 818 A.2d 1059, 1077 (2003); <em>Cafferty, </em>376 Md. at 728, 831 A.2d at 1059; <em>Attorney </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number><em>Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Moore, </em>301 Md. 169, 171, 482 A.2d 497, 498 (1984)), \u201c[w]hen our cases ... clearly demonstrate that we would apply a different sanction \u2014 had the conduct occurred or the case originated here \u2014 we need not follow the original jurisdiction\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>Id., </em>390 Md. at 673, 890 A.2d at 757. The appropriate sanction \u201c \u2018will depend on the unique facts and circumstances of each case, but with a view toward <em>consistent dispositions for similar misconduct </em>[or incapacity].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>390 Md. at 672, 890 A.2d at 756 (emphasis added in <em>Whitehead) </em>(quoting <em>Weiss, </em>389 Md. at 548, 886 A.2d at 616) (some internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">The rationale underlying our duty to assess the appropriate sanction or remedy for ourselves is that, \u201c[e]ven though attorney discipline is for the primary purpose of protecting the public, [not the punishment of the attorney,] the bar and public policy are served best by determinations consistent with other Maryland sanctions for similar misconduct.\u201d <em>Id., </em>390 Md. at 674, 890 A.2d at 757. We recognize that \u201c \u2018the public interest is served when this Court imposes a sanction [or remedy] which demonstrates to members of the legal profession the type of conduct that will not be tolerated....\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>390 Md. at 674, 890 A.2d at 758 (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sperling, </em>380 Md. 180, 191, 844 A.2d 397, 404 (2004)) (some internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, in imposing sanctions and remedies consistent with other Maryland determinations, this Court fulfills \u201c \u2018its responsibility to insist upon the maintenance of the integrity of the bar and to prevent the transgression of an individual lawyer from bringing [the profession\u2019s] image into disrepute.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Sperling, </em>380 Md. at 191, 844 A.2d at 404) (some internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">As we explained further in <em>Whitehead:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">[T]he public interest is served when <em>sanctions designed to effect general and specific deterrence are imposed on an attorney </em>who violates the disciplinary rules.... This goal of effecting general and specific deterrence is best achieved by ensuring that every member of the bar clearly understands the standards of conduct to which he or she is expected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>adhere and the consequences of failing to meet those standards. One of our goals, in maintaining these standards is to ensure that <em>consistent determinations </em>as to sanctions for similar misconduct are reached in our cases. Whether the case arises in this jurisdiction, or it comes to us as a \u201creciprocal\u201d discipline case, does not change this Court\u2019s duty to apply consistent treatment, i.e., sanctions [and remedies]~as far as is possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\">Our position on sanctions [and remedies] in \u201creciprocal\u201d cases has to do with ensuring consistency, which in turn provides the appropriate deterrent for incompetent, unscrupulous or unethical lawyers. Nor do we abandon well reasoned principles of comity in reaching our decision. As required by Rule 16-773(g), the heaviest weight is given to our sister jurisdictions\u2019 factual findings. From them we rarely stray. We deviate from their sanctions, however, when the history of our eases warrants a substantially different disposition....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-5\"><em>Id., </em>390 Md. at 674-75, 890 A.2d at 758 (emphasis added in Whitehead) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). With the foregoing in mind, we turn now to determine what sanction or remedy is imposed typically in Maryland for an attorney pleading incapacity due to mental illness and seeking an abeyance or stay of the adjudication of pending disciplinary charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Because Maryland does not have a special procedure directly analogous to that provided in D.C. Bar Rule XI, \u00a7 13, we approach our analysis by providing first an overview of the three paths by which this Court may find an attorney incapacitated. One path is provided for in reciprocal attorney grievance eases (such as this one). Pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-773, this Court may find that an attorney is incapacitated and order that, <em>inter alia, </em>corresponding \u201cinactive status\u201d be imposed as a reciprocal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">A second path to finding an attorney incapacitated in this State is provided by Rule 16-774, which states that \u201cif the attorney has been judicially determined to be mentally incompetent ...,\u201d then \u201c[a]n attorney may be [ ] placed on inactive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>status for an indefinite period.... \u201d Md. Rule 16-774(a). Under this rule, Bar Counsel files a petition to place summarily the attorney on inactive status, pursuant to the procedures set forth in subsection (b). Upon review of the petition and any answer, \u201cthe Court of Appeals may immediately place the attorney on inactive status for an indefinite period pending further order of the Court,\u201d order a designated judge to hold a hearing, or \u201center any other appropriate order.\u201d Md. Rule 16-774(c). At this time, if disciplinary or remedial proceedings are pending for alleged misconduct, the Court of Appeals\u2019s order under subsection (c) stays those proceedings. Md. Rule 16-774(d). When the attorney who has been placed on inactive status under section (c) is determined later to be competent, \u201cthe Court of Appeals shall terminate the inactive status and either dismiss the [disciplinary] petition\u201d or order a designated judge to hold a hearing on them. Md. Rule 16-774(e)</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">Lastly, Md. Rule 16-772(b) recognizes a third path by which an attorney may consent to placement on inactive status. For example, in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Demyan, </em>299 Md. 652, 474 A.2d 1342 (1984), this Court considered a petition of a respondent that the Court place him on inactive status from the practice of law due to extreme memory loss.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Demyan, </em>it appears that a petition for disciplinary action was pending. The Court ordered that the respondent be placed on inactive status \u201cuntil such time as he can demonstrate by proper evidence that he has sufficiently recovered his health, both mental and physical, to be reinstated as an active practitioner of the law in this State.\u201d <em>Id., </em>299 Md. at 654, 474 A.2d at 1343.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Similarly, in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Draper, </em>307 Md. 435, 514 A.2d 1212 (1986),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we, agreeing with the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>judge\u2019s conclusion that the attorney was incompetent, were confronted with \u201cdeciding] how to dispose of this matter in order to protect the public.\u201d <em>Id., </em>307 Md. at 440, 514 A.2d at 1215. The Court began by repeating the well-established principle that \u201c[t]he purpose of a disciplinary proceeding is to protect the public, rather than to punish the errant attorney.\u201d <em>Id., </em>307 Md. at 441, 514 A.2d at 1215 (citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kahn, </em>290 Md. 654, 431 A.2d 1336 (1981)). The Court concluded: \u201cWhen an attorney is incapacitated to the extent she is unable to engage in the practice of law, it is appropriate to place her on inactive status.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Demyan, </em>299 Md. 652, 474 A.2d 1342 (1984); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Harrison, </em>292 Md. 81, 437 A.2d 228 (1981)). The Court reasoned that inactive status is the most appropriate sanction because that \u201caction will remove [the incompetent attorney] from the practice of law until such time as she can demonstrate her fitness to return to her profession.\u201d <em>Id. See also Hohenberger v. Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n, </em>292 Md. 83, 83, 437 A.2d 229, 229-30 (1981) (granting attorney\u2019s petition and ordering that he \u201cbe placed on inactive status until such time as he can demonstrate by proper evidence that he has sufficiently recovered his health, both mental and physical, to be reinstated as an active practitioner of the law in this State\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Assuming that an attorney is incapacitated, we determine which \u201cremedy\u201d is appropriate. In this regard, a significant difference exists between our regulatory scheme and the procedures in the District of Columbia. The Maryland Rules differentiate between \u201cremedies\u201d appropriate for \u201cincapacity\u201d and \u201csanctions or remedies\u201d appropriate for \u201cprofessional misconduct\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">(a) Professional Misconduct. One or more of the following sanctions or remedies may be imposed upon an attorney for professional misconduct:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">(1) disbarment by the Court of Appeals;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">(2) suspension by the Court of Appeals;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>(3) reprimand by the Court of Appeals or, with the attorney\u2019s consent, by the Commission;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-4\">(4) conditional diversion in accordance with a Conditional Diversion Agreement entered into pursuant to Rule 16-736; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">(5) termination of a disciplinary or remedial proceeding accompanied by a warning pursuant to Rule 16-735(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">(b) Incapacity. One of the following remedies may be imposed upon an attorney for incapacity:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">(1) placement on inactive status, subject to further order of the Court, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\">(2) conditional diversion in accordance with a Conditional Diversion Agreement entered pursuant to Rule 16-736.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-9\">(c) Conditions. An order, decision, or agreement that imposes a disciplinary sanction upon an attorney or places an attorney on inactive status may include one or more specified conditions, as authorized by Rules 16-736, 16-760, and 16-781.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">Md. Rule 16-721.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">Thus, the Maryland Rules reserve the sanction of indefinite suspension for attorney misconduct. Accordingly, we impose \u201cindefinite suspension\u201d upon an incapacitated attorney typically only when the attorney is adjudicated also of misconduct warranting such a sanction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In the present case, because there has been no final adjudication finding misconduct by Kourtesis in the District of Columbia, an \u201cindefinite suspension\u201d sanction in Maryland is not appropriate. Rather, Md. Rule 16 \u2014 721(b) limits this Court to imposing one of two \u201cremedies\u201d \u2014 inactive status or conditional diversion \u2014 upon an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>incapacitated attorney, such as Kourtesis. Because conditional diversion is inapplicable in this case,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> placement on inactive status is the sole possible remedy in circumstances such as the present case where attorney misconduct has not been found at present.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">We acknowledge the imposition of \u201cinactive status\u201d upon Kourtesis differs from the District of Columbia\u2019s imposition of \u201cindefinite suspension\u201d; however, we point out that the difference is largely in name alone. The District of Columbia has no remedy equivalent to our \u201cinactive status,\u201d but rather deploys \u201cindefinite suspension\u201d as both a sanction and a remedy. Because Maryland differentiates between sanctions and remedies, we conclude that this State\u2019s \u201cindefinite suspension\u201d sanction, and its concomitant condemning connotation, is inappropriate here; instead, placement on inactive status is commensurate with our treatment of past cases involving incompetency where no final adjudication on the merits of the underlying misconduct charges has taken place as yet.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Before imposing the most analogous remedy (inactive status) on Kourtesis, however, we must determine whether <em>any </em>reciprocal remedy is appropriate in this case. Kourtesis urges this Court to send the matter to a judge of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County for a hearing on his fitness to practice law in Maryland because reciprocal discipline should not be ordered in this case due to exceptional circumstances under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Md. Rule 16 \u2014 773(e)(3) and (5). After consideration of these arguments, we conclude that neither exception applies in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">First, Kourtesis alleges that the reason for his indefinite suspension in the District of Columbia no longer exists and, thus, pursuant to Rule 16 \u2014 773(e)(5), no reciprocal action is appropriate. This argument misunderstands the nature of Kourtesis\u2019s indefinite suspension in the District of Columbia and its significance to us. The D.C. Court of Appeals imposed indefinite suspension upon Kourtesis in response to his motion, pursuant to D.C. Bar Rule XI, \u00a7 13, seeking indefinite suspension <em>and the abeyance of the disciplinary matters </em>due to his self-professed incapacity. The abeyance of the disciplinary matters is interconnected with the indefinite suspension. In order for Kourtesis to be reinstated in the District of Columbia, he must be willing to have the abeyance of the disciplinary matters lifted. In light of the dual purpose of Kourtesis\u2019s \u201cindefinite suspension\u201d in the District of Columbia, we conclude that, even if he has regained competency such that he may be deemed \u201cfit to practice law\u201d at this point, the other reason for his \u201cindefinite suspension\u201d \u2014 the stayed disciplinary proceedings in the District of Columbia \u2014 continues to exist until dismissed or adjudicated on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">To conclude otherwise would convert Maryland into an asylum for attorneys wishing to flee from pending disciplinary matters in other jurisdictions. Allowing an attorney, who petitioned in a sister jurisdiction for disciplinary proceedings to be held in abeyance due to self-professed incompetency, to seek safe haven in our State by demonstrating regained competency and permitting him or her to continue to practice here, while continuing to avoid the disciplinary proceedings stayed indefinitely in the other jurisdiction, is contradictory to our duty to uphold the integrity of the legal profession, as well as to the purposes of reciprocal attorney grievance cases. <em>See Rheb v. Bar Ass\u2019n of Baltimore City, </em>186 Md. 200, 205, 46 A.2d 289, 291 (1946) (\u201c \u2018The question is whether, after the conduct of this man, it is proper that he should continue a member of a profession which should stand free from all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>suspicion.\u2019\u201d) (citation omitted); Alan M. Colvin, <em>Reciprocal Discipline: Double Jeopardy or A State\u2019s Right to Protect Its Citizens?, </em>25 J. Legal Prof. 143, 143 (2001) (\u201cReciprocal discipline prevents attorneys from violating ethical rules, getting suspended from the practice of law, and then transferring to a new jurisdiction to continue to practice with an unblemished record of ethical conduct.\u201d). \u201cAn attorney is not cured or rehabilitated by transferring jurisdictions----\u201d <em>Reciprocal Discipline, </em>25 J. Legal Prof. at 149. Thus, we conclude that the reasons for Kourtesis\u2019s indefinite suspension continue to exist and the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d exception of Md. Rule 16-773(e)(5) should not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">We dismiss additionally Kourtesis\u2019s claimed \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d of \u201cgrave injustice.\u201d <em>See </em>Md. Rule 16-773(e)(3). At oral argument before us, Kourtesis\u2019s counsel stated that the process for obtaining a final adjudication in the District of Columbia would take many years and that reinstatement would be quicker if a competency hearing was held instead in Maryland. According to Kourtesis, a \u201cgrave injustice\u201d under Rule 16-773(e)(3) would occur if this Court imposed a sanction or remedy that precluded him from practicing law in this State until the proceedings in the District of Columbia were resolved finally. This conclusion ensues, he asserts, because of the financial difficulties he would endure. Although we acknowledge that imposing sanctions or remedies may cause great financial difficulties for respondents, such difficulties are not the type of \u201cgrave injustice\u201d envisioned by our rules, but rather an unfortunate (but necessary) consequence of measures designed to protect the public. Moreover, it seems to us far-fetched to call this a \u201cgrave injustice\u201d when Kourtesis requested the disposition he received in the District of Columbia slightly over a year ago and, apparently, seeks a hearing in this State in an effort to \u201cforum-shop\u201d to prove he has regained his competency, while keeping in place the abeyance of the disciplinary proceedings in the District of Columbia.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Regardless of Kourtesis\u2019s reason(s) for seeking a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>separate competency hearing, we conclude that the exceptional circumstance of \u201cgrave injustice\u201d under Rule 16-773(e)(3) does not apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">In conclusion, we hold that the appropriate reciprocal remedy in Maryland for Kourtesis is, at present, inactive status until further order by this Court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">IT IS SO ORDERED.

In this regard, we are confronted with what appears to be our first reciprocal attorney grievance case involving an attorney adjudicated to be incapacitated by an originating jurisdiction.
