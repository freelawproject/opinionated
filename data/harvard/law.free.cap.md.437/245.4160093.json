Petitioner charged Frost with violating various Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d or \u201cRule\u201d), specifically Rule 8.1 (Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rule 8.2(a) (Judicial and Legal Officials);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Rule 8.4(a), (c) and (d) (Misconduct).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-752(a) (Order Designating Judge), this Court referred the matter to the Honorable Paul F. Harris of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County to conduct an evidentiary hearing and to render findings of fact and recommend conclusions of law pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-757. After Petitioner made reasonable attempts to personally serve Respondent with a copy of the Petition for Disciplin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>ary or Remedial Action and related papers, including discovery requests and a written request for admission of facts and genuineness of documents,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Petitioner effectuated service on Respondent by serving the Client Protection Fund of the Bar of Maryland pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-753.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Respondent filed no response to the Petition for Disciplinary Action and discovery requests, including the Requests for Admissions, prompting the hearing judge\u2019s entry of an order of default. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 16-754(c) (providing that the failure to file an answer shall be treated as a default).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">On May 14, 2013, Judge Harris conducted a hearing on the merits. Respondent failed to appear for or participate in the hearing. During the brief hearing, Petitioner requested that all of Petitioner\u2019s Requests for Admissions, which went unanswered by Respondent, be deemed admitted. Judge Harris granted the request and accepted the Requests for Admissions into evidence. Thereafter, the hearing judge issued \u201cFindings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>of Fact and Conclusions of Law,\u201d in which he found by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent\u2019s actions constituted violations of MLRPC 8.1(b), 8.2(a), 8.4(a), (c) and (d). In doing so, Judge Harris made the following findings of facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8G\">Respondent was admitted to the Maryland Bar on June 29, 1972. He does not maintain an office for the practice of law.

Prior to May 2, 2012, Respondent had no relationship or communication with Mr. Meng. On or about May 2, 2012, Respondent forwarded a copy of the April 23, 2012 email to Paul Carlin, Esquire. On or about May 2, 2012, Respondent forwarded a copy of the April 23, 2012 email to Katherine Kelly Howard, Esquire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">On May 4, 2012, Mr. Meng emailed Respondent asking why the April 23, 2012 email was sent to him, directing him to Rule 8.2, 8.3 and 8.4 of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct and requesting a response as how the April 23, 2012 email did not violate Rules 8.2 and 8.4 and did not require reporting to Petitioner pursuant to Rule 8.3. On May 10, 2012, no response having been received to his May 4 email, Mr. Meng again emailed Respondent requesting a response to the questions posed on May 4, 2012. On May 18, 2012, Respondent emailed Mr. Meng stating, \u201cYou should have something from me in your mail Monday.\u201d On May 18, 2012, Respondent mailed Mr. Meng a letter directed to Chief of Police J. Thomas Manger, Montgomery County, Maryland. The May 18, 2012 letter did not, in any way, respond to the questions posed by Mr. Meng in his emails of May 4 and May 10. Mr. Meng received the May 18, 2012 letter on May 21, 2012. On May 21, 2012, Mr. Meng emailed Respondent again requesting a response to his May 4 and May 10 emails.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">On May 23, 2012, no further communication having been received from Respondent, Mr. Meng filed a complaint with the Petitioner and enclosed: (1) Respondent\u2019s April 23, 2012 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>email, (2) Mr. Meng\u2019s May 4, 2012 email to Respondent, (3) Mr. Meng\u2019s May 10, 2012 email to Respondent, (4) Mr. Meng\u2019s May 18, 2012 email to Respondent, (5) Respondent\u2019s letter of May 1, 2012 to Chief of Police J. Thomas Manger, and (6) Mr. Meng\u2019s May 21, 2012 email to Respondent. By letter dated July 11, 2012, Bar Counsel forwarded a copy of the May 23, 2012 complaint and enclosures to Respondent and requested a response thereto be provided, in writing, no later than July 27, 2012. Respondent received Bar Counsel\u2019s July 11, 2012 letter and enclosures. On or about July 26, 2012, Respondent sent a letter to Bar Counsel stating: \u201cThe statements of mine concerning which objections have been presented to your office are protected from state action by the free speech clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d On or about July 27, 2012, Respondent sent a letter to Bar Counsel stating, <em>inter alia:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"At5\">How did it happen, I wonder, that ten days after my email message of April 24 long-time A.G.C. of Maryland Commissioner George Meng (to whom I had forwarded that email on the subject perjury) sends me an e-mail message (for the first time in his life) with the absurd allegation that I\u2019m in violation of Rule 8 of the Rules of Professional Responsibility? No reasonably prudent individual would believe that you and he and, most likely, some other people had not conferred with one another about me and my truth-telling before on May 4th George undertook his fruitless efforts to have me assume the role of attorney respondent who offers an explanation/states some defense to a \u201ccomplaint.\u201d How did you as the Maryland Bar Counsel dare to get involved in this sort of activity, Glenn?

On or about September 13, 2012, Respondent sent a copy of a letter addressed to \u201cThe Members of the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland\u201d to Bar Counsel. The September 13, 2012 letter requested the commission \u201corder Mr. Grossman to answer truthfully in writing the question posed to him in [the] August 15th letter <em>post haste.\u201d </em>In addition to sending the September 13 letter to Bar Counsel, Respondent sent copies to the members of the Attorney Grievance Commission.

(Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Although Respondent did not at any time participate in the proceedings in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, on May 28, 2013, he filed with this Court a motion to vacate any findings of fact and conclusions of law made by Judge Harris, and to dismiss the action for lack of proper service of process, which we denied on May 30, 2013.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Neither Respondent nor Petitioner filed exceptions to the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the hearing judge.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On July 5, 2013, Petitioner filed its Recommendation for Sanction, recommending disbarment. On July 17, 2013, Respondent filed a new motion to dismiss with this Court, alleging principally that there was insufficient service of process upon him, that he had committed no violation of any Rule of Professional Responsibility, and that the statements underlying the instant action against him were protected by the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. He further requested that this Court \u201cdismiss this unjustified, unjustifiable, and downright ridiculous attorney disciplinary case.\u201d Subsequently, on July 30, 2013, Respondent filed a \u201cStatement\u201d requesting this Court to consider Respondent\u2019s July 13, 2013 \u201cMotion to Dismiss\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>timely filed exceptions in this case. Respondent\u2019s \u201cMotion to Dismiss\u201d was not, by its title or date, filed properly or timely under Rule 16-758(b),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and we decline to consider it to be timely filed exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">In attorney discipline proceedings, \u201cthis Court has original and complete jurisdiction and conducts an independent review of the record____[T]he hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact generally will be accepted unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm'n v. Cherry-Mahoi, </em>388 Md. 124, 152, 879 A.2d 58, 76 (2005) (citations omitted). Maryland Rule 16-759(b)(2)(A) provides, \u201c[i]f no exceptions are filed, the Court may treat the findings of fact as established for the purpose of determining appropriate sanctions, if any.\u201d In other words, we deem the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact \u201ccorrect if (1) they are not clearly erroneous, or (2), at th[is] Court\u2019s option, if neither party filed exceptions to them.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm'n v. Kremer, </em>432 Md. 325, 334, 68 A.3d 862, 868 (2013) (citations omitted). After a review of the record, and because neither Petitioner nor Respondent filed exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, we conclude that the facts are established as determined by Judge Harris.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">The hearing judge\u2019s proposed conclusions of law are reviewed for legal correctness. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm'n v. West, </em>378 Md. 395, 410, 836 A.2d 588, 596 (2003). \u201cIn other words, the ultimate determination as to an attorney\u2019s alleged misconduct is reserved for this Court.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm'n v. De La Paz, </em>418 Md. 534, 552, 16 A.3d 181, 192 (2011) (citation omitted). Based on our review of the record, we agree with the hearing judge that Respondent violated Rules 8.1(b), 8.2(a), 8.4(a), (c) and (d). We will, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>address Respondent\u2019s \u201cMotion to Dismiss,\u201d in which he alleged that he was not properly served, and that his conduct, as it relates to the violation of Rule 8.2(a), is entitled to First Amendment protection. We conclude that his motion is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">As noted previously, an order of default was entered against Respondent due to his failure to file an answer or participate in the disciplinary proceedings. Moreover, Respondent failed to bring his claims regarding improper service to the attention of the hearing judge. Rather, his \u201cmotions to dismiss\u201d were filed with this Court after the disciplinary hearing had concluded, thus the hearing judge was never given an opportunity to rule on them. Where Respondent failed to participate in or appear for the disciplinary hearing despite being properly served with process, and where the circumstances surrounding Petitioner\u2019s attempts to personally serve Respondent indicate his awareness of the instant proceedings, Respondent\u2019s failure to comply with the rules for disciplinary procedures is inexcusable. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Steinberg, </em>395 Md. 337, 361, 910 A.2d 429, 443 (2006) (holding that where an attorney received service of process and provided no valid reason for his failure to participate in the proceedings, the attorney\u2019s \u201cfailure to appear at the hearing [was] inexcusable\u201d and that the order of default was proper); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Faber, </em>373 Md. 173, 178-79, 817 A.2d 205, 208-09 (2003) (rejecting the respondent\u2019s exception that he did not receive proper service and that he was denied due process, where bar counsel demonstrated repeated attempts to serve the respondent personally and on the Client Protection Fund of the Bar of Maryland). Therefore, we will not set aside the default entered against Respondent. We next address Respondent\u2019s First Amendment argument as it relates to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Respondent violated Rule 8.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">MLRPC Rule 8.2(a) provides that \u201c[a] lawyer shall not make a statement that the lawyer knows to be false or with reckless disregard as to its truth or falsity concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>qualifications or integrity of a judge, adjudicatory officer, or public legal officer, or of a candidate for election or appointment to judicial or legal office.\u201d The facts establish that Respondent made the following statements in his email dated April 23, 2012, later disseminated to members of the Bar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\">1. That the Honorable Ann S. Harrington was a \u201clawless judge\u201d and accusing her of \u201carranging] for deputy sheriffs of the Montgomery County, MD Sheriffs Office to illegally arrest [him];\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">2.

That Governor O\u2019Malley exerted \u201cimproper\u201d influence over members of the Montgomery County Police Department.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">Along with its Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action, Petitioner served Requests for Admissions asking Respondent to admit that at the time he made each of the above statements, he knew them to be false or made them with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity, and that he had no facts to support any of the statements. Because Respondent failed to answer the requests, they were deemed admitted and, therefore, Respondent is charged with knowledge of the falsity of each statement, or reckless disregard as to the truth or falsity of each statement. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 16-756 (providing that discovery in attorney grievance cases is governed by Title 2, Chapter 400 of the Maryland Rules); Md. Rule 2-424(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>(\u201cEach matter of which an admission is requested shall be deemed admitted unless ... the party to whom the request is directed serves a response.... \u201d); <em>De La Paz, </em>418 Md. at 542, 16 A.3d at 186 (noting that because the attorney \u201cfailed to file an answer to Bar Counsel\u2019s Petitions or respond to its Requests for Admissions of Facts and Genuineness of Documents; thus, the factual averments in those Petitions were deemed admitted, in accordance with Md. Rules 2-323(e), 2-613, and 16-754(c)\u201d); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

At the outset, we reject the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Respondent\u2019s statement as to Governor O\u2019Malley violates Rule 8.2(a), because Governor O\u2019Malley, the chief executive of the State of Maryland, is not a \u201cpublic legal officer\u201d for the purposes of the Rule.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The five remaining statements, however, involve judges or public legal officers, which fall under the purview of Rule 8.2(a). We shall hold that by making those five statements, with the knowledge that they were false or with reckless disregard for their truth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>or falsity, Respondent violated Rule 8.2(a), and further that Respondent\u2019s statements are not entitled to protection under the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Moreover, these statements are, generally, the kind of statements that Rule 8.2(a) is intended to prevent. Allegations of corruption tend to discredit the public\u2019s trust and confidence in the judiciary and judicial system. Our analysis of this case rests on Respondent\u2019s statements taken together as a whole. For the sake of clarity, we note that certain phrases, alone, may not necessarily rise to the level of an attack on a judicial officer or public legal officer sufficient to warrant action pursuant to Rule 8.2(a). For example, Respondent\u2019s use of the words \u201clawless\u201d and \u201cweak man,\u201d without further allegations or criticisms, in another circumstance might not constitute a violation of Rule 8.2(a). Here, nevertheless, where those phrases were used in conjunction with false factual allegations of corrupt activity, to include collusion with law enforcement and \u201carranging] for deputy sheriffs ... to illegally arrest [him],\u201d Respondent is clearly in violation of Rule 8.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The Preamble to the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct provides that \u201c[6] ... a lawyer should further the public\u2019s understanding of and confidence in the rule of law and the justice system because legal institutions in a constitutional democracy depend on popular participation and support to maintain their authority.\u201d In other words, \u201c[m]embers of the legal profession have a responsibility to refrain from engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. DeMaio, </em>379 Md. 571, 581, 842 A.2d 802, 808 (2004). Rule 8.2(a) furthers this principle by requiring lawyers to refrain from impugning the qualifications or fitness of judicial and public legal officers. As Comment [1] to MLRPC 8.2(a) clarifies, \u201c[e]xpressing honest and candid opinions on such matters contributes to improving the administration of justice. Conversely, false statements by a lawyer can unfairly undermine public confi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>dence in the administration of justice.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See also In re Simon, </em>913 So.2d 816, 824 (La.2005) (\u201cWhile a lawyer as a citizen has a right to criticize [judges, judicial officers or public legal officers] publicly, he [or she] should be certain of the merit of his complaint, use appropriate language, and avoid petty criticisms, for unrestrained and intemperate statements tend to lessen public confidence in our legal system.\u201d). In other words, the purpose of Rule 8.2(a) is not to protect judges, judicial officers, or public legal officials from unkind or undeserved criticisms. Rather, Rule 8.2(a) protects the integrity of the judicial system, and the public\u2019s confidence therein, and it does so in a limited way. Statements in violation of Rule 8.2(a) must (1) be false, (2) impugn the integrity or qualifications of judges, judicial officers or public legal officers, and (3) be made by the attorney knowing them to be false or with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

We held that this conduct was \u201cwholly improper\u201d and that \u201c[i]f there was a question in his mind about the conversation between [the trial judge] and [opposing counsel] ... [the attorney] should have brought his client\u2019s concern to [the judge\u2019s] attention and made appropriate inquiry of her, not write a letter to counsel accusing him and the judge of having an inappropriate <em>ex parte </em>communication[.]\u201d <em>Hermina, </em>379 Md. at 520-21, 842 A.2d at 772. <em>See also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

In particular, the respondent made claims that the Chief Judge and Clerk of the Court of Special Appeals had \u201ccollu[ded] ... to remove briefs from the legal process\u201d and that the judge was \u201cengaged in a scheme of unjust enrichment.\u201d <em>DeMaio, </em>379 Md. at 576, 842 A.2d at 805. In that case, much like in the instant case, the respondent refused to participate in the disciplinary process and the hearing judge entered an order of default against him. <em>DeMaio, </em>379 Md. at 573-74, 842 A.2d at 803. After bar counsel filed its recommendation for sanction, the respondent filed a \u201cresponse\u201d to the recommendation for sanction, in which he criticized bar counsel\u2019s investigation and action against him. <em>DeMaio, </em>379 Md. at 578, 842 A.2d at 806. Moreover, the respondent maintained his allegations against the Chief Judge and Clerk of the Court of Special Appeals and made no apparent attempts to investigate or substantiate his claims. We held that these statements were cause for disbarment, and \u201ccertainly is conduct that prejudices the administration of justice seriously and most directly.\u201d <em>DeMaio, </em>379 Md. at 585, 842 A.2d at 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Although DeMaio did not contend that his statements were entitled to First Amendment protection, in that case we nevertheless discussed <em>In re Evans, </em>801 F.2d 703 (4th Cir.1986), in which the Fourth Circuit specifically rejected such a First Amendment argument. In that case, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland disbarred Evans from practicing law in that court for a violation of Rule 8.2(a) where Evans wrote a letter accusing a magistrate judge of incompetence and/or religious and racial bias. In rejecting Evans\u2019s argument that his speech was protected under the First Amendment, the Fourth Circuit, quoting a New York state appellate court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Judicial officers, as we have said, are not immune from suit or criticism; but, like every one else, they are protected against scandalous charges. To make a public, false and malicious attack on a judicial officer is more than an offense against him individually; it is an offense against the dignity and integrity of the courts and of our judicial system. It may bring discredit upon the administration of justice amongst citizens who have no way of determining the truth of the charges. It tends to impair the respect and authority of the court. In this and in other jurisdictions, the rule is well settled that an attorney who engages in making false, scandalous or other improper attacks upon a judicial officer is subject to discipline.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-5\"><em>In re Evans, </em>801 F.2d at 707 (quoting <em>In the Matter of Greenfield, </em>24 A.D.2d 651, 652, 262 N.Y.S.2d 349, 350-51 (N.Y.App.Div.1965)). The Fourth Circuit also cited several other jurisdictions that have reached a similar conclusion as to the limitations of First Amendment protection for speech by lawyers that is in contravention of rules of professional conduct and prejudicial to the administration of justice. <em>In re Evans, </em>801 F.2d at 707-08 (citing <em>The People ex rel.

Gansler, </em>377 Md. 656, 835 A.2d 548 (2003). In that case, then State\u2019s Attorney for Montgomery County Douglas Gansler was charged with violating Rule 3.6, which prohibits lawyers from making certain extrajudicial statements that the lawyer knows or should know have a substantial likelihood of causing material prejudice to an adjudicative proceeding. We discussed the origins and purpose of Rule 3.6, which generally is to protect defendants\u2019 Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial. <em>Gansler, </em>377 Md. at 674-77, 835 A.2d at 558-59. In addressing the applicability of the First Amendment to speech by attorneys in the context of Rule 3.6, we stated that \u201c[i]n general, the First Amendment applies equally to an ordinary citizen and an attorney,\u201d but, when acting as an attorney, \u201c[e]ven outside the courtroom, the speech of a lawyer may be curtailed to an extent greater than an ordinary citizen\u2019s.\u201d 377 Md. at 677, 835 A.2d at 560 (citation and quotation omitted).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Noting that \u201cattorneys occupy a special role as participants in the criminal justice system, and, as a result, the public may view their speech as authoritative and reliable[,]\u201d we held that Gansler violated Rule 3.6 by making several statements to the press about certain defendants\u2019 confessions, plea bargains, and his opinion of their guilt, related to pending cases. <em>Gansler, </em>377 Md. at 676, 835 A.2d at 569. Our analysis in <em>Gansler </em>is consistent with <em>DeMaio </em>and our analysis of Rule 8.2(a) today. Although Rule 8.2(a) limits attorney speech, it does so in a narrow context. The purpose of the Rule is to prevent damage to the integrity of the judicial system. False statements impugning the integrity of \u201cjudges, judicial officers, and public legal officials\u201d undermines the integrity of the judiciary, and \u201cprejudices the administration of justice seriously and most directly.\u201d <em>DeMaio, </em>379 Md. at 585, 842 A.2d at 810. Accordingly, where Respondent made knowingly false statements alleging corrupt activity by several judges and public legal officers in relation to earlier criminal proceedings against him, such expression is not entitled to protection under the First Amendment and is plainly in violation of MLRPC Rule 8.2(a).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">Our goal when imposing sanctions is to protect the public and the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession, not to punish the erring attorney. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Additionally, DeMaio failed to demonstrate any investigation or factual basis for his allegations, and maintained his allegations throughout the disciplinary proceedings against him. Quoting <em>In re Evans, </em>we stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>[AIppellant\u2019s failure to investigate, coupled with his unrelenting reassertion of the charges ... convincingly demonstrates his lack of integrity and fitness to practice law.

In addition, Respondent has repeatedly refused to offer any justification for his conduct, which, like in <em>DeMaio, </em>raises a question as to his fitness to continue in the practice of law. Respondent made numerous unsubstantiated allegations against judges and public legal officers, which he then disseminated without explanation to members of the Bar. Despite repeated requests to explain these allegations, as well as requests to explain why he disseminated them to various members of the Bar, Respondent has at all times ignored these requests or refused to offer any rational reason for his criticisms or the dissemination of those criticisms. Respondent has also presented no evidence that he has made any investigation into the truthfulness of his claims. In addition to his outright failure to respond or participate meaningfully in the instant proceedings, Respondent\u2019s inflammatory letter to Bar Counsel, stating, for example, \u201cyou should be ashamed of yourself,\u201d and insinuating that Bar Counsel would not respond \u201ctruthfully\u201d to his communications, as well as his \u201cmotion to dismiss\u201d referring to the instant action as an \u201cunjustified, unjustifiable, and downright ridiculous attorney disciplinary case,\u201d all reflect Respondent\u2019s lack of fitness to continue in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>practice of law.

Thus, we determine what the reasonable attorney, considered in light of all his professional functions, would do in the same or similar circumstances.\u201d) (citation and quotation omitted); <em>Yagman, </em>55 F.3d at 1438 (following <em>Sandlin </em>and stating that \"an objective malice standard strikes a constitutionally permissible balance between an attorney\u2019s right to criticize the judiciary and the public\u2019s interest in preserving confidence in the judicial system: Lawyers may freely voice criticisms supported by a reasonable factual basis even if they turn out to be mistaken.\u201d). Here, because Respondent, by default, is deemed to have admitted that the statements were false and that he had actual knowledge of their falsity, we need not and do not address the issue of whether a subjective or objective standard is appropriate in this context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b298-9\">.

We note that there are qualified and absolute privileges that will apply to certain speech as a defense to defamation claims, and these privileges generally apply equally to statements made by lawyers. For example, in defamation cases, an attorney has an absolute privilege to make defamatoiy statements that are rationally related to a judicial proceeding. <em>See Norman v. Borison, </em>418 Md. 630, 650, 17 A.3d 697, 709 (2011). We agree with several of our sister states, however, that there is no absolute privilege that would protect an attorney from disciplinary action. <em>See Loigman v. Twp. Comm. of Twp. of Middletown, </em>185 N.J. 566, 889 A.2d 426, 438 (2006); <em>Krouse </em>v. <em>Bower, </em>20 P.3d 895, 901 n. 1 (Utah 2001); <em>Kirschstein v.

Absolute privilege is a broad defense to tort claims, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>tort claims related to statements made in connection to pending AGC actions, <em>see Mixter v. Farmer, </em>215 Md.App. 536, 81 A.3d 631 (2013); however, we confirm that it is not a defense to claims of unprofessional conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b303-7\">ADKINS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A3vu\">Concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">The Majority opinion is well-researched and well-stated. Respectfully, I write this concurring opinion to articulate a constraint on our disciplinary authority that the Majority does not express. In my view, there are boundaries on our authority to discipline an attorney for false statements or reckless statements under Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct 8.2(a) that are dependent on the context of the false or reckless statement that is made. Judge McDonald ventures that \u201cfew lawyers \u2014 or judges \u2014 have not, at some time, uttered an unkind and undeserved criticism of a judge, an Attorney General, a State\u2019s Attorney, or a Public Defender.\u201d McDonald, J., Concurring and Dissenting Op. at 275, 85 A.3d at 281. I agree, and add that, in frustration, disappointment, or anger at an adverse ruling, it is altogether human to do so\u2014 even if the statement is false, or made with reckless disregard for its truth. Such statements should not be the subject of professional discipline, provided they are made to family members, within the confines of one\u2019s own law firm, or to other close associates whom the speaker knows to be like-minded. Were we to discipline lawyers for such statements, we and the Attorney Grievance Commission would be treading on the constitutional protection for freedom of speech so cherished by our citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>As Judge McDonald points out, the First Amendment is not confined to, or even primarily directed at, discussions among like-minded people. I limit my comment to this context only to give reassurance to practicing lawyers that I, at least, would not agree to our being \u201cword police\u201d of their day-to-day conversations about judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">But, here, the statements made by Respondent were not so confined. As the Majority says, the statements in question were intentionally mailed by Respondent to lawyers who were not part of a judicial or other disciplinary body, and with whom he had absolutely no relationship and no reason to correspond, except to make the admittedly false and defamatory statements. I do not share Judge McDonald\u2019s view that we should restrain from imposing discipline based upon a respondent\u2019s deemed admissions. In this context, I agree that the discipline imposed by the Majority opinion is fully justified.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b304-6\">McDONALD, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A3_\">Concurring and Dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Although the Majority opinion is well thought out and carefully written, I cannot join it. Our primary purpose in attorney discipline is to protect the public from inept or errant lawyers, not to protect public officials from criticism, even if unjustified. I would suspend Mr. Frost for his failure to respond adequately to Bar Counsel\u2019s inquiry, but am not comfortable disbarring on this limited record for what appears to be largely an expression of opinion, misguided though that opinion may be.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Under the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d) 8.1(b), an attorney should respond to a lawful inquiry from Bar Counsel, even if, in the attorney\u2019s view, the underlying complaint is frivolous or any resulting disciplinary action would ultimately prove untenable. Mr. Frost\u2019s failure to respond substantively to Bar Counsel\u2019s inquiry thus violated MLRPC 8.1(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An appropriate sanction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>would be an indefinite suspension with a special condition of readmission that he cooperate with Bar Counsel\u2019s inquiry. In addition, the record of this matter documents erratic behavior by Mr. Frost that raises reasonable questions about his judgment and competence (in the broadest sense). Given our responsibility to the public with respect to those we license to serve it as attorneys, I would also condition Mr. Frost\u2019s readmission on the results of an appropriate medical evaluation. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 16-760(h)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">MLRPC 8.2(a) incorporates in the disciplinary rules a restriction on attorney speech outside the courtroom or a legal proceeding. The alleged violation of MLRPC 8.2(a) in this case is based on the content of an e-mail that Mr. Frost sent to his ex-wife and then inexplicably shared with three other lawyers. MLRPC 8.2(a) prohibits a lawyer from making a statement concerning the qualifications or integrity of a judge (or other legal officer) only if the lawyer makes the statement with knowledge that it is false or with \u201creckless disregard\u201d as to its truth. The Restatement of the Law Governing Lawyers reiterates that standard and elaborates its rationale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">Lawyers are specially situated to assess the official performance of judges and other judicial and legal officers. Accordingly, both constitutional law and sound social policy require that lawyers have broad latitude in criticizing such officers. Under the rule of <em>New York Times v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964), and its progeny, judges and other public legal officers are \u201cpublic officials,\u201d so that an action by a judge or public legal officer against a lawyer for damages for defamation would require a showing of actual malice. Similar considerations should also lead to application of the standard in <em>New York Times v. Sullivan </em>in lawyer-discipline cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers \u00a7 114, comment b (2000 &amp; 2013 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The Majority opinion finds that the \u201cknowing or reckless\u201d element is satisfied in this case as a result of Mr. Frost\u2019s failure to participate in the proceedings below and to respond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>to requests for admissions. In other words, he is deemed to have admitted the intent element of the violation, which, in the view of the Majority opinion, relieves us of the need to consider the actual content and circumstances of his e-mail, or the standard by which the statements in question should be judged. Majority op. at pp. 261, 265-66 n. 11, 85 A.3d at 273, 276 n. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Requests for admissions are typically used to obtain agreement as to the genuineness of documents, the establishment of other foundational facts necessary for the admission of evidence, or the truth of uncontested facts, thereby streamlining the adjudication of a matter. <em>See, e.g., </em>P. Niemeyer &amp; L. Schuett, Maryland Rules Commentary 336 (3d ed. 2004) (\u201cRequests for admissions of fact serve a limited but useful function ____The purpose of the rule is ... to eliminate from trial those matters over which the parties truly have no dispute\u201d). While I do not fault Bar Counsel, or any other litigant, for seeking to have an opposing party concede the entire case through this discovery device, requests for admission that concern the ultimate issue in a case are generally not that useful and thus are not enforced.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>And when a request on an ultimate issue is \u201cdeemed\u201d admitted, it may be more accurately characterized as a default than a finding or holding on the particular issue. Thus, the deemed violation of MLRPC 8.2(a) is largely an echo of the violation of MLRPC 8.1(b) \u2014 the failure to respond adequately to Bar Counsel\u2019s inquiry or to participate in the proceedings below. Perhaps the peculiar facts of this case \u2014 or the unusual way in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>the ultimate issue has been determined \u2014 limit the significance of the Court\u2019s holding. On the other hand, it may establish an unfortunate precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">I suspect that few lawyers \u2014 or judges \u2014 have not, at some time, uttered an unkind and undeserved criticism of a judge, an Attorney General, a State\u2019s Attorney, or a Public Defender. No doubt there have been occasions where an attorney, in the aftermath of an adverse ruling, has commented on the parentage of the judge in a way that, even without the benefit of a \u201cdeemed admission,\u201d is obviously and literally false, but is essentially a statement of opinion rather than fact. Perhaps such remarks are usually made to those who share the sentiment and, unlike the instant case, do not generate a complaint. But whether there is a violation of MLRPC 8.2(a) should not depend on the sympathies or sensitivities of the listener.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the end, the rule is aimed at intentional factual misstatements, not rude opinions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The summary of case law in the Majority opinion is certainly accurate. I add four observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">First, as the authors of the Restatement noted, civil liability for criticism of a public official is limited to false statements made with actual <em>malice </em>\u2014 ie., knowledge of falsity or reckless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>disregard of falsity. <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964). In the context of critical remarks about judges, the Supreme Court has stated that \u201conly those false statements made with the high degree of awareness of their probable falsity demanded by <em>New York Times </em>may be the subject of either civil or criminal sanctions.\u201d <em>Garrison v. Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 64, 74, 85 S.Ct. 209, 13 L.Ed.2d 125 (1964) (reversing conviction of district attorney who stated that \u201cvacation-minded\u201d judges sympathetic to racketeering interests were responsible for court backlog and impeding vice investigations).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Second, the drafters of MLRPC 8.2(a) intended to incorporate the standards articulated in <em>Garrison </em>and <em>New York Times </em>in that rule. <em>See </em>American Bar Association, Model Rules of Professional Conduct, Proposed Final Draft (May 30, 1981) at 206 (\u201cRule 8.2 is consistent with that limitation [in <em>New York Times </em>and <em>Garrison </em>]\u201d); M. Tarkington, <em>The Truth be Damned: The First Amendment, Attorney Speech, and Judicial Reputation, 97 Geo. </em>L.J. 1567, 1587 &amp; n.123 (2009). (As the Majority opinion recounts, some courts have instead chosen not to apply the <em>New York Times </em>standard in favor of a less demanding, \u201cobjective\u201d standard. Majority op. at p. 266 n. 11, 85 A.3d at 276 n. 11).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Third, the decisions of this Court under MLRPC 8.2(a) that are relied upon by the Majority opinion all involved statements alleging specific acts of misconduct rather than a general negative characterization of the officials. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McClain, 406 </em>Md. 1, 956 A.2d 135 (2008) (in appeal to circuit court, attorney alleged that District Court judge had admitted personal bias against him and purported to \u201cdocument\u201d that allegation with false statements about the content of the record); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. DeMaio, </em>379 Md. 571, 842 A.2d 802 (2004) (attorney alleged, without factual basis, that judge had <em>ex parte </em>contact with opposing party, had possibly received a \u201cmonetary benefit\u201d from that party, and had colluded to remove briefs from public record); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Hermina, </em>379 Md. 503, 842 A.2d 762 (2004) (attorney accused judge of holding <em>ex </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number><em>parte </em>jury instruction conference with opposing counsel in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct). In this case, only the statements concerning Judge <em>Harrington </em>\u2014 i.e., that she allegedly arranged for deputy sheriffs to \u201cillegally\u201d arrest Mr. Frost \u2014 appear to go beyond derogatory adjectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">Finally, discipline imposed by the judiciary that may appear designed to shield judges from general statements of adverse opinions can itself undermine confidence in the judiciary. <em>See </em>J. Dodd, <em>The First Amendment and Attorney Discipline for Criticism of the Judiciary: Let the Lawyer Beware, </em>15 N. Ky. L.Rev. 129, 144 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">At this intersection of statements of fact and statements of opinion, of protected speech and public officials, it is best to proceed with caution. I would not impose discipline on the basis of a \u201cdeemed admission\u201d of the critical intent element. Rather, we should hold the charges under MLRPC 8.2(a) and 8.4(c) in abeyance. If Mr. Frost were suspended on the basis of the other charged violations, and were later to satisfy the conditions for readmission and cooperate with Bar Counsel\u2019s inquiry, I would remand the matter to the hearing judge for further consideration of the remaining charges. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 16-759(c)(6). But I would not disbar under MLRPC 8.2(a) and 8.4(c) at this time on this record.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-9\">. These facts would also support a determination that Mr. Frost violated MLRPC 8.4(a) (violation of the MLRPC) and 8.4(d) (conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b306-6\">. In the instant case, the Request for Admission of Facts and Genuineness of Documents largely concerned the genuineness of numerous items of correspondence involving Mr. Frost, as well as basic facts concerning his legal career and the content of statements he made. However, it also asked him to admit that he made various statements \u201cknowing that the statement was false\u201d and, with respect to the same statements, \u201cwith reckless disregard as to its truth or falsity.\u201d Among the other facts deemed admitted was that Mr. Frost is \u201cunable to render adequate legal service by reason of mental or physical illness or infirmity, or addiction to or dependence upon an intoxicant or drug.\u201d This last deemed admission concerning mental capacity conceivably raises a question about the two deemed admissions concerning the intent element.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b307-7\">. In her concurring opinion, Judge Adkins sensibly attempts to limit the reach of the Majority opinion, suggesting a sort of \"friends and family\u201d exception to its holding based on the First Amendment. The Restatement of the Law Governing Lawyers adopts a similar approach in limiting the restriction on attorney speech about judges to statements made \u201cpublicly\u201d \u2014 a qualification not included in MLRPC 8.2(a). <em>See </em>Restatement \u00a7 114. In any event, the authors of the Restatement \u2014 as well as the drafters of the model for MLRPC 8.2(a) \u2014 intended that the <em>New York Times </em>standard be satisfied. And the First Amendment is not confined to discussions among like-minded people, but rather designed to encourage and protect public discourse. <em>See, e.g., Whitney v. California, </em>274 U.S. 357, 376, 47 S.Ct. 641, 71 L.Ed. 1095 (1927) (Brandeis, J\u201e concurring); <em>Snyder v. </em>Phelps, - U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1207, 1215-17, 179 L.Ed.2d 172 (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b307-10\">. This was certainly the intent of the drafters of the model rule that became MLRPC 8.2(a). <em>See </em>American Bar Association, Model Rules of Professional Conduct, Proposed Final Draft (May 30, 1981) at 207 (\"Rule 8.2 applies to a statement of fact.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
