Rule 16-751 (a). The petition alleged violations of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d) in connection with Respondent\u2019s agreement to pursue his client\u2019s delinquent accounts receivable on a contingency fee basis and subsequent failure to remit to that client any portion of the funds he collected on the client\u2019s behalf. Specifically, the petition alleged that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.3 (diligence)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; MLRPC 1.4(a) and (b) (communication)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; MLRPC 1.15(a) (safekeeping property)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; MLRPC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>1.16(d) (declining or terminating representation)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; MLRPC 8.1(a) and (b) (bar admission and disciplinary matters)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>MLRPC 8.4(a), (b), (c), and (d) (misconduct)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; Maryland Rule 16-609 (prohibited transactions)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>; Maryland Code (1989, 2010 Repl.

Rupp, Jr., of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (\u201cthe hearing judge\u201d) to conduct an evidentiary hearing and render written findings of fact and conclusions of law. <em>See </em>Md. Rules 16-752(a) and 16-757(e). Respondent did not file a response to the Petition, timely or otherwise. Accordingly, on June 20, 2013, the hearing judge entered a default order against Respondent and the matter was set for a hearing on July 29, 2013. Respondent, notified of the default order and hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>date, neither moved to vacate the order nor appeared at the hearing. During the July 29 hearing, the hearing judge received evidence from Petitioner, acting through Assistant Bar Counsel. Thereafter, the hearing judge issued written findings of fact and conclusions of law, in which he concluded, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent had violated MLRPC 1.3; MLRPC 1.4; MLRPC 1.15(a); MLRPC 1.16(d); MLRPC 8.1(b); MLRPC 8.4(a), (b), (c), and (d); Maryland Rule 16-609; BOP \u00a7 10-306; and BOP \u00a7 10-606.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">On March 7, 2014, we held oral argument, at which only Petitioner, acting through Assistant Bar Counsel, appeared. That day, we entered a per curiam order disbarring Respondent. We explain in this opinion the reasons for Respondent\u2019s disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Based on the evidence accepted at the July 29 hearing, the hearing judge set forth findings of fact. We summarize them:</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Respondent has been a member of the Bar of this Court since November 1, 1978. In March 2003, Cindy and Matthew Griswold, owners of American Marketing Services, Inc. (a company that does business as \u201cThe Merchandiser\u201d), retained Respondent to collect delinquent accounts receivable on behalf of their company, filing collection actions whenever necessary. Respondent was to be paid on a contingency basis: he would keep as his fee one-third of any collections he made on behalf of The Merchandiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">In March<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 2011, Ms. Griswold received a telephone call from a client requesting a statement from The Merchandiser that her delinquent account had been paid in full subsequent to the filing of a collection action against her. Ms. Griswold looked into the matter and discovered that this client\u2019s account had been referred to Respondent for collection, Respondent had filed an action against the client, a judgment had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>awarded, and the judgment had been satisfied. The Merchandiser, however, had never received any portion of the judgment from Respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Ms. Griswold then searched the Maryland Judiciary Case Search website for various clients whose accounts were listed as delinquent. She discovered that lawsuits had been filed in many matters referred to Respondent and the cases had been settled, with judgments denoted as satisfied. Ms. Griswold believed that Respondent had collected approximately $78,773 from The Merchandiser\u2019s debtors on the company\u2019s behalf. Yet, The Merchandiser had received no funds from Respondent in connection with those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">From June through August 2011, Ms. Griswold requested from Respondent by telephone and email the status of various collection matters he was handling on behalf of The Merchandiser. Respondent remitted the collection amount, minus his fee, for approximately seven delinquent accounts but failed to respond as to over 200 other accounts.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">On August 29, 2011, Ms. Griswold sent a letter to Respondent demanding explanation of the status of all collection matters that had been referred to him, along with payment of any funds owed to The Merchandiser. Respondent did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>reply to this letter. Ms. Griswold then retained counsel, John Sadler, to assist in obtaining a response, and any funds owed to The Merchandiser, from Respondent. On September 16 and October 7, 2011, Mr. Sadler sent letters to Respondent requesting the status of all collection accounts and demanding that he remit all funds owed to The Merchandiser. Respondent did not reply to those letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">On October 28, 2011, Mr. Sadler sent a complaint letter to the Attorney Grievance Commission describing Respondent\u2019s failure to respond to The Merchandiser concerning the status of the collection accounts. On November 15 and 29, 2011, Bar Counsel sent letters to Respondent requesting a written response to Mr. Sadler\u2019s complaint. Respondent did not reply to those letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Bar Counsel obtained a subpoena for the records of Respondent\u2019s attorney trust account at Capital One Bank. On August 2, 2012, after reviewing the records, Bar Counsel sent a letter to Respondent requesting an accounting of numerous withdrawals he made from his attorney trust account without any notation as to the client matter for which the disbursements were made. Respondent did not reply to that letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Based upon these factual findings, the hearing judge concluded, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.3 (diligence); MLRPC 1.4 (communication); MLRPC 1.15(a) (safekeeping property); MLRPC 1.16(d) (declining or termination representation); MLRPC 8.1(b) (bar admission and disciplinary matters); MLRPC 8.4(a), (b), (c), and (d) (misconduct); Maryland Rule 16-609 (prohibited transactions); and BOP \u00a7 10-306 (misuse of trust money). The hearing judge wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-7\">This Court concludes that the Respondent, after being engaged to provide legal services to The Merchandiser, failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in carrying out that representation, thereby violating [MLRPC] 1.3. The Respondent also failed to keep his client reasonably informed about the status of his representation and failed to respond to his client\u2019s reasonable re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>quests for information, thereby violating MLRPC 1.4. The Respondent repeatedly failed to respond to the numerous emails, telephone calls and letters from Ms. Griswold, other officers of The Merchandiser, and the company\u2019s attorney, Mr. Sadler, concerning the status of the two hundred (200) collection accounts Respondent was handling on behalf of The Merchandiser. Upon abandoning his representation of The Merchandiser, the Respondent violated MLRPC 1.16(d) by not giving reasonable notice to the client and by failing to take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect his client\u2019s interests, such as surrendering papers and property to which his client was entitled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-4\">Despite his collection, on behalf of The Merchandiser, of over $78,000 [<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] from debtors of The Merchandiser\u2019s outstanding accounts, Respondent never paid any portion of said funds to his client nor advised the company that he received such funds on its behalf. The Respondent kept all funds collected on behalf of The Merchandiser and failed to submit any portion of same to his client. The Respondent knowingly misappropriated his client\u2019s, The Merchandiser\u2019s, portion of the settlement funds received from numerous collection matters he settled on its behalf, thereby violating MLRPC 1.15(a) and 8.4(a), (b), and (c), Maryland Rule 16-609, and [BOP] \u00a7\u00a7 10-306 and 10-606.[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>The Respondent violated MLRPC 8.1(b) when he knowingly and repeatedly failed to respond to lawful demand for information from the office of Bar Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Taken in its totality, the Respondent\u2019s conduct was prejudicial to the administration of justice, and therefore violated MLRPC 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">\n<em>Mitigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The Respondent has provided no evidence that mitigates his misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">In attorney discipline proceedings, this Court \u201chas original and complete jurisdiction and conducts an independent review of the record.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Page, </em>430 Md. 602, 626, 62 A.3d 163 (2013) (citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Jarosinski, </em>411 Md. 432, 448, 983 A.2d 477 (2009)). We accept the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact as correct unless shown to be clearly erroneous. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Lara, </em>418 Md. 355, 364, 14 A.3d 650 (2011) (citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Palmer, </em>417 Md. 185, 205, 9 A.3d 37 (2010)). If no exceptions are filed, we may treat the findings of fact as established for the purpose of determining the appropriate sanction. Md. Rule 16-759(b)(2)(A). We review <em>de novo </em>the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. Md. Rule 16 \u2014 759(b)(1); <em>Page, </em>430 Md. at 626, 62 A.3d 163. This is true even if, as in this case, a default order was entered against the respondent by the hearing judge. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Tinsky, </em>377 Md. 646, 653, 835 A.2d 542 (2003). The ultimate decision as to whether an attorney has engaged in professional conduct lies with this Court. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Joehl, </em>335 Md. 83, 88, 642 A.2d 194 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">Neither Respondent nor Bar Counsel filed exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact. We therefore treat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>those findings \u2014 with the exception of the finding that Respondent \u201cnever\u201d responded to Ms. Griswold \u2014 as established. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 16-759(b)(2)(A), <em>supra </em>note 11. Likewise, neither party filed exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. Based upon our <em>de novo </em>review of the record in this case, we agree with the hearing judge, for the reasons stated in his written conclusions of law, that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.3; MLRPC 1.4; MLRPC 1.15(a); MLRPC 1.16(d); MLRPC 8.1(b); MLRPC 8.4(a), (b), (c), and (d); Maryland Rule 16-609; and BOP \u00a7 10-306.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">The task that remains, then, is for us to determine the appropriate sanction for Respondent\u2019s misconduct. Respondent did not submit a recommendation for sanction. Bar Counsel, for his part, recommends disbarment. Bar Counsel contends that, absent \u201ccompelling extenuating circumstances,\u201d which the hearing judge did not find were present in this case, the appropriate sanction for the misappropriation of entrusted funds is disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\"> The severity of the sanction for an attorney\u2019s misconduct \u201cdepends on the circumstances of each case, the intent with which the acts were committed, the gravity, nature and effect of the violations, and any mitigating factors.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Ward, </em>394 Md. 1, 33, 904 A.2d 477 (2006) (citations omitted). As we consider the appropriate sanction, we bear in mind that the purpose of a sanction is not to punish the attorney, <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Garcia, </em>410 Md. 507, 521, 979 A.2d 146 (2009), but rather, \u201cto protect the public and the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession.\u201d <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Zimmerman, </em>428 Md. 119, 144, 50 A.3d 1205 (2012). \u201cSanctions accomplish these goals by deterring intolerable conduct and keeping those unfit to practice law from doing so.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The gravamen of Respondent\u2019s misconduct is his misappropriation of funds he collected on his client\u2019s behalf. As we have often repeated, \u201cthe misappropriation of entrusted funds is an act infected with deceit and dishonesty, and, in the absence of compelling extenuating circumstances justifying a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>lesser sanction, will result in disbarment.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Cherry-Mahoi, </em>388 Md. 124, 161, 879 A.2d 58 (2005) (internal quotation omitted). Such a sanction is warranted because attorneys</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-4\">must remember that the entrustment to them of the money and property of others involves a responsibility of the highest order. They must carefully administer and account for those funds. Appropriating any part of those funds to their own use and benefit without clear authority to do so cannot be tolerated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-5\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Owrutsky, </em>322 Md. 334, 345, 587 A.2d 511 (1991)). Here, Respondent, entrusted with the collection of thousands of dollars owed to his client, neither administered nor accounted for those funds. Instead, he withdrew the funds from his attorney trust account for his own use, without authorization to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Herman, </em>we disbarred an attorney for violations similar to those committed by Respondent. 380 Md. 378, 404, 401, 844 A.2d 1181 (2004). In that case, a collection agency retained the respondent, then practicing law in the State of New York, to pursue small claims on its behalf. 380 Md. at 384, 844 A.2d 1181. Under the arrangement, the respondent was authorized to deposit the funds he collected for the agency in his attorney trust account, then remit those funds, minus his fee, to the client. <em>Id. </em>at 385, 844 A.2d 1181. At some point, the respondent began to experience \u201coffice management\u201d problems, resulting in his failure to provide to his client regular disbursements and reports. <em>Id. </em>at 385-86, 844 A.2d 1181. He then moved to Maryland. <em>Id. </em>at 387, 844 A.2d 1181. After the move, the respondent continued to collect on the agency\u2019s debts but failed to remit funds he received or provide reports of those collections for over one year, during which period he continued to withdraw funds from the trust account for his own use. <em>Id. </em>at 388-89, 844 A.2d 1181. Imposing the sanction of disbarment, we found clear and convincing evidence that the respondent \u201cintentionally and willfully used funds for a purpose other than the purpose authorized by the client,\u201d which \u201creflected on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Ms honesty, trustworthiness, and fitness as a lawyer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 404, 401, 844 A.2d 1181. <em>See also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mitchell, </em>386 Md. 386, 401, 392-93, 872 A.2d 720 (2005) (disbarring attorney who, <em>inter alia, </em>failed to advise his client, the plaintiff in a personal injury lawsuit, that he had received a settlement proceeds check from the defendant, instead appropriating those proceeds for personal use).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">In sum, Respondent misappropriated client funds when he failed to remit to The Merchandiser two-thirds of the collections he made on the company\u2019s behalf. Our cases are clear that, absent compelling extenuating circumstances, such misconduct compels the sanction of disbarment. If there are any circumstances that may explain Respondent\u2019s actions, we have been made aware of none. Accordingly, disbarment is appropriate. It is for this reason that we entered the March 7, 2014, per curiam order disbarring Respondent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b675-11\">.

Although the hearing judge found that the telephone call occurred in April, the record reflects that the call, in fact, took place in March.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b679-7\">. The hearing judge described communications between The Merchandiser and Respondent during this period:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-8\">On June 22, 2011, an officer of The Merchandiser called and spoke with Respondent by telephone and requested the status of various collection matters Respondent was handling for The Merchandiser. The Respondent replied that he would provide a status update within a few days. However, he failed to do so. From June 22, 2011 through August 29, 2011, an officer of The Merchandiser telephoned Respondent\u2019s office on approximately twelve (12) separate occasions to inquire about the promised status update. The Respondent did not return any of those telephone calls and did not provide a status update.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">The record clearly demonstrates that Respondent was not <em>wholly </em>unresponsive, and we therefore do not accept the hearing judge\u2019s findings insofar as to clarify this point. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Lara, </em>418 Md. 355, 364, 14 A.3d 650 (2011) (citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

This figure comes from a spreadsheet the hearing judge admitted into evidence, uncontestcd, at the July 29 hearing.

The spreadsheet reflected accounts where Respondent had remitted a portion of the amount he presumably had collected, as well as those accounts where Respondent had remitted no portion of the amount he had collected.
