Proc. (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol., 2013 Supp.) (\u201cCP\u201d) \u00a7 8-201; (I.B) whether the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (\u201cthe circuit court\u201d) abused its discretion in not considering whether to appoint counsel for David E.

Trial and Direct Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The State charged Fuster, a dentist, with various sexual crimes against a minor patient. In the circuit court, a jury tried Fuster.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">At trial, as a witness for the State, W.K.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> testified as follows. On October 10, 2001 (when W.K. was fifteen-years-old), W.K. visited Fuster\u2019s dental office. Fuster administered gas to W.K. and placed his hand on W.K.\u2019s thigh. W.K. lost consciousness. When W.K. awoke, Fuster was \u201cmassaging\u201d her inner thigh. W.K. lost consciousness again. Sometime after W.K. awoke again, her pants were unzipped, and Fuster was rubbing her vagina with his hand. W.K. lost consciousness again. Sometime after W.K. awoke again, Fuster \u201cgrabbed [W.K.,] put [W.K.] on top of him,\u201d and said: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m using a condom[.]\u201d Sometime afterward, Fuster was naked, W.K\u2019s \u201cshirt was halfway up[,] and [her] bra was undone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">At trial, as a witness for the State, Donna Seelye (\u201cNurse Seelye\u201d), a \u201csexual assault forensic nurse examiner[,]\u201d testified that on October 10, 2001, she examined W.K., placing \u201ceach piece of clothing ... in a separate bag\u201d and \u201ccheck[ing W.K.] from head to toe[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">The jury convicted Fuster of second-degree rape, child abuse, third-degree sexual offense, and second-degree assault. Fuster appealed, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>Fuster petitioned for a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>which this Court denied. <em>See Fuster v. State, </em>412 Md. 256, 987 A.2d 16 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">B. Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">On November 3, 2010, in the circuit court, while self-represented, Fuster filed a \u201cPetition for DNA Testing-Post Conviction Review\u201d (\u201cthe Petition\u201d). In the Petition,</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Fuster stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-7\">[Fuster] request[s] that the underpants ... [that W.K.] wore [on] the day [that] she was allegedly raped[ ] be tested using PCR (STR) \u201ctouch DNA\u201d or \u201ccontact DNA\u201d analysis. (Test for [Fuster\u2019s] epithelial cells)[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-8\">[Fuster] requests] that the leg cuffs of the jeans worn by [W.K.] ... be tested using touch DNA or contact DNA analysis for [Fuster\u2019]s epithelial cells.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-9\">[Fuster] requests] that the socks and shoes worn by [W.K.] ... be analyzed for [Fuster\u2019s] epithelial cells using PCR[ ](STR) touch DNA analysis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-10\">In the answer to the Petition, the State responded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-11\">[W.K.]\u2019s jeans and underpants [ ] are in the custody of the Montgomery County Police Department, Central Supply Section-Evidence Property Unit [ (\u201cthe Property Unit\u201d) ]....

According to Officer Bickle, Sergeant Clemens \u201chas no recall that these items were ever taken[,] and if they were, he would have packaged them separately and listed them on the chain of custody documentation.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>On September 18, 2012, the circuit court conducted a hearing on the Petition. At the hearing, the following exchanges occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">THE COURT: ...

I will look for [W.K\u2019s] socks and shoes. I will conduct the type of investigation that the Court of Appeals would require us to conduct, and I\u2019m going to ask for this hearing to be reset[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-15\">On March 14, 2018, the circuit court resumed the hearing on the Petition. During the hearing, the following exchanges occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-16\">THE COURT: ... I can\u2019t order the DNA testing unless ... two conditions [are] met.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-17\">THE COURT: [T]hat there\u2019s a reasonable probability that if we go forward with DNA testing, [and] that there will be a potential for that test to produce exculpatory or mitigating evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: [T]he [S]tate never collected [W.K\u2019s] socks or shoes[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-5\">[ ] FUSTER: [The State] ha[s] to not only show that [the State] do[es]n\u2019t have it in their possession, but why [the State] do[es]n\u2019t have it in their possession, and if there was willful or malicious destruction or loss of evidence.... I plan to show that [the State] do[es]n\u2019t have it. I plan to show that it was malicious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: [The State] do[es]n\u2019t have it. [The State] never collected it. It was never collected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-7\">[ ] FUSTER: Well, it was supposed to be collected.... I\u2019ll have evidence to show that it wasn\u2019t collected \u2014 it was collected \u2014 uncollected or not collected maliciously and willfully.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: I have the collecting officer here who was with [W.K.] at the hospital, and who collected evidence there.... [H]e will testify that [W.K.\u2019s] socks and shoes were not collected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: ... Mr. Fuster ... you\u2019re not entitled to a lawyer in the context of a [p]etition for [p]ost[-c]onviction DNA testing, but if you have issues related to trial, or your attorney, you should be talking to the Office of the Public Defender if you qualify for their representation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-10\">THE COURT: [I]f you have concerns about other issues, you definitely should consult with an attorney. And certainly, you might be eligible to be represented by the Office of the Public Defender.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-11\">[ ] FUSTER: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>THE COURT: Or you should try to get a private attorney.

If you have a problem with the way that was done, you should be talking to an attorney about what possibilities you have with regard to pursuing post[-]conviction relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: [T]he [General Assembly] has decided that ... you are not as a matter of right entitled to \u2014 I mean, you can have an attorney for this proceeding.

On its own initiative, the Court of Special Appeals transferred the appeal to this Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Fuster contends that, under Rule 4-707(b), he was entitled to appointed counsel at the hearing on the Petition. Fuster argues that, by agreeing with the prosecutor\u2019s statements that he was not entitled to counsel at the hearing on the Petition, the circuit court violated his right to appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">The State responds that Rule 4-707(b) does not entitle an indigent petitioner to counsel for purposes of a petition under CP \u00a7 8-201.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">An appellate court reviews without deference a trial court\u2019s interpretation of a Maryland Rule. <em>See State v. Taylor, </em>431 Md. 615, 630, 66 A.3d 698, 707 (2013) (\u201cThis Court\u2019s interpretation of the Maryland Rules is a question of law; as such, we review a trial court\u2019s determinations on matters of interpretation without deference.\u201d (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">A court interprets a Maryland Rule by using the same canons of construction that the court uses to interpret a statute. <em>See Hoile v. State, </em>404 Md. 591, 608, 948 A.2d 30, 40, <em>cert. denied, </em>555 U.S. 884, 129 S.Ct. 257, 172 L.Ed.2d 146 (2008) (\u201cTo interpret rules of procedure, we use the same canons and principles of construction used to interpret statutes.\u201d (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). First, the court considers the Rule\u2019s plain language in light of: (1) \u201cthe [] scheme to which [the Rule] belongs\u201d; (2) \u201cthe purpose, aim, or policy of [this Court] in [adopting the\u201d Rule; and (3) the \u201cpresum[ption] that [this Court] intends [the Rules and this Court\u2019s precedent] to operate together as a consistent and harmonious body of law[.]\u201d <em>Lowery v. State, </em>430 Md. 477, 496, 61 A.3d 794, 806 (2013) (citation omitted). If the Rule\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>plain language \u201cis unambiguous and clearly consistent with the [Rule]\u2019s apparent purpose,\u201d the court applies the Rule\u2019s plain language. <em>State v. Weems, </em>429 Md. 329, 337, 55 A.3d 921, 926 (2012) (citation omitted). Generally, if the Rule\u2019s plain language is ambiguous or not clearly consistent with the Rule\u2019s apparent purpose, the court \u201csearch[es] for [rulemaking] intent in other indicia, including the history of the [Rule] or other relevant sources intrinsic and extrinsic to the [rulemak-ing] process[,]\u201d in light of: (1) \u201cthe structure of the\u201d Rule; (2) \u201chow [the Rule] relates to other laws\u201d; (3) the Rule\u2019s \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d; and (4) \u201cthe relative rationality and legal effect of various competing constructions.\u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>415 Md. 413, 422, 2 A.3d 368, 373 (2010) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">As to a petition under CP \u00a7 8-201, Rule 4-707(b)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">If the court finds that a petitioner who has requested the appointment of counsel is indigent, the court shall appoint counsel within 30 days after the State has filed its answer unless (1) the court denies the petition as a matter of law or (2) counsel has already filed an appearance to represent the petitioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">This Court adopted Rule 4-707(b) on September 10, 2009, approximately a month and a half after this Court issued <em>Simms v. State, </em>409 Md. 722, 976 A.2d 1012 (2009). In <em>Simms, id. </em>at 726 n. 5, 976 A.2d at 1015 n. 5, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9tU\">\u201cThere is no right to appointed counsel under [CP] \u00a7 8-201, either statutory or constitutional, to assist a person in filing a petition under the statute or during the initial stages of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Arey v. State, </em>400 Md. 491, 507, 929 A.2d 501, 510 (2007) (citing [CP] \u00a7 8-201(h)(2)). A [trial] court nevertheless \u201chas the inherent power to appoint counsel at any stage of proceedings under [CP] \u00a7 8-201.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508, 929 A.2d at 511. Consequently, [a trial] court may \u201cappoint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>counsel to represent a petitioner when the [trial] court believes [that] counsel would be necessary to further the interest of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 509, 929 A.2d at 51[2].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">It is apparent from a committee note accompanying a related Rule that this Court\u2019s purpose in adopting Rule 4-707(b) was to implement <em>Simms, </em>409 Md. at 726 n. 5, 976 A.2d at 1015 n. 5 (and, by extension, <em>Arey, </em>400 Md. at 509, 929 A.2d at 512). Specifically, in the committee note of Rule 4-704(a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure (\u201cthe Rules Committee\u201d) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">A petition filed by an unrepresented petitioner may be lacking in some of the details required by subsections (a)(2) and (3) of this Rule. To justify an order requiring DNA testing or a search of law enforcement databases or logs, however, those details must be provided at some point. That may be achieved by the appointment of counsel under Rule 4-707 and an appropriate amendment to the petition. See <em>Simms v. State, </em>[409 Md. 722, 976 A.2d 1012] (No. 97, September Term 2008, filed July 24, 2009).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">(Emphasis added). Based on this Court\u2019s purpose in adopting Rule 4-707(b), we conclude that Rule 4-707(b) does not entitle an indigent petitioner to counsel for purposes of a petition under CP \u00a7 8-201.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">We acknowledge that Rule 4-707(b)\u2019s plain language is not \u201cclearly consistent with [Rule 4-707(b) ]\u2019s apparent purpose^]\u201d <em>Weems, </em>429 Md. at 337, 55 A.3d at 926 (citation omitted). Namely, Rule 4-707(b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-9\">If the court finds that a petitioner who has requested the appointment of counsel is indigent, the court shall appoint counsel within 30 days after the State has filed its answer unless (1) the court denies the petition as a matter of law or (2) counsel has already filed an appearance to represent the petitioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"acx-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>(Emphasis added). In other words, pursuant to Rule 4-707(b)\u2019s plain language, under certain circumstances, a trial court must appoint counsel for an indigent petitioner for purposes of a petition under CP \u00a7 8-201. <em>See Perez v. State, </em>420 Md. 57, 63, 21 A.3d 1048, 1052 (2011) (\u201c[T]he word \u2018shall\u2019 indicates the intent that a provision is mandatory.\u201d (Citation omitted)). But, as the committee note of Rule 4-704(a) demonstrates, in adopting Rule 4-707(b), this Court was motivated as a response to <em>Simms, </em>409 Md. 722, 976 A.2d 1012. Indeed, the timing of Rule 4-707(b)\u2019s adoption and the reliance on <em>Simms </em>indicate that this Court\u2019s purpose in adopting Rule 4-707(b) was to implement <em>Simms, </em>409 Md. at 726 n. 5, 976 A.2d at 1015 n. 5, and <em>Arey, </em>400 Md. at 509, 929 A.2d at 512, which mandate that the appointment of counsel for purposes of a petition under CP \u00a7 8-201 is discretionary. <em>See Simms, </em>409 Md. at 726 n. 5, 976 A.2d at 1015 n. 5 (A trial \u201ccourt may \u2018appoint counsel to represent a petitioner when the [trial] court believes [that] counsel would be necessary to further the interest of justice.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>Arey, </em>400 Md. at 509, 929 A.2d at 512) (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Because Rule 4-707(b)\u2019s plain language is not clearly consistent with Rule 4-707(b)\u2019s apparent purpose, we \u201csearch[] for [rulemaking] intent in other indicia[.]\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>415 Md. at 422, 2 A.3d at 373 (citation omitted).

On September 9, 2009, this Court held an open meeting on the Rules Committee\u2019s One Hundred Sixty-Second Report.

(Emphasis added). In light of Rule 4-707(b)\u2019s history and this Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Simms </em>and <em>Arey, </em>the logical conclusion is that, despite Rule 4-707(b)\u2019s use of the word \u201cshall[,]\u201d Rule 4-707(b) does not entitle an indigent petitioner to counsel for purposes of a petition under CP \u00a7 8-201; instead, a trial \u201ccourt may \u2018appoint counsel to represent a petitioner when the [trial] court believes [that] counsel would be necessary to further the interest of justice.\u2019\u201d <em>Simms, </em>409 Md. at 726 n. 5, 976 A.2d at 1015 n. 5 (quoting <em>Arey, </em>400 Md. at 509, 929 A.2d at 512) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">This result ensures that Rule 4-707(b) and this Court\u2019s precedent \u201coperate together as a consistent and harmonious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>body of law[.]\u201d <em>Lowery, </em>430 Md. at 496, 61 A.3d at 806 (citation omitted).

In the Petition, Fuster requested testing of W.K\u2019s underpants, jeans\u2019 cuffs, socks, and shoes. On two occasions during the hearing on the Petition, the circuit court correctly stated that, under CP \u00a7 8-201(d)(l)(i), it would order DNA testing if it found that \u201ca reasonable probability\u201d existed that DNA testing had the scientific potential to produce exculpatory or mitigating evidence. During the hearing, Fuster requested a new trial on the ground that the convictions were based on unreliable scientific identification evidence. The circuit court correctly stated that, under CP \u00a7 8-201(c), it would order a new trial if it found that \u201ca substantial possibility\u201d existed that Fuster would not have been convicted without unreliable scientific identification evidence. Thus, the record establishes that the circuit court was well aware of where to use CP \u00a7 8-201 (c)\u2019s \u201csubstantial possibility\u201d standard and where to use CP \u00a7 8-201 (d)(l)(i)\u2019s \u201creasonable probability\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">We reject Fuster\u2019s contention that the circuit court\u2019s statement <em>(ie., </em>\u201c[WJhat [Fuster] has put forward in no way would lead me to conclude that there\u2019s a substantial possibility that he would not have been convicted without the evidence\u201d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>establishes that the circuit court used an incorrect standard in ruling on the Petition. Because Fuster requested two forms of relief <em>(ie., </em>testing and a new trial), the circuit court made two rulings: (1) the circuit court agreed with the State that Fuster was not entitled to testing; and (2) the circuit court denied the request for a new trial, determining that there was not a substantial possibility that Fuster would not have been convicted without the allegedly unreliable scientific identification evidence. The latter ruling was comprised of the circuit court\u2019s statement, which correctly referred to CP \u00a7 8-201 (c)\u2019s \u201csubstantial possibility\u201d standard. For the above reasons, the circuit court used the correct standard in ruling on the Petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Fuster contends that the circuit court clearly erred in concluding that the State conducted a reasonable search for W.K\u2019s socks and shoes. Specifically, Fuster argues that, absent an affidavit or testimony, the State\u2019s proffer (ie., that \u201cthe collecting officer ... w[ould] testify that [W.K.\u2019s] socks and shoes were not collected\u201d) did not suffice to prove that the State conducted a reasonable search for W.K.\u2019s socks and shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The State responds that, by failing to dispute the State\u2019s proffer, Fuster failed to preserve for appellate review the issue of whether the circuit court clearly erred in concluding that the State conducted a reasonable search for W.K.\u2019s socks and shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">This Court reviews for clear error a trial court\u2019s conclusion as to whether the State conducted a reasonable search for a piece of evidence that is the subject of a petition under CP \u00a7 8-201. <em>See Washington v. State, </em>424 Md. 632, 651, 37 A.3d 932, 943 (2012) (\u201c[T]he \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 standard of review is applicable to the Circuit Court\u2019s finding that [a] search ... was a reasonable search under [CP] \u00a7 8-201 [.]\u201d (Ellipsis and second alteration in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Here, we conclude that Fuster failed to preserve for appellate review the issue of whether the circuit court clearly erred in concluding that the State conducted a reasonable search for W.K.\u2019s socks and shoes. The only evidence that even remotely suggests that the State collected W.K\u2019s socks and shoes was Nurse Seelye\u2019s trial testimony that she examined W.K., placing \u201ceach piece of clothing ... in a separate bag\u201d and \u201cchecking W.K.] from head to toe[.]\u201d Nothing in Nurse Seelye\u2019s trial testimony indicates that W.K\u2019s socks and shoes were among the clothing that Nurse Seelye collected. At the hearing on the Petition, the State proffered that the \u201ccollecting officer\u201d would testify that the State had never collected W.K\u2019s socks and shoes. Fuster failed to object to the State\u2019s proffer, and thus failed to preserve for appellate review any issue as to the State\u2019s search for W.K\u2019s socks and shoes. Indeed, Fuster not only failed to dispute the State\u2019s proffer, but also, on multiple occasions, before and after the proffer, conceded that the State had never collected W.K.\u2019s socks and shoes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In so conceding, Fuster invited the circuit court to conclude that any search (whether reasonable or not) for W.K.\u2019s socks and shoes would be fruitless. A party fails to preserve for appellate review any issue as to a trial court\u2019s ruling by inviting the trial court\u2019s ruling. <em>See State v.
