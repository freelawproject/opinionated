If this appointment is not feasible, the trial court shall, within the same time frame, appoint other counsel to represent the defendant in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The appellant shall file a supplemental brief within 42 days of the date of the order appointing counsel, addressing whether (1) the show-up identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive, see\n   <em>\n    People v.
