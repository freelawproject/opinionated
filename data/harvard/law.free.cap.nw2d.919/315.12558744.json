The reverse-false-claims provisions impose liability for (1) \"[having] possession, custody, or control of property or money used, or to be used, by the state or a political subdivision and knowingly deliver[ing] or caus[ing] to be delivered less than all of that money or property,\" (2) \"knowingly mak[ing] or us[ing], or caus[ing] to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the state or a political subdivision,\" or (3) \"knowingly conceal[ing] or knowingly and improperly avoid[ing] or decreas[ing] an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the state or a political subdivision.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 15C.02(a)(4), (7). Specifically, Phone Recovery Services alleged that respondents had knowingly, intentionally, deliberately, or recklessly under-collected the 911, TAM, and TAP surcharges from their customers, and thus underpaid the amounts owed to the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Phone Recovery Services filed a complaint, under seal, in Ramsey County District Court. After the Attorney General declined to intervene, the district court unsealed the complaint and ordered Phone\n   Recovery Services to pursue the litigation on behalf of the State.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Respondents moved to dismiss. As relevant here, respondents argued that, because the surcharges are taxes, the MFCA tax bar applied,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 15C.03 (excluding a claim \"made under portions of Minnesota Statutes relating to taxation\"), and Phone Recovery Services' complaint must be dismissed for failure to state a claim,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Minn. R. Civ. P. 12.02(e) (providing for dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted). The district court agreed, applying the statutory definition of \"tax\" provided by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20645.44\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 645.44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 19 (2016) to the surcharges. Accordingly, the district court concluded that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20237.52\">\n    Minn.

Stat. \u00a7 15C.03 and dismissed the complaint with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The court of appeals agreed that the 911, TAM, and TAP surcharges are taxes by statutory definition and ultimately concluded that the claim brought by Phone Recovery Services was prohibited by the tax bar provided in the MFCA.\n   <em>\n    Phone Recovery Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12335060\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/901/185/#p199\">\n    901 N.W.2d at 198-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We granted review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We are presented with a question of statutory interpretation; specifically, does the tax bar set out in Minn. Stat. \u00a7 15C.03 as part of the MFCA apply to surcharges collected by telecommunications carriers and remitted to the State? We review the interpretation of statutes de novo.\n   <em>\n    Cocchiarella v.

This Act permits, under certain circumstances, a plaintiff to bring a private cause of action to collect funds due to the State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 15C.05 (2016). If these claims are successfully prosecuted, the plaintiff is allowed to retain some of the proceeds of the litigation and the balance of the recovery is remitted to the State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 15C.13 (2016). A false claims action can be a direct claim in which the allegation is that a defendant wrongfully secured monies\n   <em>\n    from\n   </em>\n   the State. Alternatively, as here, in a \"reverse\" MFCA complaint, the plaintiff alleges that the defendant did not turn over all monies\n   <em>\n    due to\n   </em>\n   the State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 15C.02(a)(4), (7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   But not all private causes of action under the MCFA are permitted. The MFCA \"tax bar\" precludes actions if the defendant's allegedly false claim stems from \"portions of Minnesota Statutes relating to taxation.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 15C.03. The MFCA does not define the phrase \"relating to taxation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 15C.01, 15C.03. When a statute does not define a term or phrase, we first consider the plain meaning of that language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    500, LLC v.

With respect to the term \"taxation,\" the court of appeals looked to several dictionary definitions, including \"the levying of tax,\" \"the action of taxing,\" \"the imposition of taxes,\" \"the fact of being taxed,\" and \"[a]n assessed amount of tax.\"\n   <em>\n    Phone Recovery Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12335060\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/901/185/#p199\">\n    901 N.W.2d at 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted) (alteration in original). Based on dictionary definitions of \"relating to\" and \"taxation,\" the court of appeals concluded that \"[a] statute is one 'relating to taxation' ... if the statute has a connection, relation, or reference to or concerns the imposition of a tax, the amount assessed as tax, or the revenue gained from taxes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . We agree with the court of appeals that the plain meaning of \"portions of Minnesota Statutes relating to taxation\" refers to the provisions of Minnesota Statutes that pertain, refer, or stand in some relation to the levying, imposition, assessment, or collection of taxes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shire v. Rosemount\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6827451\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/875/289/#p292\">\n    875 N.W.2d 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 292 (Minn. 2016) (\"When a word or phrase has a plain meaning, we presume that the plain meaning is consistent with legislative intent and engage in no further statutory construction.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Phone Recovery Services contends that the court of appeals erred in its interpretation of the statute in at least three ways. First, Phone Recovery Services argues that the court of appeals' interpretation fails to give effect to the Legislature's distinction between statutory fees, which includes \"obligation[s] to pay ... money\" to the State and for which a claim can be asserted under the MFCA, and taxes, for which such a claim cannot be asserted. We disagree. Nothing in the plain language of section 15C.03 refers to an \"obligation\" to \"pay money.\" We must focus on the plain language that excludes claims based on \"portions\" of statutes \"relating to taxation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Second, Phone Recovery Services argues that the broad structure of the MFCA and its remedial purpose favor a limiting construction of Minn. Stat. \u00a7 15C.03 to avoid sweeping \"the overwhelming majority of payments made to the State\" into the exception. The remedial purpose of section 15C.02 does not change the plain language of section 15C.03, and the plain language of section 15C.03 captures the Legislature's intent, which ends the process of interpretation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Brainerd v. Brainerd Invs. P'ship\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7066695\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/827/752/#p755\">\n    827 N.W.2d 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 755 (Minn. 2013). As the court of appeals stated, the plain language of Minn. Stat. \u00a7 15C.03 does not alter the claims that can be asserted under Minn. Stat. \u00a7 15C.02 ; alleged violations that \"involve claims, records, or statements that are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   made under portions of Minnesota Statutes relating to taxation\" can still be pursued.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phone Recovery Servs\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12335060\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/901/185/#p199\">\n    901 N.W.2d at 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Third, Phone Recovery Services asserts that the Legislature intended to include within Minn. Stat. \u00a7 15C.03 only statutes enacted under the State's taxing power, specifically Minn. Stat. ch. 270-299 (2016).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the plain language of\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 15C.03 does not invoke the State's taxing power, and it is not confined to chapters 270 through 299 of Minnesota Statutes-it broadly encompasses\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   statutes, unconstrained by specific chapter designations, \"relating to taxation.\" An interpretation that excludes some statutes that plainly impose taxes but are not within Minn. Stat. ch. 270-299,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 144F.01, subd. 4 (authorizing an \"ad valorem tax levy\" to support the cost of certain emergency medical services), 240.15, subd. 1(a) (imposing \"a tax at the rate of six percent\" on pari-mutuel pools) (2016), effectively requires that we add restrictive terms to the plain language and that we cannot do,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walsh v.

First, the dictionary definitions that interpret \"relating to\" to mean \"about\" are not inconsistent with our prior definition.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    500, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7057411\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/837/287/#p290\">\n    837 N.W.2d at 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defining \"relating to\" as \"to stand in some relation; to have bearing or concern; to pertain; refer; to bring into association with or connection with\" (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted) ),\n   <em>\n    with Webster's Third New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   5 (3d ed. 2002) (defining \"about\" as \"with regard to,\" \"concerning,\" and \"on the subject of\"),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 470 (defining \"concern\" as \"to relate or refer to: be about\"),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1911 (defining \"regard\" as \"to have relation to or bearing upon: relate to: touch on\"). The dissent's definitions provide only consistent synonyms, not a second reasonable interpretation that supports a finding of ambiguity.\n   <em>\n    500, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7057411\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/837/287/#p290\">\n    837 N.W.2d at 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring \"more than one reasonable interpretation\" for a finding of ambiguity (citation omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Second, Minn. Stat. \u00a7 15C.03 encompasses \"\n   <em>\n    portions\n   </em>\n   of Minnesota Statutes relating to taxation.\" A \"portion\" is \"a part of a whole,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1768 (3d ed. 2002), \"a section or quantity in a larger thing,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language\n   </em>\n   1373 (5th ed. 2011), or \"an amount, section, or piece of something,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The New Oxford American Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1330 (2001). Under the plain meaning of the word \"portion,\" a single statute, or even a single subdivision of a statute, can relate to taxation, even if the remainder of the statute or chapter of statutes does not. For example,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20403.11\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 403.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as a \"portion\" of Minn. Stat. ch. 403 (2016), may be about taxation, even if the rest of chapter 403 is not. Thus, in the context of the MFCA, the phrase \"portions\" of statutes \"relating to taxation\" does not suggest a legislative intent to focus only on statutes that make up Minnesota's counterpart to the Internal\n   Revenue Code or that are only \"about\" taxation, as argued by the dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Third, even assuming that we adopt the dissent's approach and interpret \"relating to\" to mean \"about,\" it would not produce a different result here. Minnesota Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 237.52, subd. 2, .70, subd. 6, and 403.11, subd. 1, each impose a surcharge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20237.49\">\n    Minn.

If these surcharges are taxes, and we conclude today that they are, then these subdivisions, by definition, are statutory provisions that are \"about\" taxation.

We disagree for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   First, we are required to apply the definitions provided by the Legislature in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20645.44\">\n    Minn.

Stat. \u00a7 15C.03 cannot be construed to encompass only a restricted subset of tax statutes because nothing in the plain language suggests that intent. The Legislature used no words, such as \"limited to\" certain tax statutes or tax types, and did not refer to the authority of some, but not other, agencies to administer taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Second, subdivision 19 does not define all fees and charges to be taxes. The definition is narrower, focusing on those legislative enactments that are imposed by a governmental entity, other than a price\n   <em>\n    voluntarily\n   </em>\n   paid in return for goods and services provided by the governmental entity. As explained above, the surcharges at issue here do not fall within this exception, and thus they are taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The dissent also contends that the MFCA is a remedial statute and that the tax bar in section 15C.03 should therefore be construed narrowly, rather than turning to the definitions in section 645.44.

The court seizes upon this precedent to conclude that \"relating to taxation\" can encompass any statute that has a connection with taxation. However, in the context of this case, I believe that an equally reasonable interpretation of \"relating to\" would be \"about.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The New Roget's Thesaurus in Dictionary Form\n   </em>\n   397-98 (1978) (listing synonyms of \"relationship,\" including \"relate to,\" \"about,\" \"concerning,\" and \"in the matter of\");\n   <em>\n    accord The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language\n   </em>\n   4 (New College ed. 1982) (defining \"about\" as \"[i]n reference to;\n   <em>\n    relating to\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The court asserts that there is no substantive difference between my proposed definition and the definition offered by\n   <em>\n    500, LLC\n   </em>\n   . I disagree. By describing the plain meaning of \"relating to\" as \"about,\" which is defined as \"with regard to,\" \"concerning,\" or \"on the subject of,\" the statute would retain a narrow focus.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   5 (3d ed. 2002). By contrast, the court today holds that \"relating to\" means \"[to] pertain, refer, or stand in some relation to.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   at pg. 8. \"Standing in some relation to\" or \"referring to\" a statutory topic is expansive, and requires a lesser degree of logical relation to that topic than being \"about\" that topic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   For example,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20290.0131\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 290.0131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) details what amounts individuals, estates, and trusts must add to their federal taxable income when calculating the income taxes they owe the State. Subdivision 3 of section 290.0131 mentions the amount of motor vehicle sales taxes paid in the taxable year. Section 290.0131 thus both refers and stands in some relation to motor vehicle sales. But section 290.0131 is undoubtedly\n   <em>\n    about\n   </em>\n   taxes, and also stands in some relation and refers to taxes. Put more generally, a statute that is about taxation will both stand in relation to and refer to taxation, but a statute that stands in relation or refers to taxation may not necessarily be\n   <em>\n    about\n   </em>\n   taxation. I therefore respectfully disagree with the court's contention that \"about\" is merely a consistent synonym for the terms it has used to give meaning to the tax bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   My interpretation is also more consistent with the plain meaning of the word \"relate,\" which means \"to establish a logical or causal connection\" between two things.\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1916 (3d ed. 2002).

The Legislature, aware of the tax bar, amended the MFCA by adopting a broad definition of the \"obligation\" to pay or transmit \"money\" to the state, thus ensuring that false statements or records related to fees were still actionable under the statute, which in turn demonstrates its intent that the tax bar be read narrowly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Additionally, the purpose behind the federal FCA's tax bar supports my limited reading.

None of these statutes is about taxation, nor do the statutes have a substantial relationship to taxation; indeed, the Legislature did not mention taxation in the text of these statutes. I cannot, therefore, agree with the majority that these constitute \"statutes relating to taxation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The court rejects my analysis, arguing that we can only look to preambles when a statute is ambiguous, and that we cannot use the preambles of session laws that created other statutes to resolve the ambiguity in Minn. Stat. \u00a7 15C.03. Both contentions misapprehend my point. First, as discussed, Minn. Stat. \u00a7 15C.03 is facially ambiguous. Second, when a statute is ambiguous, we may consider other laws \"upon the same or similar subjects.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20645.16\">\n    Minn.

This canon, necessarily, requires us to first determine the subjects of those other laws, to see whether or not they are \"the same or similar.\" My analysis logically uses the preambles of the legislative acts enacting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20237.52\">\n    Minn.

Stat. \u00a7 15C.03, namely, taxation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The holding I propose has two components: (1) Minn. Stat. \u00a7 15C.03 is facially ambiguous, and (2) this ambiguity should be resolved in favor of the narrower definition, \"about.\" Under the court's holding, any statute that makes even a passing reference to a \"tax\" or functions like a tax, as defined by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20645.44\">\n    Minn.

Because the Legislature did not intend to bar MFCA claims as broadly\n   as the court bars them today, I would reverse the district court and remand this case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The court cites\n   <em>\n    Haghighi v.

But that proposition cuts both ways. If the court adopted a narrow construction of the tax bar, as I propose, and the Legislature had actually intended a broad construction, then it would be just as easy for the Legislature to amend the MFCA to correct\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   hypothetical error. The court's holding today does not fulfill our duty to give effect to the intent of the Legislature, and I therefore respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In their motion to dismiss and arguments on appeal, respondents present two alternate theories for dismissal: the MFCA's public-disclosure bar, and the requirement to plead fraud with particularity under Minn.

The articles are from Tennessee, Missouri, Alabama, Indiana, and West Virginia. Every article deals exclusively with local 911 fees, and makes no mention of TAM or TAP fees, or analogous fees assessed by any other states. Of all the articles, only respondent AT&amp;T is named, in a single 2012 article from Tennessee. This single reference to one respondent out of the dozens of telephone companies Phone Recovery Services has named in this lawsuit does not satisfy\n   <em>\n    CSL Behring\n   </em>\n   's requirement that the public disclosures \"must set the government squarely on the trail of a specific and identifiable defendant's participation in the fraud.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277045\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/935/#p944\">\n    855 F.3d at 944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).
