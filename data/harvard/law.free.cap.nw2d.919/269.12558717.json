Randolph\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 153309). On order of the Court, the case having been decided on June 15, 2018,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12557747\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/917/249/\">\n    502 Mich. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12557747\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/917/249/\">\n    917 N.W.2d 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), the application is again considered. Pursuant to MCR 7.305(H)(1), in lieu of granting leave to appeal, we VACATE Part II.C of the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and we REMAND this case to that court for reconsideration in light of\n   <em>\n    Randolph\n   </em>\n   . In all other respects, leave to appeal is DENIED, because we are not persuaded that\n   the remaining questions presented should be reviewed by this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   We do not retain jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
