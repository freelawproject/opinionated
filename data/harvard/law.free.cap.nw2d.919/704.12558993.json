The complaint alleged that on the morning of August 31, 2016, Black drove up to P.S., his sister's boyfriend, in the area of 4150 Vincent Avenue North in Minneapolis, got out of his car, and told P.S. that he was going to shoot him. The complaint further alleged that when Black made the threat, he pointed a black handgun wrapped in a green cloth at P.S. and that after making the threat, Black tucked the gun into his shorts, returned to his car, and drove away. P.S. reported the incident to the police and described Black's vehicle. Police officers made contact with Black after seeing him get out of a car that matched P.S.'s description. Officers found a black 9 mm semiautomatic pistol inside a green cloth bag in the trunk of the car. Black told the officers that he did not have a permit to carry a gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The charges against Black were tried to a jury. During voir dire, the district court denied Black's objection to the state's peremptory challenge to an African American venire member. The jury found Black guilty of threatening violence and possessing a pistol without a permit, but it found him not guilty of second-degree assault. The district court entered judgments of conviction on the threatening violence and possession offenses and sentenced Black for both offenses.

Second, the statute is intended to prevent the possession of firearms in places where they are most likely to cause harm in the wrong hands, i.e., in public places where their discharge may injure or kill intended or unintended victims. The only exception to this rule is for persons who have demonstrated a need or purpose for carrying firearms and have shown their responsibility to the police in obtaining a permit.

Black's counsel noted that because the state had already removed one African American venire member for cause, there were only two African American venire members left on the panel.

The district court found that Black failed to establish a prima-facie case of purposeful discrimination.

It's anticipated, at least from my perspective in following some of the questioning that the defense was requesting is that ... they will attempt to argue that Mr. Black, in his actions in this case against the victim, was confronting the victim as a result of something-some prior situation between the victim and the defendant's sister.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   And so I believe that they will make arguments relating to the sibling issue and protectiveness of the sibling issue, and so that is the reason why the state removed [Venire Member S].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The district court's statement regarding the race-neutral reason for the peremptory strike of Venire Member S, which relates to the second step of a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   analysis, could suggest that the district court erred in its\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   analysis by failing to decide the prima-facie issue before advancing to the second step of its\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reiners\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9124896\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/664/826/#p832\">\n    664 N.W.2d at 832\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (instructing district courts to follow the three-step\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   analysis precisely and to explain its reasoning at each step, without combining the steps).
