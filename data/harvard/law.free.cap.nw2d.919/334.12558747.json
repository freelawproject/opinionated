He argues the district court erred in finding that M.J.K. failed to establish a prima facie case for termination of guardianship, and that due process violations resulted in a void judgment appointing the current guardian. The district court's order is not based on findings of fact that are clearly erroneous. The due process argument was not pursued at the district court and is waived.\n   <em>\n    State v.
