MCR 7.305(H)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The petitioner shall file a supplemental brief within 42 days of the date of this order addressing: (1) whether the respondents are entitled to a jury instruction based on MCL 722.634, which states: \"A parent or guardian legitimately practicing his religious beliefs who thereby does not provide specified medical treatment for a child, for that reason alone shall not be considered a negligent parent or guardian;\" and (2) for purposes of this determination, the distinction, if any, between the terms \"neglects\" and \"refuses\" in MCL 712A.2(b)(1), where the family court's jurisdiction is sought on the basis of the parent's failure to obtain medical care for a child. In addition to the brief, the petitioner shall electronically file an appendix conforming to MCR 7.312(D)(2). In the brief, citations to the record must provide the appendix page numbers as required by MCR 7.312(B)(1).
