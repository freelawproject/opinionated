Ct. 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Oct. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 9, 2015, prior to the Eighth Circuit's ruling, Shelton received a notice from the Iowa Department of Corrections (IDOC) concerning property he had stored in remote legal storage. The notice explained that on May 1, 2015, an earlier notice was posted informing inmates that \"IDOC Policy was revised to exclude the provision for remote legal storage.\" The May notice had stated inmates had sixty days from the date of the memo \"to send your excess legal material out at your expense, give it to an authorized visitor, or have it destroyed.\" The May notice went on to say:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Each offender identified with legal materials in storage will be allowed to review what is in storage. You will be given an opportunity to identify which items you would like destroyed, given to an authorized visitor, sent out, and what you will like to have in your legal property within your cell. Reminder, policy dictates that each offender is allowed 3 boxes of personal property, and legal work is counted in that limit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The June notice advised Shelton he had yet to comply with the IDOC directive to deal with his property, and it gave Shelton until July 7, 2015, \"to come into compliance with the directive\" or his property would be destroyed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 9, 2015, Shelton filed a \"Motion to Preserve Criminal Court Records,\" dated June 25, 2015, in state district court concerning the IDOC's revised policy. Shelton's motion caption cited his criminal case number, FECR001872, as well as his original postconviction-relief case number PCCV022133.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shelton asserted he had \"attempted to resolve this problem administratively,\" but the IDOC had \"declined to accommodate [his] procedural, statutory and constitutional rights to access the court and to have criminal records. ...\" Shelton noted his appeal to the Eighth Circuit was still pending at that time, and he asserted it was \"more likely than not\" that \"a minimum limited remand will be ordered back to the Federal District Court due to the State of Iowa's misconduct.\" Shelton requested an order be entered to protect the record for present and future court proceedings. Shelton filed his own memorandum to support his motion for the protection of his property, and later, a supplement to the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 13, 2015, the district court construed Shelton's filings in the district court as \"seeking an order restraining the [IDOC] from destroying records in his possession in prison.\" The court noted it could not \"tell whether or not the State ha[d] been given notice of [Shelton's] request,\" so the court granted Shelton's motion \"temporarily,\" enjoining the IDOC \"from destroying [Shelton's] records wherever situated, pending hearing.\" On August 24, 2015, the court entered an order finding Shelton had not exhausted his administrative remedies but the temporary order \"shall remain in full force and effect,\" pending hearing, to \"be scheduled upon request of either party after administrative proceedings are completed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A few months later, Shelton filed an application for an order to show cause why the IDOC should not be held in contempt. Shelton stated he had received a CD from the Clerk of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals containing an audio recording of the oral arguments heard in his appeal. Shelton asserted the IDOC was ordering that he \"send out or destroy\" the recording, in violation of the IDOC's policy classifying the CD as \"legal materials\" and in violation of the temporary injunction. Shelton insisted he would \"suffer irrefutable harm if an order [was] not issued immediately.\" The matter was set for hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 21, 2016, the district court entered an order denying Shelton's contempt action. The court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The first consideration is that the litigation underlying the present case has been completed and is now closed. The action was dismissed in 2009 and the appeal from that action was eventually dismissed by Shelton. For reasons unknown, Shelton has attempted to revive the present action in 2015 \"in an attempt to preserve the records in another ongoing case before the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.\" There is no jurisdictional basis to revive this action and no reason why this action should be used to enforce issues related to another pending action. Therefore, on this basis alone, the action is denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   As well, the claim that Shelton is attempting to argue that he wants to preserve the audio file of the oral arguments,\n   <em>\n    Shelton v. Mapes\n   </em>\n   , 8th Cir. No. 15-1015, is still pending. Shelton has counsel in that appeal and any question with regard to the events that transpired in the proceeding should be discussed with counsel. If Shelton has a claim with regard to access to the courts in that case, that is a claim which should be bought by his counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Finally, the ultimate test is whether Shelton has access to the courts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walters v. Kautzky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9245663\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/680/1/\">\n    680 N.W.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Iowa 2004). In this action [there] is no indication that Shelton has been denied counsel or that his ability to litigate claims has been impeded. Therefore, any request for contempt or otherwise is denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The contempt action is denied and this action is closed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Thereafter, Shelton filed a plethora of motions, including for a new trial and for sanctions. The district court subsequently denied Shelton's motions. Shelton now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On appeal, Shelton asserts two claims. First, he argues, \"The district court had jurisdiction to treat a motion to preserve criminal court records as a petition for injunctive relief prior to the filing of a civil complaint,\" citing Iowa Code chapter 664 (2015) and Iowa Rule of Civil Procedure 1.1501. Second, Shelton asserts, \"The district court violated principles of equity when it dismissed a consent decree i.e. temporary injunction, for lack of jurisdiction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Jurisdiction\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Though Shelton's June 2015 \"Motion to Preserve Criminal Court Records\" was captioned with the original criminal and postconviction-relief case numbers, the substance of the motion challenged the constitutionality of the IDOC policy-destruction of his stored legal materials if he did not move them to another permitted location. Shelton mentioned the postconviction-relief chapter of the Iowa Code-chapter 822-a few times in his motion and in his memorandum in support thereof, but he did not cite section 822.2, which sets out who can seek postconviction relief under that chapter and claims upon which relief may be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20822.2\">\n    Iowa Code \u00a7 822.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(a)-(g) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Belk v.

As relief, Shelton prayed in his memorandum that the court \"preserve his criminal case records by granting the motion to preserve his various other criminal case documents in the interest of justice ... [until] such time that [his] court avenues and legal remedies [were] exhausted or until such time\" as the IDOC provided him a \"meaningful opportunity and reasonable time to convert his physical ... records into electronic [files] ....\" The court clearly took this to mean Shelton sought a temporary injunction while he was exhausting his administrative remedies-not a request for postconviction relief. Our rules generally require that we look at a motion's substance to determine its nature, not its label.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iowa Elec. Light &amp; Power Co. v.

Where the litigant's underlying claim is an equitable action seeking permanent injunctive relief, the district court must \"assess the likelihood that the [party] would be successful in showing entitlement to a permanent injunction\" in determining whether a request for a temporary injunction should be granted.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Pursuant to rule 1.1506(1), a \"temporary injunction may be granted by ... [a] judge of the district in which the action is or will be pending.\" Because the question of whether a temporary injunction should be issued or rejected depends upon the unique facts of each case and \"rests largely in the sound discretion of the trial court,\" our review is for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . However, to the extent Shelton claims a violation of his constitutional rights, our review is de novo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Here, the district court initially granted Shelton a temporary injunction so that matters could be sorted out before any action was taken by the IDOC. Then, the court extended the temporary injunction so that Shelton had the opportunity to pursue and exhaust his administrative remedies concerning the IDOC's policy. The court was empowered to grant Shelton injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Iowa R. Civ. P. 1.1501 - .1502 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schrier v.

The injunction was only temporary; its issuance was essentially conditioned upon Shelton seeking administrative review of the policy. When Shelton requested the State be held in contempt for violating the temporary injunction, there was no evidence in the record before the district court that Shelton had exhausted or even had begun pursuing his administrative remedies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Admin.%20Code%20r.%20201-50.21\">\n    Iowa Admin.

Thus, there was no likelihood or probability of success on the merits of his underlying claim-the constitutionality of the IDOC's policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In denying Shelton's motion, the district court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The first consideration is that the litigation underlying the present case has been completed and is now closed.

There is no jurisdictional basis to revive this action and no reason why this action should be used to enforce issues related to another pending action. Therefore, on this basis alone, the action is denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Given that Shelton's original motion was not brought pursuant to section 822.2(1), we agree the postconviction-relief statutes offered him no relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fassett v.

Shelton's filing of a motion wholly unrelated to the underlying case seven years after final judgment was entered does not revive the case, create jurisdiction in the district court, revive the time to appeal from the final judgment, or create appellate jurisdiction where it does not exist.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Olsen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7076579\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/794/285/#p289\">\n    794 N.W.2d at 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A timely appeal is jurisdictional, and the time limit for appeal cannot be extended by filing an improper posttrial motion.

Shelton then filed a grievance with the IDOC on July 15, 2015. On August 13, the IDOC provided Shelton with a grievance response. Shelton's grievance was sustained. He was informed:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n    I [a representative of the Anamosa State Penitentiary] have been informed that the DOC is reviewing their earlier directive to discontinue remote legal storage areas.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n    Based upon information you have provided as well as information contained above, your grievance complaint is sustained.

The materials are not a part of the record on appeal,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Iowa R.
