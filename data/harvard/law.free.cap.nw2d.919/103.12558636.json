The order was based on the state's failures to provide respondent-driver an opportunity to consult with an attorney before submitting to testing pursuant to a search warrant and to advise respondent-driver that refusal to submit to a blood test is a crime. The district court also reasoned that suppression was required on due-process grounds. Because respondent-driver did not have a right to consult with an attorney, the state's failure to provide the advisory does not justify suppression, and respondent-driver is not entitled to relief under the due-process theory on which\n   the district court relied, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Appellant State of Minnesota charged respondent Charles Lee Mike with two counts of third-degree DWI under Minn. Stat. \u00a7 169A.20, subd. 1(1) (2016) (driving under the influence of alcohol), and Minn. Stat. \u00a7 169A.20, subd. 1(5) (2016) (operating a motor vehicle with an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more as tested within two hours of operating). Mike moved to suppress the evidence supporting the charges, and the district court held an evidentiary hearing on the motion. The relevant facts were developed at the hearing as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 7, 2017, at approximately 4:00 p.m., Deputy Troy Nichols of the St. Louis County Sheriff's Department was dispatched to a motorcycle accident in Greenwood Township. At the scene, Deputy Nichols made contact with Mike, who was being treated for injuries inside an ambulance. Mike was transported to a hospital for medical care. Based on his observations and discussions with witnesses, Deputy Nichols believed that Mike was under the influence of alcohol, and he obtained a search warrant authorizing collection of a sample of Mike's blood for chemical testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Deputy Nichols executed the search warrant while Mike was at the hospital. When executing the warrant, Deputy Nichols did not inform Mike that refusal to submit to a blood test is a crime. Nor did Deputy Nichols offer Mike an opportunity to consult with an attorney before submitting to the blood test. Hospital staff drew a sample of Mike's blood pursuant to the warrant at approximately 7:20 p.m. Chemical testing revealed that Mike's alcohol concentration was 0.23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In district court, Mike argued that his blood-test results should be suppressed for two reasons. First, Deputy Nichols did not provide him an opportunity to consult with an attorney before the blood sample was drawn and therefore violated his limited right to counsel under the Minnesota Constitution, as recognized in\n   <em>\n    Friedman v. Comm'r of Pub. Safety\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10614120,10614487\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/473/828/\">\n    473 N.W.2d 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 829 (Minn. 1991). Second, Deputy Nichols did not inform him that refusal to submit to a warranted blood test is a crime, as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20171.177\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 171.177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 1. The district court agreed and granted Mike's motion to suppress, reasoning that Mike \"had a right to consult with counsel\" and that Mike \"was not adequately informed of his rights.\" The district court also reasoned that due process required suppression. Having suppressed the blood-test results, the district court dismissed the charges against Mike. The state appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I.

In\n   <em>\n    Friedman\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court held that \"[t]he Minnesota Constitution, article I, section 6 gives [a driver] a limited right to consult an attorney before deciding whether or not to submit to chemical testing for blood alcohol.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10614120,10614487\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/473/828/\">\n    473 N.W.2d at 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    State v. Hunn\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court clarified that \"[o]n a request to consent to urine testing, a driver's limited constitutional right to counsel recognized in\n   <em>\n    Friedman\n   </em>\n   ... is not triggered unless the statutory implied-consent advisory is read.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12555929\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/911/816/#p816\">\n    911 N.W.2d 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 816-17 (Minn. 2018). The supreme court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Friedman\n   </em>\n   holding is limited to implied-consent cases because of the unique decision and consequences that come with the reading of the advisory. The legal ramifications of the decision to submit (or not submit) to chemical testing after the advisory reading are significant. Of course, consenting may provide law enforcement with the evidence necessary to secure a conviction. But refusing will\n   <em>\n    automatically\n   </em>\n   result in a mandatory license revocation, and may still result in a criminal DWI conviction. As we have recognized, it may not be clear to a driver faced with the advisory whether the consequences for consenting or refusing will be worse.

Chapter 169A is entitled \"Driving While Impaired\" and comprises several distinct groups of statutes. General\n   provisions are found in sections 169A.01 to 169A.095 (2016 &amp; Supp. 2017). Criminal provisions are found in sections 169A.20 to 169A.37 (2016 &amp; Supp. 2017). Section 169A.20 (2016 &amp; Supp. 2017) specifically defines the offense of driving while impaired, including the offense of refusal to submit to a chemical test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Procedural provisions are found in sections 169A.40 to 169A.48 (2016), administrative provisions are found in sections 169A.50 to 169A.63 (2016 &amp; Supp. 2017), and miscellaneous provisions are found in 169A.70 to 169A.78 (2016). Sections 169A.50 to 169A.53 (2016 &amp; Supp. 2017) are expressly identified in section 169A.50 (2016) as \"the Implied Consent Law.\" Section 169A.51, subdivision 3, provides that \"a blood or urine test may be conducted only pursuant to a search warrant\" and that such tests \"may be conducted only as provided in [warrant-execution statutes and section] 171.177.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Chapter 171 is entitled \"Drivers' Licenses and Training Schools.\" That chapter contains the statute at issue here, the \"Search warrant-required testing advisory.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20171.177\">\n    Minn.

We address each of the state's conclusions in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Statutory Compliance\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The state's proposition that compliance with section 171.177, subdivision 1, was not required in this case raises an issue of statutory interpretation.

In the context of deciding the extent to which evidence seized pursuant to the warrant should be suppressed, the supreme court relied on the severance doctrine,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   even though neither party had addressed the doctrine in their arguments to the court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10601288\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/452/668/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 673 &amp; n.7, 674.

However, it is the responsibility of appellate courts to decide cases in accordance with law, and that responsibility is not to be diluted by counsel's oversights, lack of research, failure to specify issues or to cite relevant authorities. The doctrine of \"severance,\" or \"partial invalidity\" has been applied by the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th United States Circuit Courts of Appeals. It is neither new to this court nor questionable. In other relevant decisions, we, in effect, have relied upon \"severability.\" ... [T]he doctrine is not of questionable validity ....

We therefore decide the issue in accordance with this law, as is our responsibility as an appellate court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Once again, suppression based on a statutory violation is justified only if the violation subverts the purpose of the statute. We therefore consider the purpose of section 171.177, subdivision 1. Two cases inform our consideration. The first is\n   <em>\n    Tyler v. Comm'r of Pub.

In\n   <em>\n    Tyler\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court considered, in the context of a license-revocation proceeding, the appropriate remedy for the state's failure to provide a standard implied-consent advisory before obtaining a driver's consent to testing.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10652684\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/368/275/\">\n    368 N.W.2d at 278, 280-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The supreme court stated that \"[i]t would be improper and unfair to revoke a driver's license for refusing to take a test if an advisory were not given,\" but that \"failure to give an advisory should not make any difference in a case where the revocation is based on test results showing that the driver had an [illegal] blood alcohol concentration.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10652684\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/368/275/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10652684\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/368/275/\">\n    at 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The supreme court reasoned, \"The advisory is not designed to persuade a driver\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to take a test; rather it is aimed at letting a driver know the serious consequences of his refusal to take a test.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10652684\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/368/275/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The second case is\n   <em>\n    State v.

The onerous civil consequence of license revocation is designed to induce the driver to submit to testing. The minimum one-year revocation for refusal under the implied consent statute is hardly a \"safe harbor,\" free of adverse consequences. When compared to the 90-day minimum revocation for taking but failing the test, the civil consequences strongly compel the driver to take the test.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10602670\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/473/375/#p377\">\n    473 N.W.2d 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 377 (Minn. App. 1991) (citations and quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In sum, caselaw indicates that the purpose of an implied-consent advisory regarding refusal to submit to chemical testing is to inform a driver of the serious consequences of refusal in an effort to compel the driver to take the test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Although Mike does not address Minnesota law regarding suppression of evidence based on a statutory violation, he asserts that the purpose of the advisory in section 171.177 is to inform a driver that he may refuse the test, even though there is a warrant compelling the test. Mike argues that although \"drivers are told 'refusal to take a test is a crime' and not 'you can refuse to submit to testing in exchange for additional criminal charges' either statement operates as an affirmation that the ability to refuse exists, regardless of the presence of a warrant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Although the advisory in section 171.177, subdivision 1, indirectly communicates that refusal is an option, we disagree that this is the purpose of the advisory. The legislature chose an advisory that explicitly focuses on only one aspect of warranted blood or urine testing-the criminal consequences of refusal-without addressing other aspects such as the option to refuse.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20171.177\">\n    Minn.

Stat. \u00a7 169A.51, subd. 2 (requiring advisory that Minnesota law requires breath test, refusal to submit to test is a crime, and test subject has limited right to consult an attorney). This singular, express focus leads us to conclude that the purpose of section 171.177, subdivision 1, is consistent with the purpose of the implied-consent advisories in\n   <em>\n    Tyler\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Scott\n   </em>\n   : to inform a driver of the serious consequences of refusal in an effort to compel the driver to take the test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Because the purpose of the advisory in section 171.177, subdivision 1, is to encourage submission to testing, and not refusal, that purpose is not subverted if a driver submits to a test without being read the advisory. And because the statutory purpose is not subverted in such circumstances, failure to provide the advisory does not justify suppression of ensuing test results. We therefore hold that failure to comply with the advisory requirement in Minnesota Statutes section 171.177, subdivision 1, does not justify suppression of the test results in a criminal prosecution for DWI.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court therefore\n   erred by suppressing Mike's blood-test results on the ground that the state failed to inform Mike that refusal to take a warranted blood test is a crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Lastly, we address the district court's apparent reliance on due process as a ground for suppression.

Thus, by relying on\n   <em>\n    Stumpf\n   </em>\n   , the district court essentially relied on the due-process holding of\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   in suppressing Mike's test results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   , the Minnesota Supreme Court concluded that Minn.Stat. \u00a7 169.123, subd. 2(b)(2) (1990), which required a law-enforcement officer to advise a person subject to testing under the implied-consent law that the person may be subject to criminal penalties if testing is refused, violated the due-process rights of a driver because she did not have a prior driver's license revocation and the criminal test-refusal statute then in effect applied only to drivers who had prior license revocations. 473 N.W.2d at 849-51, 853-55. In\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Comm'r of Pub.

The rule of law announced in this case does not mean that law-enforcement officers may force an individual to submit to chemical testing. This case does not involve failure to comply with a statutory prohibition of forced blood draws. We therefore do not decide whether such a statutory violation justifies suppression of evidence obtained as a result. If and when we are presented with that issue, we will consider the purpose of the statutory prohibition in deciding whether a violation justifies suppression.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
