For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BASIC FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 1999, Puetz took a job with Emergency Care Specialists (ECS), a physicians' group representing about 150 physicians and about 70 physician's assistants. ECS exclusively staffs its physicians at hospitals run by defendant, Spectrum Health Hospitals (Spectrum). Through her relationship with ECS, Puetz had admission privileges in emergency services and observation medicine at Spectrum. In addition, Spectrum appointed Puetz to serve as the associate medical director of observation medicine, the associate medical director for emergency and cardiovascular medicine, and the clinical advisor for pediatrics. In connection with her role at Spectrum, Puetz developed certain observation protocols, which she admitted were created for Spectrum's use and placed on Spectrum's intranet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Because the observation program at Spectrum was considered a success, individuals and organizations outside of Spectrum and ECS were interested in it. As a result, in the summer of 2013, ECS and Puetz decided to prepare a pamphlet on observation medicine in an effort to start consulting on the subject. When Spectrum learned about the pamphlet, it instructed ECS that it had to work with Spectrum on any consulting or observation work. Further, a meeting was held on the pamphlet/consulting work in July 2013. At the meeting, Spectrum claimed ownership of the observation materials. A follow-up meeting was scheduled, but the meeting did not occur before Puetz was, essentially, prohibited from working at Spectrum in any capacity because of her comments on a Facebook page.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The record reflects that on August 5, 2013, a Spectrum nurse posted on a public Facebook page a photograph of the backside of an overweight woman and the caption: \"Don't judge me. I like what I like.\" In response to the post, 12 Spectrum employees and 3 ECS employees commented on the photograph on Facebook. Relevant to this appeal, Puetz was the sixth person to comment, and she stated, \"OMG is that [patient's initials]? You are soo naughty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A Spectrum staff member saw the post on Facebook, was uncomfortable with the dialogue, and reported it to Spectrum. Defendant Kevin Splaine, Spectrum's president, testified that the decision was made to discipline those involved. Initially, Spectrum decided to remove Puetz from her administrative roles at the hospital. However, Splaine testified that as the investigation into the incident continued, he decided that additional discipline was warranted. According to Splaine, \"anyone with whom we could prove was part of this dialogue knew that this was a patient, if they were an employee of Spectrum Health, they would be terminated. If they were contracting with Spectrum Health, the contract would be terminated. And if they were privileged at Spectrum Health, we would not allow them to practice at Spectrum Health Hospitals.\" The other individuals involved received a written reprimand. By August 19, 2013, Puetz was informed that she was being removed from both her \"administrative leadership position and clinical\" because of the Facebook incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 21, 2013, after making that decision, Splaine spoke at an ECS meeting. Ostensibly, Splaine spoke at the meeting because there was \"a lot of angst and concern\" about the decision to remove Puetz, and ECS wanted to hear Spectrum's side of it. Splaine apparently did not refer to Puetz by name at the meeting; however, he allegedly told everyone at the meeting that Puetz's comments on Facebook\n   violated HIPAA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, Splaine sent ECS a letter demanding that Puetz and another employee of ECS not be scheduled at any hospital owned by Spectrum. In the letter, Splaine referred to the conduct of Puetz and the other employee as reprehensible, unprofessional, and disturbing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 14, 2014, Puetz filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan alleging defamation, false-light invasion of privacy, breach of contract, intellectual property ownership, and two counts of tortious interference with a business expectancy. Only Count IV, the intellectual-property-ownership claim, arguably fell within the federal court's original jurisdiction. After discovery closed, the federal district court sua sponte issued a show-cause order regarding subject-matter jurisdiction. Thereafter, the court determined that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the intellectual-property claim and dismissed the entire complaint without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Within 30 days of her federal complaint being dismissed, Puetz filed a claim in the Kent County Circuit Court. In response, Spectrum moved for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(7) with regard to the defamation claim and for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10) for the remaining claims. Puetz also moved for partial summary disposition on the defamation claim, asserting that Splaine's comments were defamation per se, and she asked the court to rule as a matter of law that her comments on Facebook did not constitute a violation of HIPAA. After oral argument, the trial court entered a written opinion and order dismissing the defamation claim under MCR 2.116(C)(7) and dismissing the remaining claims under MCR 2.116(C)(10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.

ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In Michigan, the period of limitations for a defamation claim is one year. MCL 600.5805(9). \"A defamation claim accrues when 'the wrong upon which the claim is based was done regardless of the time when damage results.' \"\n   <em>\n    Mitan v. Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3682684\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/474/21/#p24\">\n    474 Mich. 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 24,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=706%20N.W.2d%20420\">\n    706 N.W.2d 420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005), quoting MCL 600.5827. Here, the allegedly defamatory statements were made on August 21, 2013, and August 22, 2013. Puetz timely filed her complaint in federal court, but her federal complaint was dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction in June 2015. Puetz declined to appeal the dismissal from federal district court. Subsequently, on July 21, 2015, she filed suit in Michigan, again raising her defamation claim based on Splaine's August 21 and August 22, 2013 statements to\n   ECS. Because her defamation claim was filed more than a year after her claim accrued, it is time-barred unless a tolling provision applies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In order to bring a state-law claim in federal court, a plaintiff must assert his or her claim under the supplemental jurisdiction statute, 28 USC 1367. Section 1367(a) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) or as expressly provided otherwise by Federal statute,\n   <em>\n    in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution.\n   </em>\n   Such supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties. [Emphasis added.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Therefore, before a federal court may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a state-law claim, two requirements must be met. First, there must be a civil action over which the federal district court has original jurisdiction. Second, the state-law claim must be \"so related\" to the federal claim that it forms \"part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=706%20N.W.2d%20420\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In this case, the federal district court concluded that Puetz's complaint failed to satisfy the first requirement, i.e., the federal district court lacked original jurisdiction over any of the claims raised in the complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, because there was no claim over which the federal court had original jurisdiction, the court had no authority under \u00a7 1367(a) to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Puetz's state-law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The supplemental jurisdiction statute does not contain a provision expressly addressing what happens when a state-law claim is dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under \u00a7 1367(a). Instead, \"Subsection (b) places limits on supplemental jurisdiction when the district court's original jurisdiction is based only on diversity of citizenship jurisdiction....\"\n   <em>\n    Raygor v.

In addition, Subsection (d) appears to toll the limitations period for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   claim asserted under Subsection (a) regardless of whether the plaintiff was successful in asserting that claim.

Further, the United States Supreme Court has not addressed this issue, and although there are a number of state courts and lower federal courts that have addressed the issue, those decisions are not binding on this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In the absence of binding authority interpreting 28 USC 1367(d), we first address the United States Supreme Court decision in\n   <em>\n    Raygor\n   </em>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Raygor\n   </em>\n   Court addressed the narrow issue of whether it was constitutionally permissible to apply the tolling provision in \u00a7 1367(d) to state-law claims dismissed on Eleventh Amendment grounds.\n   <em>\n    Raygor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108418\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/533/#p540\">\n    534 U.S. at 539, 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108418\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/533/#p540\">\n    122 S.Ct. 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In answering this question, the\n   <em>\n    Raygor\n   </em>\n   Court acknowledged that \u00a7 1367(d) applied on its face to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   claim asserted under Subsection (a).\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 542,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108418\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/533/#p540\">\n    122 S.Ct. 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the Court stated that \"reading subsection (d) to apply when state law claims against nonconsenting States are dismissed on Eleventh Amendment grounds raises serious doubts about the constitutionality of the provision given principles of state sovereign immunity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The Court considered it a\n   <em>\n    constitutional\n   </em>\n   question given that a limitations period may be a central condition of a state's decision to waive immunity and given that a state can \"prescribe the terms and conditions on which it consents to be sued ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108418\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/533/#p540\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108418\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/533/#p540\">\n    at 542-543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108418\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/533/#p540\">\n    122 S.Ct. 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks and citation omitted). As a result, the\n   <em>\n    Raygor\n   </em>\n   Court relied on the following principle of statutory construction: \"When Congress intends to alter the usual constitutional balance between the States and the Federal Government, it must make its intention to do so unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 543,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108418\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/533/#p540\">\n    122 S.Ct. 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Turning to the statutory language, the\n   <em>\n    Raygor\n   </em>\n   Court noted that there was a lack of clarity on whether there was a clear intent to toll the limitations period for claims against nonconsenting state defendants that were dismissed on Eleventh Amendment grounds.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 544,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108418\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/533/#p540\">\n    122 S.Ct. 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, although the language \"any claim asserted\" was broad enough to cover the situation in\n   <em>\n    Raygor\n   </em>\n   , it was \"not the kind of unequivocal statutory language sufficient to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment\" because it did not reflect any \"specific or unequivocal intent to toll the statute of limitations for claims asserted against nonconsenting States ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 544-545,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108418\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/533/#p540\">\n    122 S.Ct. 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, although the statute could be read to authorize tolling of claims dismissed against nonconsenting State defendants on Eleventh Amendment grounds, in context, 28 U.S.C. 1367 only contemplates a few grounds for dismissal.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 545,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108418\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/533/#p540\">\n    122 S.Ct. 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   The requirements of \u00a7 1367(a) make clear that a claim will be subject to\n   dismissal if it fails to \"form part of the same case or controversy\" as a claim within the district court's original jurisdiction. Likewise, \u00a7 1367(b) entails that certain claims will be subject to dismissal if exercising jurisdiction over them would be \"inconsistent\" with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994 ed. and Supp. V). Finally, \u00a7 1367(c) (1994 ed.) lists four specific situations in which a district court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a particular claim. Given that particular context, it is unclear if the tolling provision was meant to apply to dismissals for reasons unmentioned by the statute, such as dismissals on Eleventh Amendment grounds. In sum, although \u00a7 1367(d) may not clearly exclude tolling for claims against nonconsenting States dismissed on Eleventh Amendment grounds, we are looking for a clear statement of what the rule\n   <em>\n    includes\n   </em>\n   , not a clear statement of what it\n   <em>\n    excludes\n   </em>\n   . Section 1367(d) fails this test. As such, we will not read \u00a7 1367(d) to apply to dismissal of claims against nonconsenting States dismissed on Eleventh Amendment grounds.

Despite the large size of the group, the trial court relied on\n   <em>\n    Derderian\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that disclosure to a \"medical executive committee/team\" does not satisfy the publicity element of a false-light claim. See\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 388,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=689%20N.W.2d%20145\">\n    689 N.W.2d 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Derderian\n   </em>\n   , however, unlike the present case, the plaintiffs failed to provide adequate factual support for their claim that any \"publication was made to a sufficiently large group of people.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=689%20N.W.2d%20145\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, given that there is factual support for Puetz's claim that the disclosure was made to 50 to 60 people, and given that a jury could reasonably infer that to be a large group of people so as to satisfy the publication requirement, we conclude that the trial court erred by finding there was no genuine issue of material fact on the publicity element of Puetz's false-light claim with regard to the statements made at the August 21, 2013 meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The second element of a false-light claim is that the comments must be \"unreasonable and highly objectionable\" because they attributed to the plaintiff \"characteristics, conduct, or beliefs that were false and placed the plaintiff in a false position.\" See\n   <em>\n    Duran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1860170\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/200/622/#p631\">\n    200 Mich.

The trial court did not reach this element because it granted summary disposition based on a lack of publicity. Puetz contends there is a factual dispute on this point because Splaine stated at the ECS meeting that she had violated HIPAA. Spectrum argues, however, that Splaine never referred to Puetz by name at the meeting, so Puetz cannot prove that\n   Splaine attributed a HIPAA violation to her at the meeting. We disagree. The record reflects that the attendees of the ECS meeting were aware of the Facebook incident, those involved, and the discipline imposed; it is reasonable to infer that they knew Splaine was referring to Puetz when he spoke at the meeting. Consequently, we conclude that there are fact questions about whether Splaine told ECS that Puetz violated HIPAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The next question is whether there is a fact question regarding whether the communication of that information, i.e., the attribution of a HIPAA violation to Puetz, was false and placed her in a false light. We note that whether Puetz's comments violated HIPAA could be determined as a matter of law. However, it is not necessary to take that step because in order to establish a false-light claim, a plaintiff must establish that when the defendant disseminated the information, it was done with actual knowledge or reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the publicized matter.\n   <em>\n    Detroit Free Press, Inc\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2300518\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/164/656/#p666\">\n    164 Mich.

Here, the record reflects that before Splaine spoke at the ECS meeting, he had ongoing discussions with Spectrum's lawyers and others involved in the decision-making process about whether the Facebook incident was a violation of HIPAA. Further, he testified that based on his own compliance training, he was aware that identifying a patient by his or her initials is part of what constitutes a patient identifier for HIPAA purposes. In addition, several witnesses testified at length about the rationale behind the discipline imposed. Specifically, if the Facebook post demonstrated knowledge that the individual commenting knew the woman depicted was a patient, then the person making that comment was terminated or prohibited from practicing at Spectrum. Puetz has not directed this Court to any evidence showing that when Splaine made his comments, he either knew his comments were false or he recklessly disregarded the possibility that they were false. Stated differently, even if Puetz could establish that unreasonable and highly objectionable information was publicized to a large group of people, she cannot establish that when he spoke at the ECS meeting, Splaine \"must have known of or acted in reckless disregard as to the falsity of the publicized matter and the false light in which the plaintiff would be placed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . As a result, although the court's reasoning was flawed, the trial court did not err by dismissing Puetz's false-light claim to the extent that it was based on Splaine's comments at the August 21, 2013 meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Finally, Puetz argues that her false-light claim should be allowed to proceed because Spectrum, ECS, and \"some doctors\" knew who Puetz was and then, one day, she opened her door and a reporter was there asking if she was terminated for a Facebook comment. Puetz's lawyer represented to the trial court that this type of result did not come about \"without that information being publicized,\" but when asked by the court to show \"anything in the record that supports your supposition that anyone at Spectrum gave that information out,\" Puetz's lawyer candidly admitted that \"we can't.\" In its opinion granting summary disposition on this claim, the trial court noted that \"the record is bereft of evidence that Spectrum took any actions to notify the media of its disciplinary actions\" and that the court could not \"presume that Spectrum leaked any information to the press.\" In the absence of any evidence in support of this claim, we conclude that the trial court did not err by dismissing this aspect of the false-light claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In sum, Puetz's false-light claim was premised on three separate incidents: the letter to ECS, the statements made at the ECS meeting, and statements made to the media about Puetz. The letter, however, is not actionable because there is no genuine issue of material fact with regard to whether it was publicized. The statements to the media are not actionable because there is, in fact, no evidence that Spectrum made any false statement to the media about Puetz. Finally, although the trial court erred by finding no genuine issue of fact with regard to whether the statements at the ECS meeting were publicized, Puetz cannot establish that Splaine made the statements with actual knowledge or reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the publicized matter.\n   <em>\n    Detroit Free Press, Inc\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2300518\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/164/656/#p666\">\n    164 Mich.

Therefore, despite there being a fact question on some of the elements of the false-light claim, Puetz's failure to establish the final element is fatal to her claim, and the trial court did not err by dismissing it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the trial court did not err by dismissing this claim under MCR 2.116(C)(10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   2. BREACH OF CONTRACT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The trial court also erred by dismissing Puetz's intellectual-property-ownership claim, which was based on a breach-of-contract theory. The trial court held that as a matter of law all the agreements Puetz signed bound her to follow Spectrum's policies and procedures, including Spectrum's intellectual-property policy. The court further found that under the broad language of the intellectual-property policy, Spectrum owned the disputed observation materials. On appeal, Puetz contends that the trial court erred by finding she was bound by the intellectual-property policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \"In Michigan, the essential elements of a valid contract are (1) parties competent to contract, (2) a proper subject matter, (3) a legal consideration, (4) mutuality of agreement, and (5) mutuality of obligation.\"\n   <em>\n    Thomas v. Leja\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2332229\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/187/418/#p422\">\n    187 Mich. App. 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 422,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=468%20N.W.2d%2058\">\n    468 N.W.2d 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991). Here, the trial court relied on three contracts: a 2008 clinical services agreement, a 2009 medical-director-services agreement, and a 2012 pediatric-clinical-services agreement. However, the language of the contracts makes it apparent that Puetz was not a party to the contracts and her signature on the agreements did not represent her intent to be bound by the terms set forth in them. Instead, the parties were Spectrum and ECS, who were named parties, signed as parties, and referred to as parties throughout the contracts. Because Puetz was not a party to the contracts and because there is no evidence before this Court that she separately agreed to be bound by the agreements, the trial court erred by concluding she was bound by the 2008, 2009, and 2012 provisions providing that she would conform with Spectrum's intellectual-property policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   We note that there are also several problems with the dates of the agreements. The 2008, 2009, and 2012 agreements refer to \"this agreement,\" indicating that they apply to services performed under each respective contract. Puetz testified that she started developing her observation materials in 2003, which is about five years before she signed the 2008 agreement, about six years before the 2009 agreement, and about nine years before she signed the 2012 agreement. Given that the contracts purportedly binding her to the intellectual-property policy were not in place when she started developing the content, not all of the observation materials could have been developed under the 2008, 2009, and 2012 agreements. Moreover, a copy of the intellectual-property policy in\n   effect in 2003 is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   included in the lower-court record. Instead, the record indicates that the intellectual-property policy was put into effect in June 2006. It was revised in June 2010 and again in October 2012. Section 2.3.3.3 of the 2012 version of the intellectual-property policy provided that \"[a]ny Intellectual Property developed by an Associate prior to his or her relationship with Spectrum Health shall not be owned by Spectrum Health, except to the extent a Derivative Work of such Intellectual Property is developed during the Associate's relationship with Spectrum Health and otherwise meets the qualifications for ownership by Spectrum Health set forth in Section 2.3. above.\" The 2010 version of the policy had a similar limitation. Accordingly, at a minimum, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Puetz, it appears that there are factual questions about whether some of the materials were developed before the intellectual-property policy was in place and before Puetz signed any contract potentially binding her to conform to the policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the trial court erred by dismissing this claim under MCR 2.116(C)(10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   3. TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH A BUSINESS EXPECTANCY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   To succeed on a claim of tortious interference with a business expectancy, a plaintiff must establish \"the existence of a valid business relationship or expectancy, knowledge of the relationship or expectancy on the part of the defendant, an intentional interference by the defendant inducing or causing a breach or termination of the relationship or expectancy, and resulting damage to the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Dalley v. Dykema Gossett PLLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4072327\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/287/296/#p323\">\n    287 Mich.

Further, to satisfy the third element, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant \"acted both intentionally and either improperly or without justification.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . If the defendant's act was motivated by legitimate business reasons, then the act does not \"constitute improper motive or interference.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 324,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=788%20N.W.2d%20679\">\n    788 N.W.2d 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant \"did something illegal, unethical, or fraudulent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The record reflects that multiple individuals who commented on the Facebook post were disciplined. In addition, although not everyone who posted on the Facebook page was terminated or prohibited from working at Spectrum, the record reflects that Puetz and three or four others were either terminated or prohibited from working at Spectrum Hospitals. Thus, although Puetz can establish that Spectrum intentionally interfered with her relationship with ECS by instructing ECS not to schedule her at any Spectrum facility, she cannot establish that Spectrum acted improperly or without justification, given that Spectrum also terminated or disciplined others involved in the Facebook incident. Further, given the impropriety of Puetz's comments on Facebook, there is nothing to suggest that Spectrum was acting illegally, unethically, or fraudulently when it sought to prevent her from being employed in its hospitals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Moreover, although Puetz speculates that Spectrum had an improper motive when it interfered with her relationship with ECS, she cannot direct this Court to\n   anything other than her own suspicions. Splaine testified that he did not know about Puetz's intellectual-property dispute before he reached the decision to prohibit her from working at Spectrum. Puetz offered no evidence to counter that testimony, other than speculation that his direct supervisor probably knew about the dispute and may have influenced him. Further, Puetz has offered no evidence to contradict Splaine's testimony that the rationale behind the discipline imposed was based on whether or not the individual who commented on the Facebook post was aware or unaware that the woman depicted was a patient. Consequently, Puetz has failed to support this claim, and the trial court did not err by dismissing it under MCR 2.116(C)(10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   IV. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In sum, we reverse the trial court's decision to dismiss Puetz's defamation claim because under the language in 28 USC 1367(d) the limitations period was tolled. We also reverse the court's decision to dismiss Puetz's breach-of-contract claim because there is a genuine issue of material fact with regard to whether Puetz agreed to be bound by Spectrum's IP policy. However, we affirm the court's decision to dismiss Puetz's claim for false light and her claim for tortious interference with a business expectancy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Affirmed in part and reversed in part.
