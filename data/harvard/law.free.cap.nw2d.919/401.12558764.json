However, in its review of the record, the Court of Appeals failed to recognize that, at the end of that hearing, the trial court quoted the applicable standard from\n   <em>\n    Lafler\n   </em>\n   and unequivocally found that there was a reasonable probability that the defendant would have accepted the plea offer. This finding - made by the trial judge who presided over the trial and the evidentiary hearing - is supported by the record, and we are not \"left with a definite and firm conviction that the trial court made a mistake.\"\n   <em>\n    People v.
