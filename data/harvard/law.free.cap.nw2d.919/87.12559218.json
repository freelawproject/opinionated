The employees work 24-hour shifts in client homes. During the time period relevant to this appeal, Baywood paid its employees a daily rate of $165 or $170.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In March 2014, the department received a complaint that Baywood was not paying overtime required by the MFLSA and initiated an investigation into whether Baywood violated the MFLSA between March 21, 2012, and March 21, 2014 (the audit period). As a result of that investigation, the department issued a compliance order, determining that Baywood had violated the MFLSA by failing to pay overtime to 112 home-health-aide employees (the employees) and ordering payment of back wages totaling $557,713.44 and an equal amount in liquidated damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Baywood contested the order, and the department initiated contested-case proceedings under the Minnesota Administrative Procedure Act (MAPA).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2014.57\">\n    Minn.

Baywood asserted that it paid the employees under a \"split-day plan\" that included overtime pay and, alternatively, that the department erred by failing to exercise discretion in determining whether to award liquidated damages. The department disputed that Baywood used a split-day plan, and alternatively asserted that the MFLSA does not permit split-day plans. The department also asserted that it lacked discretion to forgo an award of liquidated damages. An administrative-law judge (ALJ) heard oral argument and issued proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and a recommendation that the compliance order be affirmed with respect to the overtime violations. The parties submitted exceptions and arguments, and a designee for the commissioner of labor and industry (the commissioner) issued a final administrative order affirming the compliance order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Baywood appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I.

Baywood asserts that it paid its employees under a split-day plan-with a regular rate paid for the first 5.5 hours and an overtime rate paid for the remaining 10.5 hours-and that the commissioner erred by granting summary disposition in spite of the evidence that it provided to support its assertion of this split-day pay plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Baywood's evidence included an affidavit from its president, Dorothy Muffett, and affidavits from four Baywood employees. Muffett averred that, consistent with industry practice, Baywood's compensation was expressed as a daily rate, and that she or one of her administrative employees would explain the daily rate to new employees. Muffett further averred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The compensation plan that Baywood adopted during the relevant time period of this audit was to calculate a companion's pay at a rate that was higher than both the federal and state minimum wages for the first 5.5 hours of a shift and at 1.5 times that rate as a daily premium for the next 10.5 hours of a shift, for a total of 16 hours.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Each of the employee-affiants testified to their understanding that Baywood's pay was composed of straight time and overtime. And, in response to the department's arguments that Baywood's payroll records were inconsistent with its alleged split-day plan, Baywood asserted that an error in Baywood's payroll program caused it to inaccurately reflect the manner in which employees were paid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Although it is a close case, we conclude that Baywood put forth sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding how its employees were paid. The affidavits of Muffett and the Baywood employees are evidence that, if believed, support the existence of a split-pay plan under which Baywood paid employees overtime. In recommending summary disposition, the commissioner relied heavily on the department's analysis of Baywood's payroll records and the absence of documentary evidence to corroborate Baywood's assertions regarding its pay plan. But Baywood's affidavits are evidence, and they contradict the department's analysis of the payroll records. Thus, in granting summary disposition, the commissioner necessarily, and improperly, weighed Baywood's evidence to find it less worthy of credence than the department's evidence. Accordingly, we hold that the commissioner erred by granting summary disposition based on a premature determination that Baywood did not use a split-day plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Baywood argues that the department erred in interpreting the MFLSA and associated administrative rules to preclude split-day plans and that its interpretation effectively enforces an unpromulgated rule. The commissioner determined that Baywood had forfeited this argument by failing to raise it to the ALJ.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree with Baywood that, because the issue was raised to the commissioner, who was the final decision-maker, it was not forfeited. In this regard, we note a distinction between evidence, which must be submitted to the ALJ during a contested-case hearing, and argument, which may be made to the ALJ during the hearing and to the agency decision-maker following the hearing.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2014.60\">\n    Minn.

The rules do not define the \"overtime work\" for which premium pay can be excluded from the regular-rate-of-pay calculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Under the plain language of the statutes and rules, it is unclear whether an employer may pay daily overtime under a split-day pay plan and deduct the premium paid for overtime hours from the calculation of the regular rate of pay. The department argues that \"overtime work\" refers only to hours worked in excess of 48 per week and that the MFLSA does not allow split-day plans or daily overtime. Baywood asserts that the regulation allows for deduction of the premium portion of daily overtime paid. The analysis of this issue is complicated by the interplay between the FLSA and the MFLSA. Baywood argues that, under the department's interpretation, employers paying overtime for hours worked in excess of 40 under the FLSA would be required to include that premium pay in their calculation of the regular rate for purposes of determining overtime owed under the MFLSA, which would result in a higher overtime rate for hours in excess of 48 per week under the MFLSA than the rate required under the FLSA for hours\n   worked in excess of 40.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Baywood further asserts that the department's interpretation constitutes an improper, unpromulgated rule that cannot be the basis for the commissioner's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Under MAPA, Minnesota agencies are required to promulgate administrative rules properly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2014.05\">\n    Minn.
