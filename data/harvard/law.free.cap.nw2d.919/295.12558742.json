Sheahan's misconduct involved assisting a client in the fraudulent transfer of assets during a lawsuit, engaging in dishonest conduct during post-judgment discovery, and failing to cooperate with the Director.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minn. R. Prof. Conduct 1.2(d), 3.1, 3.3(a)(1) and (3), 3.4(a)-(b), 4.1, 8.1, 8.4(c)-(d), and Rule 25, Rules on Lawyers Professional Responsibility (RLPR). Petitioner applied for reinstatement in June 2017, and a hearing was held before a panel of the Lawyers Professional Responsibility Board. The panel found that petitioner proved by clear and convincing evidence that he had undergone the requisite moral change to render him fit to resume the practice of law, that he possesses current legal skill and knowledge, and that he had otherwise met the conditions of reinstatement set forth in our prior order. The panel recommended that petitioner be reinstated to the practice of law and placed on probation for a period of 2 years, subject to conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Petitioner and the Director of the Office of Lawyers Professional Responsibility have entered into a stipulation for reinstatement in which they agree with the panel's recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   We have independently reviewed the file and approve the panel's recommendation to reinstate petitioner and place him on probation. We have modified the condition of petitioner's probation with respect to treatment from a mental-health professional to reflect that petitioner must follow the recommendations of the treating professional, rather than a treatment schedule set by the panel or the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Based upon all the files, records, and proceedings herein,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   1. Petitioner William Michael Sheahan is reinstated to the practice of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   2.
