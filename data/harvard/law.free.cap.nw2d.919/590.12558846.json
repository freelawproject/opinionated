Arty's buys in bulk from a distillery the various distilled spirits that it uses to create its products. It is undisputed that these activities of Arty's involve sales of \"intoxicating liquors,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   WIS. STAT . \u00a7 125.02(8) (2015-16), and that sales of intoxicating liquors are subject to a state occupational tax,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   WIS. STAT . \u00a7 139.03(2m).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Based on differing statutory interpretations, Arty's and the Wisconsin Department of Revenue dispute two closely related questions regarding Arty's liability for the intoxicating liquor occupational tax. When does Arty's incur liability, and how much of the contents of each bottle is subject to the tax? The Department argues that Arty's incurs tax liability when it sells its mixtures in bottles to wholesalers and that the taxes are calculated based on the entire contents of each bottle (alcoholic\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   non-alcoholic ingredients). Arty's argues that it incurs liability when Arty's purchases distilled spirits in bulk from a distiller and that taxes are calculated later based only on the distilled spirits portion of the contents of each bottle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 The Tax Appeals Commission agreed with the Department's statutory interpretation. Arty's petitioned for judicial review, and the circuit court affirmed the commission's ruling and order. Arty's appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We agree with the commission and accordingly affirm the circuit court on this statutory interpretation issue. We conclude that the tax liability is incurred when Arty's sells to\n   its customer wholesalers, and that the entire volume of each bottle is taxable as an intoxicating liquor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 Arty's also makes a constitutional argument, based on the assumption that the Department prevails on the statutory interpretation issue just described. This argument is based on two facts: (1) sales of intoxicating liquors are taxed at higher rates than are sales of the same volumes of wine, which are in turn taxed higher than sales of the same volume of fermented malt beverages (beer); and (2) Arty's products have alcohol contents that are lower or roughly equivalent to some wines and beers. Properly framed, Arty's argues that, if the commission is correct in its statutory interpretation, the statutes on their face violate the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws, because sellers of intoxicating liquor pay higher occupational tax rates than sellers of wines or beers containing the same or higher alcohol contents, without a rational basis to justify this distinction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 The commission rejected Arty's constitutional argument. On review, the circuit court remanded the constitutional issue to the commission on the ground that it \"has not been appropriately developed on summary judgment.\" The Department cross appeals the circuit court's decision to remand. We agree with the Department that remand to the commission is not necessary. We also conclude that Arty's fails to demonstrate that there is no rational basis for the legislation. We discern a rational basis in the pursuit of the efficient and effective collection of the taxes for the benefit of the public, including deterring\n   and detecting tax cheating. Accordingly, we reverse the circuit court's remand order and, instead, affirm the commission decision on the constitutional issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 The facts are undisputed. Arty's produces and sells bottled \"premixed cocktails.\" One example is what Arty's calls a \"ready to drink\" bottle of \"Brandy Old Fashioned Sweet.\" Each seven-ounce bottle produced by Arty's consists of: 1.2 ounces of distilled spirits (for example, brandy); and 5.8 ounces of soda, water, and flavoring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 Arty's does not ferment substances to produce alcohol, nor does it distill alcohol from any product of fermentation. Instead, Arty's purchases distilled spirits in bulk from a distillery, then dilutes the distilled spirits in a mixture of soda, water, and flavoring. Arty's sells the bottled mixtures to licensed liquor wholesalers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 The distilled spirits that Arty's purchases are 40 percent alcohol by volume. After dilution, each Arty's bottle is 6.9 percent alcohol by volume. To elaborate briefly regarding alcohol, the parties do not dispute the chemical and mixing processes involved. \"Alcohol is a product of fermentation,\" and alcohol is \"separated, not produced, by distillation.\"\n   <em>\n    Pennell v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8699540\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis/141/35/#p38\">\n    141 Wis. 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 38,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20N.W.%20115\">\n    123 N.W. 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1909). In general, distillation involves boiling and condensation to separate components of a liquid mixture.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In particular, \"[d]istillation of fermented products produces distilled\n   beverages with a high alcohol content.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In contrast, with wine or beer, the process ends with fermentation, producing a liquid containing alcohol which is not distilled,\n   thus resulting in a lower alcohol content.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, the distiller takes fermented alcoholic products and distills them into products with more highly concentrated alcohol levels (called distilled spirits or liquor), which are then sold to Arty's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 Arty's remitted payments to the Department for the intoxicating liquor occupational tax for the period March 31, 2012, through June 30, 2013. This was at the statutory rate of 85.86 cents per liter imposed on \"intoxicating liquor.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   WIS. STAT . \u00a7 139.03(2m). However, in paying these taxes, Arty's counted only the distilled spirits portion of its products and not other ingredients. The Department assessed an additional tax, calculated based on the entire volume of each bottle. Arty's filed a petition for redetermination, which the Department denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 Arty's petitioned the commission, challenging what Arty's described as the Department's decision to \"attach[ ] tax to [sales of] non-alcohol ingredient[s],\" namely, the soda, water, and flavoring, as well as presenting its constitutional argument. On cross motions for summary judgment, the commission rejected both Arty's statutory interpretation argument and its constitutional argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 Arty's filed a petition for review in circuit court. The court rejected the statutory interpretation argument made by Arty's. On the constitutional issue, the court remanded to the commission because the\n   court deemed the issue insufficiently developed. Arty's appeals the first decision and the Department cross appeals the second.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 We address the statutory interpretation issue first and then the constitutional issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

We address Wisconsin law only, and reject Arty's invitation to interpret the Wisconsin occupational taxes on alcoholic beverages \"in harmony with\" the federal alcohol sales taxation structure. Without going into detail regarding the federal system, it is sufficient to\n   know that the federal government taxes products that contain distilled spirits, based on alcohol by volume, in a manner entirely different from that used by the Department to collect Wisconsin's occupational tax on intoxicating liquor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205001\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), (b) (Dec. 2017) (imposing a tax on each \"proof gallon\" of distilled spirits produced in or imported into the United States, which attaches when the distilled spirits are produced).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    WISCONSIN STAT . Ch. 125\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b618 WISCONSIN STATS . ch. 125 describes a state \"system\" for the \"production, distribution, and sale\" of \"alcohol beverages,\" which includes \"state regulatory authority\" over this system, \"for the benefit of the public health and welfare and this state's economic stability.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   WIS. STAT. \u00a7 125.01 (\"Legislative intent\"). Alcoholic beverages are placed into three categories, which we now list in the order from most to least heavily taxed under the occupational tax, as discussed in more detail below, in connection with WIS. STAT . Ch. 139:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (1) \"intoxicating liquor,\" WIS. STAT . \u00a7 125.02(8) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (2) \"wine,\" \u00a7 125.02(22) ; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (3) \"fermented malt beverages\" (including beer), \u00a7 125.02(6).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   There is no dispute that the distilled spirits that Arty's purchases in bulk are \"intoxicating liquors,\" nor is there any suggestion that Arty's sells wine or beer. Therefore we need not address the definitions of the other two categories of alcoholic beverages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b619 \"Intoxicating liquor\" is defined as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   all ardent, spirituous, distilled or vinous liquors, liquids or compounds, whether medicated, proprietary, patented or not, and by whatever name called, containing 0.5 percent or more of alcohol by volume, which are beverages, but does not include \"fermented malt beverages.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   WIS. STAT . \u00a7 125.02(8). To repeat, each Arty's bottle contains a beverage that is 6.9 percent alcohol by volume, well above the 0.5 percent threshold that partially defines intoxicating liquor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b620 WISCONSIN STAT . ch. 125 defines two types of producers of intoxicating liquors: \"rectifiers\" and \"manufacturers.\" Neither side here argues that Arty's is a manufacturer and they agree that the source of distilled spirits for Arty's is a manufacturer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   WIS. STAT. \u00a7 125.02(10) (\" 'Manufacturer' means a person, other than a rectifier, that ferments, manufactures or distills\n   intoxicating liquor.\"). However, the parties disagree about whether Arty's is a \"rectifier\" under one shared definition of \"rectifier\" contained in both chapters 125 and 139. This shared definition is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   A person who after rectifying and purifying distilled spirits, by mixing such spirits with any materials, manufactures any spurious, imitation or compound liquors for sale.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Sec. 125.02(16)(c) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   WIS.

As noted, the tax in chapter 139 at issue here\n   establishes an occupational tax \"upon the selling of intoxicating liquor\" at the rate of 85.86 cents per liter. WIS.

Statutory Interpretation Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b623 We begin with a fundamental point about an occupational liquor tax to provide general context. This tax is not \"an excise tax upon the liquor itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Berlowitz v. Roach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8677985\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis/252/61/#p67\">\n    252 Wis. 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 67,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20N.W.2d%20256\">\n    30 N.W.2d 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1947) (interpreting the 1945 and 1947 versions of WIS. STAT . \u00a7 139.26 ). Instead, it is a tax on \"the privilege to sell\" intoxicating liquor, and applies \"only to intoxicating liquor in possession of persons who are engaged in the business of selling intoxicating liquor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20N.W.2d%20256\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, as clearly reflected in the current statutory language, this is a tax on sales of liquor, and not a tax on liquor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   WIS. STAT . \u00a7 139.03(2m) (establishing \"an occupational tax\" \"\n   <em>\n    upon the selling of\n   </em>\n   intoxicating liquor\") (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b624 With that context in mind, we turn to the timing-of-first-sale question at the heart of the parties' statutory interpretation dispute. Using the terminology of WIS. STAT . \u00a7 139.06(1)(b), the Department contends that \"the time of the first sale\" of the distilled spirits at issue here-which is when \"[l]iability for taxes\" under WIS. STAT . \u00a7 139.03(2m)\"on liquor produced or bottled in this state ... is incurred\"-is when Arty's sells its products to wholesalers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 139.06(1)(b). Arty's disagrees, contending that it incurs \"first sale\" liability when Arty's purchases distilled spirits in bulk from its distiller. We agree with the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b625 Our conclusion is dictated by the unambiguous language in WIS. STAT . \u00a7 139.04(4). This language excludes from consideration all transactions between Arty's and its distiller. \"No\" intoxicating liquor occupational tax \"is levied\" \"in respect to\" \"[s]ale or shipment of ... intoxicating liquor in bulk between manufacturers [and] rectifiers ....\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 139.04(4). There is no dispute that Arty's purchases intoxicating liquor from a \"manufacturer\" of intoxicating liquor. And, as we discuss below, we agree with the Department that Arty's is a rectifier, as defined in\n   WIS. STAT . \u00a7 139.01(6). Therefore, \"[n]o tax is levied\" on a \"sale\" \"between\" the distiller and Arty's. In sum, the \u00a7 139.04(4) exclusion requires Arty's and the Department to ignore purchases by Arty's from its distiller and to treat sales by Arty's to wholesalers as the first sales, and therefore the taxable sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b626 Arty's makes two primary contrary arguments and less significant additional arguments. The first primary argument is that Arty's is not a rectifier,\n   under any definition in WIS. STAT . \u00a7 139.01(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Arty's other primary argument is not easily summarized, but it involves the statutory terms \"levied\" and \"imposed.\" We address the primary arguments, respectively, under the first two subheadings below and then, the additional lesser arguments, under a single separate subheading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Arty's As Rectifier Under WIS. STAT. \u00a7 139.01(6).\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b627 Arty's contends that it is not a rectifier under any definition in WIS. STAT . \u00a7 139.01(6). We disagree, based on one definition of \"rectifier,\" which we now repeat:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   [A] person ... who after rectifying and purifying distilled spirits, by mixing such spirits or liquors with any materials, manufactures any spurious, imitation or compound liquors for sale.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   WIS. STAT . \u00a7 139.01(6). We interpret this definition to include a person who does the following: (1) mixes distilled spirits with other materials, and (2) uses that mixture to manufacture, for sale, a beverage that contains distilled spirits (liquor) mixed with other ingredients. This clearly applies to what Arty's does. We now explain our interpretation of \u00a7 139.01(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b628 First, on its face, the phrase \"by mixing such spirits ... with any materials\" supplies a definition for the otherwise potentially ambiguous preceding phrase, \"rectifying and purifying distilled spirits.\" That is, when one mixes distilled spirits with \"any materials,\" one is \"rectifying and purifying distilled spirits.\" Explaining this conclusion further, WIS. STAT . \u00a7 139.01(6) provides a definition for the term \"rectifier.\" Therefore, to avoid the circular definition problem of using a term (\"rectifier\") to define itself, it is logical for the legislature to include explicit guidance, within the definition of \"rectifier,\" to explain what the phrase \"rectifying and purifying\" means. The meaning of the phrase \"rectifying and purifying\" is otherwise not immediately evident, and Arty's fails to direct us to any separate definition of \"rectifying and purifying\" that undermines this interpretation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b629 Second, by its plain terms, the phrase \"compound liquors\" connotes liquor beverages that contain multiple elements, namely, distilled spirits plus at least one added ingredient.\n   <em>\n    See Compound\n   </em>\n   , MERRIAM WEBSTER ONLINE DICTIONARY , https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/compound (last visited Sept. 10, 2018) (defining the adjective \"compound\" as \"composed of or resulting from union of separate elements,\n   <em>\n    ingredients\n   </em>\n   , or parts.\") (emphasis added). We recognize\n   that distilled spirits are themselves compounds in the sense that they are not pure alcohol (40 percent alcohol means 60 percent non-alcoholic other substances). And, to repeat, \"intoxicating liquors\" are defined to\n   include \"distilled ... liquors, liquids, or\n   <em>\n    compounds\n   </em>\n   , ... containing one-half of one percent or more of alcohol by volume.\" WIS. STAT . \u00a7 139.01(3) (emphasis added). However, it is reasonable to speak of adding materials to a substance that is a compound in order to produce a new compound; one compound may become an element of another compound.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b630 Arty's argues that the phrase \"compound liquors\" should be interpreted to mean beverages that contain multiple\n   <em>\n    types\n   </em>\n   of distilled spirits, such as blends of different types of scotches, and asserts that it produces no such blend. When Arty's was asked at oral argument to defend this interpretation, its only response was to argue that, because the word \"liquors\" in the phrase \"manufactures any ... compound liquors for sale\" is plural, this means that the item for sale contains more than one type of intoxicating liquor. However, we agree with the Department that the only reasonable reading is that \"liquors\" is plural because it follows three adjectives, not one (\"spurious, imitation or compound\"). Further, if the legislature had intended the narrow meaning argued by Arty's, it presumably would have conveyed that idea through a phrase such as \"any ... compound\n   <em>\n    of\n   </em>\n   liquors,\" and Arty's effectively asks us to insert a term into a statute, which we cannot do. Finally on this issue, Arty's fails to explain, in the context of the applicable statutes, what the underlying logic would be in having the definition of rectifier turn on whether a liquor beverage contains more than one type of liquor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b631 For these reasons, we conclude that one definition of \"rectifier\" in WIS. STAT . \u00a7 139.01(6) includes a person, such as Arty's, who mixes distilled spirits\n   with other materials and uses that mixture to manufacture for sale a beverage that contains liquor mixed with other ingredients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    2. \"Levied\" Versus \"Imposed\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b632 We now turn to the second primary argument by Arty's that it should be taxed only on the volume of distilled liquor it purchases from its distiller. This argument begins with the general rule that \"[w]hen the legislature uses different terms in the same act, we generally do not afford them the same meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

The different terms that Arty's highlights are \"levied\" (in the phrase \"[n]o tax is levied\" in WIS. STAT . \u00a7 139.04 (introduction) ) and \"imposed\" (in the phrase \"[a]n occupational tax is imposed\" in WIS. STAT . \u00a7 139.03 (introduction) ). Arty's contends that the term \"levied\" in the exclusions created under \u00a7 139.04(4) (introduction) signals that no taxes are collected at the time of transactions between Arty's and its distiller supplier. Instead, Arty's argues, collections of the tax, based on the Arty's-distiller transactions, are delayed until Arty's makes sales to wholesalers, which is when the taxes are actually \"imposed,\" pursuant to \u00a7 139.03(2m), based on the earlier distiller-Arty's transaction. We reject this argument for the following reasons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b633 First, this appears to be, at best, an incomplete argument. Even if we could discern in the statutory language separate triggers for when taxes are \"levied\" as opposed to when they are \"imposed,\" Arty's fails to articulate a theory as to why the times when taxes are \"imposed\" must be the times when taxes are collected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b634 Second, as the Department notes, other types of sales listed under the \"exclusions\" title in WIS. STAT . \u00a7 139.04 -such as the exclusions for sales of sacramental wine,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 139.04(6), and for sales for \"medicinal purposes,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 139.04(8) -plainly establish complete and not delayed exclusions. These are presented as parallel concepts. The construction offered by Arty's fails to account for the structure of \u00a7 139.04 as a whole, which by all appearances is a list of complete exclusions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kalal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9188131\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/271/633/\">\n    271 Wis.2d 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 46,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9188131\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/271/633/\">\n    681 N.W.2d 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a statute is \"interpreted in the context in which it is used; not in isolation but as part of a whole\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b635 Third, while Arty's is correct that variations in statutory language addressing a given topic may signal differing meanings, \"levied\" and \"imposed\" are not contained in the same statute or section, where the rule of interpretation that Arty's relies on is strongest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

The premise is that the word \"levy,\" as used in the phrase \"[n]o tax is levied\" in WIS. STAT . \u00a7 139.04 (introduction), cannot mean \"imposed.\" However, this position finds no support in commonly accepted definitions.\n   <em>\n    See Levy\n   </em>\n   , MERRIAM WEBSTER ONLINE DICTIONARY , https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/levy (last visited Sept. 10 2018) (\"the imposition or collection of an assessment.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b637 Fifth, and particularly in light of the four points we have already made, it would be a highly obscure drafting choice for the legislature to signal delayed collection of a category of taxes merely by using the terms \"levied\" and \"imposed\" in these separate statutes. Arty's fails to point to any term that conveys the concept of delay. We do not interpret statutes based on the assumption that they contain tortuously coded language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kalal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9188131\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/271/633/\">\n    271 Wis.2d 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 45,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9188131\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/271/633/\">\n    681 N.W.2d 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining plain meaning statutory interpretation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b638 For these reasons, we reject Arty's argument that the term \"levied\" means that tax liability arises but collection is delayed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Additional Statutory Interpretation Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b639 Arty's correctly notes that \" 'a tax cannot be imposed without clear and\n   express language for that purpose.' \"\n   <em>\n    Tetra Tech EC, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12556996\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/914/21/\">\n    382 Wis.2d 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 103 n.53,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12556996\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/914/21/\">\n    914 N.W.2d 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    DOR v.

However, we have explained why we conclude that clear and express language in WIS. STAT . \u00a7\u00a7 139.03(2m), 139.06(1)(b), 139.04(4), and 139.01(6) resolves the issue against Arty's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b640 Arty's broadly asserts that the Department's interpretation cannot be correct, because it \"subject[s] non-alcoholic substances,\" \"substances that contain no alcohol,\" to the occupational tax on sales of intoxicating liquor. This amounts to a complaint about the particular choices that the legislature has made, both in defining \"intoxicating liquors\" to include both distilled spirits and non-alcoholic substances and in subjecting sales of intoxicating liquors to a method-of-production-based tax. It may be counterintuitive that a beverage with an alcohol content of just 0.6 percent should be defined as an \"intoxicating liquor\" for purposes of this tax.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   WIS. STAT . \u00a7\u00a7 125.02(8), 139.03(2m). But this is not an incoherent or irrational legislative choice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b641 Arty's argues that an opinion of the Wisconsin attorney general stands for the proposition that the intoxicating liquor tax applies only to the alcoholic portion of an intoxicating liquor beverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Op.%20Att%27y%20Gen.%20138\">\n    68 Op.

However, the attorney general opinion is not persuasive because\n   it construed statutes that have been changed and involved entirely distinguishable facts. It is sufficient to note, as the commission observed, that Arty's argument is directly undercut by the fact that under the attorney general's approach the\n   <em>\n    full amount\n   </em>\n   of the beverage product at issue was taxed (albeit at varying rates, given a differential taxing formula then in place).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b642 Arty's asserts that the statutes at issue must be ambiguous because the Department itself has demonstrated confusion about their meaning. This is illustrated, Arty's argues, by the fact that the Department \"does not collect any liquor tax\" on sales of bitters, which Arty's asserts are beverages with \"a very high alcohol content.\" However, assuming without deciding that Arty's has identified confusion by the Department in enforcing the statutes, Arty's does not develop an argument explaining how this would provide support for any particular statutory interpretation argument that Arty's now makes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b643 In a related vein, Arty's briefly asserts that, because the Department adopted a regulation, WIS. ADMIN. CODE \u00a7 TAX 8.01 (June 2018), for the purpose of clarifying taxation of intoxicating liquors, that amounts to an acknowledgment of ambiguity in the statutes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again, however, Arty's fails to develop an argument explaining how anything about adoption of the regulation demonstrates ambiguity in the statutory terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b644 For these reasons, we agree with the commission's statutory interpretations that the first, taxable sales of intoxicating liquors are sales by Arty's of its bottled mixtures to its customers, and that the entire volume of each bottle is an intoxicating liquor, each liter of which is subject to the intoxicating liquor occupational tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    II. EQUAL PROTECTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b645 Arty's argues that, if the pertinent statutes are interpreted in the manner we explain above, this creates an arbitrary and irrational classification that violates Arty's right to equal protection of the law under the federal and state constitutions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   More specifically, Arty's argues that there is no rational basis to justify taxing more heavily sales of low-alcohol-content beverages containing distilled spirits than sales of the same volume of low-alcohol-content beverages containing no distilled spirits. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b646 We first explain our standard of review and why we conclude that Arty's makes a facial constitutional challenge to the current taxation scheme.

To succeed on a claim that a law is unconstitutional on its face, the challenger must demonstrate that the State cannot enforce the law under any circumstances. If the challenger\n   succeeds, then the law is void for all purposes. An as-applied challenge, in contrast, focuses on the facts of the challenger's case, and if the court determines that the law actually violates the challenger's rights, then \"the operation of the law is void as to the party asserting the claim.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   We presume that statutes are constitutional, and if any doubt exists about the statute's constitutionality, the court must resolve that doubt in favor of upholding the statute. A party challenging a statute overcomes the strong presumption of constitutionality only by demonstrating that the statute is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. \"It is not sufficient for the challenging party merely to establish doubt about a\n   statute's constitutionality, and it is not enough to establish that a statute probably is unconstitutional.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    Blake v.

We disagree. It is a facial challenge. As discussed in more detail below, Arty's argues that the current taxation scheme, as we interpret it above, always operates unconstitutionally, because it is irrationally based on the\n   <em>\n    methods of production\n   </em>\n   of the sales of alcoholic beverages, as opposed to being based on the\n   <em>\n    alcoholic content\n   </em>\n   of the beverages. That is, Arty's argues that the only rational alcoholic beverage taxation system would be one based on the alcoholic content of the alcoholic beverage, and that it is irrational to tax beverages more heavily merely because their ingredients include distilled spirits. Thus, the remedy that Arty's seeks is invalidation of the entire current system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Citizens United v.

If the legislature adopted an alcoholic-content-based taxation system, this would result in higher tax rates on sales of products that contain distilled spirits and that have higher alcoholic contents than wines or beers. Thus, the argument proceeds, the new taxation system would produce some outcomes that approximate outcomes under the current method-of-production-based system. We reject this argument. Even if some outcomes under a new statutory scheme might approximate current outcomes, this does not change the fact that Arty's challenges the constitutionality of the entire current system in all applications.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Voters With Facts v.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b653 Arty's focuses on the fact that the occupational tax on sales of intoxicating liquors is imposed on the volume of intoxicating liquor sold, without regard to the alcohol content of the beverage, except that all intoxicating liquor must be at least 0.5 percent alcohol by volume.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   WIS. STAT . \u00a7 139.03(2m). Arty's argues that it is unconstitutional not to tie levels of taxation to levels of the strength of the alcohol content, that is, unconstitutional not to impose higher taxes based on higher alcohol content.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b654 To repeat, there is no dispute that the occupational tax on sales of intoxicating liquor is higher than the equivalent tax on sales of the same volume of wine, which is higher than the equivalent tax on beer sales regardless of the alcoholic content of the respective beverage, so long as the alcoholic content\n   exceeds 0.5 percent (with a slight variation for wine, establishing two levels of alcoholic content, which does not matter to any argument either party makes).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   WIS. STAT . \u00a7\u00a7 139.03(2m) (85.86 cents per liter for intoxicating liquor), 139.03(2n) (either 6.605 or 11.89 cents per liter, depending on the alcohol content level, for wine other than cider), 139.02(1) ($2 per 31 gallons of fermented malt beverages). As Arty's points out, this means that sales of beverages that include distilled spirits \"are taxed much more heavily\" than sales of the same volumes of wine and beer, regardless of alcoholic content.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b655 Against that factual background, Arty's contends that this tax scheme creates the following classifications of citizens: (1) \"producers of low [alcohol] potency ... beverages made using products derived\n   from the distillation process,\" who pay a higher occupational tax on sales, and (2) \"producers of low [alcohol] potency ... beverages made using products derived from the fermentation process,\" but not distillation, such as wine and beer, who pay a lower occupational tax on sales of the same volume. Arty's argues that these classifications deny it equal protection, because low-alcohol-by-volume products that contain distilled spirits are \"essentially identical\" to low-alcohol-by-volume wine and beer products, but nevertheless the former are taxed more heavily merely because of a difference in the method of production, and that distinction is not based on any rational legislative decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b656 The Department does not dispute the first two steps of the equal protection analysis. It acknowledges that the current taxing scheme creates the distinct classifications described by Arty's and that it taxes sales of low-alcohol beverages containing distilled\n   spirits much more heavily than sales of low-alcohol beverages containing wine or beer. The Department disputes the third step, whether there is a rational basis for the different treatment. On this issue, the Department's core argument is that the current method-of-production-based system is rational because it \"provides for easy administration by taxing all intoxicating liquor sales the same without needing to analyze the ingredients in each individual product sold in the state,\" in particular the alcohol content in each product, and that part of what makes administration easy is that it minimizes opportunities for tax cheating compared with an alcohol-content-based taxation system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b657 We now address the five rational-basis test factors under\n   <em>\n    Blake\n   </em>\n   and explain why we reject the arguments that Arty's makes regarding each.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b658 The first factor is easily resolved. Arty's does not support its suggestion that the classification here does not involve \"substantial distinctions which make one class really different from another.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blake\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775016\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/370/1/\">\n    370 Wis.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 33,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775016\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/370/1/\">\n    884 N.W.2d 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Arty's contends that low-alcoholic-content beverages that contain distilled spirits (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , a \"Brandy Old Fashioned Sweet,\" 6.9 percent alcohol by volume) are \"virtually identical\" to low-alcoholic-content beverages that do not contain distilled spirits (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , a wine cooler, 6.9 percent alcohol by volume). True, these are alcoholic beverages with the same alcohol content. But the first factor asks only whether there is \"really a difference\" between the classes, and here that difference is the presence or absence of distilled spirits. Arty's does not suggest that it is difficult for producers, sellers, or regulators to\n   distinguish between alcoholic beverages that contain distilled spirits and those that do not. The difference is real.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b659 Much of the argument on the constitutional issue involves the second rational-basis factor, which is whether the classification is \" 'germane to the purpose of the law,' \" that is, has \" 'some relevance to the purpose for which classification of the classes is made.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775016\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/370/1/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775016\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/370/1/\">\n    370 Wis.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 30, 33,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775016\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/370/1/\">\n    884 N.W.2d 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoted source omitted). We begin with purposes for the taxation scheme, and then address whether the classification Arty's challenges has some relevance to a purpose of the scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b660 Arty's argues that the legislature's only purpose in imposing the occupational taxes on sales of alcoholic beverages is to encourage temperance, and that this purpose is directly undermined when a higher alcohol content beverage is taxed more than a lower alcohol content beverage. We interpret Arty's to use the term \"temperance\" to mean not just abstention from drinking, but also avoidance of excessive inebriation and alcoholism, and we will follow the broader meaning in our discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b661 Arty's does not reach square one in establishing a temperance purpose, because\n   Arty's fails to direct us to any provision establishing a temperance purpose behind the tax provisions in WIS. STAT . ch. 139. Chapter 139 does not contain a statement of legislative intent. Instead, as we now explain, chapter 139 contains statutes that make clear that temperance is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a primary purpose in establishing and collecting the occupational taxes at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b662 The tax on intoxicating liquors includes beverages that are anywhere from .5 to 100 percent alcohol.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   WIS. STAT . \u00a7 139.01(3). This exceedingly\n   broad range demonstrates that the legislature has decided\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to tax sales based on alcohol content. If the legislature had even a minor purpose of encouraging temperance through the use of the occupational taxes, it would presumably have taken steps to tax more heavily beverages with higher alcohol concentrations. Instead, it has swept into a single category all beverages containing distilled spirits, regardless of alcohol content, and did the same (with only a small variation regarding wine) with wine and fermented malt beverages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b663 Further, there is pertinent evidence in the statutes that, in contrast to temperance, germane purposes of the taxation scheme here include the efficient and effective collection of the taxes for the benefit of the public, including deterring and detecting tax cheating. We find these both in the general nature and structure of the pertinent statutes in chapter 139 and related statutes in chapter 125, and also in the \"[l]egislative intent\" statement in chapter 125. We have seen that chapter 125 is closely related to chapter 139 in the context of issues raised in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kalal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9188131\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/271/633/\">\n    271 Wis.2d 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 46,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9188131\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/271/633/\">\n    681 N.W.2d 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (closely related statutes can be pertinent to interpretation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b664 The chapter 125 statement of intent highlights, in part, interests in \"this state's economic stability,\" and \"in efficient and effective collection of tax.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   WIS. STAT. \u00a7 125.01. Granted, the latter statement is made in the specific context of face-to-face retail sales at licensed premises. It nonetheless appears to express a pertinent purpose of the legislature in connection with the overall system involving production and distribution of alcoholic beverages, including the collection of occupational taxes. It is also true that the statement of legislative intent contains a reference to\n   \"the benefit of the public health and welfare,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9188131\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/271/633/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , but this does not reflect a strong temperance purpose in particular.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b665 As purported support for its temperance-purpose argument, Arty's points exclusively to a statement in the \"foreword\" of the state treasurer to the 1942 \"Wisconsin Red Book\" of \"Administrative Rules and Orders.\" The treasurer stated in part that he \"hereby adopts the following rules and regulations for the purpose of effectively insuring temperance in the consumption of liquors and wines in this state, and promoting obedience of law and order.\" Arty's fails to explain how the treasurer's 1942 statement establishes a single or even a primary purpose of temperance for the current occupational taxes imposed on sales of alcoholic beverages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b666 Having determined that the taxation scheme has the purposes of advancing state \"economic stability\" and its \"interest in efficient and effective collection of tax,\" we turn to the issue whether Arty's has demonstrated that the challenged classification does not have some relevance to those purposes. The Department does not offer a robust or detailed argument,\n   but it does not have to. Its argument is sufficient to satisfy the some-relevance-to-purpose standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \u00b667 The Department asserts that treating Arty's the same as a company that sells \"a straight bottle of vodka or a bottle of whisky\" promotes efficient and effective tax collection. That is, it is simpler, and therefore more efficient and effective, for the Department to tax sales of three classes of alcoholic beverages-intoxicating liquors, wines, and fermented malt beverages-at set rates assigned to each class, and applied to the total volumes of products sold, than it would be to require all taxpayers to report the alcohol content of each alcoholic beverage sold and then collect taxes based on self-reported alcohol content levels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b668 As part of this argument, the Department suggests that if the Department had to depend on self-reporting of precise alcohol content levels of all alcoholic beverages there would be room for hard-to-detect tax cheating that cannot occur, or is less likely to occur, under the current system. In contrast, the Department submits, under the current system it can easily audit data regarding the product inputs to rectifiers and manufacturers, in order to determine whether distilled spirits are ingredients and what volumes of products are being sold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b669 Arty's argues that we should ignore these positions of the Department, because all Wisconsin alcoholic beverage sellers are currently obligated to create and submit to federal alcohol regulators detailed alcohol-content data. However, putting aside the question of whether Arty's provided the commission with a sufficient factual record to establish this proposition, Arty's concedes that \"there could be some complication\" in transforming the federally required data into forms and procedures appropriate for filing state\n   occupational taxes. And, more importantly, Arty's fails to explain why the Wisconsin Legislature could not rationally weigh the risks of potential inefficiency and the potential risks of tax cheating in this context, for Wisconsin's purposes, differently than federal authorities may weigh these same considerations, for federal purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b670 The third and fourth rational-basis factors are easily resolved, because Arty's does not contend that the taxation scheme here is \" 'based upon existing circumstances only,' \" precluding additional members in any pertinent class, or that the taxation scheme does not apply equally to each member of each pertinent class.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blake\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775016\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/370/1/\">\n    370 Wis.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 33,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775016\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/370/1/\">\n    884 N.W.2d 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoted source omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b671 The fifth rational-basis factor involves an assessment of the \" 'propriety,' \" in light of the public good, of using the current method-of-production-based system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <a case-ids=\"6775016\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/370/1/\" xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    id=\"p609\" href=\"#p609\" data-label=\"609\" data-citation-index=\"1\" class=\"page-label\"&gt;*609\n   </a>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775016\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/370/1/\">\n    <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.&lt;/extracted-citation&gt;harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n     See id.\n    </em>\n    Arty's offers no new arguments on this propriety topic.

In particular, we note that Arty's fails to provide evidence or argument that seriously undermine the Department's plausible contention that Arty's proposed alternative taxation system would be an\n    invitation to widespread forms of tax cheating that have no current, widespread equivalents.

This argument is frivolous. As plainly reflected in the pertinent pleading, after arguing the merits of the constitutional issue, the Department merely stated that, if the court\n    <em>\n     disagreed\n    </em>\n    with the Department on the constitutional issue, the appropriate remedy would be remand, because the commission had resolved the issue on summary judgment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    Our conclusion that one purpose of the challenged taxation scheme is efficient and effective collection of taxes, including avoiding tax cheating, readily distinguishes an Illinois supreme court case on which Arty's heavily replies as persuasive authority.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Federated Distributors, Inc. v.
