Fischer sued the City of Sioux Falls for negligence, but the circuit court granted the City's request for summary judgment, concluding that the City is immune from liability for such negligence claims. Fischer appeals, arguing there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the City's conduct amounts to gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [\u00b6 2.] On June 29, 2014, Fischer and his grandson were riding their bicycles along a paved path in Kuehn Park, which is owned by the City of Sioux Falls. Kuehn Park offers a golf course, playground, softball diamonds, swimming pool, and tennis courts. For parkgoers entering via the paved path, the most direct route to the tennis courts and swimming pool is through the northern gate of the tennis courts. Noticing that the tennis courts' northern gate was open, Fischer diverted from the path and rode through the grass, intending to access the tennis courts and swimming pool. While riding into a depressed area, the front tire of Fischer's bicycle became lodged in a natural drainage ditch that had been concealed by grass. Fischer was thrown from his bicycle and sustained serious injuries, including fractures in his back, neck, and sternum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b6 3.] Fischer filed an action against the City on May 3, 2016, alleging a single claim of \"negligence.\" In the complaint, Fischer alleged that the City owed him a duty to make the park reasonably safe or to warn him of concealed dangers like the drainage ditch. He also alleged that the City \"failed to use reasonable care or diligence to design, construct, maintain in good repair, inspect and upgrade the area where [Fischer] was injured or to warn [him] of the concealed danger.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b6 4.] On November 14, 2016, the City filed a motion requesting summary judgment. The City argued that it was immune from liability for negligence under SDCL 20-9-20, which generally states that a political subdivision of South Dakota owes no duty of care to keep land used for outdoor\n   recreational purposes safe or to warn of dangerous conditions. Although Fischer had not alleged gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct in his complaint, he responded that SDCL 20-9-20 did not immunize the City from liability for such claims. The parties deposed several of the City's employees, who generally testified that they were aware of the natural drainage ditch, that the ditch was often concealed by grass, and that they believed a bicyclist attempting to ride over the ditch could be injured. After holding a hearing on September 11, 2017, the circuit court granted the City's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 5.] Fischer appeals, raising the following issue: Whether the circuit court erred by granting the City's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 6.] Summary judgment is appropriate \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" SDCL 15-6-56(c).

Fischer's complaint identifies a single cause of action: \"negligence.\" The court granted summary judgment based on SDCL 20-9-20 and -21, which immunize a municipality from liability for negligence in connection with land open to the public for recreational use.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As Fischer points out, however, a municipality remains liable for an injury caused on such land that results from the \"gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct\" of a municipality employee. SDCL 20-9-22(1). The City points out that the phrases\n   <em>\n    gross negligence\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    willful or wanton misconduct\n   </em>\n   are noticeably absent from Fischer's complaint.

Moreover, a plaintiff alleging willful or wanton misconduct must prove the defendant acted\n   with a culpable mental state.

Nor does the evidence submitted on the motion for summary judgment (i.e., the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, and affidavits, pursuant to SDCL 15-6-56(c) ) distinguish his cause of action from one for ordinary negligence. The evidence in the record does not suggest that the rut posed an easily perceptible danger of death or other serious physical harm; indeed, Fischer's complaint asserts that the rut simply \"poses\n   <em>\n    danger\n   </em>\n   to citizens at the park[.]\" (Emphasis added.) Nor does the evidence in the record suggest that the probability of such \"danger\" is substantially greater than that required for ordinary negligence-Fischer's complaint does not address the question of probability at all. Even on appeal, Fischer's summary of the City's employees' deposition testimony suggests that harm was merely possible rather than substantially probable; he asserts that the employees testified that \"the front tire [of a bicycle]\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   sink into the rut,\" that \"the front tire\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   get stuck,\" that \"the bike\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   flip,\" and that \"a member of the public\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   be seriously injured.\" (Emphasis added.)

Several City employees testified that they knew about the sizeable rut in the grassy area between the paved trail immediately to the north of the tennis court and swimming pool areas. These employees testified that thousands of visitors enter Kuehn Park each year and a City ordinance allows bicyclists to ride their bikes off the sidewalk. City employees testified to having observed bicyclists riding in the grassy areas of the park. Several employees testified to their personal knowledge and experience with the rut before Fischer was seriously injured when his bike tire hit the rut, causing him to be thrown from the bike. Such testimony included the fact that not only had lawnmowers been stuck in the rut in the past, but the rut was large enough to break the axle of a lawnmower if it was driven directly over the rut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b6 22.] The facts also show that the City employees\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   that the rut was at times hidden by grass or grass clippings. Photographic evidence indicates that the rut became camouflaged after the area surrounding the rut was mowed. Moreover, on the day Fischer was injured, the evidence shows that a park guest playing tennis observed Fischer immediately after Fischer was injured. As this individual ran to assist and approached where Fischer was lying, he testified that he observed the\n   grass and vegetation \"completely obscured the rut to the point where it was not visible.\" The photographs of the rut and the park guest's observations demonstrate that the dangerous condition was obscured and could not be appreciated by parkgoers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b6 23.] Additionally, a fact question exists regarding the probability of harm created by the City's decision to open a gate on the north end of the fenced-in tennis courts in approximately 2013. When the gate is open, bicyclists and pedestrians traveling on the paved trail can travel the short distance, over the grassy area where the rut is located, to the gate to gain access to the tennis court and swimming pool areas. As noted by the majority opinion, \"[f]or parkgoers entering via the paved path,\n   <em>\n    the most direct route to the tennis courts and swimming pool\n   </em>\n   is through the northern gate of the tennis courts.\" Majority \u00b6 2 (emphasis added). Indeed, Fischer testified that the very reason he left the path was because the most direct route toward the tennis courts and swimming pool was over the concealed rut to reach the open gate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [\u00b6 24.] But this route was not always available. The evidence shows that for a time prior to 2013 while the gate was open, the City received complaints from park guests about skateboarders and possibly bicyclists coming into the tennis court area. In response, the City closed the gate. For unknown reasons, the City re-opened the gate in 2013. The gates remained open at least until 2014 when Fischer was injured. When the gate is closed, bicyclists and pedestrians on the paved trail must go around through the parking lot area to access the tennis courts or pool. There would be little or no reason to expect park guests to cross over the rut when the north gate of the tennis court is closed. But after the gate was re-opened in 2013, a reasonable juror could conclude that park guests, particularly children, bicycling on the paved path, would see the open gate and take the shortest route over the hidden rut to the tennis courts and swimming pool. On these facts, the City's state of mind as to the likelihood of serious injury are questions of fact for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [\u00b6 25.] The majority deems the basis of Fischer's allegations \"mere speculation, conjecture, or fantasy.\" Majority \u00b6 13 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Schaefer v.

In so concluding, the majority claims that the evidence and deposition testimony offered by Fischer only suggests the possibility, rather than probability, of harm. Majority \u00b6\u00b6 10-11. Highlighting questions posed to City employees rather than their answers, the majority apparently arrives at its conclusion in part because the attorneys did not couch their inquiries in stronger language. However, the majority ignores statements by City employees affirming, without reservation, the danger the rut posed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    Q:\n   </strong>\n   And you wouldn't take a bicycle over that rut that you wouldn't take your mower over, would you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    A:\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    Absolutely not\n   </em>\n   .
