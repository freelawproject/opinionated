We affirm, concluding the court did not err by dismissing the Thompsons' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [\u00b6 2] In May 2016 Walsh County notified Jann Thompson\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   she failed to pay her 2013 property taxes. The notice stated the County would foreclose on the property unless Thompson paid the taxes by October 1, 2016. Thompson previously attempted to pay the taxes with promissory notes and other instruments; however, they were not accepted by the County. On October 6, 2016, the County recorded a tax deed for the property due to Thompson's failure to pay the 2013 taxes. The County informed Thompson she had the right to repurchase the property before the tax sale by paying all outstanding taxes and costs against the property. On November 2, 2016, Thompson paid the 2013, 2014 and 2015 taxes and redeemed the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b6 3] Before paying the outstanding property taxes the Thompsons sued the Defendants, claiming the State has no authority to tax their property, and county officials improperly refused payment by not accepting the Thompsons' promissory notes. The Thompsons also alleged fraud, inverse condemnation and slander of title. The Thompsons subsequently filed a number of other documents and motions relating to their complaint. The Defendants denied the Thompsons' allegations, and requested dismissal of the complaint and denial of the additional civil filings and motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b6 4] The Defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing the Thompsons failed to exhaust their administrative remedies by not bringing their claims related to property taxes to the Walsh County Board of Commissioners before suing. The district court agreed and dismissed the Thompsons' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 5] Following dismissal, the Thompsons filed a motion requesting a transfer and assignment of their property tax obligations to the Defendants' attorney. The\n   court denied the motion, concluding it was frivolous because \"[n]o reasonable person could think a court would rule in Plaintiffs' favor and assign all future real estate tax obligations to Defendants' themselves, much less their attorney individually.\" The court awarded the Defendants $400 in attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 6] Summary judgment is a procedural device under N.D.R.Civ.P. 56(c) for the prompt resolution of a controversy on the merits without a trial if there are no disputed issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Horob v.

The Defendants assert the court properly dismissed the claims because Thompsons failed to submit their property tax claims to the Walsh County Board of Commissioners as required by N.D.C.C. \u00a7 57-45-09.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b6 8] Section 57-45-09, N.D.C.C., provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"No action may be brought in the courts of this state to annul any taxes or tax assessments, except special assessments for public improvements, or to recover back taxes erroneously paid, or any part thereof, until the same first has been submitted to the board of county commissioners for adjustment in accordance with the existing law, and any action brought without having been first submitted to the board of county commissioners must be dismissed without prejudice.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b6 9] The Thompsons argue the County should have accepted their promissory notes and honored them for payment of the property taxes. \"The county treasurer, and other officials charged with the duty of collecting public moneys, in their discretion, may accept bank checks, bank drafts, and express and post-office money orders in payment of any tax, assessment, fee, or license.\" N.D.C.C. \u00a7 57-20-13. \"The acceptance of any check, draft, or money order in payment of any tax, fee, or license does not constitute payment until it has been duly honored and paid, and acceptance is subject to collection.\" N.D.C.C. \u00a7 57-20-14. The plain language of the statutes gives a county discretion to restrict the form of payment for property taxes, and acceptance of an instrument does not establish actual payment until honored.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b6 10] A taxpayer may apply for an abatement or refund of property taxes under N.D.C.C. \u00a7 57-23-04(1) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"Upon application filed in the office of the county auditor on or before November first of the year following the year in which the tax becomes delinquent, as in this chapter provided, the board of county commissioners may abate or refund, in whole or in part, any assessment or tax upon real property.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The statute lists eight cases when a taxpayer may apply for an abatement or refund, including \"[w]hen taxes have been erroneously paid,\n   <em>\n    or errors made in noting payment\n   </em>\n   , or in issuing receipts therefor.\" N.D.C.C. \u00a7 57-23-04(1)(e) (emphasis added). If the Thompsons believed the County erred by not accepting and honoring their promissory notes as payment for the property\n   taxes, their remedy was to seek redress with the Walsh County Board of Commissioners under N.D.C.C. \u00a7 57-23-04(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b6 11] In granting summary judgment in the Defendants' favor, the district court determined the Thompsons \"did not file an application for correction, abatement or refund, pursuant to N.D.C.C. ch. 57-23, for any part of the 2013, 2014, or 2015 property taxes.\" The court dismissed the Thompsons' \"claims and causes of action related to ... [the] taxation of [their] Property ... without prejudice pursuant to N.D.C.C. \u00a7 57-45-09.\" The court dismissed the Thompsons' remaining claims against the Defendants with prejudice. Under N.D.C.C. \u00a7 57-45-09, claims related to property taxes first must be submitted to the board of county commissioners, and \"any action brought without having been first submitted to the board of county commissioners must be dismissed without prejudice.\" Because the Thompsons did not first submit their property tax claims to the Walsh County Board of Commissioners, the court did not err by dismissing the Thompsons' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b6 12] The Defendants argue the Thompsons' appeal is frivolous and request double costs and attorney's fees. The Defendants' attorney submitted an affidavit and itemized statement stating the Defendants incurred attorney's fees of $5,295 defending the appeal, plus additional fees and costs for oral argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United Bank of Bismarck v.
