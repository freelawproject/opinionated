The indictment was not subject to the demurrer urged against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">2. The rulings of the court complained of upon the admissibility of evidence were not erroneous; the charge of the court was full and fair, and the evidence was amply sufficient to authorize the defendant\u2019s conviction. For no reason pointed out in the record did the court err in overruling the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"AN58\">\n<em>Broyles, G.
