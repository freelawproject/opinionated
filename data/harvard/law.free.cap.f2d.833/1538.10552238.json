Ward was convicted of three counts of tax evasion (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201), and two counts of making false statements or claims to a federal agency. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Ward makes three arguments on this appeal. First, he suggests that the United States has jurisdiction over only Washington, D.C., the federal enclaves within the states, and the territories and possessions of the United States. Secondly, he interprets the term \u201cindividual\u201d within the Internal Revenue Code to apply only to those individuals located within this jurisdiction of the United States. Ward reaches this twisted conclusion by misinterpreting a portion of the Income Tax Code. The 1918 Act defined the words \u201cstate\u201d or \u201cUnited States\u201d to \u201cinclude\u201d United States territories and the District of Columbia; Ward asks this court to interpret the word \u201cinclude\u201d as a term of limitation, rather than of definition. Finally, Ward maintains that the only persons expressly and statutorily liable for income tax are the withholding agents of nonresident aliens and foreign corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-5\">We find each of appellant\u2019s contentions to be utterly without merit. The district court properly denied Ward\u2019s motions for acquittal, and properly refused to instruct the jury as to Ward\u2019s theory of his defense. The opinion of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
