Nes-mith. Nesmith alleges that his employer, Martin Marietta Aerospace (MMA), discriminated against him because of his race and discharged him in retaliation for filing a discrimination suit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. We affirm the judgment on the merits and the award of $2,000 in attorney\u2019s fees against plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-19\">Representing himself at a consolidated trial of separate actions for discrimination and retaliation, Nesmith called a number of witnesses, including an MMA official, for cross-examination. Nesmith also testified. MMA then moved for a dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) on the ground that Nes-mith had failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination or of retaliation and asked for an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The court entered judgment, based on findings of fact and conclusions of law, dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s claims with prejudice and awarding MMA attorney's fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-20\">The law is clear concerning the requirements for proving cases of this kind. <em>See Nix v. WLCY Radio/Rahall Communications, </em>738 F.2d 1181, 1184 (11th Cir.1984); <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 688 (1973); <em>Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1093, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). The trial testimony and the documentary evidence support the court\u2019s conclusion that neither Nesmith\u2019s race nor his filing charges played a role in MMA\u2019s actions toward him. There is little that need be said of the district court\u2019s findings in this regard. Nesmith\u2019s career thrived, with many promotions and salary increases, during the presidency of Robert Whalen, his mentor, and faltered when Whalen left the company. Whalen\u2019s endorsement, not Nesmith\u2019s abilities, explained his rapid advancement during Whalen\u2019s tenure at MMA. Nesmith had been promoted to a level at which he was unable to perform satisfactorily and, as a consequence, he experienced periods without assignments despite MMA's efforts to accommodate him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1491\">*1491</page-number>Nesmith was away from his job on medical leave, at a salary of over $40,000 a year, during much of 1984-85. Following MMA\u2019s last effort to find a suitable position for him in the manufacturing department, Nesmith began a period of paid medical leave which lasted six months, with extensions. At the conclusion of Nesmith\u2019s leave, he was terminated. There is no evidence which requires a finding that MMA\u2019s action was based on race.</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-4\">The record also supports the district court\u2019s finding that Nesmith was not fired in retaliation for his equal employment opportunity activities at the company. Indeed, the court found that his early rapid advancement at MMA was related to his efforts on behalf of black and female employees of MMA. Even in his last years there, the company appeared to be extremely tolerant in attempting to find a satisfactory position for him and in according him leave for his medical problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-5\">Not being clearly erroneous, the district court\u2019s findings, including its finding on the \u201cultimate\u201d issue of intentional discrimination, must be affirmed. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a); <em>Pullman-Standard v. Swint, </em>456 U.S. 273, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-6\">The district court held that MMA was entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees under both Title VII and Federal Rule Civil Procedure 11. Were the award based on Rule 11 only, we would be inclined to reverse. ThaLRule-is-a-sanction -against bad faith litigation. The Rule provides that a lawyer, or a party, if unrepresented, must sign every pleading which means that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afs\">to the best of the signer\u2019s knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry it is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, and that it is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATa\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-7\">The standard for imposing Rule 11 sanctions is more stringent than other attorney\u2019s fees statutes because it requires the additional element of bad faith. The amended rule incorporates an objective standard in assessing bad faith. <em>See Donaldson v. Clark, </em>819 F.2d 1551, 1556 (11th Cir.1987) <em>(in </em>banc). The standard requires a determination as to whether the party\u2019s conduct was reasonable under the circumstances. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1579-9\">The district court without discussion determined that Nesmith\u2019s suit was brought for an improper purpose. There is insufficient evidence to support this conclusion. The evidence Nesmith presented not only failed to indicate discriminatory treatment, but instead revealed that Nesmith received several salary increases and promotions during his tenure. Nesmith made no showing that other similarly situated members of the unprotected class were treated preferentially nor did he present evidence of retaliation. Under these circumstances, it is apparent that Nesmith\u2019s claim may be characterized as without foundation, but there is no evidence that he was in bad faith in bringing the claim, or that it was brought for any purpose other than to receive what he thought he was entitled to under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-10\">The standards for awarding Title VII attorney\u2019s fees under the statutory provisions of Title VII have a different base. In <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 421, 98 S.Ct. 694, 700, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978) the Supreme Court held that \u201ca district court may in its discretion award attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing defendant in a Title VII case upon a finding that the plaintiff\u2019s action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, even though not brought in subjective bad faith.\u201d It appears clear from the facts in this case that the district court was well within its discretion in imposing attorney\u2019s fees under the <em>Christiansburg </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-12\">The amount of attorney\u2019s fees was properly modified by the district court in consideration of the plaintiff\u2019s ability to pay. <em>See Durrett v. Jenkins Brickyard, Inc. </em>678 F.2d 911, 917 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
