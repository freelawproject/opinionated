Such sales and purchases of Government royalty oil were subject to federal regulations from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>1973 to January 28, 1981. Both companies filed suit in the Claims Court under the Tucker Act (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1)) to recover for allegedly excessive prices collected by the Government contrary to that federal regulatory scheme. The Government moved to dismiss on the ground that there was no jurisdiction in the Claims Court to consider such claims. Judge Har-kins of the Claims Court held that there was no such jurisdiction, and therefore dismissed the complaints. <em>Tipperary Refining Co. v. United States, </em>11 Cl.Ct. 572 (1987). We agree with his views and affirm on the basis of that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
