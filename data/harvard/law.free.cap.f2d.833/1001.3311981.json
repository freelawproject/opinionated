Before the trial court\u2019s decision in the present case, the Claims Court decided, and the Federal Circuit affirmed, <em>Ohio National Life Insurance Co. v. United States, </em>11 Cl.Ct. 477, <em>aff'd on op. below, </em>807 F.2d 1577 (1987), which squarely dealt with the issues in question in taxpayer\u2019s present suit. On April 22, 1987, Judge Wiese decided in the government\u2019s favor based on the <em>Ohio National </em>decision. The trial court stated that no \u201clegally significant distinction[s]\u201d existed between the taxpayer\u2019s suit and <em>Ohio National </em>and that the court was bound by the <em>Ohio National </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-20\">We affirm on the basis of Judge Wiese\u2019s opinion. We too perceive no significant differences between the taxpayer\u2019s suit and the facts and authority of <em>Ohio National. </em>Even if this panel wishes to deviate from the holding in <em>Ohio National, </em>which we do not, we would be unable to do so since our circuit practice does not permit one three-judge panel to overrule another three-judge panel. <em>Mother\u2019s Restaurant, Inc. v. Mama\u2019s Pizza, Inc., </em>723 F.2d 1566, 1573, 221 U.S.P.Q. 394, 400 (Fed.Cir.1983) (\u201cThe court may overrule a prior holding having precedential status only by an in bane decision.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
