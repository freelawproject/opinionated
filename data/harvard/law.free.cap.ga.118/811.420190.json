Where an execution against a principal and sureties is levied on property of the principal which, on being claimed, is found subject, if the plaintiff receives therefor, irregularly and without a judicial sale, a sum less than its value, the sureties will be entitled to be discharged from said fi. fa. to the extent of the actual value of the property. <em>Atlanta National Bank </em>v.
