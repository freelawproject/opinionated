We held in <em>Tyler v. N.J. Automobile Full Ins., </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>463, 466, 550 A.2d 168 (App.Div.1988), that UIM benefits are available if the tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurance limits are lower than the claimant\u2019s UIM insurance limits. There, the tortfeasor\u2019s vehicle was not underinsured because he carried limits of $25,000 per person injured and $50,000 per accident whereas the injured claimant\u2019s UIM limits were only $15,000 per person injured and $30,000 per accident. In <em>Filippatos v. Selective Insurance Co., </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>236, 238, 574 A.2d 1002 (App.Div.1990), the tortfeasor\u2019s vehicle was underinsured because he carried a single limit of $300,000 per accident regardless of the number of persons injured whereas the injured claimant\u2019s UIM limit was $500,000 per accident regardless of the number of persons injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">The policy limits that had to be compared in <em>Tyler </em>and in <em>Filippatos </em>matched, two double-limit policies in <em>Tyler </em>and two single-limit policies in <em>Filippatos. </em>The limits therefore could be compared without difficulty. By contrast, the policy limits in the present case do not match. The tortfeasor carried a policy having a single limit of $100,000 per accident regardless of the number of people injured whereas plaintiff, one of four people injured by the tortfeasor, had UIM coverage limited to $100,000 per person injured and $300,000 per accident. Defendant New Jersey Automobile Full Insurance Underwriting Association (defendant), plaintiff\u2019s insurer, argues that the tortfeasor\u2019s vehicle was not underinsured because his per person liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>coverage is no less than plaintiffs per person UIM coverage. The trial judge agreed and denied plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We now reverse and hold that where more than one person has been injured by a tortfeasor, his vehicle is underinsured if the tortfeasor\u2019s per accident limit is less than the claimant\u2019s UIM per accident limit, even if the per person limit is the same in both policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Plaintiff, his wife and two others were injured when a motor vehicle in which they were riding collided with a negligently operated motor vehicle. The proceeds of the tortfeasor\u2019s $100,-000 per person/per accident coverage were divided among the four injured people. Plaintiff received $16,695.78, although his damages were determined in arbitration to be $70,000. He now claims from defendant the difference, $53,304.22, under his UIM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">In comparing the limits in the two policies, we must compare the same kind of coverage provided in each. Because several people were injured by the tortfeasor, plaintiff\u2019s $300,000 per accident UIM limit must be compared with the tortfeasor\u2019s $100,000 per accident limit. The result of the comparison is that the tortfeasor\u2019s vehicle is underinsured. Had plaintiff alone been injured, then only his $100,000 per person limit would be compared with the tortfeasor\u2019s $100,000 per person limit and the tortfeasor\u2019s vehicle would not have been underinsured. Plaintiff is entitled to $100,000 UIM coverage, the per person limit under his UIM policy. That is more than enough to require defendant to pay him $53,304.22, the unpaid portion of his damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The result is fair. As this case demonstrates, the tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurer would have incurred a greater risk had its policy indemnified the tortfeasor for up to $300,000 per accident instead of only $100,000 per accident. We assume that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>the added risk would have resulted in an added premium. The tortfeasor saved that added premium by carrying only $100,000 coverage per accident. Plaintiff, on the other hand, undoubtedly paid defendant a premium for the additional $200,000 per accident UIM coverage by which his per accident limit exceeds the tortfeasor\u2019s $100,000 per accident limit. Therefore, because more than one person was injured in the accident it is fair to consider plaintiff's UIM limit to be greater than the tortfeasor\u2019s liability limit so that plaintiff can receive the benefit of all the coverage he bought.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">In denying plaintiff\u2019s motion, the trial judge was misled by the following emphasized language found in <em>Tyler:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-6\"><em>The [UIM] statute [N.J.S.A. 17:28-1.1e] produces the same result if there is one injured claimant or many, </em>or if the amount of damages exceed the tortfeasor\u2019s liability limits, or even if multiple claims against one tortfeasor are, because of his liability limits, settled for amounts which are individually less than the underinsured motorist coverage available from the claimants\u2019 policy. A tortfeasor is not underinsured relative to plaintiffs\u2019 damages, or relative to the judgment or judgments against him, but rather relative to the limits of the underinsured motorist coverage purchased by or for the person seeking recovery. <em>[Tyler, supra, </em>at 466, 550 A.2d 168. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">There the court was making the point that to determine in a particular case whether a tortfeasor\u2019s vehicle is underinsured requires comparing the limits of the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy with the limits of the claimant\u2019s UIM policy. Other facts, such as the number of people injured and the amount of their claims are generally not relevant. However, where the claimant, the tortfeasor or both have double limits, one \u201cper person\u201d and the other \u201cper accident,\u201d it becomes necessary to consider whether more than one person was injured by the tortfeasor in order to determine which of the limits to use when making the comparison.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b114-8\">We granted plaintiff leave to appeal the interlocutory order. Other issues remain to be tried.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
