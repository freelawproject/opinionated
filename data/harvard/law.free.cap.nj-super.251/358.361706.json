The State\u2019s principal evidence consisted of the testimony of a police officer who allegedly witnessed the transaction in the course of his surveillance of a \u201chigh crime\u201d area. Prior to trial, the prosecutor obtained an order barring the defense from cross-examining the officer concerning the vantage point from which he allegedly observed the sale of the drug. Under the order, defense counsel was precluded from questioning the officer concerning the height of the location, its nature and character, its direction, and the angle from which his observations were made. The only testimony allowed to be elicited at trial concerning the officer\u2019s ability to observe the incident was that he was inside an undisclosed building some 50 to 75 feet from the defendant when the sale occurred. We hold that the pretrial order deprived defendant of his sixth amendment right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">The State\u2019s chief witness at trial was Michael Mihalik, a member of the Trenton Police Department. Officer Mihalik testified that at approximately 2:00 p.m. on June 1, 1988, he embarked upon a surveillance of the corner of Stockton and Academy Streets, an area known for its drug activity. It was a \u201cclear day\u201d and Officer Mihalik had an \u201cunobstructed\u201d view of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>the area. The officer related that he had taken binoculars with him but found them unnecessary in light of his close proximity to the corner.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">During his surveillance, Officer Mihalik observed three people approach Rafael Fernandez. Fernandez referred these individuals to defendant, who was standing nearby. No arrests were made because the officer was unable to determine whether drugs were sold. At 2:40 p.m., Officer Mihalik observed a black woman, later identified as Joanne Carroll, approach Fernandez. Fernandez gestured toward defendant. Defendant then accompanied Carroll to a vacant lot across the street. Officer Mihalik saw Carroll give defendant an undetermined amount of money in exchange for a small package. The officer alerted several policemen who arrested Carroll a few blocks from the scene. A search of her clothing revealed a small quantity of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">After the alleged sale, Officer Mihalik observed defendant cross the street and hand Fernandez an undetermined amount of money. Fernandez ran into a nearby building and returned several minutes later. Both defendant and Fernandez were then apprehended. Neither drugs nor money were found on defendant. A search of Fernandez\u2019s pocket disclosed $250 in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Defendant elected to testify. He admitted that he had engaged in conversation with Fernandez, who he knew resided in the area. Defendant denied any contact with Carroll.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">It is against this factual backdrop that we consider the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">We first address questions concerning the procedure utilized by the Law Division in deciding the State\u2019s motion. Prior to trial, the State applied for an order barring the defense from questioning Officer Mihalik concerning the vantage point of his surveillance. Pursuant to <em>Evid.R. </em>8, a hearing was conducted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>in open court in the presence of defendant and his attorney. Officer Mihalik testified under oath that he observed the drug transaction from a distance of 50 to 75 feet. However, the officer refused to disclose which side of the street he was on, the level or height of the location, its direction, whether it was a private residence, a business, or an abandoned building, and the angle from which his observations were made. The officer testified that disclosure of the location could possibly result in reprisals. He also recounted that the police continued to use the location for drug surveillance purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The court then conducted an <em>in camera </em>hearing from which both defendant and his attorney were excluded. We need not recount in detail what occurred at the hearing. It is enough to say that the exact location of the officer\u2019s vantage point was described at length. In addition, the witness repeated his concern that disclosure of the location might result in reprisals and would impair future investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">After the <em>in camera </em>hearing, the proceedings continued in open court. Following the arguments of counsel, the trial court entered the order barring the defense from cross-examining Officer Mihalik concerning the location from which he allegedly observed the drug transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">We reject defendant\u2019s argument that he was denied his sixth amendment right of confrontation when he and his attorney were excluded from the <em>in camera </em>hearing. In the context of the limited nature of the hearing and the societal interests sought to be vindicated, the exclusion of the defense did no real violence to the constitutional values underlying the confrontation clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">Of course, we recognize that a defendant has a fundamental right to be present at every critical stage of a trial. <em>See, e.g., State v. Trent, </em>157 <em>N.J.Super. </em>231, 241, 384 <em>A.2d </em>888 (App.Div.1978), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>251, 398 A.2d 1271 (1979); <em>R. </em>3:16. Though confrontation means more than being allowed to confront the witness physically, the opportuni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>ty to meet the accuser \u201cface to face\u201d before the trier of fact forms the core of the values upon which the confrontation clause rests. <em>See Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 <em>U.S. </em>56, 63, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>2531, 2537, 65 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>597, 606 (1980); <em>Mattox v. United States, </em>156 <em>U.S. </em>237, 242, 15 <em>S.Ct. </em>337, 242, 39 <em>L.Ed. </em>409, 410-11 (1895). Physical presence of the defendant enhances the reliability of the fact-finding process and promotes society\u2019s interest in \u201chaving the accused and the accuser engage in open and even contest in a public trial.\u201d <em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 <em>U.S. </em>530, 540, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2056, 2062, 90 L.Ed.2d 514, 525 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\"> This much conceded, the right of confrontation is not absolute. The right of the accused to be present must be anchored to the reason for its existence. The right to meet one\u2019s accuser face to face is not guaranteed \u201cwhen presence would be useless, or the benefit but a shadow.\u201d <em>Snyder v. Massachusetts, </em>291 <em>U.S. </em>97, 106-07, 54 <em>S.Ct. </em>330, 332-33, 78 <em>L.Ed. </em>674, 678 (1934). The right of confrontation and due process require that a defendant be allowed to be present to the extent that a fair and impartial hearing would be impaired in his absence. <em>Id. </em>at 108, 54 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 333, 78 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 679. It has thus been said that \u201ca defendant is guaranteed the right to be present at any stage of the criminal proceeding that is critical to its outcome if his presence would contribute to the fairness of the procedure.\u201d <em>Kentucky v. Stincer, </em>482 <em>U.S. </em>730, 745, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>2658, 2667, 96 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>631, 647 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Within this analytical framework, we must look to the nature of the hearing to determine whether a defendant has the right to be present. The object of the hearing in this case was to determine whether Officer Mihalik\u2019s surveillance point was to be accorded confidentiality. In <em>State v. Williams, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>620, 571 <em>A.</em>2d 1358 (App.Div.1990) and <em>State v. Crudup, </em>176 <em>N.J.Super. </em>215, 422 A.2d 790 (App.Div.1980), we analogized the issue of the confidentiality of a surveillance site to the well known \u201cinformant\u2019s privilege.\u201d We said that the purpose of both privileges \u201cis to further the public interest in effective law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>enforcement.\u201d <em>State v. Williams, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 627, 571 A.2d 1358. By preserving the confidentiality of a surveillance point, innocent persons are protected against reprisals, and ongoing and future investigations are free to take their course. <em>Ibid. </em>However, these law enforcement interests must be balanced against the defendant\u2019s right to contest the State\u2019s charges. <em>Id. </em>at 631, 571 A.2d 1358. We explained that a defendant seeking to learn the location of a police surveillance post should ordinarily show that he or she needs the evidence to conduct his or her defense and that there are no adequate alternative means of \u201cgetting at the same point.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The degree of handicap established by the defendant must then be weighed by the trial court against the policies underlying the privilege. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">In <em>Crudup, </em>we held that a hearing should be conducted to ensure a proper weighing of the appropriate factors. At the hearing, the trial judge must seek to accommodate the competing interests of the defendant and the State. 176 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 220, 422 A.2d 790. Specifically,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">[T]he trial judge must determine the importance of disclosure in the particular case to counsel\u2019s ability to conduct an effective cross-examination on the witness\u2019 ability to perceive. The necessity for disclosure must then be weighed against the consequences of revealing the vantage point____ If the vantage point is in a private home or a place of business, real potential for reprisal against the owner may weigh against disclosure. If maintenance of secrecy is necessary to protect ongoing investigations, this must be considered; if the site is no longer used or useful, other considerations could control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">\n<em>Ibid.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">We conclude that defendant\u2019s constitutional rights were not violated by his exclusion from the hearing. The purpose of the hearing was to apprise the court of the location from which the surveillance took place and to identify the law enforcement interests that allegedly required protection. Although the hearing pertained to an evidentiary issue\u2014the metes and bounds of defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination\u2014the information provided was wholly unrelated to the factual questions to be decided at trial. Whether or not disclosure of the surveillance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>site might imperil innocent citizens or future investigations was a subject entirely foreign to the question of defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. Defendant had no interest in learning of the reasons for the prosecutor\u2019s concern that disclosure would endanger the public and compromise future investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">In our view, a defendant\u2019s interests are adequately protected by requiring that a transcript of the hearing be made and kept under seal for appellate review. Questions concerning law enforcement\u2019s need for confidentiality are thereby preserved for the appellate court\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Our decision in <em>State v. Ogburne, </em>235 <em>N.J.Super. </em>113, 561 A.2d 667 (App.Div.1989) is clearly distinguishable. There, we held that a defendant may not be excluded from an <em>in camera </em>hearing conducted under the Rape Shield Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-7, to determine the admissibility of evidence of any previous sexual conduct of the alleged victim. <em>Id. </em>at 115-16, 561 A.2d 667. A rape victim's sexual history is not confidential information necessary for effective law enforcement. Disclosure of such information has little or no tendency to impair law enforcement objectives. As we have emphasized, the object of the <em>in camera </em>hearing in this case was to determine whether a realistic possibility existed that innocent persons would be threatened or future investigations imperiled if disclosure were required.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">We stress the limited contours of our holding. We are concerned here only with that part of a pretrial hearing in which the State presents evidence concerning the need for confidentiality, and where the court must determine whether there are legitimate law enforcement interests that require protection. We hold that defendant has no constitutional right to be present when this evidence is developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">We nevertheless find that the trial court mistakenly exercised its discretion by unduly restricting the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>right of cross-examination. We see no need to divulge what occurred at the <em>in camera </em>hearing. The State presented considerable evidence that future investigations might be compromised by disclosure of the surveillance point. The State\u2019s evidence concerning the possibility of reprisals was far less plausible. The question, therefore, is whether defendant\u2019s need for the information outweighed these concerns. The tension between these competing interests must be assessed against the backdrop of the constitutional values involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The sixth amendment to the Federal Constitution guarantees the right of an accused in a criminal prosecution \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d Our State Constitution is similarly worded and provides parallel protection. <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. I, para. 10. As we noted previously, confrontation means more than being allowed to confront the witnesses physically. <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 <em>U.S. </em>308, 315, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>1105, 1109, 39 L.Ed.2d 347, 353 (1974). The primary interest secured by the constitutional protection is the right of cross-examination. <em>Douglas v. Alabama, </em>380 <em>U.S. </em>415, 418, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>1074, 1076, 13 L.Ed.2d 934, 937 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">We have long recognized that cross-examination is the primary means by which the credibility of a witness and the truth of his testimony are tested. <em>State v. Crudup, </em>176 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 221, 422 A.2d 790; <em>State v. Hare, </em>139 <em>N.J.Super. </em>150, 153-56, 353 A.2d 109 (App.Div.1976), <em>certif. denied, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>525, 361 A.2d 539 (1976). The cross-examiner \u201cis not only permitted to delve into the witness\u2019s story to test [his] perception and memory, but [also] allowed to impeach, <em>i.e., </em>discredit the witness.\u201d <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 <em>U.S. </em>at 316, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1110, 39 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 353. No matter that the likelihood of defendant\u2019s contention \u201cmight be slim.\u201d <em>State v. Crudup, </em>176 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 221, 422 A.2d 790. The point to be stressed is that under our system, a defendant is entitled to fully test the State\u2019s proofs by challenging a witness\u2019s perceptions and his ability to make observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>We have previously identified the interests sought to be protected by the informant\u2019s privilege. These include the protection of innocent individuals from reprisals and the safeguarding of ongoing or future investigations. We have also noted these interests underlie the principles we have developed in preserving the confidentiality of surveillance points. As with the informer, the efficacy of these interests could be seriously impaired by disclosing the location of a police stakeout site. Revelation of the precise location of the site could render future use valueless and expose the owner to reprisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">However, the equation of the two privileges is imperfect. The purpose of the informant\u2019s privilege is to protect the informant\u2019s anonymity. The question is generally presented in the context of a motion to suppress evidence, where the accused seeks to avoid the truth and escape the inculpatory thrust of evidence in hand. <em>State v. Burnett, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>377, 386, 201 A.2d 39 (1964). In contrast, we are dealing here with the trial of the criminal charge itself. The goal of obtaining a truthful verdict outweighs other competing interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Moreover, the site of a surveillance, unlike the identity of an informant, is generally not a peripheral issue. Where the question is one of identification or, as here, the ability of a witness to perceive that which he testifies that he observed, it is the only issue in the case. In this context, we note that the informant\u2019s privilege is inapplicable where the informer is an \u201cessential witness on a basic issue ..., where the informer is an active participant in the crime for which defendant is prosecuted, ... where a defense of entrapment seems reasonably plausible, ... or where disclosure is mandated by fundamental principles of fairness to the accused.\u201d <em>State v. Milligan, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>373, 383-84, 365 A.2d 914 (1976). These instances rarely arise. However, visual observations made from a surveillance site often constitute the entirety of the State\u2019s proofs. The defendant\u2019s need to discredit such evidence is more apparent and the handicap resulting from non-disclosure and preclusion of cross-examination more disabling.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>These considerations militate against application of the surveillance site privilege in a case such as this, where the State\u2019s principal evidence consists of the observations of a police officer. We recognize that the privilege has been widely-accepted in other jurisdictions. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Harley, </em>682 F.2d 1018 (D.C.Cir.1982); <em>Jenkins v. United States, </em>541 A.2d 1269 (D.C.1988); <em>Thompson v. United States, </em>472 A.2d 899 (D.C.1984); <em>Hicks v. United States, </em>431 A.2d 18 (D.C.1981). We also acknowledge decisions holding that in order to overcome the privilege the defendant must show there was some \u201cvantage point in the relevant area that would not permit a clear view\u201d of the criminal conduct alleged. <em>See Jenkins v. United States, </em>541 A.2d at 1272; <em>Thompson v. United States, </em>472 A.2d at 901. We are nevertheless of the view that a less particularized showing of need may overcome the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">This is not a case in which disclosure of the surveillance point \u201cwould be only of peripheral assistance\u201d to the defendant. <em>State v. Williams, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 634, 571 A.2d 1358. Officer Mihalik\u2019s testimony was crucial to the State\u2019s case and not merely corroborative. <em>See Commonwealth v. Lugo, </em>406 <em>Mass. </em>565, 572, 548 <em>N.E.2d </em>1263, 1267 (1990). A penetrating cross-examination was the only means available to the defense to contest the charges. Defendant was denied that right and opportunity. The trial court prohibited all inquiry into Officer Mihalik\u2019s ability to perceive and make observations, the only real factual issue in the case. <em>See Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>673, 679, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1431, 1437, 89 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>674, 683 (1986). A reasonable jury might have received a significantly different impression of the police officer\u2019s credibility had defense counsel been permitted to pursue his proposed line of cross-examination. A reversal is therefore mandated.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Because a retrial is necessary, we briefly address the claim that Officer Mihalik\u2019s destruction of his notes impaired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>defendant\u2019s ability to defend. We find no merit in this contention. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2). The notes were only tangentially relevant to the factual issues, in the case. While it would have been preferable had the court made specific findings concerning whether the officer\u2019s failure to preserve the notes was in \u201cbad faith,\u201d <em>see Arizona v. Youngblood, </em>488 <em>U.S. </em>51, 58, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>333, 337, 102 L.Ed.2d 281, 289 (1988), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>488 <em>U.S. </em>1051, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>885, 102 L.Ed.2d 1007 (1989), we discern no undue prejudice to the defendant\u2019s rights. The court instructed the jury that if it found Officer Mihalik destroyed his notes at a time when he knew the case was proceeding to trial, it could infer that the notes contained information inconsistent with the witness\u2019s trial testimony. The court\u2019s charge obviated any potential for prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The judgment of conviction is reversed and the matter is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
