He had a history of chronic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>paranoid schizophrenia which required hospitalization in psychiatric facilities for most of the years between 1980 and his death in August 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">On July 24, 1986, defendant Zimmerman requested admission. He had had in excess of 60 admissions to BPCH for problems related to chronic undifferentiated schizophrenia and substance abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">At about 3:00 p.m. on August 9, 1986, Gianni was physically attacked by Zimmerman in the television room of the B-Ground (B-G) unit of BPCH. As a result of this attack by Zimmerman and the beating sustained by Gianni, Gianni lapsed into a coma and died 10 days later at the Hackensack Medical Center. The B-G unit is an acute psychiatric unit, reserved for patients whose conditions require monitoring to prevent injury to themselves or others. As such, it is considered a \u201clocked unit.\u201d Although the patients are permitted to roam free and intermingle in the television room which is a section of the locked unit, the nature of the B-G unit as a locked unit prevents the patients from leaving the hospital of their own free will, notwithstanding the voluntary admission. In addition, according to the record, a voluntarily admitted patient at BPCH psychiatric unit is required to give 72 hours notice before discharge. See the then applicable statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-48 (now repealed).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Not only did Gianni\u2019s illness warrant placement in a locked unit, more restrictive methods of restraint were sometimes employed in his case. Upon occasion, he was physically restricted to a geri-chair. On other occasions he had to be placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>in a \u201cseclusion room,\u201d which is a separate room where the patient is placed \u201cfor the patient\u2019s own protection and for the protection of the other patients.\u201d On the morning of his death, decedent was placed in a seclusion room at 8:30 a.m., and was released into the television or day room at 10:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">The complaint filed by the plaintiffs as representative of decedent\u2019s estate and on behalf of the individual plaintiffs, alleges negligence by all or some of the defendants charged with the care and treatment of the decedent as well as the care and treatment of Zimmerman. A claim was asserted against Zimmerman for intentional tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">For the purpose of the summary judgment motion only, the defendants assumed that a prima facie case of negligence was stated. However, they rely on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-7(b) and <em>Popek v. Dept. of Human Services, </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>128, 572 <em>A.</em>2d 1160 (App.Div.1990), as conferring immunity upon the public entity and its employees. The trial judge construed <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-7(b) as being limited solely to situations involving injury by an involuntarily confined patient inflicted on another involuntarily confined patient. On this basis, the motion judge distinguished <em>Popek </em>which had involved involuntarily confined attackers, and presumably an involuntarily confined victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-7 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\">Neither a public entity nor a public employee is liable for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-8\">a. an injury caused by an escaping or escaped person who has been confined for mental illness or drug dependence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-9\">b. an injury caused by any person who has been confined for mental illness or drug dependence upon any other person so confined.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">Plaintiffs take the position that the Task Force Comment (comments) to the quoted statutory section indicates a legislative intent to place voluntary patients outside the scope of any and all immunities found in the Tort Claims Act. The comment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-7 states simply: \u201cThis provision is prompted by reasoning similar to that contained in the comment to section 59:5-2 of this act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Generally, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-1 deals with the immunity of public entities. Subsection (b) states: \u201cAny liability of a public entity established by this act is subject to any immunity of the public entity and is subject to any defenses that would be available to the public entity if it were a private person.\u201d The comment to subsection (b) of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-1 recites:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">Subsection (b) is intended to insure that any immunity provisions provided in the act or by common law will prevail over the liability provisions. It is anticipated that the courts will realistically interpret both the statutory and common law immunities in order to effectuate their intended scope.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The clear intent of the statute is \u201cto insure that any immunity provisions provided in the act or by common law will prevail over the liability provisions....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Defendants contend that the provisions of the Tort Claims Act should be interpreted in a common sense manner, and that absent a clear indication of a legislative intent to create a distinction between voluntarily and involuntarily admitted patients, the immunity provisions should prevail. See <em>Ross v. Moore, </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 6, 533 A.2d 398 (App.Div.1987). Although plaintiffs rely on <em>Doe v. Youth and Family Services Division, </em>178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>499, 429 A.2d 596 (App.Div.1981); rev\u2019d on dissenting opinion, 89 <em>N.J. </em>284, 445 A.2d 1148 (1982), we do not find that case dispositive here. That case dealt with the inapplicability of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:5-1 to 59:5-5, which is limited to prisoners and to injuries inflicted by prisoners on either other prisoners or other persons, to a juvenile in need of supervision (JINS). In any event, those provisions, although held inapplicable to a JINS, are not limited solely to prisoner-to-prisoner injuries <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>59:5-2b(4)), but include injuries to non-prisoners. The Tort Claims Act immunity applies to public entities and public employees for injuries caused by prisoners, escapees, or persons resisting arrest. See <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:5-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">The California statute, which was essentially the model upon which the New Jersey statute was based, differs in language from the New Jersey statute. The California Tort Claims Act provides \u201c... a public entity is not liable for: (1) An injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>proximately caused by a patient of a mental institution. (2) An injury to an inpatient of a mental institution.\u201d Cal.Govt.Code \u00a7 854.8(a)(1)-(2) (West 1980); see also Report of Attorney General\u2019s Task Force on Sovereign Immunity (1972), New Jersey Tort Claims Act at 115-116 (\u201ca public entity is immune for any injury caused by a patient to an inpatient of a mental institution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">A clear indication of the scope of immunity conferred by the California Tort Claims Act in this context is set forth at Cal.Govt.Code \u00a7 854.5, which states, \u201cAs used in this chapter, confine includes admit, commit, place, detain or hold in custody.\u201d In interpreting this provision, the California Court of Appeal determined that the substitution of the term confined for committed indicated a desire to expand the scope of immunity to include persons voluntarily admitted to state facilities. <em>L.A. County-U.S.C. Medical Center v. Superior Court, </em>155 Cal.App.3d 454, 460, 202 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>222, 225 (Cal.App.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Although the term \u201cconfined\u201d is not defined in the New Jersey Tort Claims Act, we are satisfied that the more sensible interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6\u20147(b) does not require a distinction between voluntary and involuntary patients, and that the principles in <em>Popek v. State Dept. of Human Services, supra, </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>128, 572 <em>A.</em>2d 1160,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> apply. In our view the purpose of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-7(b) was to confer immunity upon governmental entities and employees for injuries to all patients physically confined which were inflicted by other patients so confined, regardless of whether they were voluntarily or involuntarily committed to the institution. For that reason, although the plaintiffs\u2019 decedent initially voluntarily entered BPCH, at the time the beating occurred, he was in a locked unit and was not free to leave at any time of his own will under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>then applicable statute <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-48),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the policies and procedures of BPCH. Thus, for purposes of the New Jersey Tort Claims Act, he was \u201cconfined\u201d and the public entity defendants-appellants had statutory immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">We reverse the order denying summary judgment and remand to the trial court for the entry of orders dismissing the complaint against the defendants-appellants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b535-9\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-48 was the provision governing discharge of voluntary patients, upon notice, in effect at the time the incident occurred. This provision was repealed by <em>L. </em>1987, c. 116, effective June 7, 1989, and replaced by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.20 as to voluntary admissions. It reduced the maximum period to delay discharge from 72 hours to \"48 hours or the end of the next working day from the time of the request, whichever is longer,\u201d unless it is determined \u201cthat the patient needs involuntary commitment\u201d and a court order is obtained under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b538-6\">It is not clear whether the victim in <em>Popek </em>had been initially voluntarily or involuntarily committed. As far as we can determine the pleadings merely referred to \"committed.\" <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-1 does not contain a relevant definition. Perhaps that is an appropriate subject for legislative consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b539-13\">See note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
