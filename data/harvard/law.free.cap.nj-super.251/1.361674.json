Plaintiffs appeal from an order entered by the Law Division awarding defendant $500 expert fees and $750 legal fees for a total of $1,250 pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(c)(3) and (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-12\">Plaintiffs filed an action in the Law Division for damages sustained as a result of an automobile collision with defendant on August 30, 1985. Thereafter, pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:21A, the matter was scheduled for arbitration and, after a hearing, an award was made in favor of plaintiff Ramez in the amount of $6,000. Plaintiffs rejected the arbitrator\u2019s award and requested a trial <em>de novo. </em>The matter was tried to a jury, which returned a verdict of no cause of action in favor of defendant and against plaintiff. Pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(c), the trial judge granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>defendant\u2019s motion for $500 expert fees and $750<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-34 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\">The party having filed for a trial de novo shall be assessed court costs and other reasonable costs of the other party to the judicial proceeding, including attorney\u2019s fees, investigation expenses and expenses for expert or other testimony or evidence, <em>which amount shall be, </em>if the party assessed the costs is the one to whom the award is made, <em>offset against any damages awarded to that party by the court, and only to that extent; </em>except that if the judgment is more favorable to the party having filed for a trial de novo, the court may reduce or eliminate the amount of the assessment in accordance with the extent to which the decision of the court is more favorable to that party than the arbitration decision, and as best serves the interest of justice. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">It is clear from the statute that attorney\u2019s fees and expenses for an expert \u201cshall be ... offset against any damages awarded to that party by the court, and only to that extent.\u201d In other words, if no award is made, then no attorney\u2019s fees and expert\u2019s costs may be assessed against that party on a trial <em>de novo. </em>This intent is confirmed by the Assembly introductory statement to the act providing for arbitration of certain automobile accident claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-9\">... the party asking for a trial <em>de novo </em>shall pay the arbitrators\u2019 fees. That party shall also be assessed court costs and the reasonable costs of the trial to the other parties, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, <em>not to exceed the amount of damages awarded that party, </em>if that party is the one to which the award is made; the court may reduce or eliminate the assessment to the extent that the court decision is more favorable to the filing party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">Introductory statement to Assembly, No. 3822, <em>reprinted in Helstoski v. Hyckey, </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>142, 148, 541 A.2d 1114 (App.Div.1988) (emphasis supplied). The automobile arbitration statute was implemented by the Supreme Court under <em>R. </em>4:21A. <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>(c) Trial De Novo. An action in which a trial de novo has been demanded by any party shall be returned, as to all parties, to the trial calendar for disposition. A party demanding a trial de novo shall be required to pay $150 towards the arbitrator\u2019s fee and may be liable to pay the reasonable costs, including attorney\u2019s fees, incurred after rejection of the award by those parties not demanding a trial de novo. Seasonable costs shall be awarded on motion supported by detailed certification subject to the following limitations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">(1) If a monetary award has been rejected, no costs shall be awarded if the party demanding the trial de novo has obtained a verdict at least 20 percent more favorable than the award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">(2) If the rejected arbitration award denied money damages, no costs shall be awarded if the party demanding the trial de novo has obtained a verdict of at least $250.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-8\">(3) The award of attorney\u2019s fees shall not exceed $750 in total nor $250 per day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-9\">(4) Compensation for witness costs, including expert witnesses, shall not exceed $500.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">It is thus apparent that the rule, consistent with the statute, is designed to award reasonable costs and counsel fees only out of the amount of the award. Here, there was no verdict in favor of plaintiffs. Therefore, there was no fund out of which an award may have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b49-11\">We note that trial consumed only two days but defense counsel requested and was granted attorney\u2019s fees for an additional day of preparation. Since the issue of the amount of fees is not before us by virtue of our decision, we do not address the propriety of an award for attorney\u2019s fees related to trial preparation but leave it for another day when properly before the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
