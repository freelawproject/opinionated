The child was conceived and born in 1978 during her mother\u2019s marriage to defendant, D.K. D.K. and the child\u2019s mother divorced in 1981. The mother died in 1985 and shortly thereafter plaintiff commenced an action for a judgment establishing his paternity of Z.K. and for custody. That action resulted in a December, 1987 consent judgment awarding custody to D.K., but acknowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>edging plaintiff to be the child\u2019s biological father. Plaintiff\u2019s visitation rights were to be resolved by the parties after consultation with and recommendation from a court appointed psychologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">In May, 1988, plaintiff filed a motion seeking an order for visitation. The order, entered January 28, 1989, afforded plaintiff a Saturday or Sunday visit once every two months. In August, 1989, plaintiff filed a motion for increased visitation which was denied by an order dated February 1, 1990. Thereafter, the court entered the order from which plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\"><em>R. </em>4:42-9(a)(1) authorizes an allowance of counsel fees in a family action. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">(1) <em>In a family action, </em>the court in its discretion may make an allowance both pendente lite and on final determination to be paid by any party to the action, including if deemed to be just any party successful in the action, on any claim for divorce, nullity, support, alimony, custody, visitation, equitable distribution, separate maintenance and enforcement of interspousal agreements relating to family type matters. Any pendente lite allowance may include a fee based upon an analysis of prospective services to be performed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Plaintiff contends that the present case is not a \u201cfamily action\u201d within the rule\u2019s meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">We observe that the adjective \u201cfamily\u201d is used in a generic sense as a shorthand for the specific actions enumerated in the rule. They include actions for custody and visitation and, therefore, the present case qualifies under the rule as to type of action. Reduced to its essence, plaintiff\u2019s contention is that this case is not a family action because he and defendant were not married to each other and are not otherwise related. We reject this contention as we did in <em>Olen v. Melia, </em>141 <em>N.J.Super. </em>111, 357 A.2d 310 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>518, 366 A.2d 673 (1976) and <em>Coor v. Coor, </em>124 <em>N.J.Super. </em>341, 307 A.2d 104 (App.Div.1973). <em>Olen </em>involved an equitable distribution dispute. Defendant wife died and the controversy continued between plaintiff husband and the deceased wife\u2019s children by another marriage. We upheld an award of counsel fees in favor of the wife\u2019s heirs. In <em>Coor, </em>we affirmed an award of counsel fees imposed on the correspondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>Moreover, plaintiff and defendant share a family relationship with the child, Z.K., plaintiff as the biological father and defendant as custodial step-parent. It is the litigants\u2019 family relationship with Z.K. and her best interests that was the core of this litigation. <em>See R. </em>5:1-2(a) describing actions cognizable in the Family Part of the Chancery Division as \u201c[a]ll civil actions in which the principal claim is unique to and arises out of a family or family-type relationship.\u201d The absence of a matrimonial relationship did not preclude a counsel fee award in <em>Vasquez v. Bolduc, </em>212 <em>N.J.Super. </em>455, 515 A.2d 500 (App.Div.1985), a support dispute between parents who had never been married to each other. <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>9:17-54 authorizing counsel fees in an action under the <em>New Jersey Parentage Act, N.J.S.A. </em>9:17-38 to 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The cases relied upon by plaintiff are inapposite. <em>Crowe v. DeGioia, </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>22, 495 A.2d 889 (App.Div.1985), <em>aff'd. o.b., </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>50, 505 A.2d 591 (1986), was a contract action, a so-called palimony suit. In <em>Anzalone v. Anzalone Brothers, Inc., </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>481, 449 A.2d 1310 (App.Div.1982), a matrimonial action, we ruled that counsel fees could not be imposed on a corporate defendant though properly joined for the purpose of setting aside an alleged fraudulent conveyance of property. <em>Youth and Fam. Serv. Div. v. J.O., </em>178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>74, 427 A.2d 1150 (Cty.Ct.1980) involved an action by a stranger to the family relationship, a State agency, for custody and termination of parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">We conclude, therefore, that this case is a family action within the meaning of <em>R. </em>4:42-9(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\"> Plaintiff also contends that the trial court erred in failing to make findings, and plaintiff invites us to exercise our original jurisdiction \u201cand reverse the order below.\u201d The award of counsel fees in a family action rests in the court\u2019s discretion. <em>Williams v. Williams, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>229, 233, 281 A.2d 273 (1971). The principal factors to be considered in exercising that discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>tion are the applicant\u2019s need, the other party\u2019s ability to pay, and the applicant\u2019s good faith in defending the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\"> We have no doubt of defendant\u2019s good faith in defending plaintiff\u2019s August 1989 motion for increased visitation, filed only eight months after the January, 1989 order establishing a visitation schedule. Defendant filed his New York, New Jersey and United States income tax returns with his case information statement in support of his application for fees. He also filed his affidavit. Those uncontested documents established that the custody litigation initiated by plaintiff placed a heavy financial burden on defendant. As a result, defendant refinanced his residence, more than doubling his mortgage indebtedness. He has no capital assets other than his residence and one automobile. Defendant, a physician, is employed by the City of New York and also maintains a private practice. However, his income tax returns and case information statement reflected a disposable income of approximately $67,000. In his affidavit defendant stated that he has no savings and must resort to home equity financing to pay his current liabilities. Thus, the uncontroverted record established defendant\u2019s need.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">In contrast, plaintiff provided no financial information. Plaintiff is a physician. In his affidavit he took the position that each party should bear his own counsel fees and one-half of the guardian ad litem\u2019s fee because \u201cwe are both medical doctors and both capable of paying our individual costs and expenses.\u201d The financial information defendant submitted belies this statement. As previously indicated, the record establishes defendant\u2019s financial need. However, the record is silent regarding plaintiff\u2019s income, assets and liabilities. In light of plaintiff\u2019s decision not to submit highly relevant financial information to the trial court, his greater ability to underwrite the litigation expenses may be inferred.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Scanlon v. General </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number><em>Motors Corp., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>582, 598-99 n. 7, 326 A.2d 673 (1974) (plaintiffs failure to produce allegedly defective product supports an inference adverse to plaintiff as to existence of any defect); <em>State v. The Council, Div. of Resource Dev., </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>199, 202, 287 A.2d 713 (1972) (\u201cbehavior of a litigant with respect to relevant evidence may permit an inference that his behavior was prompted by a conscious appreciation that the evidence would or might be hurtful to his position\u201d); <em>Inter-chemical Corp. v. Uncas Printing &amp; Fin. Co., Inc., </em>39 <em>N.J.Super. </em>318, 328, 120 A.2d 880 (App.Div.1956) (defendant\u2019s suppression of evidence in its possession supports inference that it would be beneficial to plaintiff in action for damages for failure to pay royalties).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Although we agree that the trial court should have articulated specific findings and conclusions, we are not inclined to remand for that purpose. The record established, beyond question, defendant\u2019s good faith and need. The only other element necessary to dispose of defendant\u2019s counsel fee application was plaintiff\u2019s financial condition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiff, having chosen not to provide that information to the court despite its compelling relevance and importance, cannot now be heard to complain about the absence of a finding below. The counsel fee allowance is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">For the reasons expressed above, we perceive no abuse of discretion in the allocation of the guardian <em>ad </em>litem\u2019s fee, <em>R. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>5:8B(d), and the mental health professional\u2019s fee, <em>R. </em>5:3-3(a), to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b610-7\">At oral argument, in response to a question by this court, plaintiffs attorney stated that plaintiffs income was between $125,000 and $150,000 annually. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Although the attorney had no knowledge of plaintiff\u2019s income beyond what plaintiff told him, even this concession places his income at twice defendant\u2019s. We have no information regarding plaintiffs assets.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b611-9\">Plaintiff does not challenge the reasonableness of defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s charges. Nevertheless, we accept plaintiffs invitation to exercise our original jurisdiction, <em>R. </em>2:10-5, and conclude that the charges are reasonable and that the services were necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
