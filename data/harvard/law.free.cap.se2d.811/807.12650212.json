After a hearing, the circuit court granted Respondents' motion for summary judgment. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand to the circuit court.</p><p id=\"p-9\"><strong>I.</strong></p><p id=\"p-10\">Like the circuit court, we are required to view the record in the light most favorable to Mims, construing all ambiguities and inferences in his favor.</p><p id=\"p-11\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"2\" data-label=\"393\" href=\"#p393\" id=\"p393\">**393</a><em>Simmons v. Berkeley Elec. Coop., Inc.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12278722\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/419/223/#p228\">419 S.C. 223</extracted-citation>, 228, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12278722\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/419/223/#p228\">797 S.E.2d 387</extracted-citation>, 390 (2016). In light of this standard, the facts presented at summary judgment are as follows:</p><p id=\"p-12\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"810\" href=\"#p810\" id=\"p810\">*810</a>Mims was born prematurely and, as a result, suffered both physical and mental disabilities. At age twenty-one, an evaluation found him to have the cognitive ability of a twenty-month-old child. During the first twenty-seven years of his life, Mims lived with and was cared for by his mother, Margaret Mims. In 1999, Ms. Mims fell ill, and Mims was voluntarily committed to full-time DDSN care in a residential facility known as \"Clusters.\" While at Clusters, Mims experienced several ailments, including bruises on his groin, vomiting, and a twenty-eight pound weight loss. In 2000, Mims was beaten by a Clusters employee. Several months after the beating, Ms. Mims requested Mims be returned to her care. In response, DDSN petitioned the probate court to have Mims committed to the residential facility. After a hearing, the probate court judicially admitted Mims to DDSN's care, concluding he was profoundly mentally retarded with complex medical needs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After the Clusters employee was arrested and charged with assault and battery as a result of beating Mims, Ms. Mims wrote a letter to DDSN again requesting he be returned to her care.</p><p id=\"p-13\">In response, Ms. Mims received a letter from DDSN's Director of Government and Community Relations that stated:</p><p id=\"p-15\">In January 2002, Mims was repeatedly hit by another resident with a belt. The State Long Term Care Ombudsman reviewed the incident and concluded that:</p><p id=\"p-16\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"2\" data-label=\"394\" href=\"#p394\" id=\"p394\">**394</a>It is substantiated that resident-to-resident abuse occurred. The [Omnibus Adult Protection Act] states that physical abuse does not include altercations or acts of assault between vulnerable adults. However, the incident should have been reported to the Ombudsman because of its serious nature. Although the Ombudsman Program does not have the statutory authority to investigate resident-to-resident abuse, it would investigate to determine if adequate supervision was provided. Lack of Supervision was also substantiated based on the above findings.</p><p id=\"p-17\">In March 2002, Mims was transferred from Clusters to another residential facility under contract with DDSN called \"Kensington.\" In 2003, the Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) investigated Clusters and found the facility failed to consistently provide the staffing or training necessary to protect residents.</p><p id=\"p-18\">Between 2002 and 2004, Mims was treated for a swollen and bruised hand, elevated blood pressure, suspected pain, and an incident where he was discovered to have a large number of ant bites.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In late 2004, one of Mims' co-residents died after choking on insufficiently pureed food, precipitating another investigation by CMS. In April 2005, CMS terminated Kensington's certification. As a result, some of Kensington's residents were relocated to other facilities; however, DDSN did not relocate Mims.</p><p id=\"p-19\">A month later, on May 27, 2005, Mims presented to the emergency room with a four centimeter laceration to the undersurface of his penis. Although the emergency-room doctor's notes described the injury as a \"[s]uperficial <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"811\" href=\"#p811\" id=\"p811\">*811</a>laceration to penis,\" the laceration was repaired with seven sutures. An internal investigation of the injury concluded \"the origin remains <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"2\" data-label=\"395\" href=\"#p395\" id=\"p395\">**395</a>unexplained.\" Upon learning of the injury, Ms. Mims initiated proceedings to become Mims' guardian.</p><p id=\"p-20\">An emergency hearing was held on Ms. Mims' petition for guardianship. Based on evidence presented indicating Kensington was decertified in April 2005 and Mims sustained a \"serious unexplained injury\" on May 27, 2005, the probate court appointed Ms. Mims as her son's guardian and custodian.</p><p id=\"p-21\">On May 29, 2007, Ms. Mims filed a complaint on Mims' behalf, suing DDSN for various torts and statutory violations. However, that complaint was never served. On May 7, 2008, Mims filed an amended complaint, adding Respondents Lacy and Butkus to the lawsuit and pleading the current allegations. The amended complaint was served on May 12, 2008.</p><p id=\"p-22\">Respondents filed a motion to dismiss for untimely service, which was originally denied but then granted after a hearing on the motion to reconsider. <em>Mims ex rel. Mims v. Babcock Ctr., Inc.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3881871\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/399/341/#p343\">399 S.C. 341</extracted-citation>, 343-44, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3881871\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/399/341/#p343\">732 S.E.2d 395</extracted-citation>, 396 (2012). Mims appealed the dismissal, and the South Carolina Supreme Court found the amended complaint was timely served. <em>Id</em> . (holding Rule 15(a), SCRCP, allows for filing and service of an amended complaint without leave of court, even if the original complaint was not served).</p><p id=\"p-23\">The case was remanded, and Respondents moved for summary judgment. After a hearing, the circuit court granted summary judgment, finding: (1) Mims' lawsuit was limited in scope to potential liability for three incidents of personal injury: the 2000 beating by a Clusters employee, the 2004 \"ant-bite incident,\" and the 2005 penis injury; (2) the majority of Mims' causes of actions were time-barred; and (3) the remaining causes of action either failed as a matter of law because they were insufficiently pled or because Mims failed to satisfy his summary judgment burden.</p><p id=\"p-24\"><strong>II.</strong></p><p id=\"p-25\">The circuit court ruled the statute of limitations barred most of Mims' claims, including: (1) the \u00a7 1983 claims that arose before May 12, 2005, and (2) the state tort claims that arose before May 12, 2006. In so ruling, the circuit court found Mims' lawsuit commenced on May 12, 2008, the day his <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"2\" data-label=\"396\" href=\"#p396\" id=\"p396\">**396</a>amended complaint was served. The circuit court additionally found Mims was not entitled to disability tolling under section 15-3-40 of the South Carolina Code (2005) because he was not \"insane\" for purposes of the statute when his causes of action accrued and, alternatively, even if he was \"insane,\" his disability ceased when Ms. Mims was appointed his guardian. We reverse.</p><p id=\"p-26\">Initially, we find Mims' lawsuit commenced on May 7, 2008, the day Mims' amended complaint was filed. <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2015-3-20\">S.C.

Section 15-3-40 permits tolling if a claimant is \"insane.\" In <em>Wiggins v. Edwards</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"492684\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/314/126/\">314 S.C. 126</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"492684\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/314/126/\">442 S.E.2d 169</extracted-citation> (1994), the South Carolina Supreme Court defined the term \"insane\" for purposes of the tolling statute by stating:</p><p id=\"p-29\">Insanity or mental incompetency that tolls the statute of limitations consists of a mental condition which precludes understanding the nature or effects of one's acts, an incapacity to manage one's affairs, an inability to understand or protect one's rights, because of an over-all inability to function in society, or the mental condition is such as to require care in a hospital.</p><p id=\"p-30\"><extracted-citation case-ids=\"492684\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/314/126/\">314 S.C at 129</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"492684\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/314/126/\">442 S.E.2d at 170</extracted-citation> (quoting 54 C.J.S. <em>Limitations of Actions</em> \u00a7 117 ). We find there is no material fact in dispute regarding the severe mental disabilities Mims experienced since birth. Uncontroverted evidence presented to the circuit court demonstrates Mims was never able to manage his own affairs or protect his rights, and Mims required consistent one-on-one care to accomplish daily tasks of living. We therefore find Mims was entitled to the statutory tolling protection of section 15-3-40. <em>See</em> <em>Wiggins</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"492684\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/314/126/\">314 S.C at 129</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"492684\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/314/126/\">442 S.E.2d at 170</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-31\">Additionally, we find the circuit court erred in ruling section 44-26-90 of the South Carolina Code (2018),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> permits tolling for <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"2\" data-label=\"398\" href=\"#p398\" id=\"p398\">**398</a>only those who were declared legally incapacitated by a formal court order before their actions accrued. There is no explicit language in section 44-26-90 that restricts the effect of the disability tolling statute in this way, and both statutes were passed by the Legislature to protect vulnerable people. To interpret section 44-26-90 as removing the protections created by section 15-3-40 for someone who meets the definition of \"insane\" from <em>Wiggins</em> , but who has not yet been declared incompetent by a probate court, is contrary to the general policy in South Carolina of affording special protection to the mentally disabled, especially in civil legal proceedings. <em>See</em> <em>Lancaster Cty.

The question of whether a disability ceases when a legal guardian is appointed is novel in South Carolina. However, the vast majority of jurisdictions <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"813\" href=\"#p813\" id=\"p813\">*813</a>with similar tolling statutes hold the appointment of a guardian does not end the disability when the tolling statute is unambiguous and does not suggest a legislative intent to end the disability when a guardian is appointed. <em>See</em> <em>Barton-Malow Co., Inc. v.

Mims asserts Lacy and Butkus had actual and constructive knowledge Mims' confinement at Clusters and Kensington posed a \"pervasive and unreasonable risk\" of constitutional injury because they knew or should have known of the ongoing substandard care and neglect occurring at Clusters and Kensington, including beatings, insect infestations, and sexual assaults; that Lacy's and Butkus's response to the knowledge was so inadequate as to show \"deliberate indifference to or tacit authorization of the alleged offensive practices\"; and finally, that there was an \"affirmative causal link\" between the Lacy's and Butkus's inaction and the particular injury of unlawful confinement suffered by Mims-namely, that while Mims' confinement to DDSN's care was justified by his need for safe, one-on-one supervision at all <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"2\" data-label=\"402\" href=\"#p402\" id=\"p402\">**402</a>times, Lacy and Butkus failed to ensure this level of care was provided to Mims, resulting in multiple personal injuries to Mims over a period of years.</p><p id=\"p-45\">We find the record does not support the circuit court's conclusion that Mims referred only to the beating by a Clusters employee, the ant-bite incident, and the penis injury in alleging and arguing Respondents Lacy and Butkus are subject to \u00a7 1983 liability. Accordingly, we reverse the circuit court's finding that Mims' lawsuit is limited to these three discrete incidents, and instead find Mims alleges his \u00a7 1983 injury was the unlawful confinement he experienced while in DDSN care.</p><p id=\"p-46\">We also find the circuit court erred in finding Mims presented no evidence of widespread abusive conduct at Clusters and Kensington and no evidence that Respondents Lacy and Butkus knew of and ignored systemic problems. At summary judgment, Mims cited to evidence to support his theory of \u00a7 1983 liability, including reports from CMS regarding certification of Clusters and Kensington, as well as affidavits and depositions of Ms. Mims, Lacy, Butkus, and the affidavit of Mims' GAL. Accordingly, viewing all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to Mims' theory of the case, Mims has presented more than a scintilla of evidence <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"815\" href=\"#p815\" id=\"p815\">*815</a>to demonstrate there are material facts in dispute regarding his \u00a7 1983 claims. <em>Hancock v.

As the South Carolina Supreme Court stated in <em>Madison</em> , the court's sole function regarding the issue of proximate cause at summary judgment is \"to inquire whether particular conclusions are the only reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the evidence.\" <em>Id</em> . We find there are multiple inferences that could be drawn from the evidence presented at summary judgment; therefore summary judgment is not appropriate. Rather, a jury must determine whether an affirmative causal link exists between Lacy's and Butkus's inaction and Mims' alleged unlawful confinement.</p><p id=\"p-48\"><strong>IV.</strong></p><p id=\"p-49\">In granting summary judgment, the circuit court dismissed Mims' causes of action for negligent supervision, negligence, and gross negligence for failure to state a claim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The circuit court additionally found Mims did not satisfy his summary judgment burden of proving negligent supervision.

Mims' allegations appear to be based on a theory that DDSN structured its provision of services to skew in favor of residential facility placements and away from in-home care services by, for example, paying employees at residential facilities more than DDSN pays at-home caregivers.</p><p id=\"p-53\">Mims failed to provide evidence to support this theory of liability. <em>See</em> <em>Singleton v.

While Mims cited to a single instance of a denial of requested services at summary judgment, we find this one example does not constitute more than a mere scintilla of evidence that Respondents systematically violated the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act in an ongoing manner. <em>See</em> <em>Hancock</em> , 381 S.C. at 330-31, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3853590\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/381/326/#p330\">673 S.E.2d at 803</extracted-citation> (2009) (\"[I]n cases applying federal law ... the non-moving party must submit more than a mere scintilla of evidence to withstand a motion for summary judgment.\").

However, we reverse the circuit court's dismissal and grant of summary judgment on Mims' claims for violations of \u00a7 1983 against Respondents Lacy and Butkus, as well as his claims for negligence, gross negligence, and negligent supervision against DDSN. Mims' lawsuit commenced on the date his amended complaint was filed, May 7, 2008, and he may receive <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"2\" data-label=\"406\" href=\"#p406\" id=\"p406\">**406</a>the benefit of a five-year tolling of the statute of limitations for each of his claims under section 15-3-40 of the South Carolina Code. Finally, we find the circuit court erred in limiting the scope of Mims' lawsuit. The case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p><p id=\"p-56\"><strong>AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</strong></p><p id=\"p-62\">Respondents contend Mims' allegations of these injuries, as well as the vomiting, weight loss, bruised groin and hand, and pain were not pled or otherwise before the circuit court. We disagree. Among other allegations that encompassed these health complaints, Mims referenced \"systemic abuse, neglect, and exploitation of clients\" living in Clusters and Kensington in his amended pleading. In support, Mims cited to the six-volume record he filed without objection in the case-consisting of news articles, medical records, sworn affidavits, and depositions-during the hearing on Respondents' motion and in his memorandum in response to Respondents' motion for summary judgment.</p><p id=\"p-63\">In 2002, the Legislature amended section 15-3-20(B) of the South Carolina Code, and, in 2004, the South Carolina Supreme Court correspondingly amended Rule 3(a), SCRCP. Before the 2004 amendment, Rule 3(a), SCRCP, stated, \"A civil action is commenced by filing and service of a summons and complaint,\" and lawsuits were found to have commenced on the day of service. <em>See, e.g.</em> , <em>First Palmetto State Bank &amp; Trust Co. v.

The original complaint was never served. We find nothing in the language of Rule 15(c), SCRCP, that allows relation-back to an unserved pleading, and applying the rule in that way would have the undesirable consequence of permitting litigants to extend the statute of limitations for several of their causes of actions by choosing to wait until the conclusion of their longest statute of limitations to file and serve an amended complaint. <em>See</em> <em>Logan v.

Respondents did not move for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP ; rather, Respondents moved for summary judgment under Rule 56, SCRCP.
