In light of this standard, the facts presented at summary judgment are as follows:\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-12\">\n     Mims was born prematurely and, as a result, suffered both physical and mental disabilities. At age twenty-one, an evaluation found him to have the cognitive ability of a twenty-month-old child. During the first twenty-seven years of his life, Mims lived with and was cared for by his mother, Margaret Mims. In 1999, Ms. Mims fell ill, and Mims was voluntarily committed to full-time DDSN care in a residential facility known as \"Clusters.\" While at Clusters, Mims experienced several ailments, including bruises on his groin, vomiting, and a twenty-eight pound weight loss. In 2000, Mims was beaten by a Clusters employee. Several months after the beating, Ms. Mims requested Mims be returned to her care. In response, DDSN petitioned the probate court to have Mims committed to the residential facility. After a hearing, the probate court judicially admitted Mims to DDSN's care, concluding he was profoundly mentally retarded with complex medical needs.\n     <footnotemark>\n      2\n     </footnotemark>\n     After the Clusters employee was arrested and charged with assault and battery as a result of beating Mims, Ms. Mims wrote a letter to DDSN again requesting he be returned to her care.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-13\">\n     In response, Ms. Mims received a letter from DDSN's Director of Government and Community Relations that stated:\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-15\">\n     In January 2002, Mims was repeatedly hit by another resident with a belt. The State Long Term Care Ombudsman reviewed the incident and concluded that:\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-16\">\n     It is substantiated that resident-to-resident abuse occurred. The [Omnibus Adult Protection Act] states that physical abuse does not include altercations or acts of assault between vulnerable adults. However, the incident should have been reported to the Ombudsman because of its serious nature. Although the Ombudsman Program does not have the statutory authority to investigate resident-to-resident abuse, it would investigate to determine if adequate supervision was provided. Lack of Supervision was also substantiated based on the above findings.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-17\">\n     In March 2002, Mims was transferred from Clusters to another residential facility under contract with DDSN called \"Kensington.\" In 2003, the Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) investigated Clusters and found the facility failed to consistently provide the staffing or training necessary to protect residents.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-18\">\n     Between 2002 and 2004, Mims was treated for a swollen and bruised hand, elevated blood pressure, suspected pain, and an incident where he was discovered to have a large number of ant bites.\n     <footnotemark>\n      3\n     </footnotemark>\n     In late 2004, one of Mims' co-residents died after choking on insufficiently pureed food, precipitating another investigation by CMS. In April 2005, CMS terminated Kensington's certification. As a result, some of Kensington's residents were relocated to other facilities; however, DDSN did not relocate Mims.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-19\">\n     A month later, on May 27, 2005, Mims presented to the emergency room with a four centimeter laceration to the undersurface of his penis. Although the emergency-room doctor's notes described the injury as a \"[s]uperficial\n     laceration to penis,\" the laceration was repaired with seven sutures. An internal investigation of the injury concluded \"the origin remains\n     unexplained.\" Upon learning of the injury, Ms. Mims initiated proceedings to become Mims' guardian.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-20\">\n     An emergency hearing was held on Ms. Mims' petition for guardianship. Based on evidence presented indicating Kensington was decertified in April 2005 and Mims sustained a \"serious unexplained injury\" on May 27, 2005, the probate court appointed Ms. Mims as her son's guardian and custodian.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-21\">\n     On May 29, 2007, Ms. Mims filed a complaint on Mims' behalf, suing DDSN for various torts and statutory violations. However, that complaint was never served. On May 7, 2008, Mims filed an amended complaint, adding Respondents Lacy and Butkus to the lawsuit and pleading the current allegations. The amended complaint was served on May 12, 2008.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-22\">\n     Respondents filed a motion to dismiss for untimely service, which was originally denied but then granted after a hearing on the motion to reconsider.\n     <em>\n      Mims ex rel. Mims v. Babcock Ctr., Inc.\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3881871\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/399/341/#p343\">\n      399 S.C. 341\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 343-44,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3881871\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/399/341/#p343\">\n      732 S.E.2d 395\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 396 (2012). Mims appealed the dismissal, and the South Carolina Supreme Court found the amended complaint was timely served.\n     <em>\n      Id\n     </em>\n     . (holding Rule 15(a), SCRCP, allows for filing and service of an amended complaint without leave of court, even if the original complaint was not served).\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-23\">\n     The case was remanded, and Respondents moved for summary judgment. After a hearing, the circuit court granted summary judgment, finding: (1) Mims' lawsuit was limited in scope to potential liability for three incidents of personal injury: the 2000 beating by a Clusters employee, the 2004 \"ant-bite incident,\" and the 2005 penis injury; (2) the majority of Mims' causes of actions were time-barred; and (3) the remaining causes of action either failed as a matter of law because they were insufficiently pled or because Mims failed to satisfy his summary judgment burden.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-24\">\n     <strong>\n      II.\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-25\">\n     The circuit court ruled the statute of limitations barred most of Mims' claims, including: (1) the \u00a7 1983 claims that arose before May 12, 2005, and (2) the state tort claims that arose before May 12, 2006. In so ruling, the circuit court found Mims' lawsuit commenced on May 12, 2008, the day his\n     amended complaint was served. The circuit court additionally found Mims was not entitled to disability tolling under section 15-3-40 of the South Carolina Code (2005) because he was not \"insane\" for purposes of the statute when his causes of action accrued and, alternatively, even if he was \"insane,\" his disability ceased when Ms. Mims was appointed his guardian. We reverse.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-26\">\n     Initially, we find Mims' lawsuit commenced on May 7, 2008, the day Mims' amended complaint was filed.\n     <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2015-3-20\">\n      S.C.

We find there is no material fact in dispute regarding the severe mental disabilities Mims experienced since birth. Uncontroverted evidence presented to the circuit court demonstrates Mims was never able to manage his own affairs or protect his rights, and Mims required consistent one-on-one care to accomplish daily tasks of living. We therefore find Mims was entitled to the statutory tolling protection of section 15-3-40.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Wiggins\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"492684\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/314/126/\">\n      314 S.C at 129\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"492684\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/314/126/\">\n      442 S.E.2d at 170\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-31\">\n     Additionally, we find the circuit court erred in ruling section 44-26-90 of the South Carolina Code (2018),\n     <footnotemark>\n      6\n     </footnotemark>\n     permits tolling for\n     only those who were declared legally incapacitated by a formal court order before their actions accrued. There is no explicit language in section 44-26-90 that restricts the effect of the disability tolling statute in this way, and both statutes were passed by the Legislature to protect vulnerable people. To interpret section 44-26-90 as removing the protections created by section 15-3-40 for someone who meets the definition of \"insane\" from\n     <em>\n      Wiggins\n     </em>\n     , but who has not yet been declared incompetent by a probate court, is contrary to the general policy in South Carolina of affording special protection to the mentally disabled, especially in civil legal proceedings.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Lancaster Cty.
