HUFF\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Braulio M. Castillo (\"appellant\") appeals the rulings of the Circuit Court of Loudoun County (\"circuit court\") finding that he abused and neglected his minor children under Code \u00a7 16.1-228(1) and (5) and terminating his residual parental rights to those children pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B) and \u00a7 16.1-283(E)(ii). On appeal, appellant challenges certain of the circuit court's evidentiary rulings, the circuit court's decision to consider the abuse and neglect issue during the same proceeding as the termination issue, its decision to hold evidence open pending the final sentencing order in appellant's criminal trial, and the sufficiency of the evidence to support both the abuse and neglect and termination rulings. For the following reasons, this Court affirms the circuit court's decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.

So viewed, the evidence is as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Events Leading to Removal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 1, 2013, the circuit court issued a protective order prohibiting appellant from having contact with his wife, Michelle Castillo, except by agreement or as necessary to\n   facilitate visitation exchanges with their children. Appellant and Ms. Castillo had been married for seventeen years when the protective order was entered, and they were parents to four minor children. Appellant is the biological father of J.C., born July 9, 2004; Z.C., born October 22, 2007; and B.C., born July 1, 2010. The fourth child, V.C., was born on February 7, 2003 and adopted by the couple as an infant. The basis of the protective order was appellant's repeated verbal, physical, and sexual abuse of Ms. Castillo, often in the presence of one or more of the children. Pursuant to the order, appellant had visitation with the children on alternate weekends and every Wednesday from 4:00-7:00 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ms. Castillo picked up the children after their regularly scheduled visitation with appellant on the evening of Wednesday, March 19, 2014. On the following morning, March 20, appellant received a telephone call indicating that the children could not find their mother. Although the protective order prohibited appellant from having contact with Ms. Castillo or the children outside of scheduled visitation periods or other agreed times, appellant went to Ms. Castillo's house, looked around the house for Ms. Castillo, dressed the children, and took all but the youngest to school. The youngest remained with appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Loudoun County Department of Family Services (\"DFS\") received a report of suspected abuse or neglect of the children later that day. The report indicated that law enforcement officers had found Ms. Castillo deceased that morning, hanging in the basement bathroom. The report also advised that because appellant was a person of interest in the investigation of Ms. Castillo's death, the children should not be returned to appellant's care. Child Protective Services (\"CPS\") assumed custody of the children the same day and placed them with David and Stephanie Meeker, friends of the Castillo family, pursuant to a safety plan developed with appellant's consent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Proceedings Before the Juvenile Court\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   DFS filed petitions with the Loudoun County Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court (\"JDR court\") on March 28 alleging\n   abuse and neglect of the children. The JDR court entered emergency removal orders that same day granting DFS temporary legal custody of the children. Following a preliminary removal hearing on April 4, the JDR court entered preliminary removal orders finding that each child had been abused or neglected and awarding temporary legal custody to DFS. Meanwhile, on April 1, appellant was charged with the first-degree murder of Ms. Castillo, breaking and entering with intent to commit murder, and violation of the protective order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A series of foster care plan reviews and permanency planning hearings ensued. Although DFS's original goal for the children was to return them home, DFS changed that to a concurrent goal of returning home or adoption in December 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The JDR court approved the concurrent goals as an interim plan in permanency planning orders dated January 20, 2015, and set a subsequent hearing for September 8, 2015. DFS filed updated foster care plans and petitions for permanency planning hearings setting forth an exclusive goal of adoption on August 14, 2015. The JDR court postponed this second permanency planning hearing pending resolution of the criminal case against appellant. On June 16, 2016, a jury found appellant guilty of the first-degree murder of Ms. Castillo, breaking and entering with the intent to commit murder, and violating the protective order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The next day, DFS filed petitions to terminate appellant's residual parental rights with\n   respect to each of the children pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B) and 16.1-283(C)(2). DFS amended these petitions to include Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E)(ii) and 16.1-283(E)(iv) as additional grounds for termination on June 22, 2016. The JDR court ultimately entered orders terminating appellant's residual parental rights to the children, which appellant appealed to the circuit court on July 1, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The appeal of the dispositional orders had been originally scheduled for November 18-19, 2014, but following two continuances requested by DFS, was rescheduled for September 19-23, 2016. After appellant noted his appeal of the termination orders, DFS moved on July 7, 2016 to combine the appeals of the dispositional and termination orders into a single proceeding. Appellant objected to combining the hearings because the criminal case had not yet concluded, but the circuit court nevertheless granted the motion to combine. On August 26, 2016, appellant moved to stay the combined appeal \"until such time as [appellant] is sentenced and a final order is entered in the underlying criminal matter.\" The motion elaborated that any termination under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E) could not take place until appellant had concluded any post-trial motions and exhausted the availability of appeal. The circuit court denied this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Circuit Court Trial\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The circuit court trial commenced on September 19, 2016 and continued until September 23, then recessed until October 31, 2016 when it became apparent that additional time would be necessary for the proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   During the trial, DFS sought to introduce Ms. Castillo's testimony during the 2013 protective order hearing in the circuit court. Appellant objected on hearsay grounds, and DFS contended that the testimony was admissible under the former testimony exception codified at Virginia Rule of Evidence 2:804(b)(1). After hearing argument, the circuit court admitted the evidence stating, \"I find that the requirements under 2:804(a)(1) [sic] have been met, and that ... the matter in the\n   transcript was family abuse, and certainly an issue in these cases is the issue of abuse within the family.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   DFS also called appellant to testify during its case-in-chief, and questioned him regarding certain notes contained in his smartphone and labeled as privileged communications. Counsel for appellant objected on attorney-client privilege grounds, and the circuit court sustained the objection. DFS later questioned\n   Mark McCaffrey, a detective with the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office, about how he obtained appellant's smartphone during the criminal investigation of appellant. McCaffrey testified that he gained possession of the phone while executing a search warrant of appellant's residence. Although appellant initially refused to provide the phone's passcode, he soon relented and revealed the code to McCaffrey, stating \"See, I'm being cooperative.\" Based on this additional information, DFS sought once again to introduce the notes contained on appellant's phone. This time, the circuit court ruled the notes admissible and found that appellant waived any privilege by giving the passcode to the detective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Dr. John Walker testified during DFS's case-in-chief as an expert in the field of human development focusing on youth with trauma and attachment issues. While describing the children's bond with the Meekers, Walker testified that the children said \"that [the Meekers' home] feels safe, that it feels like home.\" Appellant objected to this testimony on hearsay grounds, and DFS replied that the children's statement was admissible as the basis of his expert opinion regarding their bond with the Meekers. The circuit court overruled the objection and admitted the testimony for the limited purpose of demonstrating the basis for Walker's opinion regarding the bond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   DFS additionally presented evidence that it considered potential relative placements for the children. Immediately after the emergency removal in March 2014, DFS had considered placing the children with relatives, but all relatives known to DFS at that point were staying with appellant in appellant's residence. DFS later developed a genogram of the family and\n   mailed letters to several of the children's relatives advising them that the children were in foster care and that DFS was considering relative placements. DFS set up visitations between the children and various relatives, and interviewed some of these relatives as candidates for placement. Among the relatives under consideration, several did not believe that appellant had murdered Ms. Castillo or gave testimony at the criminal trial that contradicted the children's testimony, others lacked appropriate housing or had health concerns, one relative had strained interactions with the children, and another indicated that she would be willing to be a placement for the first time during the circuit court trial. DFS personnel testified that because two of the four children in its custody were expected to, and actually did, testify against appellant in his criminal trial, it placed significant weight on relatives' attitudes toward appellant in assessing the appropriateness of relative placements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At the conclusion of its case-in-chief, DFS moved to hold evidence open in order to introduce the final order from appellant's criminal case, including appellant's sentence. On the seventh day of trial, November 1, 2016, the circuit court granted DFS's motion over appellant's objection. The circuit court entered the final order in appellant's criminal case on December 30, 2016, sentencing him to a term of life imprisonment plus sixteen years. The civil trial reconvened for an eighth day on April 25, 2017, during which DFS offered the sentencing order into evidence and rested. Appellant then moved to strike the evidence, which he renewed after presenting his case-in-chief and after DFS called rebuttal witnesses. In each of his motions, appellant contended that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of abuse and neglect under Code \u00a7 16.1-228 and that DFS had not established by clear and convincing evidence that termination was appropriate under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B), (C), or (E). The circuit court denied both motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On August 11, 2017, the circuit court ruled that the children had been abused and neglected and terminated appellant's\n   parental rights pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B) and (E)(ii). This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This Court employs a familiar standard of review on appeal of a circuit court's decision to terminate parental rights:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   When addressing matters concerning a child, including the termination of a parent's residual parental rights, the paramount consideration of a trial court is the child's best interests. On review, \"[a] trial court is presumed to have thoroughly weighed all the evidence, considered the statutory requirements, and made its determination\n   based on the child's best interests.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Logan v.

ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Appellant raises ten assignments of error on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   1. The trial court erred in admitting prior irrelevant hearsay testimony under a non-existent Virginia Rule of Evidence (2:804(a)(1)) and, even if intending to apply Virginia Rule of Evidence 2:804(b)(1), the trial court erred in finding that the issue on which the testimony was offered in a protective order hearing pertaining to alleged acts against an adult was substantially similar to the current case involving alleged abuse and neglect of minor children and petitions for termination of parental rights over those children.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   2. The trial court erred in finding that [appellant] had knowingly, voluntarily, and intentionally waived his attorney-client privilege on contents contained within his cellular phone that was seized pursuant to a search warrant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   3. The trial court erred in applying Virginia Rule of Evidence 2:703 by allowing an expert to testify regarding the substance of out-of-court hearsay statements used to support the basis for his opinion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   4. The trial court erred in granting the Department's Motion to Hold Evidence Open to Permit Introduction of Final Order from CR 26450, thereby granting a continuance during the Department's case-in-chief from November, 2016 to April, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   5. The trial court erred in denying [appellant's] Motion to Strike and Renewed Motion to Strike the evidence pertaining to the petitions to terminate his parental rights when no separate proceeding had been held and there had been no prior finding of abuse and neglect as required in Va. Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-283(A) and 16.1-283(B).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   6. The trial court erred in finding that there was sufficient evidence to give consideration to relative placement as required in Virginia Code \u00a7 16.1-283 when the Department had not properly investigated any of the maternal or paternal relatives of the children and\n   further erred by finding that none of the relatives offered for consideration met the requirements as defined in Virginia Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-283(A) and 16.1-283(A)(A1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   7. The trial court erred in finding sufficient evidence that each child had been abused or neglected as defined in Virginia Code \u00a7 16.1-228(1) by holding that there was substantial risk of impairment of mental functions when there was no evidence presented to support such a finding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   8. The trial court erred in finding sufficient evidence that each child had been abused or neglected as defined in Virginia Code \u00a7 16.1-228(5) where the evidence did not prove that the children were left without parental\n   care or guardianship and where [appellant's] involuntary absence was not unreasonable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   9. The trial court erred in terminating Mr. Castillo's parental rights under Virginia Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B) where (i) there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of neglect or abuse such that it presented a serious and substantial threat to each child's life, health or development; (ii) the court improperly considered a finding of guilt in [appellant's] criminal matter; and (iii) the court indicated it considered rehabilitative efforts prior to the children's placement in foster care when no such evidence was presented.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   10. The trial court erred in terminating [appellant's] parental rights under Virginia Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E)(ii) finding [appellant] had been convicted of a criminal offense when there was no conviction in the case bearing Loudoun County Case Number CR 26450.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   This Court will consider those assignments necessary for resolution of the appeal in turn.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kilby v.

One of the issues before the circuit court in the instant case was whether appellant had abused and neglected the children. Appellant contends that Ms. Castillo's protective order testimony addressed only his abuses of her and thus relates to an issue other than his abuse of the children. This argument mischaracterizes both what constitutes child abuse and the contents of her testimony. The record indicates that Ms. Castillo's testimony at the protective order hearing detailed not only instances of appellant abusing her around the children-actions constituting psychological abuse of the children-but also appellant's physical abuses of the children themselves, including pushing then-five-year-old Z.C. hard enough to knock him to the ground and grabbing then-two-year-old B.C. by the arm and twisting until he cried. Appellant's argument that the testimony is inadmissible because it took place during a protective order hearing before DFS ever became involved is similarly misguided. As the Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   , the former testimony simply must relate to a sufficiently similar issue to that in the present proceeding-there is no requirement that the two proceedings be for the same purpose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2068027\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/231/1/#p5\">\n    231 Va. at 7-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=341%20S.E.2d%20153\">\n    341 S.E.2d at 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The circuit court, however, did not mention the notes in its ruling, and ample other evidence existed in the record to support the conclusion that appellant had violated the protective order. Among the evidence rendering the notes redundant was the protective order itself, which made clear that appellant was not entitled to contact with the children on Thursday, March 20, 2014. Because the circuit court had sufficient evidence other than the notes at issue from which to conclude appellant violated the protective order and did not rely on the notes in its ruling, this Court holds that any error in finding that appellant waived the attorney-client privilege and admitting the notes was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   C. Hearsay as Basis of Expert Testimony\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In his third assignment of error, appellant contends that the circuit court misapplied Virginia Rule of Evidence 2:703 by permitting DFS's expert, Dr. John Walker, to testify regarding hearsay statements by the children that formed the basis of his opinion regarding their bond with the Meekers.

This rule, derived from Code \u00a7 8.01-401.1, does not provide\n   <em>\n    carte blanche\n   </em>\n   for litigants to introduce otherwise inadmissible material in derogation of the ordinary rules of evidence.

The record indicates that DFS began researching the children's relatives shortly after the initial removal.

Many of these relatives had visitation with the children, which DFS supervised in order to consider the relatives' interactions with the children in assessing whether placement with those relatives would be appropriate. Further, DFS conducted interviews with relatives who seemed to be the most likely placement candidates. In the course of its investigation, DFS determined that all of the relatives it considered would be inappropriate for various reasons, including inadequate housing, medical conditions, strained interactions with the children, or holding beliefs regarding appellant inconsistent with what DFS believed to be the children's best interests.

On appeal before the circuit court, appellant moved to stay or continue the case pending entry of a final order in the criminal case against him, which DFS opposed and the circuit court denied without elaboration. But when DFS moved to hold evidence open for admission of the final criminal order, the circuit court granted its motion,\n   finding admission of the order to be \"central to the just outcome of this matter.\" The circuit court, perhaps tacitly recognizing its opposite rulings on the issue during the course of litigation, acknowledged in its oral ruling the important considerations favoring each side's positions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Obviously, the tension in this case, as was pointed out in counsel's positions, is between minding the statutory mandates ... for docketing priority and adjudication of these type of matters, that is, the termination of residual parental rights, to alleviate children languishing in foster care, and that's on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the Court, having full information upon which to determine the issues before it.

A criminal judgment in the Commonwealth's favor would have been, and eventually proved to be, dispositive on the issue of terminating father's parental rights. Had the circuit court elected to proceed without waiting for the final criminal order, it likely would have conducted a subsequent termination hearing addressing the alternate ground for termination once the final order became available from the criminal action. The circuit court weighed the need for prompt resolution and stability for the children against the need for greater certainty that its ruling would be correct. It decided that a few months' delay for evidence that would provide that increased certainty was better for the children than going on to reach a decision it perceived would be more vulnerable to reversal on appeal, thus risking potential years of uncertainty for the children. On the record before it, this Court cannot say that the circuit court abused its discretion in making this determination. Accordingly, this Court holds that the circuit court did not err in holding the evidence open for entry of the final criminal order against appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   F.

In his tenth assignment of error, appellant further argues that the circuit court erred by terminating his residual parental rights to the children under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E)(ii). Because the circuit court's decision to\n   hold a combined hearing on both issues, if error, was nevertheless harmless given that the evidence overwhelmingly supported a termination finding under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E)(ii), this Court affirms its rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Code \u00a7 16.1-283(A) provides, in relevant part, that \"[t]he residual parental rights of a parent or parents may be terminated by the court as hereinafter provided in a\n   <em>\n    separate proceeding\n   </em>\n   if the petition specifically requests such relief.\" (Emphasis added).

That provision states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   The residual parental rights of a parent or parents of a child who is in the custody of a local board or licensed child-placing agency may be terminated by the court if the court finds, based upon clear and convincing evidence, that it is in the best interests of the child and that ... (ii) the parent has been convicted of an offense under the laws of the Commonwealth ... that constitutes murder ... if the victim of the offense was ... the other parent of the child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Unlike Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B), the other ground upon which the circuit court terminated appellant's residual parental rights, Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E)(ii) requires no predicate finding that the parent abused and neglected the children. The circuit court had before it a final criminal order convicting appellant of the murder of Ms. Castillo, biological mother of three of the children and adoptive mother of the fourth, which it held was a conviction within the meaning of Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E)(ii).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   circuit court further held that, in light of the speculative possibility of appellant maintaining a relationship with the children from prison and the children's need for stable parental figures, the evidence supported a finding by clear and convincing evidence that termination of appellant's parental rights was in the best interests of the children. These findings, amply supported by the evidence in the record, justified termination pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E)(ii). Because termination under that provision does not require a finding of abuse and neglect, the procedural requirements for separating termination proceedings from hearings on other issues are not significant in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Accordingly, to the extent that the circuit court may have erred by not holding separate proceedings for the termination issues, such error was harmless because appellant received a fair trial in which overwhelming evidence was presented supporting termination of his residual parental rights to the children under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E)(ii).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   IV. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The circuit court did not err in its evidentiary rulings, and its ruling regarding appellant's waiver of attorney-client privilege was harmless in light of the other evidence against appellant and the inconsequential probative value of the challenged notes. It gave full consideration to possible relative placements for the children, but found based on ample evidence that no relative was appropriate. On the specific facts of this case, the circuit court's decision to hold evidence open for admission of the final criminal order was not an abuse of discretion. The final conviction order, in light of the other evidence presented, provided sufficient grounds for the circuit court to terminate appellant's parental rights under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E)(ii) and rendered harmless its decision to combine all the JDR court appeals into one hearing.
