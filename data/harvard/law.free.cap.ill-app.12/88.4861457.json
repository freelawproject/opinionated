B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. v. Howard, 80 Ill. 91; The Illinois Linen Co. v. Hough, 91 Id. 67.</p> <p id=\"b86-3\" pgmap=\"86\">It appears that the second instruction for the plaintiff was as follows: \u201cThe court further instructs the jury for the plaintiff, if you believe from the evidence that the train of the defendant was run upon the steer of plaintiff upon a public crossing by reason of the employes of the defendant neglecting to sound a whistle or to ring a bell atapoint at least eighty rods from such crossing, or as the result of such signal or alarm, and that the defendant or its employes were guilty of gross negligence, and the negligence of the plaintiff was slight as compared to that of the defendant, then you should find for the plaintiff.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b86-4\" pgmap=\"86\">From this it would be understood that the gross negligence here intended might consist as well in either the giving or in failing to give the alarm required by the statute, as the fact might be found to be \u2014 an error so patent to the mind of a lawyer as to arouse a suspicion of the accuracy of the transcript, but which an intelligent juror uninformed as to the statute, to which no reference is made, might not perceive.</p> <p id=\"b86-5\" pgmap=\"86\">For the giving of these instructions the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b86-6\" pgmap=\"86\">Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
