As the grounds for dismissing the appeal are not disclosed by the bill of exceptions and nothing appears to the contrary, this court must presume that they were sufficient to justify the action of the court in dismissing the appeal.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b257-12\" pgmap=\"257\">Appeal from the County Court of Sangamon county; the Hon.
