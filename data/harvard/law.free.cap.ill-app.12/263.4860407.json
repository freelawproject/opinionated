The suit was brought and prosecuted for the use of the State\u2019s attorney.

Section 5 of chapter 14 of the Revised Statutes, 1874, prescribes the duties of this officer and requires him to \u201c commence and prosecute all suits in his county against railroad and transportation companies, which may be prosecuted in the name of the People of the State of Illinois.\u201d The next section provides for the appointment of a State\u2019s attorney to prosecute in all cases when the State\u2019s attorney is sick, absent, unable to attend court or interested in the cause pending.</p> <p id=\"b260-8\" pgmap=\"260(45) 261(41)\">The State\u2019s attorney is a public,officer elected by the people, commissioned by the governor, required to give bond for the faithful discharge of the duties of his office, and paid, in part, a salary for his services out of the treasury of the State. He is charged by law with large discretidn in prosecuting offenders against the law. He may commence public prosecutions, in his official capacity by information and he may discontinue them when, in his judgment, the ends of justice are satisfied.</p> <p id=\"b261-4\" pgmap=\"261\">In the case of The People ex rel. v. N. C. R. R. Co. 88 Ill. 546, it was said by the court, in speaking of the powers of this officer, \u201c The State\u2019s attorney, if the information affects public rights only, may undoubtedly act at the instance of an individual who may furnish him the requisite proofs to authorize him to act, who he may name relator, but he must act under a sense of official duty, and not merely lend his name for the use of a private party, and the proceedings must be official in fact, and not simply official in form but private in fact.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b261-7\" pgmap=\"261\">The statute authorizing the commencement of the suit in the name of the People for the use of any one suing, could not have been intended to confer upon the officers of the court charged with the impartial administration of justice, such as the judge, jurors or State\u2019s attorney trying the cause, the right to use the machinery of the law for their own private gain.</p> <p id=\"b261-8\" pgmap=\"261\">Every person charged with the violation of the public law, should receive a fair and impartial trial, and to that end it is of the first importance that the officers of the court, by whom he is prosecuted or convicted, should be free from all pecuniary interest in his conviction. The person for whose use this suit was prosecuted was one of the officers of the court, and as such known to be the State\u2019s attorney of the county, and we are not prepared to hold that the court erred in refusing to permit him to enforce the penal laws of the State in the name of the People for his own gain.</p> <p id=\"b261-10\" pgmap=\"261\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
