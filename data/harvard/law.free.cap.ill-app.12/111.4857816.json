Appellant set up an express contract for a specified term and the quitting of appellee before its expiration. Held, that it was error for the court to permit appellee to set up a slight sickness which had not continued up to the time he left, as a justifying cause for leaving appellant\u2019s employ, since appellee had not been required to work when he was ill, and had voluntarily resumed work on the next day. It was also error for the court to refuse to allow appellant to offer testimony, tending to impeach appellee\u2019s general reputation for truth.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-9\" pgmap=\"107\">Error tolthe Circuit Court of Putnam county; the Hon.

He was not required to work on the day he was sick, and voluntarily resumed on the next; but in the meantime had engaged to work elsewhere and left on that evening without notice.</p> <p id=\"b108-9\" pgmap=\"108(28) 109(16)\">To the evidence of such sickness, as a justifying cause for leaving, the defendant objected, but the court admitted it. Defendant then offered evidence tending to impeach the plaintiff\u2019s general reputation for truth, which was refused olithe ground that it came too late.</p> <p id=\"b109-4\" pgmap=\"109\">On both points the ruling was erroneous and the judgment is therefore reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b109-5\" pgmap=\"109\">Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
