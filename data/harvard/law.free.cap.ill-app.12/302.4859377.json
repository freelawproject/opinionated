Was the defendant, when this suit was begun, about to fraudulently dispose of her property so as to hinder and delay her creditors?</p> <p id=\"b299-11\" pgmap=\"299\">2d. Has she within two years before this suit was begun fraudulently conveyed or otherwise disposed of her property so as to hinder and delay her creditors; and if the plaintiffs have failed to prove both of those points by a preponderance of the evidence you should find for the defendant.</p> <p id=\"b299-12\" pgmap=\"299\">\u201c Hsually the plaintiff may allege as many grounds of attachment within the terms of the law as he may deem expedient. In doing so, the several grounds should be stated, cumulatively, and if any one of them be true it will sustain the attachment though all the others be untrue.\u201d Drake on Attachments, Sec. 101. (5th ed.)</p> <p id=\"b299-13\" pgmap=\"299(22) 300(14)\">The plaintiffs were entitled to recover if they proved either cause for the attachment, but if they failed to prove both of the causes alleged they could not recover.
