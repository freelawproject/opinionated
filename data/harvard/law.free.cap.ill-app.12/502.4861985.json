Affeld, as one of the sureties. The action was for the use of one D. S. Balckom, against whom Charlotte Steiber, as it was alleged, had, December 11, 1877, sued-out a writ of replevin from a justice of the peace, for certain specified goods and chattels, and delivered said writ to said Carl Affeld to be executed. The breach assigned was that said Carl Affeld took, accepted, approved and returned a replevin bond in that case that was insufficient, defective, and absolutely worthless; and such replevin suit having been dismissed by the court, and judgment de retorno habendo and for damages awarded against said Steiber, which could not be enforced or collected, said Balckom sustained damages, etc. The defendants having filed the plea of nil debet (on which plaintiff took issue), filed a special plea in which they averred that said Carl Afield as sucli constable, kept and performed all the conditions of his said bond, and that before executing the said writ of replevin he took from the said Charlotte Steiber a good and valid replevin bond, as by law he was required to do, which bond was in the words and figures as follows:</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-4\" pgmap=\"499\">\u201c Know all men by these presents, that we, Mrs. Cli. Steiber and -=--are held and firmly bound unto C. Afield, a constable in the said county of Cook, in the State of Illinois, and to his successors in office, executors, administrators and assigns, in the penal sum of four hundred dollars, lawful money of the United States, for the payment of which sum we do hereby bind ourselves, our heirs, executors and administrators.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-7\" pgmap=\"499\">\u201c The condition of the above obligation is such that, whereas, on the 11th day of December, A. D. 1877, the said Mrs. Ch. Affeld sued out a writ of replevin before A. L. Morrison, Esquire, a Justice of the Peace in and for said county of Cook, against D. S. Balckom, defendant, for the recovery of th'e following described goods and chattels, to wit: eighty glasses, a lot of wine bottles, one mirror, one pool table, twenty kegs, one piano, one counter and shelves, an ice box, twelve chairs, three tables.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-8\" pgmap=\"499\">\u00a1Now if the said Mrs. Oh. Steiber, plaintiff, shall prosecute her suit to \u201c affect, and without delay, and make return of the said property, if return thereof shall be awarded, and save and keep harmless the said constable in replevying the said property, then this obligation to be void ; otherwise to remain in full force and effect.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-9\" pgmap=\"499\">Witness our hands and seals this 11th day of December, A.

To that plea the plaintiff replied simply that the defendant Carl Afield did not, before executing the said writ of replevin in the declaration set forth, take from the said Charlotte Steiber a good and valid replevin bond, as by law he was required to do, concluding to the country.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-4\" pgmap=\"500\">On the trial before the court without a jury, the plaintiff stipulated that Henry Soelke, the surety on the replevin bond, \u25a0was financially solvent, and good for the amount in the bond. The defendants offered the replevin bond set out in said plea in evidence, but on objection by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, the court excluded it. To which ruling defendants excepted. The court found the issues for the plaintiff. To which defendants also excepted.

The People, 54 Ill. 228.</p> <opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b501-6\" pgmap=\"501\">McAllister, J.</author> <p id=\"Ag0\" pgmap=\"501(282) 502(86)\">The assignment of the breach of the constable\u2019s bond declared upon is not, that the constable executed the writ of replevin without having taken from the plaintiff in that writ any bond whatever; but it is that he-took, accepted, approved and returned a bond that was insufficient, defective and absolutely worthless. The special plea to that breach (which was the only one assigned) set out in hceo verba the bond which the constable in fact did take; and averred the sufficiency of the surety, as respected his pecuniary responsibility. If the plaintiff\u2019s attorney had desired to raise the question of law, whether the bond so set out was invalid upon its face, he should have demurred to that plea, so that the question would have been properly presented to the court for decision. If, on the other hand, he claimed that the bond as set out in the plea was not the one which the constable in fact did take, he should have so averred in his replication to that plea; and that would have put that fact in issue. So also as to the sufficiency of the surety. The replication, however, does not directly or indirectly deny the fact of the constable having taken at the time in question the particular bond set out in the special plea, or make any mention of the particular averment in such plea that the surety on such bond was financially responsible. We are unable to come to any other conclusion than,that the replication in effect admitted the fact of the constable having taken the particular bond set out in the special plea, as well as the pecuniary responsibility of the surety. McCormick v. Huse, 66 Ill. 315; Simmons v. Jenkins, 76 Ill. 479. If the matters so admitted amount to a defense to the action, then the judgment below is necessarily erroneous. The question, whether the facts so admitted are sufficient to answer the breach assigned in-the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, and then defeat the action, depends solely upon the further question, whether the replevin bond, as set out in the special plea is to be regarded as valid and effectual for the purpose of its execution.</p> <p id=\"b502-5\" pgmap=\"502\">We perceive that the name of the surety is not mentioned in the bond. That does not affect its validity. It is well settled that although the name of the party is not mentioned in the bond, yet if he signs and seals it he will be bound. We also perceive, at the beginning of the condition and in the mention of the name of the person who sued out the writ of replevin, it is the said Mrs. Oh. Affeld instead of Steiber. From the whole instrument there is no doubt that Mrs. Steiber was the person intended. If that be so, the objection is untenable. That the court should look at the whole instrument and thereby determine who was the person intended, is decided by Hibbard v. McKindly, 28 Ill. 254. By proper averments there could be no difficulty in recovering upon that bond. It was not therefore invalid. Again, the defendants offered the same identical bond set out in the special plea in evidence; but, on plaintiff\u2019s general objection, the court excluded it. The replevin bond being valid and the surety good, the judgment below was unwarranted and must be reversed.</p> <p id=\"b502-6\" pgmap=\"502\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
