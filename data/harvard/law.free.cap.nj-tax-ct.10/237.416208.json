The parcels encompass the common recreational facilities of The Holiday Lake Community Club and, as such, are subject to rights of Holiday Lake property owners. Plaintiff contends, as it did before the Tax Court, that (1) the property owners\u2019 rights in the parcels make them unmarketable and therefore the parcels have no value, and (2) the 1986 assessments are excessive because the value of the parcels is reflected already in the assessments of the property owners\u2019 lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-14\">After review of the record and consideration of the law and counsel\u2019s arguments, we affirm for the reasons set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Judge Lasser\u2019s written opinion reported at 9 <em>N.J.
