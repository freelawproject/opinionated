These words might only refer to a violation of the rules of the mill. They do not necessarily imply larceny. To make the words a foundation for an action of slander, facts must be set forth, in a <em>colloquium, </em>which would show that the words spoken could only have been understood to apply to a felonious taking. <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Loeb, </em>19 R.
