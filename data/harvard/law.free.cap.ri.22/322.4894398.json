Indictment. Control of Doclcet.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b394-8\">Where there were three indictments on the calendar for the day against the defendant, a new trial will not be granted because the attorney-general was allowed to try one of the indictments out of its regular order on the calendar, the defendant haying been duly notified that all the indictments were down for trial on the day in question and failing to show good cause for a continuance.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b394-9\">The attorney-general has control of his docket, and after it has been set down for trial and due notice given he may try the cases in such order as he sees fit.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b394-10\">(2) <em>New Trial. Indictment. Illness of Defendant.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b394-11\">The fact that defendant produced a physician\u2019s certificate that he was ill and unable to proceed with the trial is no reason for granting a new trial where it appears that the court sent another physician to examine him, in company with the physician who had given the certificate, on the morning of the day of trial, and the opinion of both.physicians showed that the defendant had recovered from the illness set out in the certificate.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-12\">Indictment for selling liquor.

Tanner, Attorney-General, </em>for State.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A4gK\"><em>John M. Brennan, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Under the long and well-settled practice in this State, the attorney-general has control of his docket, and after it has been set down for trial and due notice thereof given, he may try the cases in such order as he sees fit. The defendant having been duly notified that all the indictments against him were down for trial on the day in question, he was bound to be ready or to show good cause why he was not, which he failed to do ; and hence this branch of the second ground for new trial cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\"><bracketnum>(2)</bracketnum> As to the contention of the defendant that he was ill and unable to proceed with the trial, it appears that while he did produce a physician\u2019s certificate to that effect, it also appears that the court, upon motion of the attorney-general, sent another physician to examine the defendant, who made report that on the morning of the day of the trial he examined the defendant, in company with the physician who had previously given the certificate referred to, and that in the opinion of both of said physicians the defendant had' recovered from the illness set out in said certificate. Upon this report being made to Mr. Justice Wilbur, he allowed the attorney-general to proceed with the trial of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">In view of these facts we cannot say that the defendant was unfairly or improperly forced to a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Petition for new trial denied, and case remanded for sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
