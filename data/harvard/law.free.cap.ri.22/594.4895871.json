It appears that the goods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>alleged to have been converted were leased on May 5, 1900, and that the assignment was made June 26, 1900. \u25a0 The alleged conversion by demand and refusal, if any there was, occurred after that. Hence, according to <em>Meyers </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>11 R. I. 180, the title to the goods had passed to the assignee, and the action should have been brought in his name.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AlK\"><em>F. H.
