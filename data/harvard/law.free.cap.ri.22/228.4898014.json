The petition sets forth that at a caucus for the election of a ward committee for the fifth ward of the city of Pawtucket, the petitioners received a majority of the ballots cast by the electors, as members of the ward committee as counted and announced by the warden, but that the warden refused to issue certificates of election; that upon a recount the petitioners were declared elected and certificates of election issued to them, by virtue of which they became members of the ward committee and also entitled to be members of the city committee, but that the respondents, the other duly-elected members of the city committee, refused to recognize the petitioners as members of said city committee, but recognized other persons as entitled to said offices. The petitioners prayed that a writ of <em>mandamus </em>might issue commanding the respondents to recognize the petitioners as members of the said committees. The respondents moved for the dismissal of the petition for various in-formalities, and because upon the allegations <em>mandamus </em>would not lie.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"A2d\">Heard on motion to dismiss, and petition dismissed.</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AGt\"><em>James E.
