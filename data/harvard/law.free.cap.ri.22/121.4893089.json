The husband was the only witness to the alleged contract, and under Glen. Laws R. I. cap. 244, \u00a7 37, the husband is not permitted to disclose any communication made to him by his wife during their marriage, except in trials for divorce. No exception was taken on this ground, but, since the statute is founded on reasons of public policy, it cannot be waived by the parties. <em>Campbell </em>v. Chace, 12 R. I. 333. Though the parties were not husband and wife at the time of the trial, the same reasons of policy would preclude a disclosure of the communica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>tion after the dissolution of the marriage as well as before, and such was the evident purpose of the statute.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AdYH\"><em>Franklin P. </em>Owen, for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A5r\"><em>Robert W. </em>Burbank, for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b194-3\">The case is remitted to the Common Pleas Division, with direction to enter judgment for the defendant for costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
