Y. 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">In the case at bar it was necessary to prove that the owner was a corporation and that it existed under the name alleged in the indictment; and as this was done, everything was proved that was necessary to have been averred in the indictment regarding ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">We are aware of the rule that no allegation, whether it be necessai-y or unnecessary, which is descriptive of the identity of that which is legally essential to the charge in the indictment can ever be rejected as surplusage. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fitzpatrick, </em>4 R. I. 269. For instance : In an indictment for the larceny of a \u201c black horse \u201d the case cannot be made out by proof that the horse stolen was of some other color. And the same strictness of proof is required where a <em>place </em>is mentioned in an indictment, not as a matter of venue, but of local description-. But it is evident that the exact technical name of the State by whose authority the corporation which owned the property that was stolen was created is in no way descriptive of the identity of anything which is essential to the charge in an indictment for larceny. It is also evident that the defendant in the case at bar was in no whit prejudiced by the ruling complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">In <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of Dedham, </em>16 Mass. 141, it was held that charging in the indictment that the offence was committed by the town of Dedham, instead of the Inhabitants of the Town of Dedham, which was the corporate name, was sufficiently certain, and also that the defendants were rightly named. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Read, </em>12 R. I. 135, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>held that an error in the name of the corporation in the complaint was not ground for quashing the complaint.
