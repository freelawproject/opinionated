The allegation, therefore, based upon no fact stated, except that the defendants intend to operate a brewery, that the brewery \u2018 \u2018 will necessarily become a nuisance \u201d must be regarded as mere conjecture. If a brewery <em>per se </em>is not a nuisance, as is admitted, we cannot grant an injunction against building and operating a brewery. If the operation of a brewery in any certain way is a nuisance, <em>we </em>may grant an injunction against such a mode of operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">The cases cited by the complainants generally support our. conclusion, so far as they are in point. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>Hutton\u2019s Reports, 135, was an action on the case for damages caused by a brew-house and privy. The court says: \u201cBy which case it appeareth that although sea-cole be a necessary fuell tb be used, and that brew-houses are necessary, yet the rule in law is <em>sic t\u00edtere tuo, ut alienum non Iceclas. </em>And chimneys, dye-houses, and tan-vats are also necessary, but so to be used that they be not prejudicial to their neighbors. And in this case the jury found that this new brew-house and privy was maliciously erected to deprive the plaintiff of the benefit of his habitation and office, and that the plaintiff was hereby damnified, as in the declaration is alleged.\u201d All the judges concur in judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">In <em>Mulligan </em>v. <em>Elias, </em>12 Abbott\u2019s Pr. R. N. S. 260, the defendant\u2019s chemical works were in full operation, and voluminous evidence was before the court upon which it determined that the works as operated constituted a nuisance against which an injunction should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\"><em>Moses </em>v. <em>The State, </em>58 Ind. 185, was a criminal complaint for maintaining a public nuisance. The court held the evidence sufficient to justify conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number><em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Mauzy, </em>117 Ind. 258, was heard upon demurrer to a bill for injunction which alleged that the defendants were converting a building twenty-eight feet distant from the complainant\u2019s residence into a blacksmith\u2019s shop, and that the carrying on of a blacksmith\u2019s business there would essentially interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of the lives of complainant and his family; that the gases and smoke from the forges would fill his house with smoke and smells unbearable and offensive to his senses and very injurious to himself and family ; that the noise of the shop and its customers and accumulation and filth in and about it would destroy the free use of complainant\u2019s property, etc. The court held these allegations, except that the blacksmith\u2019s shop was to be operated, to be mere conclusions which might not be verified by the event and which did not constitute sufficient ground for granting an'injunction. \u201c It is necessary,\u201d say the court, \u2018 \u2018 in order to restrain a person from commencing the operation of a business in itself legitimate,\u2019 that it should be made to appear that the person about to enter into such business threatens and intends to conduct the business in a manner which will constitute a nuisance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><em>Coker </em>v. <em>Birge, </em>9 Ga. 425, was an application for an injunction against the erection of a livery-stable with a plank floor on the lot adjoining the complainant\u2019s hotel. The allegations of apprehended injury were such as might well be considered inevitable, and the injunction was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">In <em>Aldrich </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>8 R. I. 246, the stable was in operation, and the jury found it in fact to be a nuisance to the plaintiff, an adjoining householder.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\"><bracketnum>(2)</bracketnum> The allegation that the operation of the brewery or the business carried on there will result in the transportation over the tracks of the street railroad company of a largely increased quantity of merchandise would be equally probable if the brewery were to be located anywhere on the line of the road miles away from the homes of the complainants. The company, if licensed to carry freight and passengers, must carry them in such quantity and numbers as increasing business and population may demand. The additional annoyances to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>persons residing on the line of the road is clearly <em>damnum absque injuria.</em></p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ap0y\"><em>T.
