It is perfectly clear from the will that the estate was to be sold. The will contained no residuary clause, except by providing that each of the legatees should be entitled to receive a proportional part of the surplus. The expression of desire was equivalent to a direction to sell. The limitation of time was dependent upon obtaining a suitable price. It evidently meant that while she desired a speedy sale she did not want the estate sacrificed by a sale before a suitable price could be obtained. We think, therefore, that the executor has authority to sell and is entitled to a decree for specific performance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
