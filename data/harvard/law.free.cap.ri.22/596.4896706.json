Guardian and Ward.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b668-17\">Gen. Laws R. I. cap. 196, \u00a7 7, authorizes a Probate Court to appoint a guardian of the person and estate of a person who, \u201cfrom want of discretion in managing his estate, shall be likely to bring himself or family to want, or to render himself or family chargeable.\u201d The decree of the Probate Court found that the person was lacking in discretion, but did not find that he was likely to bring himself to want or render himself chargeable :\u2014</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b668-18\"><em>Held, </em>that the decree was not sufficient to warrant the appointment of a guardian.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b668-19\"><em>Held, </em>further, that the court had jurisdiction of the proceedings, and the decree only was erroneous.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-20\">Certiorari seeking to quash certain probate proceedings, the nature of which appears in the opinion.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b668-21\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AsJ\">\n<bracketnum>(1)</bracketnum>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Abz6\">The court is of opinion that, as the petition was filed by the ward himself, the provision relating to notice, Gen. Laws cap. 196, \u00a7 17, is not applicable. It would be quite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>unnecessary to serve a notice upon a petitioner, not insane or <em>\u25a0non compos </em>mentis, of the pendency of his own petition.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AyA\"><em>H.

Quinn, </em>for guardian.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b669-3\">The statutory authority to appoint a guardian in a case like this is the fact that a person \u00a3 \u00a3 from want of discretion in managing his estate shall be likely to bring himself or family to want, or to render himself or family chargeable. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><bracketnum>(2)</bracketnum> The decree in this case simply shows that the court found the petitioner to be lacking in discretion. It did not find that he was likely to bring himself to want or to render himself chargeable. The decree, therefore, was not sufficient to warrant the appointment of a guardian. The court had jurisdiction of the proceeding, and the decree only was erroneous. <em>Hopkins </em>v. Howard, 20 R. I. 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The decree is therefore quashed, and the. case remitted to the Court of Probate of Pawtucket with direction to re-open the same and to set a time for entry of decree, or for further hearing, upon notice to the petitioner of at least ten days prior thereto.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
