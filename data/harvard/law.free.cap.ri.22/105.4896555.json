The declaration in the first count alleged that defendant was an owner of an office-building and operated elevators for the transportation of passengers therein; that plaintiff, having business with one of the tenants in said building, entered an elevator; that de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>fendant\u2019s servant opened the door of the elevator and thereby invited plaintiff to walk out onto the floor of the building-before the floor of the elevator was level with the floor of the building- and while the elevator was in motion, whereby plaintiff\u2019s foot was crushed between the floor of the elevator and the floor of the building, caused by the moving upward of the elevator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-4\">In a second count the declaration alleged that after the elevator had reached the floor where plaintiff wished to alight, so that plaintiff could safely step out, the elevator having practically come to a stand-still, that the servant of defendant opened the door of the elevator, thereby inviting plaintiff to leave the elevator ; and while she was passing out the defendant\u2019s servant caused the elevator to move upward, whereby the plaintiff was injured.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b178-5\">Heard on demurrer to declaration.

The count is objectionable also in alleging that the defendant\u2019s \u201cservant opened the door of the elevator which opened onto the fifth floor, and thereby invited the plaintiff to walk out of said elevator onto said fifth floor before the floor of the elevator was level with said fifth floor, and while it was in motion.\u201d This is pleading a conclusion of law as to the invitation, and is also stating a proposition to which we cannot assent. Eor it does not necessarily follow that because the defendant\u2019s servant opened the door of the elevator he thereby as matter of law invited the plaintiff to leave the elevator. Such an implied invitation would depend upon circumstances. If the door was opened after the elevator had reached the floor in question and come to a stand-still, an invitation to step out would clearly be implied; but if it was opened before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>reaching the floor and coming to a stand-still, or practically doing so, no invitation ought to be implied on the part of the passenger. Brakemen on railroad trains usually open the gates on the platforms and also open the doors of the cars just before reaching a station, and they also announce the name of the station ; .but no one would treat this as an invitation to alight until the train had come to a stand-still. In <em>Chafee </em>v. <em>Ry. Co., </em>17 R. I. 661, this court held that the implied invitation to a passenger to cross the track, if necessary, in order to board a train, does not continue after the train has started. The allegation as to the invitation is therefore objectionable ; and while the count is not demurrable for this reason, as this part thereof might-be rejected or stricken out as surplusage, 12 Ency. PI. &amp; Pr. 1028, we think attention should be called thereto in order that we may not appear to approve thereof. See <em>Martello </em>v. <em>Fusco, </em>21 R. I. 572.</p>\n<p id=\"AgM\"><bracketnum>(3)</bracketnum> We think the second count states a cause of action. It sets out in substance that after the elevator had reached the fifth floor, and while the plaintiff was passing out of the elevator onto said floor (she having been invited to leave the elevator by the servant by opening the door after arriving at this floor), the defendant\u2019s servant caused the elevator to move upwards, whereby one of the plaintiff\u2019s feet was caught between the floor of the elevator and the fifth floor of the building and injured. This count, as we understand it, alleges that the elevator had reached the fifth floor or was so near to the level thereof that the passengers could easily and safely step out upon said floor; that the elevator had either absolutely or practically come to a stand-still; that the door had been opened to enable the passengers to alight; and that while the plaintiff was stepping out the elevator was started up again and the plaintiff\u2019s foot caught as aforesaid. The count is not so accurately drawn as it might he, hut, construing it as we have, we cannot say that it is demurrable.</p>\n<p id=\"AWF\">The demurrer to the first count is sustained, and the demurrer to the second count is overruled.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AyU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number><em>JEJ.
