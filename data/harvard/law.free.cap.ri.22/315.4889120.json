In <em>Spalding </em>v. <em>Bainbridge, </em>12 R. I. 244, construing Gen. Stat. cap. 195, \u00a7 26, the language was that upon cause shown the court <em>shall </em>require surety. The court held that, although the statute was peremptory in form, the matter was still left to the discretion of the court. Gen. Laws E. I. cap. 247, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, 4, are suin' stantially the same, except that section 4 uses the words \u201c shall be dismissed \u201d in place of the former words <em>\u201c </em>may be dismissed.\u201d These words, however, are no more mandatory than those construed in <em>Spalding </em>v. <em>Bainbridge. </em>They clearly mean that, upon a refusal to comply with the order of the court, the action or suit shall be dismissed. But the court may extend the time for giving surety, and the acceptance of the surety in this case, after the time first named had expired, amounted to nothing more than an extension of time. The court is, therefore, of opinion that the order was properly made, and the respondents\u2019 motion for an order of dismissal is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
