That on the same day he was notified to cease his work by the town sergeant, acting under the orders of the town council, and that in pursuance of such notice he at once ceased operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-15\">That the site of the school-house was finally located by the school committee of the town on the northwest corner of the common, and that on September 19th, 1895, this location was ready for the plaintiff to work upon, and that he at once began work thereon and finished the building on September 16, 1896. This building was duly accepted by the proper authorities, and the money due under this contract \u2014 $18,300\u2014together with some allowances for extra work, was duly paid to the plaintiff, the following receipt being given by him at the time of the last payment, viz. :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-16\">\u201cBristol, R.

Wherefore, by reason of the aforesaid, the said town became liable to pay to the plaintiff all of said sums, and in consequence of such liability impliedly undertook and promised to pay the same. All of which is to the plaintiff\u2019s damage eight thousand ($8,000) dollars.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-3\">Then follows an averment that the claim was duly presented to the town council and disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><bracketnum>(1)</bracketnum> The town now petitions for a new trial because it says that the verdict was against the law and the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The gist of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action is damages caused by the wrongful delay of the town in selecting a location for the school-building in question. And the first question which arises is as to the obligation of the town under this contract to select and furnish a site for the proposed school-house.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Section 4, chapter 60, of the General Laws provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">\u201cThe school committee,shall locate all school-houses, and shall not abandon or change the location of any without just cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">It follows, consequently, that the building-committee mentioned in this contract had no power to locate the school-house in question, neither did the town council have that power. The attempt by the building-committee to locate the schoolhouse on the middle of the north side of the common on August 13, 1895, was a mere nullity. The statute confided entire jurisdiction over the selection of the site for the schoolhouse to the school committee of the town, a body over whom neither the building-committee nor the town council had any jurisdiction. Neither body could require the school committee to locate the school-house where the contract called for it to be located, or, indeed, could compel that body to locate the school-house at all. It should be borne in mind that the town has paid the full contract price \u2014 $18,300\u2014which was called for by the contract, and that this action is not for any part of that amount. If the plaintiff saw fit to contract for the erection of a school-house before a location had been selected therefor by the only body authorized by law to locate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>the same, he cannot now sue the town because a body of public officers who were not parties to this contract did not locate the building where he expected it would be located or within the time in which he considered they should have acted. Briefly stated, the town cannot in this action be held liable for the failure of the school committee to act in the matter of the location.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">In <em>Howland </em>v. <em>School </em>District, 15 R. I. 186, decided in 1885, the court, speaking by Chief Justice Durfee, says, concerning the power of a school district to locate a school-house: \u201cPossibly it may be thought that the vote to locate implies a vote to erect and is, therefore, equivalent to it. We do not think so. The vote to locate was, in point of law, a mere nullity, the power to locate being in the school committee. The vote was merely the expression of a preference. The statute contemplates that the selection of the site shall precede the vote to build.\u201d- And in <em>Gardiner's Appeal, </em>4 R. I. 602, Ames, C. J., says: \u201cThe school committee of Jamestown, acting by a majority, have, according to the <em>discretionary </em>power vested in them by law, determined the place of the new school-house to be built in District No. 1 of their town. . . . As, however, the <em>discretion </em>to decide this question is, by law, vested in the <em>school committee, </em>I can see no wrong done any one by their decision, however unwise it may be, and no question for the commissioner, upon appeal, to determine.\u201d This last decision was modified, as to the right of appeal to the school commissioner, in <em>Cottrell's Appeal, </em>10 R. I. 615, where, at page 619, Potter, J., says that the location established by the commissioners on appeal \u2018\u2018 could not be changed without bringing proceedings again before the committee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">But it may be contended that the plaintiff is entitled to recover because he contracted in good faith with a building-committee authorized to make a contract to erect the schoolhouse, and that he gave notice to the building-committee that he should claim damages for delay in selecting a site, and that consequently the town is estopped to deny his right to recover. The testimony is not entirely satisfactory that his claim of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>notice to the building-committee that he should claim damages was anything more than a general conversation with one or more members of the committee. But, even if that were not so, we think there is no question of estoppel in this case. The town is a municipal corporation, and this court has repeatedly decided that those who deal with agents of municipal corporations must ascertain the limits of their powers at their peril.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">In <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Coggeshall, </em>12 R. I. p. 332, decided in 1879, Chief Justice Durfee says of the case then before the court: \u2018c It is of the essence of the defence that the persons who furnished the entertainment acted in good faith,' being ignorant that the city was incapable of contracting for it. If they knew the city was incapable of contracting for it, the defence falls to the ground. But was it not their duty to know it ? And can the court entertain the supposition that they did not know it ? It is well settled that a municipal corporation, when sued directly on a contract which it is incapable of making, cannot be estopped from taking advantage of its incapacity because the party suing has acted on the contract in good faith, supposing it to be legal, for the reason that any person who contracts with such a corporation, which is a creature of public law, is bound at his own peril to know the extent of its capacity.\u201d See cases cited. See also <em>Farnsworth </em>v. <em>Pawtucket, </em>13 R. I. p. 88; <em>Mathewson </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>19 R. I. 16; <em>McAleer </em>v. <em>Angell, </em>19 R. I. 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">It was conceded at the argument, by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, that on the 19th day of September, 1895, after the delay in-selection of the lot, the town could not have required the plaintiff to perform the contract if he had refused so to do. We are clearly of the opinion that his election to proceed with the contract after the delay was a complete waiver of all claims arising from the delay, and that in addition he is also precluded from recovery in this action by the, receipt which he gave the town at the time of the last payment. The most favorable contention for the plaintiff is that his cause of action arises out of the contract in question, and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>has acknowledged full payment of all sums due him thereunder.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A6b\"><em>Henry W. Hayes, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AJHL\"><em>O. L. Bosworth, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b524-3\">We are, consequently, of the opinion that the plaintiff has no cause of action, and that the case must be remanded to the Common Pleas Division with direction to enter <em>judgment for the defendant for costs.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
