The testimony disclosed the following facts : The plaintiffs are bankers, or engaged in prosecuting certain branches of the banking business, with a branch office in Boston, Mass., and with a corresponding firm, Brown, Shipley &amp; Co., in London, England. The defendant is a thread manufacturing corporation, with a mill at Westerly, in this State, and uses more or less Egyptian cotton in the prosecution of its business. One E. Von Salomon was located in Providence in the spring of 1896 and for several yeai\u2019s prior thereto, and dealt in long-staple cotton. In March, 1896, Von Salomon desired to purchase 300 bales of cotton from Gr. Erauger &amp; Co., of Alexandria, Egypt, and, not being in funds, applied to the plaintiffs\u2019 Boston branch for credit. He had obtained credit from the plaintiffs several times before in purchasing Egyptian cotton. The following arrangement was made by Von Salomon and the plaintiffs as to the 300 bales aforesaid. Von Salomon deposited with the plaintiffs $2,000 as a guarantee fund, and the plaintiffs furnished him with a letter of credit for the required amount, the terms of which letter Gr. Erauger &amp; Co. accepted, and accordingly sold the 300 bales, drawing on Brown, Shipley &amp; Co. (the plaintiffs\u2019 nearest correspondent) at 90 days, with bill of lading attached, and shipped the cotton to the plaintiffs at Boston. Brown, Ship<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>ley &amp; Co. accepted and paid the draft, collecting of the plaintiffs, of course, the amount paid by them. Von Salomon was to sell the cotton and turn over the sale notes to the plaintiffs, and the proceeds of the cotton thus sold were to be paid to the plaintiffs, and thus the plaintiffs would be re-imbursed for their advances. March 25, 1896, Von Salomon sold 150 bales of this lot to the defendant, the defendant as well as Von Salomon signing the sale note in duplicate, each party keeping a copy, and Von Salomon sent his copy to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\">When the contract between Von Salomon and the defendant for the 150 bales was made, the cotton had not arrived in Boston, but the bill of lading was in the plaintiffs\u2019 hands as collateral for their advances, and it was in their possession two or three weeks before the cotton arrived. The bill of lading was turned over by the plaintiffs to H. N. Proctor &amp; Co., of Boston, forwarders, to make entry of the. cotton at the custom-house, and who attended to forwarding the 150 bales to the defendant at Westerly. The sale note or contract of the 150 bales was a printed form with the blanks properly filled. It bore P. Von Salomon\u2019s letter-heading, and, in smaller letters under it, the name of G-. Prauger &amp; Co., Alexandria, Egypt, and then it proceeded in this wise :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-4\">\u201cProvidence, E.

Shipment due in Boston next week. Loss in weight not to exceed 5 lbs. per bale. Seller to cover cotton by insurance for the benefit of himself -until it arrives at Westerly, E. I.

Clark, Jr., Gen\u2019l Man\u2019g.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>The cotton arrived in Boston about March 31, 1896, and was forwarded at once to the defendant at Westerly, arriving there about, April 5, 1896 ; and payment would be due, according to the terms of the sale note* thirty days thereafter, or early in May. Instead of waiting for the bill of sale time for payment to mature, Yon Salomon, by arrangement with the defendant, drew on the defendant on demand for the net, after deducting an allowance for shortage in weight and discount for interest for the time before the contract maturity. The draft thus drawn on the defendant was signed by F. Yon Salomon, and it was also indorsed by him, as it was payable .to his order at the Washington National Bank, Westerly, E. I. The defendant paid it by check, and supposed the transaction was closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">All this arrangement between Yon Salomon and the plaintiffs, as to this particular lot of cotton, as well as all similar arrangements as to other cotton sold by Yon Salomon to the defendant, was entirely unknown to the defendant, who believed that Yon Salomon owned the cotton and had good right to sell it on such terms as he saw fit, and to alter the time and place of payment as he and the defendant might agree. On several occasions before this, with sale notes exactly like this, Yon Salomon had drawn on the defendant in the same way, and it had never been questioned, nor had it evoked any notice or comment from anybody. What Yon Salomon did with the defendant\u2019s checks, or the money obtained on them, the defendant did not know and supposed it had no reason to care.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 Boston manager, who had sole charge of this business on the plaintiffs\u2019 part, swore that \u2018 \u2018 he never requested the Wm. Clark Co. to pay us <em>\\i. e. </em>the plaintiffs]. The contracts did not come directly to us from the Wm. Clark Co., but from Yon Salomon. We have received the Wm. Clark Co.\u2019s checks for cotton at least once. Can\u2019t say how they were indorsed. We held these contracts; never told the Wm. Clark Co. we held them. Have all been paid except the one in question, never paid to us direct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>About six weeks after the 150 bales had been paid for on Von Salomon\u2019s draft, and about a month after the contract maturity of the sale, to wit, June 3, 1896, the plaintiffs wrote the defendant to inquire why payment had not been made to them as per the terms of the sale note. The next day the defendant replied that it had paid for the cotton March 18th <em>(sic </em>but an error for April 18th), \u201cMr. Von Salomon having made a sight draft on us through our local bank.\u201d June 10, 1896, the plaintiffs made demand by letter for a settlement for the 150 bales (in the words of the letter), \u201cimported under our letter of credit and delivered to you by virtue of your contract of the 25th March payable to us and in our hands. Mr. Von Salomon\u2019s explanations of the transactions are not satisfactory to us, and we now ask you for a settlement as per contract referred to.\u201d Some other correspondence passed between the plaintiffs and the defendant, but the defendant has never paid nor agreed to pay the amount otherwise than by paying Von Salomon\u2019s draft already referred to. June 17, 1896, the defendant caused Von Salomon to be arrested at its suit brought to recover the amount paid to take up his draft of April 18, 1896, and afterwards, to wit, on July 18, 1896, it discontinued said suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\">At the time of the defendant\u2019s bringing said suit against Von Salomon it did not know of the existence of a trust receipt given by said Von Salomon to the plaintiffs March 31, 1896, and accepted by the said plaintiffs, said trust receipt being in these words, viz.: \u201cReceived from Brown Brothers &amp; Co. the following goods' and merchandise, their property, specified in the bill of lading per Fabian, dated Alexandria, Feb. 25, \u201996, marked and numbered as follows : Sapho 601 /900\u2014 300 bales \u2014 Three hundred bales of steam pressed cotton.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">(Signed) H.

Von Salomon.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-28\">5838-14-8.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>This trust receipt was a printed form, with the blanks filled in writing to make it applicable to the property in question, date, &amp;c., the form being furnished by the plaintiffs, and the property was actually received from the plaintiffs\u2019 forwarders after getting through the custom-house, and the receipt was then delivered by said H. N. Proctor &amp; Co. to the plaintiffs, according to the plaintiffs\u2019 directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\">At the time of the defendant\u2019s bringing its action against Von Salomon, the defendant also did not know of the existence of the plaintiffs\u2019 letters to Von Salomon of June 2 and of June 18, 1896. In said letter of June 2, 1896, the plaintiffs wrote : \u201cWe estimate we shall be short some $500 when we receive Clark Co.\u2019s check. Please attend to this remittance at once, and advise us why the delay on the part of Wm. Clark Co.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">The plaintiffs\u2019 said letter of June 18, 1896, spoke of not making any new arrangements with Von Salomon until the old ones had been satisfactorily settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\"><bracketnum>(1)</bracketnum> Under this state of facts the court is of the opinion that the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover. The whole course of dealings between the plaintiffs, Von Salomon, and the defendant clearly indicates that Von Salomon was authorized by the plaintiffs to do all that he did, except to convert to his own use the amount received from the defendant. The evidence nowhere raises a suspicion in the mind of the court that the defendant, when it paid Von Salomon, had any knowledge that Von Salomon was either not entitled to receive the money or was going to make any improper use of the money after receiving it. There was nothing about the sale note to put the defendant upon inquiry as to whether Von Salomon was an agent merely, the designation of Brown Brothers &amp; Co. as the party to whom payments of maturing contracts were to be remitted not being sufficient to serve as notice to the defendant that the plaintiffs had any rights there, or were in' any different position from any other banking firm or institution where one makes or has made deposits to his owxx credit. The plaintiffs admit that Voxi Salomoxx\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>copy of the original contract with the defendant was sent them, as such contracts had always been before, though the defendant did not know it; so the plaintiffs had opportunity and could easily have notified the defendant of their rights had they not been willing to trust Von Salomon\u2019s honesty. Their course of dealing, their letter to Von Salomon of June 2, 1896, and, above all, the trust receipt from Von Salomon, in my opinion constituted Von Salomon their agent to sell said cotton and receive the money; and if Von Salomon, after receiving the money, converted it to his own use instead of paying it over to the plaintiffs, it is the plaintiffs\u2019 loss and not the defendant\u2019s. The defendant\u2019s bringing an action against Von Salomon, under the pressure of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim against it that it had been buying cotton that Von Salomon had dealt with fraudulently, does not, in my opinion, operate as a bar, an election, or an estoppel in any way to prevent the defendant\u2019s resisting the plaintiffs\u2019 action in this case, for the defendant in bringing its action was not advised of all the facts, nor of the most important one of all, to wit, the existence of the trust receipt.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A7F\"><em>Bassett &amp; Mitchell, </em>for plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Ari\"><em>John T.
