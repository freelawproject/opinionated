These are, in brief, that it was a rainy day, and that the poles of the derrick which was to be unloaded were wet and slippery. The fact that they were in this condition, and hence liable to slip while being unloaded, was as obvious to the plaintiff as to the defendants\u2019 foreman, and hence no duty was devolved upon the defendants of warning the plaintiff against the danger therefrom. Knowing of the danger, he must be held to have assumed the risk. Moreover, the assurance of the foreman that there was no danger was not within the scope of his authority to give, and hence, although acted upon by the plaintiff, was nothing for which the master was responsible. It was a mere error of judgment on a subject on which the plaintiff had the same means of knowledge as the foreman.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\"><bracketnum>(2)</bracketnum> The contention of plaintiff\u2019s counsel that the defendants are liable because the assurance referred to was given by the plaintiff\u2019s superior is untenable, for the reason that in giving it he was not discharging any duty devolved by law upon his principal. And hence his negligence, if such it can properly be called, was the negligence of a fellow-servant. <em>Brodeur </em>v. <em>Valley Falls Co., </em>16 R. I. 448; <em>Hanna </em>v. <em>Granger, </em>18 R. I. 507; <em>Larich </em>v. <em>Moies, Ib. </em>513; <em>Frawley </em>v. <em>Sheldon, </em>20 R. I. 258; <em>Morgridge </em>v. <em>Telephone Co., </em>20 R. I. 386.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar1Q\">The declaration does not bring the case within that class <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>of cases where the master is held liable for injuries sustained by the servant while acting in an emergency under the orders of a superior whom he was instructed to obey, and while doing something out of his ordinary line of employment, as was the case in <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Oriental Print </em>Works, 11 R. I. 152. In that case evidence was offered tending to show that when the plaintiff was employed he was given to understand that he was to obey the orders of his superior, the engineer, which clearly differentiates the case from the one before us.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aro\"><em>James M. </em>Gilrain, for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A2s\"><em>Vincent &lt;&amp; Bice, </em>for defendants.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The demurrer is sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
