The bill alleged that the proceedings by which said street was abandoned were void, and that the obstructions placed in said street by the respondents cut off the light from the building of the complainants.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AoK\">Heard on demurrer to bill, and demurrer sustained.</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AY-\"><em>Stephen A.

As the complainants show no title to relief, we do not see that they are in a position to question the legality of the proceedings for the abandonment of Comfort street as a public highway. Our opinion is, therefore, that the demurrer should be sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
