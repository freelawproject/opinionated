The facts are -stated in the opinion. The gravamen of the declaration was as follows: \u201cAnd it was the duty of the defendant then and there by its said agent or servant to use due care in driving, controlling, and managing its vehicle and horse so as not to collide with and run against the plaintiff, then and there riding said bicycle along said highway. Yet the said defendant did not observe its duty, but, on the contrary, so carelessly and improperly drove, governed, managed, and directed said horse and vehicle by its said agent or servant that by and through the carelessness, negligence, and improper conduct of the defendant the said horse and vehicle of the defendant ran against the plaintiff,\u201d etc. The defendant \u2022objected to the introduction of any testimony as to the character of the horse under the above count.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"Ah1b\">Heard on petition of defendant for new tidal.

He was riding on his bicycle and was on the extreme right-hand side of the road, which, at the place where the accident liajjpened, was. about sixty feet wide.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><bracketnum>(1)</bracketnum> It appears that the defendant\u2019s horse had shied at some lighted electric cars shortly before reaching the place of the ' accident, and was going at an unusual rate of speed when he reached a point opposite the plaintiff, and that he then shied at two other lighted electric cars which were standing on the switch, and ran into the plaintiff. There is evidence that the driver of the team did not have it under proper control at the time; and we think it was competent for the jury to find that he was not in the exercise of due care in this regard. He was going, according to his own testimony, at the rate of from twelve to fifteen miles an hour, on a country road, after dark; and there is evidence that the horse was a green one and had previously shied at electric cars to the knowledge both of the driver and the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"AWK\">In view of these facts we cannot say that it clearly appears that the jury were not warranted in finding that the defendant was responsible for the injury which the plaintiff suffered. The case is rather a close one, but after carefully considering* all of the evidence we do not feel that we can properly disturb the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\"><bracketnum>(2)</bracketnum> The point taken by defendant, that the plaintiff could not be permitted to prove that the horse was a green one and had previously shied at electric cars because the declaration contained no allegation to that effect, is untenable. The character of the horse, as ruled by the presiding justice, had a direct bearing upon the question of the defendant\u2019s negligence. That is to say: if the horse was an old and gentle one, well accustomed to the electric cars and never having shown any restiveness when passing them, a less degree of care would be required of the driver than when driving a green or fresh horse which had previously shied when passing such objects. For what is reasonable or due care de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>pends, in every case, on the subject-matter to which the care is to be applied and the circumstances attending that subject-matter at the time when care is required. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Scrip</em>ture, 3 Allen, 564.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AnY\"><em>Page &amp; Page and </em>Cushing, for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"APCK\"><em>Vincent &amp; Bice, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Petition for new trial denied, and case remitted to Common Pleas Division for judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
