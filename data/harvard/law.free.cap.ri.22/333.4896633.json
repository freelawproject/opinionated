The facts are sufficiently stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"ANR\">Heard on demurrer to bill, and demurrer overruled.</disposition>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b405-12\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Ao1\">The hill is filed to compel the respondent to return to the complainant certain books of the company which were loaned to the respondent, then a member of the company, for temporary examination. The bill is demui\u2019red to upon the grounds, as presented at the hearing, that the complainant has an adequate remedy at law and the triviality of the subject-matter of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-13\">Such books have no ascertainable value in money, and hence an action for damages would be quite inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-14\"><bracketnum>(1)</bracketnum> But record-books may have a great value to the complainant company as an account of its history, and the only remedy at law would be an action of replevin. The bill alleges that this has been tried without effect. The complainant\u2019s remedy to proceed in equity is therefore clear. The case is similar in principle to <em>Manton </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>19 R. I. 423.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ARlq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number><em>Walter H.
