Injunction, \u00a7 386<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when finding sufficient as basis for decree for damages. A finding in a final decree that a certain sum was due defendant for the wrongful issuance of an injunction is a sufficient\" finding of fact on which to base a decree, adding the amount to the amount of defendant\u2019s damages, although the record does not show any evidence on which such finding was based, it appearing from the record that the injunction was issued and dissolved and that a suggestion of damages was filed.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
