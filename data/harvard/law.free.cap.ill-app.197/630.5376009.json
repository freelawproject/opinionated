In an action to recover back money deposited to secure faithful performance of a lease which plaintiff abandoned before the end of the term, where defendant\u2019s amended affidavit of merits alleged such abandonment and that defendant \u201chas considered and treated said abandonment by plaintiff and her failure to pay rent as a termination of the tenancy and cancellation of the lease,\u201d a judgment for defendant is erroneous where it appears that the amount deposited was $450 and the amount owed to defendant by plaintiff at the time of such abandonment was $150, the proper judgment in such case being for plaintiff for $300.</headnotes><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-3\" pgmap=\"653\">The seventh clause provided that: If plaintiff should abandon or vacate the premises, they might be relet by defendant for such rent and upon such terms as he might see fit; and if a sufficient sum should not be realized, after paying the expenses of such reletting and collecting, to satisfy the rent reserved, plaintiff would satisfy and pay all deficiency.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-4\" pgmap=\"653\">It appeared that plaintiff vacated the premises on the last Sunday in May, 1911 owing defendant $150, as rent for the month of May, 1911.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-5\" pgmap=\"653\">After the close of all the evidence and before a finding, the defendant asked and obtained leave to file and did file an amended affidavit of merits, in which he alleged in part that plaintiff had abandoned said premises; that defendant \u201chas considered and treated said abandonment by plaintiff and her failure to pay rent as a termination of the tenancy and cancellation of the lease, and has made efforts to re-rent the premises to other parties and did so in his own name as owner;\u201d and that in finding new tenants and negotiating new leases he expended time and effort and paid attorney\u2019s fees, etc.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-6\" pgmap=\"653\">The action was tried by the court without a jury.
