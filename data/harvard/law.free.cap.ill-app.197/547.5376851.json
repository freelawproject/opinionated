To reverse a judgment for plaintiff, defendant prosecutes this writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-10\" pgmap=\"569\">For some time prior to June, 1912, the defendant operated a steam turbine at its plant in the Chicago stockyards, and purchased from the plaintiff certain gears to be used with the turbine.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-11\" pgmap=\"569(74) 570(110)\">It appeared that the gears were ordered in June, 1912, deliver\u00e9d in July, 1912, and installed in defendant\u2019s plant. After the gears were in operation from four to six weeks, some of the teeth broke. They were then taken to defendant\u2019s machine ship, turned down on a lathe, the broken parts removed and then replaced and used at intervals thereafter. After the break, defendant took the matter up with the plaintiff, the defendant claiming that the g*ears were, inherently defective, causing the break, and that the gears should be replaced without cost. The plaintiff contended that the trouble was caused by reason of a faulty foundation on which the turbine was placed. After some controversy, the plaintiff, on August 14, 1912, wrote the defendant a letter in which plaintiff reiterated its belief that the break in the teeth of the gears was due to the foundation on which the turbine rested, and suggested that defendant send the gears to the manufacturer\u2019s laboratory for testing, and intimating that if found defective such manufacturer would probably replace them.</p><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b570-11\" pgmap=\"570\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b570-12\" pgmap=\"570\">1.
