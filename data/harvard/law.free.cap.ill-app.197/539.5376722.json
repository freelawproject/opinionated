Hickey, plaintiff, against Edwin L. Reed &amp; Company, defendant, in the Municipal Court, of Chicago, to recover on a written contract whereby defendant hired plaintiff to go to Indianapolis to work for a street car company during the continuance of a strike there. To reverse a judgment for plaintiff, defendant prosecutes this writ or error.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-8\" pgmap=\"561(170) 562(72)\">The contract provided that he was to receive three dollars sa day, board, lodging and transportation. Apparently the men taken to Indianapolis merely reported for work and were ready to take out ears when ordered. \u2022 It was admitted that plaintiff reported Saturday and Sunday after arriving in Indianapolis. The defendant\u2019s assistant superintendent testified that he discharged plaintiff next day, and is corroborated by other employees of the defendant. Plaintiff testified that he reported every day during the strike, and was regularly checked, and is corroborated by one fellow-employee. Defendant\u2019s superintendent testified that beginning with Monday, no check mark appeared after plaintiff\u2019s name; that a cross was then placed after plaintiff\u2019s name, and the notation \u201copen number.\u201d The timekeeper testified that an employee was checked when he presented his card; that the sheets offered in evidence were carbons of the originals; that the checks were not put on the sheets before the parties came to the barn; and that where a man did not report, a cross was placed after his name. Examination of the carbon sheets showed that plaintiff was regularly checked each day in identically the same manner as other employees. A vertical mark appeared through these check marks, and the notation \u201copen number\u201d appeared in lead pencil. The vertical marks did not appear to be made by an impression through the carbon paper, but to have been made some time after the original entry.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b562-8\" pgmap=\"562\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b562-9\" pgmap=\"562\">1.

In an action to recover under a written contract whereby defendant employed plaintiff to go to Indianapolis to work for a street car company during a strike, defendant claimed plaintiff was discharged .two days after arriving at Indianapolis, but plaintiff \"claimed that he reported for work every day during the continuance of the strike and was checked by defendant\u2019s timekeeper, and defendant introduced carbon copies of its time sheets which showed that plaintiff was checked each day, as were other employees, but a vertical mark appeared through the check marks on the time sheets and the notation \u201copen number\u201d appeared opposite plaintiff\u2019s name in pencil, and examination of the sheets showed that the vertical marks were not made by an impression through the carbon paper but were made some time afterwards, held that the sheets tended to corroborate plaintiff\u2019s claim.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b562-10\" pgmap=\"562(53) 563(54)\">2.
