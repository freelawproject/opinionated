To reverse a judgment for plaintiff for $409.50, defendant prosecutes this writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-9\" pgmap=\"618\">The evidence tended to show that plaintiff was experienced in the ladies\u2019 ready-to-wear clothing business, and in October, 1913, was employed by a ladies\u2019 cloak and suit concern, and making $25 a week, with a prospect of continued employment. At this time defendant and one Bruns purchased a bankrupt stock of merchandise. Neither had ever been in the ladies\u2019 clothing business and they needed an experienced man to retail this stock. Defendant asked plaintiff to take charge of the sale of this merchandise, and plaintiff replied that it would not pay him to leave a steady position for a short time. An agreement was made that plaintiff should work for defendant from October 16th until the following January 15th at $45 a week. Plaintiff entered upon his duties and did the things which are usually done under such circumstances to attract customers, displaying skill and experience. The stock was smoked and burned and of old style, and did not sell at profitable prices. After a week and five days, defendant discharged plaintiff.</p><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b619-7\" pgmap=\"619\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b619-8\" pgmap=\"619\">Master and servant, \u00a7 84*\u2014when evidence sufficient to sustain finding as to wrongful discharge of servant. In an action to recover on an oral contract of employment, where there was evidence that the cause of plaintiff\u2019s discharge was the failure of defendant to do a profitable business, but where defendant attempted to justify the discharge on the ground that plaintiff made misrepresentations as to his ability, salary and length of service with his former employer, and that he was incompetent and did not perform his work in a good and workmanlike manner, evidence held sufficient to sustain a finding that plaintiff was wrongfully discharged.</headnotes><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-3\" pgmap=\"619\">Plaintiff sought to obtain other employment, and from October 28th until March 27th was able to secure a position for only three and a half weeks at $12 per week.</p><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b619-4\" pgmap=\"619\">Eben F.
