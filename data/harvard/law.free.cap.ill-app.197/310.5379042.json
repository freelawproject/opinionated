The evidence showed that by the will it was provided that after the payment of debts and funeral expenses $1,500 should be paid to defendant; that defendant should take possession of all the rest and residue of the estate and hold it in trust for a period of five years; with power to rent, repair and sell, \u201cand to do whatever else he deems best for the interest of said estate,\u201d compensation to be paid defendant for managing said estate at the rate of three per cent, at the end of each year on the fair cash value of said estate. He was not required to give bond. The will further provided that at the end of five years after the death of the testator said estate should be divided equally among Anna Marie Larson, wife of the defendant and niece of the testator, Lotta Nelson, a niece of the testator, Emil Otterbeck, a nephew, Edward Otterbeck, a brother, and Mathilda Otterbeck, wife of Edward. Defendant was appointed executor of the will without bond.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-4\" pgmap=\"333\">On May 4, 1911, the above named beneficiaries, except Anna Marie Larson, filed their bill in chancery, charging that said defendant as trustee had received considerable sums of money of the estate and had converted the same to his own use; that he had concealed trust property and was insolvent and not under bond. They prayed among other things that he be required to set forth a true and perfect account of all the trust funds and be decreed to pay what is due from him. Answer and replication were filed, and on November 13, 1911, the court entered an order finding that the said defendant had never rendered an account of the trust property to the beneficiaries, and ordered that 'the cause be referred to a master in chancery to take an account of all the trust property. The master heard evidence and filed his report with his conclusions, and stated the account of the trustee, finding the net balance due from him to be $6,403.75. The defendant filed objections to this report, which after-wards by order stood as exceptions. The complainants filed no objections or exceptions. Subsequently the court entered a decree overruling all exceptions to the</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b334-8\" pgmap=\"334\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b334-9\" pgmap=\"334\">1.
