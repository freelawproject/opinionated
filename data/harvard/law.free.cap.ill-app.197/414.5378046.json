Appeal and error, \u00a7 538<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when error in refusing motion to direct verdict not preserved for review. Where on the court\u2019s refusal of the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict made at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, the defendant introduces proof and fails to renew his motion at the close of all the evidence, the point that such refusal was erroneous is not preserved for review.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b437-7\" pgmap=\"437\">2. Appeal and error, \u00a7 800<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when motion for new trial and ruling thereon need not appear in hill of exceptions as basis for review. Since the Amendment of 1911 to section 81 of the Practice Act (J. &amp; A. If 8618) dispensing with the necessity of incorporating formal exceptions in the record, it seems that the former rule of practice, requiring that to preserve for review the refusal of a new trial the motion therefor and ruling thereon must appear in the hill of exceptions, no longer applies where the transcript of the record contains a specific order of the court overruling and denying the motion as such order presumably would not have been entered had the motion not been made, and as it need not have been in writing nor an exception to the ruling preserved, the reason for the rule has failed.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b437-8\" pgmap=\"437\">3. Theaters and shows, \u00a7 4<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence sufficient to sustain verdict for damages for personal injuries. A verdict for the plaintiff for personal injuries is not manifestly against the weight of evidence where the evidence tends to show that defendant eonduct\u00e9d a theater on his premises, in the lobby of which were pictures and advertisements hung for the public to come in and see, and that in the wall of the lobby a radiator was so insecurely fastened that without apparent negligence on the part of the plaintiff, a minor, it fell out of its place upon him and injured him while he was looking at the pictures, the circumstances being such as to raise the inference of neglect on the part of defendant to have the radiator so fastened that it would not fall over from contact with it such as might be expected in a public place.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b437-3\" pgmap=\"437\">John E.
