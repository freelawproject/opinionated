Hale, complainant, against Clara Hale, defendant. From a decree dismissing his bill for want of equity, complainant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-7\" pgmap=\"383\">Complainant charged defendant with having committed adultery with one Clinton Vail on the 15th day of September, 1911, and on the 24th day of March, 1913, and the place of the adulterous intercourse was alleged to be the City of Chicago, and he also charged generally, but not specifically, other adulterous acts with Vail.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-8\" pgmap=\"383\">The answer of the defendant denied categorically the two acts of adultery specifically charged and also denied that she committed adultery at any other time or times with Vail. It is likewise charged in the bill and admitted in the answer that one child was born as the fruit of the union between the parties, a daughter, Frances Hale, who was between six and seven years of age at the time of the filing of the bill. A replication was filed to the answer and the cause was tried before the court on the pleadings thus formed.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-9\" pgmap=\"383(72) 384(42)\">Complainant\u2019s proof to sustain his charges of adultery were based upon the alleged confession of his wife made on the 16th day of September, 1911, and as to the adultery charged to have been committed on March 24, 1913, on the testimony of two detectives. The alleged confession defendant denied in toto. The evidence showed that the \"parties continued to live in the marital relation from that time until the middle of May, 1912; that complainant did not finally leave his wife until August 7, 1912, and letters written by him to her during that time were couched in 'affectionate terms, without any reference to defendant\u2019s having fallen from marital rectitude.</p><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b384-11\" pgmap=\"384\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b384-12\" pgmap=\"384\">1.

On a bill for divorce on the ground of adultery, evidence of private detectives employed by complainant to shadow defendant, which shows that they followed her and the co-respondent for several weeks and saw them together at times, but only in public places and surrounded by many people, is insufficient to show adultery.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
