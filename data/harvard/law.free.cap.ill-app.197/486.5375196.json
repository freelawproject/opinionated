The Appellate Court will not disturb a judgment resting upon the verdict of a jury unless it is apparent from all the evidence that the verdict is clearly contrary to its preponderating force, or that the rulings of the court in its procedure and in its instructions were calculated to mislead the jury to the complaining party\u2019s injury.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b508-6\" pgmap=\"508\">Appeal from the Superior Court of Cook county; the Hon.

Trespass, \u00a7 49<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014sufficiency of evidence as to amount of soil taken. In an action of trespass for breaking the close of plaintiff and digging and carting away soil from plaintiff\u2019s land, evidence held sufficient to sustain a finding that the amount of soil taken and its value was as claimed by defendant.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b509-4\" pgmap=\"509\">3. Trespass, \u00a7 48<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when penal ordinance prohibiting removal of soil inadmissible. An ordinance of the City of Chicago, section 1495 of the Revised Municipal Code, providing for a penalty for the offense of unlawfully taking away earth from the land of another without first obtaining a permit, is inadmissible in evidence in an action of trespass for breaking the close of plaintiff and digging and carting away soil from plaintiff\u2019s land.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b509-5\" pgmap=\"509\">4. Trespass, \u00a7 48<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence of obtaining permit to dig and cart away soil immaterial. In an action of trespass for breaking the close of plaintiff and digging and carting away soil from plaintiff\u2019s land, evidence that defendant obtained a permit to take away the soil is immaterial in the absence of proof that such permit was obtained from the owner of the land.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b509-6\" pgmap=\"509\">5. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1466<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when admission of immaterial evidence harmless error. The admission, in an action of trespass for breaking the close of plaintiff and digging and carting away soil from plaintiff\u2019s land, of immaterial evidence as to having obtained permit from one other than the owner of the soil pilfered, was harmless error where the question involved was as to the amount of the soil taken.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b509-7\" pgmap=\"509\">6. Trespass, \u00a7 48<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence of arrest of defendant\u2019s employees for taking soil irrelevant. In an action of trespass for breaking the close of plaintiff and digging and carting away soil from plaintiff\u2019s land, evidence that some of defendant\u2019s employees were arrested for purloining soil from land of plaintiff was irrelevant, the only issue being the amount of the soil taken.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b509-8\" pgmap=\"509\">7. Trespass, \u00a7 48<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence that person not employed by defendant took soil admissible. In an action of trespass for breaking the close of plaintiff and digging and carting away soil from plaintiff\u2019s land, in which the issue is to the amount of soil taken, evidence that men who were not servants or agents of defendant dug and carted away soil of plaintiff\u2019s is admissible to rebut any inference that such men were acting for defendant, so that he should be charged with the soil removed by them.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b509-9\" pgmap=\"509\">8. Appeal and error, \u00a7 524<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when objection to argument of counsel insufficient. A general objection to the argument of counsel at the end thereof is insufficient, as objections should be specific so that the court may be able to rule thereon.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b509-10\" pgmap=\"509(9) 510(54)\">9. Instructions, \u00a7 96<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when instruction on credibility of witness correct. An instruction that if the jury believed from the evidence that any witness had sworn falsely as to any material fact in issue then the entire testimony of the witness might be disregarded, except in so far as corroborated by other credible evidence or by facts or circumstances proved on the trial, approved.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
