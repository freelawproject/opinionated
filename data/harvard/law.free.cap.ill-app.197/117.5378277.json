From a judgment for plaintiff for $4,000, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-9\" pgmap=\"139\">During the winter season the defendant operated its cars eastward on the north side of the bridge and westward on the south side, the superstructure of the bridge consisting in part of lattice work standing between the north and south tracks. The testimony for the plaintiff tended to show that the defendant\u2019s car was approaching the crossing from the west on the north side of the bridge at a high rate of speed, without sounding a gong or giving any other signal; that the plaintiff, before approaching the crossing from the south side, stopped and listened for the ringing of the gong of the defendant\u2019s street cars, and not knowing of the custom to operate eastbound cars on the north track, looked toward the east, and seeing none stepped upon the track, was knocked down and injured. Further, the admitted facts were that the tracks of the defendant\u2019s line ran within two feet of the superstructure of the bridge and that the lattice \"work thereof practically shut off the view of persons approaching the crossing from the south side of the bridge.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b140-7\" pgmap=\"140\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b140-8\" pgmap=\"140\">1.
