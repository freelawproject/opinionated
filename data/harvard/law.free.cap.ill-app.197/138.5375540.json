E. Benton, defendant, in the Circuit Court of Williamson \u2022county, to recover for personal injuries alleged to have been sustained as a result of the negligent operation of defendant\u2019s automobile. From a judgment for plaintiff for $700, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-12\" pgmap=\"160\">The declaration was in six counts, in general, charging defendant with negligence in the operation of his automobile, and with driving such automobile at a speed in excess of twenty-five miles an hour, with failing to give warning of its approach, and with failing to stop when it was apparent that plaintiff\u2019s horse was frightened thereby. Defendant pleaded the general issue, and on a trial by jury plaintiff recovered a verdict.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-13\" pgmap=\"160(20) 161(85)\">It appeared that plaintiff and a Mrs. Sanders drove to the home of a Mrs. Newton, in a one-horse buggy, for the purpose of buying some eggs. Just prior to the accident plaintiff and Mrs. Sanders were sitting in the buggy on the north side of the road in front of Mrs. Newton\u2019s house, talking to Mrs. Newton. The horse and buggy were facing west. While the women were talking Mrs. Newton stated to plaintiff and Mrs. Sanders that an automobile was crossing the bridge. It appeared that this bridge was about five or six hundred feet east of where the horse was standing.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-5\" pgmap=\"161\">It further appeared that plaintiff and Mrs. Sanders at once alighted and plaintiff went around to the horse\u2019s head, and taking hold of the bridle began leading the horse into a lot at Mrs. Newton\u2019s. Plaintiff testified that as soon as she heard that an automobile was coming, she and Mrs. Sanders at once got out, and she took hold of the horse\u2019s bridle; that the automobile was coming at a rate of speed estimated by her at from thirty to thirty-five miles per hour; that the horse at once became frightened, and began to kick and plunge and dragged her into the lot and circled around and finally threw her to the ground. Plaintiff\u2019s chief injury was to her knee, which she testified was still swollen and caused her pain at the time of the trial, some six months after the injury. Evidence for defendant tended to contradict plaintiff as to the speed at which the car was running at the time of the accident, and to show that the horse was inside the lot when the car passed, and did not become frightened until after the car passed.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b161-6\" pgmap=\"161\">Denison &amp; Spieler, for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b161-7\" pgmap=\"161\">Neely, Gallimore, Cook &amp; Potter, for appellee.</attorneys> <footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b162-12\" pgmap=\"162\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
