H. Brink and Ignatz Pilat, trading as Brink and Pilat, against M. Finkelstein and Sam Bosenthal for goods sold and delivered by plaintiffs to defendants at plaintiffs\u2019 request. From a judgment for defendants, after a trial by the court, plaintiffs appeal.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-8\" pgmap=\"421\">Plaintiffs were commission merchants and Finkelstein was a dealer in poultry. Bosenthal was Finkelstein\u2019s real estate agent and accommodated him at times by giving him checks for cash. The goods sued for were sold and delivered to Finkelstein between December 9 and 14, 1912. Plaintiffs had previously sold and delivered to him similar goods and received payments therefor in the form of checks signed by Bosenthal. It was claimed by plaintiffs that before the sale and delivery of said goods, Bosenthal had promised to pay for them over the telephone. Bosenthal denied that he had made any such promise, or that he ever talked over the telephone to or saw plaintiffs until after the transactions sued on were had, when he endeavored to effect a settlement. He said that when he gave the checks in question it was for cash given him by Finkelstein to the amount of plaintiffs\u2019 bills. He was corroborated by Finkelstein.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b421-9\" pgmap=\"421\">Q. J.
