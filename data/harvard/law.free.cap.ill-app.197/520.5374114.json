Ott, Mabel C. Ott, Henry Shrik and Lucy Shrik, defendants, in the Municipal Court of Chicago, to recover on a promissory note. To reverse a judgment for defendants, plaintiff prosecutes this writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-12\" pgmap=\"542(52) 543(39)\">On July 18, 1911, the Shriks owned certain realty, upon which a loan of $3,000 was negotiated by John P. Foerster &amp; Company, mortgage bankers. The Shriks executed a principal promissory note of $3,000, due in five years, with interest semiannually at six per cent, per annum, and evidenced by ten interest notes or coupons. All were made payable to and indorsed by the makers, and provided that unless otherwise specified in writing by the holder, they should be payable at the office of John P. Foerster &amp; Company, Chicago.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-4\" pgmap=\"543\">On May 16, 1912, the Shriks sold the real estate to the Otts, subject to the incumbrance of $3,000.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-5\" pgmap=\"543\">The evidence further showed that during December, 1913, the Shriks received notice from John P. Foerster &amp; Company that interest coupon No. 5 for $90 would be due January 18, 1914; that on January 6, 1914, one Thies, a brother-in-law of defendant Louis Ott, paid the cashier of John P. Foerster &amp; Company $90 to take up the interest coupon; that the cashier stated that the note had not yet been received, but he gave him a receipt in the following form:</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b543-8\" pgmap=\"543\">\u201cNo. 468.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AAB\" pgmap=\"543\">Chicago, Jan. 6,1914.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-9\" pgmap=\"543\">\u201cReceived of Louis A.

Foerster.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-12\" pgmap=\"543\">that on January 9,1912, John P. Foerster &amp; Company were forced into involuntary bankruptcy and did not pay the $90 to plaintiff; that the interest coupon, at the time payment was made by the Otts, and since then, was in possession of the plaintiff.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-13\" pgmap=\"543\">The evidence further showed that prior to this payment, four other interest coupons had matured and were paid to John P. Foerster &amp; Company in a similar manner. All of said interest coupons were stamped across the face with the words, \u201cPaid, John P. Foerster &amp; Company,\u201d and the respective dates upon which payments were made.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-14\" pgmap=\"543\">It also appeared that counsel for the plaintiff were also counsel for John P. Foerster &amp; Company in the bankruptcy proceedings, and that the claim of plaintiff\u2019s, based upon this same interest coupon, was proved in bankruptcy.</p><headnotes data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b544-8\" pgmap=\"544\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b544-9\" pgmap=\"544\">1.
