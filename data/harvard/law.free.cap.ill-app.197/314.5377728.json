J ones were appointed executors and were given \u201cfull power to sell my plantation in Jones County known as Ravenswood and to make a deed for the same.\u201d E. L. Haughton died before the occurrence of the transaction in question. Jones, as surviving executor, by an instrument in writing executed by him on August 28, 1909, gave to complainants, who resided in North Carolina, an option to purchase some 18,000 acres of land belonging to the Lawrence J. Haughton estate. By its terms the executor promised that upon payment to him of $100,000 on or before November 1, 1909, he would deliver a deed to the holders of the option; the option could be and was extended to January 1, 1910, under certain of its provisions. On November 16, 1909, this option was assigned by complainants to the defendant John M. Gartside, who in consideration for such assignment agreed to pay or to secure the payment of $10,000, and on December 21, 1909, a mortgage was executed by defendants and delivered to complainants, which mortgage complainants seek to foreclose.</p><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b337-8\" pgmap=\"337\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b337-9\" pgmap=\"337\">1.
