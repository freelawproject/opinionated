Broxham, plaintiff, against James J. Harrington, Jr., defendant, to recover money expended by the plaintiff in redeeming from a sale of property for an unpaid special assessment which the plaintiff claimed the defendant, the plaintiff\u2019s grantor of the property, represented as having been paid. On judgment for the defendant, the plaintiff brings error.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-4\" pgmap=\"477\">It appeared that plaintiff and defendant, each owning certain lots, agreed to make an exchange; that on August 25, 1913, they met at the office of defendant to close the deal; that defendant produced an opinion of title from the Chicago Title &amp; Trust Company showing that his property was subject to a special assessment for street paving, confirmed February 29, 1912, payable in five annual instalments. Plaintiff testified that defendant said that the former owner of his lots had paid the first instalment of-the special assessment, and that defendant would get the receipt from him and turn it over to plaintiff. There was evidence tending to corroborate plaintiff. On the other hand, defendant denied making such statement, and there was testimony tending to corroborate him. The deal was closed, defendant giving plaintiff a warranty deed of that date conveying the property to plaintiff, \u2018 \u2018 subject to all taxes and assessments levied for the year 1912 and to any unpaid special taxes or special assessments.\u201d Plaintiff claimed that as a matter of fact this first instalment of the special assessment had not been paid, and that after he acquired title the property was sold therefor and he was obliged to and did deposit with the county clerk $116.67, the amount necessary to redeem from this sale. Plaintiff claimed that by defendant\u2019s false representation, knowingly made, he induced plaintiff to act upon it to his loss and injury.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b477-5\" pgmap=\"477\">Rathte, Lawlor &amp; Connor, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b477-6\" pgmap=\"477\">William A.
