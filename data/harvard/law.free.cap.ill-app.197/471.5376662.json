Connell, defendant, in the Superior Court of Cook county, to recover for personal injuries sustained as a result of the alleged negligence of defendant in operating his automobile, so that plaintiff was struck by it while crossing a street. From a judgment for defendant, plaintiff appeals.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-9\" pgmap=\"493\">It appeared that the defendant was driving in the right-hand street car track in Milwaukee avenue. Plaintiff started to cross diagonally between two street intersections. The distance between the right-hand rail of the right-hand track and the curb was ten feet five inches. Plaintiff testified that he looked both ways and did not see the car, or know that one was on the street until struck. Defendant testified that he saw plaintiff when he stepped from the curb; being then fifty feet away and going at the rate of ten miles an hour; that the horn of his car was sounded five or six times, but as plaintiff paid no attention he applied the brakes and locked his rear wheels, but the track was wet and the car slid and struck plaintiff. The action was tried by jury and there was a verdict of not guilty.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b493-10\" pgmap=\"493\">Thomas E. Swanson and Elwyn E.
