The verdict and judgment were for $12,000.

Pain of mind I understand to be an element.

If she is to be anything, or do anything, she has got to go out and earn a living, or attempt to do so; unless this jury does what we consider the fair and right thing. Now here. What ought to be a sufficient sum to maintain that child? What is she really damaged? * * * Yes, I know your game. I didn\u2019t interrupt you. I know you are taking all my time you can, and trying to break me up before this jury.

What ought to keep her through her life? I say to you she can not have an investment at a much safer percentage than five per cent. What would that bring her? Would you ask this girl, in her condition, to live on less than $1,000 a year? Don\u2019t you think that would be fair and right? When everything now, and everything that she has got to meet and take care of is taken into consideration? Do you mean to say that would be too much? Now, gentlemen of the jury, consider it well.

Is that too much?</p><p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-7\" pgmap=\"425\">Mr. H. I object to the argument, if your Honor please, that there is anything in the law that allows any damages based on a percentage derived from a principal, for the reason that the principal never comes back to the other party. It is not\u2014</p><p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-8\" pgmap=\"425\">Mr. B. Oh, now\u2014</p><p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-9\" pgmap=\"425\">Mr. H.

I have pondered this thing well. I will give you my opinion for what I think it is worth\u2014what would be sustained in this court or any other court, and be fair and square. Taking into consideration all the pain of body and mind that she has suffered, the money loss that she would have; all the pleasures she will be deprived of. Gentlemen of the jury, what does it mean? Is $20,000 too much? I say that it is not when everything is considered. Would you ask her or any human being to live on less than that or to get along? Do not turn her away now, even if she is in humble circumstances. Do not scale that down or make it too small.</p><p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-14\" pgmap=\"425\">Mr. H.

Well, I will cast that out.</p><p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-6\" pgmap=\"426\">The Court. The objection is overruled.\u201d (Exception to ruling and remark.)</p><p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-7\" pgmap=\"426\">Mr. B. Yes, I know, take it out.

Rathbone, for appellee.</attorneys> <footnote data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b422-11\" pgmap=\"422\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols, XI to XV# and Cumulative Quarterly, same topic and section number.</p> </footnote> <opinion data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b426-17\" pgmap=\"426\">Mr. Justice Barnes</author> <p id=\"Ahi\" pgmap=\"426\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b426-18\" pgmap=\"426(17) 427(31)\">The only error assigned necessary to consider is that relating to remarks of counsel for plaintiff during his address to the jury. Because their prejudicial effect is made more apparent when viewed in their entirety they have been quoted in the foregoing statement at some length.</p> <p id=\"b427-4\" pgmap=\"427\">Besides the impropriety of some of them, two things were manifest in the course of the trial,\u2014that there was unrestrained departure from the lines of proper argument and comment, and laxity in enforcing recognized rules of procedure. But for the latter the former would rarely occur and occasions for review would be lessened. But if the presiding judge neglects his duty to guide the trial and exercise the power to prevent abuse of argument and improper comment before the jury, it cannot be expected that the judgment will pass review. And if counsel will not take warning from the numerous decisions on this subject to refrain from transgressing the well-known limitations a fair' trial and dispassionate consideration of the evidence prescribe, they must attribute the loss of benefits to their excess of zeal or indiscretion and not to a disposition of reviewing courts lightly to disturb the verdict of a jury. It is as essential to the attainment of justice as to the dignity of the court that abuses of this sort should not be tolerated. \"</p> <p id=\"b427-5\" pgmap=\"427(124) 428(163)\">To be specific. On several occasions when defendant\u2019s counsel sought a ruling on his objections he was ' compelled, apparently without assistance of the court, to dissuade plaintiff\u2019s counsel from pressing the argument objected to before a ruling could be obtained. The exercise of the undoubted right to demand a ruling on objections was not only repeatedly interfered with by continuing the line of argument without giving opportunity for a prompt ruling, but freely characterized, without rebuke or admonition of the court, as purposely intended \u201cto break up\u201d counsel\u2019s argument. To emphasize it, he declared that he \u201cexpected it,\u201d and knew opposing counsel would try \u201cto break him up,\u201d and instead of appealing to the court if he needed protection, invited the jury\u2019s consideration of Ms disadvantage in being \u201cinterrupted and bully-ragged every minute. \u2019 \u2019' Remarks of this kind were improper even when the rulings were in his favor. But when against him they took the form of appealing from judge to jury of the impropriety not only of counsel\u2019s \u201cinterruptions\u201d but of the rulings of the court. When the court sustained objection to the remark as to his client\u2019s matrimonial prospects, he said to the jury, \u201cwhat is the use of our beating around the bush?\u201d When objection was sustained to \u201cstaking his opinion and reputation\u201d as to what the damages should be, he said: \u201cGentlemen, I see that I can not make much of a talk here to-day, but I don\u2019t care what it is, you can judge between us both. * * * I have told you what I believe this amount ought to be and I ask you to give it.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b428-6\" pgmap=\"428\">Again, when improper remarks were objected to they were withdrawn frequently with the remark that it was done \u201cto save time\u201d and without a ruling of the court, thus leaving the jury to consider both their propriety and the necessity of counsel\u2019s suggested sacrifice.</p> <p id=\"b428-7\" pgmap=\"428\">We cannot believe that such procedure was without prejudice to defendant, and its extent cannot be measured. It was calculated to warp the jury\u2019s judgment as to the evidence as well as the amount of the verdict. A remittitur would not cure the error even if we were disposed to regard the amount of the verdict as excessive. It was at least large.</p> <p id=\"b428-8\" pgmap=\"428(88) 429(127)\">. It was the duty of the court to pass on objections when made that the jury might be guided by its rulings, and it was the duty of counsel to stop his argument until the ruling was made. It was the court\u2019s duty not only to require him to cease, but not to permit his reflections on the exercise of the legal right to interpose objections. It was for the court to pass upon the grounds and not for the jury on the motives of objections. Being unacquainted with technical procedure or the necessities therefor, the jury should not have been left by absence of the proper conduct and guidance of the trial to infer that the objections were resorted to as a mere device to interrupt counsel\u2019s argument and consume his time. We would not reverse for occasional infractions of this kind, but when they are so numerous as to show a clear disregard of the settled course of procedure designed to insure a fair hearing and protect parties to a trial from injustice, we are constrained to reverse the judgment even though it might otherwise stand. The responsibility of the result is not with us, but that of upholding the guaranties surrounding a fair trial is.</p> <p id=\"b429-4\" pgmap=\"429\">But if the unwarranted obtrusion of counsel\u2019s individual opinion as to the amount of damages, the argument that the basis of the verdict should be an amount sufficient to produce an income that would support the minor the rest of her life, the reference to her \u201chumble circumstances,\u201d the allusion to her going down \u201cinto the valley of the shadow of death\u201d while under the anesthetic, and the discussion of mental pain and spoiled matrimonial prospects, would not separately call for a reversal of the judgment, when taken together in connection with the course of procedure above alluded to, they undoubtedly would.</p> <p id=\"b429-5\" pgmap=\"429\">Reversed and remcmded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
