Schmidt, plaintiff, against the Marine Mi Hr Condensing Company, defendant, to recover the balance of the price of milk sold the defendant. From a judgment for plaintiff, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-9\" pgmap=\"301(195) 302(154)\">The defendant was engaged in the business of purchasing milk and the plaintiff had been delivering milk to the defendant, the delivery for each month being settled and paid for on or about the 15th of the succeeding month. During the month of October, 1913, the plaintiff had delivered to the defendant 6,563 pounds of milk, and on or about the 11th or 12tli of November the plaintiff visited the office of the defendant and there met the president. The purpose of his-visit was to make prices for milk for six months from October 1st, and he then had a conversation with the president of the defendant company who told him that $1.85 per hundred would be paid him for six months beginning October 1, 1913, the milk to be delivered at Marine. Shortly thereafter the defendant caused to be published in the Marine Telegram the following notice: \u201cNotice is hereby given that the Marine Milk Condensing Company guarantees an average price of $1.85 per hundred for milk for the six months beginning October 1st and ending April 1st. Henry Bieke, Manager.\u201d The plaintiff saw and read this notice about the time of its insertion and continued to deliver milk to the defendant until April 1st. At the end of each month a statement was sent from the main office of the defendant to their agent at Marine, together with a check for the amount of milk delivered during that month. It appears that for the month of October the check was $1.75 per hundred, February $1.80 per hundred, and March $1.75 per hundred, and the other months was $1.85 per hundred. Each time the check was below $1.85 the plaintiff complained to the agent that it was not enough but accepted the check and cashed it, and upon the payment of the last check he told the agent of the defendant at Marine that unless they paid the balance to make up the $1.85 he would sue them. The balance was not paid and this suit was brought to recover the same.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b302-8\" pgmap=\"302\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b302-9\" pgmap=\"302\">1.
