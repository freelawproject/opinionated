Principal and agent, \u00a7 173<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what duty agent tearing down barn owes owner of stored goods. In the, absence of any privity of contract or relationship between the agent of an estate and one who without authority stores goods in a barn on such estate, such agent in tearing down such barn owes the owner of the goods no duty further than to exercise reasonable care to protect them until the owner has a reasonable opportunity to remove them.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b419-10\" pgmap=\"419\">3. Negligence, \u00a7 162<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence admissible that goods not taken away or destroyed. In an action against the agent of an estate to recover for goods alleged to have been negligently destroyed by defendant in tearing down a barn in which the goods were stored, and where the record does not show what became of the \"goods, it is error to exclude evidence tending to prove an averment in defendant\u2019s affidavit of merits that no goods were taken away or destroyed as alleged.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b419-11\" pgmap=\"419\">4. Torts, \u00a7 30<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>-\u2014when evidence insufficient to establish joint liability. In an action against two defendants to recover for goods alleged to have been negligently destroyed in tearing down a barn where the goods were stored, the record fails to show a joint liability where it appears therefrom that one defendant was the agent of the estate ito which the barn belonged and the other defendant was the tenant of a cottage on such estate who had rented the barn to plaintiff without authority from the owner.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b419-4\" pgmap=\"419\">Ota P.
