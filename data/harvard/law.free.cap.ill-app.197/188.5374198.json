From a judgment for the defendant, the plaintiff appealed.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AhZ\" pgmap=\"210(153) 211(201)\">It appears from the record in this case that on September 1, 1913, the defendant Lucian Cassont made a mortgage to the State Bank of L. H. Gilster &amp; Company, and that in said mortgage was included twentacres of growing wheat. It further appears from the evidence that the mortgage, while it bore date of September 1st, was not acknowledged or recorded until the 11th of October. On the 4th day of October of the same year defendants confessed a judgment in favor of plaintiffs for the amount of $101.10. Execution was issued and placed in the hands of the sheriff on the same day and on October 6, 1913, this execution was served by copy upon the defendants, and upon the same day defendants filed their schedule of personal property and in the schedule is included \u201c25 acres of growing wheat, less rent of one-third,\u201d and said schedule also contains the following clause: \u201cAbove property belongs to Lucian Cassout, and the mules, wheat and wagon are under mortgage, or contract to be mortgage placed on the wheat as soon as .sown.\u201d On November 19th the plaintiffs caused the aforesaid execution, then in the hands of the sheriff, to be levied upon the 25 acres of wheat contained in said schedule, and on December 1, 1913, the wheat was sold at public auction by the sheriff and bid in by plaintiff in the execution at $107.51. It further appears from the evidence that after the wheat had been cut by the defendant Lucian Cassout, and was ready to be threshed, the plaintiffs sued out this writ of replevin and obtained possession of such wheat. Upon the making of said schedule the sheriff did not select appraisers and the property set forth in the schedule was treated as exempt property. It was contended by the plaintiff that at the time the schedule was made the wheat in question had not been sown but was sown thereafter and prior to October 11th, and consequently was additional property acquired and subject to levy under plaintiff\u2019s execution as after-acquired property.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b211-8\" pgmap=\"211\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b211-9\" pgmap=\"211\">1.
