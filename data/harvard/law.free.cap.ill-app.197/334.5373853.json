The defendant was personally served, did not appear, and an order of default was entered for failure to appear July 8,1914. July 22nd the cause was heard and a decree of divorce entered and an order that defendant pay complainant $75 per month alimony. July 31st defendant filed his motion to vacate the decree, set aside the default of defendant and give him leave to answer. The hearing of the motion was continued, and February 15, 1915, the motion was denied, and from that order this appeal is prosecuted.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-8\" pgmap=\"356\">In his affidavit in support of his motion defendant stated that the decree of divorce was entered during his absence from the State. On the hearing of the motion it was admitted that at the time of the hearing of the bill for divorce, defendant was in the court house and spoke to the witnesses. The ground on which defendant asked the court to vacate the decree of divorce was that complainant had been guilty of adultery during the marriage.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b356-9\" pgmap=\"356\">Charles R.
