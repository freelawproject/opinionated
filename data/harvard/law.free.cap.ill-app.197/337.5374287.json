On the hearing\u2019 a rule was entered directing her to pay over to the administrator $2,000. From such order she appealed to the Circuit Court. On the hearing in that court the following order was entered following certain findings:</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-10\" pgmap=\"359\">\u201cTherefore, it is considered by the court that the appellant, Mary Gorlewicz, take nothing by her aforesaid action, and that the administrator of the estate of Joseph Gorlewicz go hence without day and do have and recover of and from the appellant, Mary Gorlewicz, the sum of two thousand dollars, together with his costs and charges in this behalf expended and have execution therefor.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-11\" pgmap=\"359(38) 360(40)\">The evidence showed that Joseph Gorlewicz died May 4, 1911, and had at the time of his death a dram-shop license which expired October 31, 1911.

February 13, 1912, she sold the license so issued to her for $2,000.</p><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b360-8\" pgmap=\"360\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b360-9\" pgmap=\"360\">Executors and administrators, \u00a7 62<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence insufficient to show that property constitutes asset of estate.
