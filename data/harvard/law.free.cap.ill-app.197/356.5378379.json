The order giving-plaintiff leave to file an amended declaration and an amended affidavit of claim was entered November 2, 1914. The amended declaration and amended affidavit of claim were filed the same day. The order provided that defendant\u2019s \u201cplea now on file shall stand to said amended declaration, to which latter plaintiff objects and excepts.\u201d November 25th defendant\u2019s plea was stricken out, its default taken and judgment entered against defendant. The bill of exceptions showed that defendant by its counsel objected to plaintiff\u2019s motion for leave to amend, but its objection was overruled and defendant excepted; that defendant also excepted to the judgment and prayed an appeal, which was allowed on defendant filing a bond, etc. The record showed no motion of defendant for leave to file an affidavit of merits.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b379-7\" pgmap=\"379\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b379-8\" pgmap=\"379\">1.
