Bartels, plaintiff, against J. W. Rudloff, August Rudloff and Ed Rudloff, defendants, in the Circuit Court of Randolph county. In his affidavit plaintiff charged that defendant was about to depart from the State with .the intention of having his effects removed therefrom, and that within two years last past had fraudulently conveyed and assigned his effects so as to hinder and delay his creditors. August Rudloff and Ed Rudloff filed interpleader claiming the property attached under a chattel mortgage given to them by defendant to secure an indebtedness of about $3,200. Trial by jury was waived. The court found for plaintiff for the amount of his debt and awarded execution thereon, but found for the interpleaders and quashed the writ of attachment, ordering the release of the property attached.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-11\" pgmap=\"30\">From the judgment and order on the interpleader, plaintiff appeals.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-12\" pgmap=\"30(90) 31(169)\">Plaintiff resided in St. Mary\u2019s, Missouri, and owned a farm on Kaskaskia Island in Randolph county, Illinois. J. W. Rudloff had been a tenant on this farm for a number of years handling stock and grain. Plaintiff had taken up a mortgage against the tenant, and through various transactions an indebtedness had accnmulated against him in favor of plaintiff, amounting to $3,588.68. In November, 1913, the parties attempted to reach a settlement as to the amount due plaintiff and, failing to do so, agreed to submit the matter to the interpleaders and John F. Bartels, a brother of plaintiff, as arbitrators. It was further agreed that whatever amount the arbitrators found due to plaintiff should be immediately paid or secured and that possession of the premises should be surrendered. The arbitration was never concluded. On November 26, 1913, J. W. Rudloff executed a note for $3,200 due in one year, payable to August Rudloff and Ed Rudloff, with interest at seven per cent., to secure which he gave a chattel mortgage. The note and mortgage were not satisfactory, and on December 1st he executed a new note to the interpleaders for the same amount and a new mortgage covering the same property. This mortgage was recorded December 5th, and a day or two thereafter the note was delivered to Ed Rudloff. December 13th following, plaintiff filed his affidavit for attachment. There was no proof that J. W. Rudloff was about to leave the State with the intention of removing his effects therefrom.</p><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b31-7\" pgmap=\"31\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b31-8\" pgmap=\"31\">1.

Where a contemplated arbitration is never concluded, the persons selected to act as arbitrators therein occupy the same position towards the parties as though such arbitrators had never been selected to act as such, and if such arbitrators are creditors of one of the parties to the proposed arbitration, such arbitrators have the same right as other creditors to obtain security for their debts.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b32-11\" pgmap=\"32\">9. Fraudulent conveyances, \u00a7 17*\u2014when mortgage does not constitute fraudulent conveyance to hinder and delay creditors.

If 492), although it appeared that at the time such mortgage was given defendant was insolvent, it also appearing that at such time defendant was in good faith indebted to interpleaders in the amount of the note secured by the mortgage, and that such mortgage was given in good faith.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
