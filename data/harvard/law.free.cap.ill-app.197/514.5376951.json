Landlord and tenant, \u00a7 464<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when noncompliance of tenant \u2022with demand for payment of rent does not terminate lease. Section 8 of the Landlord and Tenant Act (J. &amp; A. If 7046), providing for demands by landlords for nonpayment of rent by tenants, notifying such tenants that in case of nonpayment within five days the lease will be terminated, and further providing that \u201cif the tenant shall not within the time mentioned in such notice, pay the rent due, the landlord may consider the lease ended,\u201d does not of necessity terminate the lease on the noncompliance by the tenant with the demand, but merely gives to the landlord the right to consider the lease ended, or in force, at his option, the words \u201cmay consider the lease ended\u201d presupposing the existence of the lease, and such words being superfluous if the intention of the Legislature was to terminate the tenancy by serving a five-day notice.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b536-7\" pgmap=\"536\">2.

If 7046) were construed as terminating the lease on the noncompliance by the tenant with a notice under the statute, such construction would enable the tenant to forfeit the lease by committing a breach requiring the notice, and thereby take advantage of his own wrong, which forfeiture would be no more favored by the law than a forfeiture by the landlord against the tenant.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b536-8\" pgmap=\"536\">3.

After the service by a landlord on a tenant of notice and demand under section 8 of the Landlord and Tenant Act (J. &amp; A. If 7046), which is not complied with by the tenant, the action of the landlord in bringing either forcible detainer proceedings or ejectment would be an affirmative act showing his intention to exercise his option under the statute to consider the lease as ended.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b536-9\" pgmap=\"536\">4.

A tenant on whom a notice and demand has been served by the landlord under section 8 of the Landlord and Tenant Act (J. &amp; A.

Eulette,</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"Anp6\" pgmap=\"538\">Agent. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote> <p id=\"b538-12\" pgmap=\"538\">The foregoing facts are uncontradicted. There is, however, a conflict in the evidence as to what took place after defendant served the aforesaid notice.</p> <p id=\"b538-13\" pgmap=\"538\">Plaintiff introduced evidence that on October 21, 1913,\u2014five days after he received the notice\u2014he vacated said premises and turned over the key to a person duly authorized to receive same by defendant, and that he tendered the sum of $33.88 to defendant. for rental of the premises for twenty-one days in October, which, however, was refused.</p> <p id=\"b539-3\" pgmap=\"539\">Defendant introduced evidence that plaintiff did not vacate the premises until either the 26th or 27th of October, 1913, and that the keys were not delivered until the 28th or 29th of October; and also offered evidence to show that after -the vacation of said premises by plaintiff on the 26th or 27th\u201c of the month, he re-entered the premises for the purpose of putting them in shape to rent to the best possible advantage, as he claimed was his duty under the law; that the premises remained vacant until the first of March, 1914; that the damages sustained by him by reason of the abandonment of the premises by plaintiff exceeded the $300 deposited with defendant under the lease as security for the faithful performance of the terms thereof.</p> <p id=\"b539-4\" pgmap=\"539\">Upon this record, plaintiff claims that by the serving of the aforesaid notice, under the provisions of section 8 of our Landlord &amp; Tenant Act, ch. 80 of Hurd\u2019s Rev. St. of Illinois for 1911 (J. &amp; A. 7046), plaintiff not having paid the rent within five days as required in said notice, the lease was terminated; that because of the termination of said lease, he was entitled to the return of the $300 deposited under the clause hereinabove set forth, less the amount tendered as the rent due for the use of said premises for the twenty-one days in October that the premises were occupied by him.</p> <p id=\"b539-5\" pgmap=\"539\">Defendant contends that said lease was not thereby terminated, but that plaintiff abandoned the premises demised under said lease, and that by reason of suqh abandonment, defendant sustained damages in a sum greater than the amount deposited as security for the faithful performance of the covenants in the lease.</p> <p id=\"b539-6\" pgmap=\"539\">If the foregoing facts established a termination of the lease, then the judgment of the Municipal Court must be affirmed; if not, we must reverse it.</p> <p id=\"b539-7\" pgmap=\"539(18) 540(8)\">If the position of plaintiff is tenable, then the mere serving of the five-day notice, followed by plaintiff\u2019s noncompliance therewith, constituted a termination of the lease.</p> <p id=\"b540-5\" pgmap=\"540\">'Section 8 of our Landlord &amp; Tenant Act (J. &amp; A. Tf 7046) provides as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b540-6\" pgmap=\"540\">\u201cDemand of rent\u2014Suit for possession\u2014Joinder of claim for rent in complaint. That a landlord or his agent may, at any time after rent is due, demand payment thereof and notify the tenant, in writing, that unless payment is made within a time mentioned in such notice, not less than five days after service thereof, the lease will be terminated. If the tenant shall not within the time mentioned in such notice, pay the rent due, the landlord may consider the lease ended, and sue for the possession under the statute in relation of (to) forcible entry and detainer, or maintain ejectment without further notice or demand. And a claim for rent may be joined in the complaint, and judgment obtained for the amount of rent found due, in any action or proceeding brought, in an action of forcible entry and detainer for the possession of the demised premises, under this section. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote> <p id=\"b540-7\" pgmap=\"540\">Under the facts in evidence, plaintiff defaulted in the payment of the rent due October 1st. The landlord, therefore, as provided under section 8 supra, notified the tenant that unless the rent was paid within five days, the lease would be terminated; but section 8 does not provide that the serving of such notice shall itself constitute a termination, for that section provides :</p> <blockquote id=\"b540-8\" pgmap=\"540\">\u201cIf the tenant shall not within the time mentioned in such notice, pay the rent due, the landlord may consider the lease ended, and sue for the possession under the statute in relation of (to) forcible entry and detainer, or maintain ejectment without further notice or demand. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote> <p id=\"AcMH\" pgmap=\"540(46) 541(54)\">In our opinion, the words \u201cmay consider the lease ended\u201d necessarily presuppose the existence of the lease, after the serving of the five-day notice,\u2014or why would they be there? If the intention of the Legislature was to terminate the tenancy by the serving of a five-day notice, the words \u201cmay consider the lease ended\u201d are superfluous. We believe these words were inserted for a purpose, and for but one purpose, viz., to indicate that it is optional with the landlord, after serving a five-day notice, to consider the lease still in force, or ended, as he sees fit.</p> <p id=\"b541-4\" pgmap=\"541\">Plaintiff had committed a breach of one of the covenants of the lease. The landlord had called his attention to the breach and warned him, by serving said notice, that unless said breach was corrected, he (the landlord) could consider the lease ended.</p> <p id=\"b541-5\" pgmap=\"541\">Under the contention of the plaintiff, not only could the tenant commit a breach, but he could use that breach to compel a forfeiture, thereby taking advantage of his own wrong. Such a forfeiture is no more favored in law than is a forfeiture by the landlord against the tenant. '</p> <p id=\"b541-6\" pgmap=\"541\">In support of his contention, plaintiff cites Wm. J. Lemp Brewing Co. v. Lonergan, 72 Ill. App. 223. This case, however, refers to Dickenson v. Petrie, 38 Ill. App. 155, as holding to the contrary.</p> <p id=\"b541-7\" pgmap=\"541\">After a careful examination of section 8 of our Landlord and Tenant Act, supra, we are impelled to' adopt the reasoning set forth in Dickenson v. Petrie, supra, and to hold that under said section it is the privilege of the landlord, after serving the five-day notice followed by the tenant\u2019s noncompliance, to say whether or not he wishes to forfeit the lease, and'to bring forcible entry and detainer proceedings or an action in ejectment; His election to do either would be an affirmative act showing that he considered the lease ended. Until an act is performed by the landlord in pursuance to said notice, which could be regarded as an election to consider the tenancy ended, the tenant has no right to vacate the premises; therefore, the act of plaintiff in vacating the premises, whether he did so on October 21st or later, must be regarded as an abandonment thereof.</p> <p id=\"b542-4\" pgmap=\"542\">In this view of the case, the only question that remains for the court to determine is whether or not the damages sustained by defendant because of said abandonment were greater than the amount deposited by plaintiff with defendant to secure the faithful performance of the covenants of the lease.</p> <p id=\"b542-5\" pgmap=\"542\">For the reasons hereinabove assigned, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the views hereinabove expressed.</p> <p id=\"b542-6\" pgmap=\"542\">Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
