At the time he gave no exclamation or indication of injury, but continued working, and neither then nor while delivering the coal or going home did Gertz mention coal falling on him. Witness was working on the opposite side of the wagon. The physician testified that the cause of death was diabetes mellitus, accompanied by a gangrenous condition of the foot incident to diabetic ulcer. It was amply proved that the insured had suffered for a long time from diabetes, and that for several years before his death had a diabetic ulcer of the foot, the ulcer being two inches broad and an inch long, exposing bones one-half inch to one inch deep. Insured meanwhile frequently complained about his foot. A few days before his death some of his fellow-workmen called on him, and to a suggestion that his foot hurt because coal dropped on it, Gertz replied: \u201cNo, I\u2019 don\u2019t know nothing about coal dropping on it, \u2019 \u2019 and, again, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t remember of any coal of any kind falling upon my leg.\u201d He was then apparently in full possession of his faculties.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-5\" pgmap=\"485\">The policy insured against, \u201cbodily injuries, effected directly and independently of all other causes and solely through external, violent and accidental means.\u201d It also provided: \u201cIn the event of * * * injury due wholly or in part to or resulting directly or indirectly in or from * * * any disease or bodily infirmity, or * * * infection in any form or manner. * * * The Association shall not be liable.\u201d A further provision is: \u201cDisability resulting from * * * abscesses, ulcers, and blood-poisoning, are classified as sickness, and are covered only under the sick benefit clauses of this policy.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-9\" pgmap=\"485(55) 486(60)\">The policy covered a variety of contingencies, with variant amounts to be paid, including not only death from accident, but loss of hands, feet, etc., indemnity while disabled from accident, partial disability, illness indemnity, and some eight or nine other contingencies, including death from sickness. It appeared that after insured died, plaintiff demanded payment of the \u201cillness indemnity\u201d of the policy. This was paid, as well as the amount payable, \u201cif the death of the member results from sickness,\u201d and she signed a receipt \u201cin full settlement of all claims.\u201d Plaintiff was assisted by her daughter, an intelligent girl twenty years of age.
