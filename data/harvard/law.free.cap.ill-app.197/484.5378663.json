There was no extension of a lease where the landlord, before the expiration of the old lease, notified the tenant by letter that he would expect prompt surrender of the premises- at the expiration of the term, as he had made a lease to another person; that possession was necessary to make needed repairs and that if the tenant remained in possession after expiration of the term he would be charged double rent; and, after expiration of the term, the tenant vacated the premises after the landlord commenced making repairs, and the subsequent tender of double rent was refused.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b507-7\" pgmap=\"507\">2.
