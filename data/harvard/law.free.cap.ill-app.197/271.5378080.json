Negligence, \u00a7 216*-\u2014when instruction on negligence as modified invades province of jury. In a personal injury action based on the defendant\u2019s negligence, it is erroneous for the court to substitute the word \u201cmay\u201d for \u201cshould\u201d in the defendant\u2019s instruction, reciting the negligence charged in the declaration, seeking to confine the negligence to that alleged and charging the jury that unless the negligence was of the character so described and alleged in the declaration they should find \"the defendant not guilty, inasmuch as by such modification the discretion of the jury was substituted for their duty.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b294-6\" pgmap=\"294\">3.
