Williams, trading as Williams Grain Company, plaintiff, against Joseph Krug, defendant, to recover the purchase price of goods sold and delivered. From a judgment for the defendant, the plaintiff prosecutes a writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-8\" pgmap=\"505\">There was no personal equation between the parties to the transaction nor any prior dealings between them. The order on which the oats, etc., were delivered was by telephone, but the person who gave the order, if any was given, remains unidentified. No attempt was made to verify the order, but the oats, bran, etc., were delivered not to defendant but at a bam near 3927 Prairie avenue, Chicago, where three other Krugs\u2014William, George and Henry\u2014kept horses. The receipts for the oats offered in evidence were signed neither by defendant nor by any person authorized by or acting for him. Furthermore, the testimony demonstrated that at the time the oats, grain, etc., were delivered by plaintiff, defendant had a contract with another firm for these' commodities, which were supplied by said firm to defendant regularly during that time.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b505-9\" pgmap=\"505\">L.
