The fact that a writ of error has been issued in a proceeding to adjudge defendant guilty of contempt in failing to pay alimony, and has been made a supersedeas, does not prevent complainant from further proceeding to collect subsequently accruing instalments of alimony.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b358-5\" pgmap=\"358\">William H.
