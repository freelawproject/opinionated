Appeal and error, \u00a7 1725<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when refusal to eliminate count error. In an action by an employee against an employer to recover for injuries received by falling from a framework, where on a former appeal the Appellate Court decided that plaintiff could not maintain an action for a defect in the footboard on which he was working, it is error to refuse to eliminate a count in the declaration charging as the sole act of negligence against defendant that it failed to maintain the footboard in a reasonably safe condition.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b392-11\" pgmap=\"392\">2. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1815<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>-\u2014when instructions misleading. Instructions which permit the jury to predicate their verdict on a count of the complaint based on a theory of negligence which had been eliminated from the case on a former appeal are misleading.</headnotes><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-5\" pgmap=\"392\">This appeal is prosecuted from the second trial of the cause. On the first trial a verdict was instructed against plaintiff and the Appellate Court reversed the judgment entered on that verdict for the reason that in its opinion the facts found in the record should have been submitted to the jury for determination. The pleadings are the same as at the first trial. The syllabus on the former appeal appears in 184 Ill. App. 455.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b392-6\" pgmap=\"392\">David K.
