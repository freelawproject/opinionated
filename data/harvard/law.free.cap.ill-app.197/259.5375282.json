From a judgment for plaintiff for $2,500, defendant appeals. Deceased left a widow who prosecuted this action as administratrix for the benefit of the next of kin.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-13\" pgmap=\"281(27) 282(58)\">The first count charged that the third and fourth entries were dry and dusty and that the defendant wilfully failed and neglected to have the entries and' roadways thoroughly sprinkled or cleaned, by reason of which and while Hughes was following his duty, and while the air in the entry and crosscut was so charged with dust, and by reason of the firing of the shots the dust became ignited, causing a violent explosion in the entries and crosscut, injuring the deceased Hughes.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-5\" pgmap=\"282\">The second count charged that defendant wilfully failed and neglected to conduct into the working place of Hughes an amount of air sufficient to render the working place reasonably free from deleterious air, etc., and that the air being charged with gas and dust became ignited causing a violent explosion, injuring deceased.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-6\" pgmap=\"282\">The fifth count charged that it was the duty of the defendant to use reasonable care to furnish a reasonably safe place in which to work and that the entries and crosscuts were in a dangerous condition, in that there had been a squeeze in the mine and the air passages partially closed to such an extent that sufficient quantities of fresh air could not be forced through the passages to prevent the air in the third arid fourth entries and crosscuts from becoming deleterious. Also that the blast from the shots caused the gas, dust and other inflammable substances with which the air in the entries and crosscuts was charged and of which defendant had knowledge, to become ignited causing a violent explosion, injuring Hughes.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-7\" pgmap=\"282\">The original declaration then concluded with profer\u00ed of letters of administration, etc.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-8\" pgmap=\"282(74) 283(51)\">The sixth.or additional count was filed within one year of the time of the injury, and charged a storage of one hundred pounds of powder in the fourth west entry, and that the fire from the shots caused the powder to become ignited and to explode, injuring the deceased Hughes. This count then averred death, survivorship, and concluded with damages to the amount of $3,000, and made profert of letters of administration, and then followed this averment: Plaintiff further avers that the said defendant had elected not to he bound by an Act of the General Assembly of the State of Illinois, commonly known as the Compensation Act, and that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was bound by the terms of said act.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-5\" pgmap=\"283(315) 284(296)\">It appeared that James Hughes and his buddy, John Dunn, were employed by defendant as shot firers in its mine, and while so engaged on November 25, 1913, an explosion occurred by which the said James Hughes and John Dunn received fatal injuries. The explosion occurred in the third and fourth west entries off of the second north entry in the mine. The entries are the first and second north extending north and south, and the first, second, third and fourth west entries, which are turned to the west off of the second north. The north entries extended some distance north of the third and fourth west entries. Air was circulated by a fan, producing a downcast of air, passing into the first north entry and after going some distance beyond the fourth west it was returned through the second north to the fourth west entry, and thence west through the fourth west entry and at the end of this returned by the third west to the second north and thence south to the second west entry, thence west, returning by the first west to the second north entry, and thence passing into the shaft. There was evidence tending to show that a squeeze in the first and second west entries causing the top to fall and to some extent to stop up these entries so that the passage for the air in returning to the shaft was very much smaller in these entries than in the third and fourth entries. Room No. 9 was located about two-thirds of the distance west on the fourth west entry and north of the second north entry. Ten shots had been placed in these entries to be fired by Hughes and Dunn. Room No. 9 had two shots placed in it. There was one shot in the face of the fourth west entry, one in the crosscut being opened near the face of that entry, two in the face of the third west entry and two in each of the two stub entries off the third west and opposite the crosscut marked 12 on the plat. On the afternoon of the 25th of November, Hughes and Dunn went into these entries and fired the shots located and while being fired an explosion occurred injuring both these shot firers. It was disputed where the shot firers commenced firing. It was claimed by plaintiff that the evidence showed they commenced firing in the third west entry, and by defendant that they commenced in the fourth west entry.and fired with the air current, and defendant contended that the evidence showed that the cause of Hughes\u2019 death was firing his shots in too rapid succession and with the air, carrying the powder smoke or carbon monoxid from one shot to the other, resulting in an explosion, and claimed to be sustained by the fact that a portion of the skin of a burned hand, a portion of a little finger, cap, lamp and other things were found in the third west entry. It was contended by plaintiff that the roadway in these entries was very dusty, and that the circulation of air being very poor, the dust mingled with the powder smoke and firing the shots in succession, the standing powder smoke combined with the dust ignited and produced the fatal effect; and also claimed that there was evidence of charred dust upon the roof and props of the entry and that the dust had been burned and coked and stuck to the timbers and roof of the entry, and that the dust in the air was one of the causes of the explosion.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-5\" pgmap=\"284\">Hughes and Dunn were fonnd in the fourth west entry and at the distance of about forty feet from the second north entry.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-6\" pgmap=\"284(43) 285(71)\">Defendant pleaded the statute of limitations to the first, second and fifth counts, and plaintiff\u2019s demurrer to the plea was sustained. The cause was tried by jury. At the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the court excluded the evidence and directed a verdict as to the third, fourth and sixth counts, but refused the motion as to the first, second and fifth counts. The motion was renewed at the close of all the evidence and again refused. After verdict plaintiff was permitted to amend by inserting in each count the allegation that defendant had elected not to be bound by the act commonly known as the Compensation Act. The jury found for plaintiff.</p><headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b285-8\" pgmap=\"285\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b285-9\" pgmap=\"285\">1. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, \u00a7 12<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when not necessary to allege in all counts that employer had elected not to come under Compensation Act. In an action at common law to recover for personal injuries resulting in the death of plaintiff\u2019s intestate, a miner, sustained since the enactment of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of 1913, a general averment in one of several counts that the employer had elected not to provide and pay compensation as provided by the statute is sufficient although other counts contain no such averment, such averment being of a general character not peculiar to any count but pertaining to all counts.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b285-10\" pgmap=\"285\">2. Death, \u00a7 36<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when not necessary to allege in all counts that deceased left next of hin. Although it is usual in practice in actions to recover for death to aver in all counts of the declaration that deceased left next of kin, it is not necessary to do so, and the statutory requirement is met if such allegation appear in one count.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b285-11\" pgmap=\"285(54) 286(21)\">3. Limitation of actions, \u00a7 69<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when use of additional counts alleging survivorship does not constitute new cause of action. In an action to recover for death, where the declaration contains hut one count which alleges that deceased left next of kin, additional counts or an amended declaration averring survivorship in each count is not the statement of a new cause of action, but a restatement in amplified form of the original cause of action.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b285-5\" pgmap=\"285\">William E.

Pleading, \u00a7 56<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when count preserved as part of declaration after direction of verdict. Where the evidence as to a count is stricken and a verdict directed as to the count, the count is not thereby stricken but remains part of the declaration for reference purposes and may furnish a sufficient basis for additional counts setting forth the cause of action in a manner more accurate and legal than in the disapproved count.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b286-6\" pgmap=\"286\">5. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, \u00a7 12<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when declaration in action for death sufficient. In an action at common law to recover for injuries resulting in the death of plaintiff\u2019s intestate, a miner, sustained since the enactment of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of 1913, where the employer elected not to provide and pay compensation as provided by the statute, declaration examined and held as a whole to state a complete cause of action.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b286-7\" pgmap=\"286\">6. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, \u00a7 12<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when declaration sustained by one good count. In an action at common law to recover for injuries resulting in the death of plaintiff\u2019s intestate, a miner, sustained since the enactment of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of 1913, where defendant pleaded the statute of limitations to three counts not alleging that the employer had elected not to provide and pay compensation as provided by the statute, a demurrer to the plea held not erroneously sustained where a count to which the statute was not pleaded sufficiently alleged such election.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b286-8\" pgmap=\"286\">7. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u2014what is liability of employer under act. An employer operating under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is liable for all injuries sustained by his employees acting within the scope of their employment, regardless of questions of negligence, proximate cause or accident.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b286-9\" pgmap=\"286\">8. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, \u00a7 2<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when presumed that employer decided not to come under Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. In an action at common law to recover for personal injuries sustained by an employee since the enactment of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of 1913, it will be assumed as a fact that defendant had elected not to pay compensation in accordance with the act, where counsel conceded in argument that defendant was not operating under the act at the time of the injury and never had been so operating, although there was no evidence of such fact.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b286-10\" pgmap=\"286(51) 287(39)\">9. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, \u00a7 2<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when action of counsel constitutes declaration that employer not operating under statute. In an action at common law to recover for injuries resulting in the death of plaintiff\u2019s intestate, a miner, sustained since the enactment of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of 1913, the action of counsel for defendant in offering evidence tending to show that negligence of defendant was not the proximate cause of the injury sought to be recovered for is equivalent to a declaration that defendant was not operating under the statute.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b287-5\" pgmap=\"287\">10. Trial, \u00a7 34<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when courts reluctant to sustain objections. Courts are reluctant to sustain objections where a party has lost no rights by reason of the matters objected to and where nothing is to be gained by sustaining the objections.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b287-6\" pgmap=\"287\">11. Evidence, \u00a7 206<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what constitutes a declaration against interest of deceased person. In an action to recover for personal injuries resulting in the death of plaintiff\u2019s intestate, a miner, since the enactment of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of 1913, where the employer elected not to provide and pay compensation as provided by the act, and where plaintiff\u2019s injuries were the result of an explosion occurring immediately after deceased fired certain shots, and where defendant\u2019s theory of the accident was that the shots were fired with the air, causing the powder smoke or carbon monoxid to be carried from one shot to another, causing the explosion, a statement of deceased\u2019s buddy tending to confirm defendant\u2019s theory is a statement against the interest of the declarant, it appearing that declarant was injured by the same explosion.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b287-7\" pgmap=\"287\">12. Evidence, \u00a7 205<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when declarations of deceased person admissible.
