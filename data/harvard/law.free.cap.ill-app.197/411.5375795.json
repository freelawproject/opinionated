From a judgment for plaintiff, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-8\" pgmap=\"433\">The contract began with a recital that it was an agreement between said company and \u201cIn Old New York (Geo. Hoey, Mgr.),\u201d to be designated thereafter in the contract as manager and artist respectively. By its terms the manager engaged the artist \u201cin his specialty or act\u201d for a period of one week commencing July 6th, at the price of three hundred and fifty dollars.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-9\" pgmap=\"433\">Defendant urged that it was not a contract between the parties because Hoey was not referred to as a party in the body thereof. The contract was signed by each of the parties and the evidence tended to show that the term \u201cIn Old New York (Geo. Hoey, Mgr.),\u201d was a name used by Hoey to designate his company of performers composed of himself and his employees, and that defendant knew it was dealing with Hoey personally and no one else.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-10\" pgmap=\"433(17) 434(20)\">The court refused to permit defendant to prove whether or not one Jacobs employed by the booking agency that negotiated the contract between Hoey and said company reported to the latter a conversation he had with Hoey.</p><headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b434-12\" pgmap=\"434\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b434-13\" pgmap=\"434\">1.

Contracts, \u00a7 196<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when printed words do not control. An amusement company cannot escape liability upon a written contract with a theatrical performer for one week\u2019s service because of the fact that the contract provides that a failure on the part of either party to perform \u201csuch week\u201d shall not be deemed a violation of its terms by either party, it appearing that the parties used a printed form designed to cover various situations, including those for a longer term than one week, and this clause referred to a situation where a contract was made for more than one week.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b434-15\" pgmap=\"434(20) 435(76)\">3.
