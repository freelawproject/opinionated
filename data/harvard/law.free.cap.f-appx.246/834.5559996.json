In sentencing him, the district court departed upward from criminal history category III to category VI under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.3, p.s. (2006), and imposed a sentence of seventy-seven months imprisonment. Clark appeals his sentence, arguing that the sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to explain why category IV or V was not sufficient. We conclude that the decision to depart was reasonable, but agree that the district court failed to explain adequately the extent of the departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>The court departed based on Clark\u2019s lengthy criminal history, which included offenses not counted because of their age, several lenient sentences for serious offenses, and many charges disposed of through a diversionary disposition. A departure sentence is reviewed for reasonableness, both with respect to the decision to depart and the extent of the departure. <em>United States v. Hernandez-Villanueva, </em>473 F.3d 118, 123 (4th Cir.2007). Here, the district court adequately stated its reasons for departing. However, the court failed to follow the incremental approach required under <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 884 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">We therefore vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing. On remand, the district court should explain why categories IV and V are inadequate. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
