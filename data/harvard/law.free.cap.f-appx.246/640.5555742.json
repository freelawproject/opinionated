Dexter Harrison appeals his convictions and sentences for conspiring to commit arson and mail fraud, mail fraud, arson, and making misleading statements, all in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 844(i), 1341, and 1512(b)(3). On appeal, Harrison first argues that the district court abused its discretion by admitting the testimony of two witnesses as non-hearsay statements by a co-conspirator. Second, Harrison argues that the district court abused its discretion by admitting certain testimony as a non-hearsay prior consistent statement. Finally, Harrison argues that his sentence of a total of 180 months of imprisonment was unreasonable. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">In 2005, Harrison, with co-defendant Martin Harrell, was indicted in a 13-count superceding indictment. In the indictment, Harrison and Harrell were jointly charged with: (1) conspiring to commit arson and mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 844\u00ae, and 1341 (Count 5); (2) mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 (Count 6); and (3) arson, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 844\u00ae, 2 (Count 7). The indictment also separately charged Harrison with making misleading statements, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b)(3) (Count 13).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-13\">Prior to trial, Harrison filed a motion in limine to prohibit the government from entering into evidence statements allegedly made by Harrell to a third person essentially confessing to the arson. Harrell also filed a motion in limine to prevent the government from, among other things, discussing at trial any communication between Harrell and his wife Julie Harrell (\u201cJulie\u201d), arguing that such communications were protected by the marital privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-14\">At a pre-trial hearing, and later in writing, the district court granted Harrison\u2019s motion in part, prohibiting the government from mentioning at trial incriminating statements Harrell made to a third person until after it had held a hearing to determine whether they were admissible as non-hearsay co-conspirator statements. As to Harrell\u2019s motion, the government agreed not to ask Julie about any communications between Harrell and herself, and limit their examination to things she observed. The defense apparently accepted this agreement, and the court apparently took no action on this aspect of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-15\">Harrison and Harrell proceeded to trial on Counts 5-7 and 13, as well as others that are not relevant to this appeal. At trial, three witnesses testified that they had been guests at the Ramada Inn in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Donalsonville, Georgia, (\u201cthe motel\u201d) on 7 January 2002, when they were awoken from sleep by the exhaust fans in the motel\u2019s bathrooms blowing off the walls. They testified variously that heat, \u201cred reflections,\u201d and \u201cblack smutty smoke\u201d came out of the holes left by the fans, and all testified that they determined the motel was on fire and left their rooms. R9 at 6, 10-11, 14-15. One witness testified that he suffered smoke inhalation that required treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Stella Williams testified that she was working the night shift at the motel on the night of the fire. While outside smoking, Williams saw a white man wearing jeans, work boots, a tough fabric \u201cCarhart\u201d jacket, and baseball hat \u201ceither trying to enter or come out of\u2019 the ground floor utility hallway. <em>Id. </em>at 21. The man had a \u201cpump-up sprayer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>She also testified that the door to the utility hallway and the mechanical room was locked with a metal key.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Williams testified that in the next few minutes she called 911, heard an explosion, was told by a guest that the motel was on fire, and called all of the guests to get them out of the motel. She testified that other than the guest who suffered smoke inhalation, they all escaped safely. She testified that she saw a pickup truck leave the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Three law enforcement agents testified about the investigation of the fire. The agents essentially explained that the evidence found at the scene, including various plastic containers containing a red-dyed fuel and some that originally held \u201csome type of farm chemical,\u201d as well as a pump sprayer, showed that the fire was intentionally started using a mixture of gasoline and diesel fuel. R9 at 97. Two of the agents also testified that they discovered similar plastic containers and chemicals in a shed rented by Harrell and at his residence. They further testified that the utility hallway might have been accessed using the motel master keys.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">Michael Murphy, an investigator for the Georgia Bureau of Investigations, testified that in February 2002 he received an anonymous tip that led him to question Harrell in connection with the fire. Harrell told Investigator Murphy that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know anything about a motel fire, [but] that he might have some information that might be helpful.\u201d RIO at 47. Investigator Murphy testified that Harrell then stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-10\">about two or three weeks before Christmas, ... 2001, two individuals came to his barn, and one of the individuals\u2019] names was either Tracy or Stacy Williams.... Williams ... asked him did he know an individual by the name of Russ Presley. [Williams] stated that ... Presley was currently at the ... motel.... [Williams] stated that ... Presley was involved in something, was in some kind of trouble, and was afraid for his life, and that he wanted a thousand dollars, and that he wanted to talk to ... Harrell____ [Harrell told Williams] he was not going to give [Presley] a thousand dollars, but he would go help him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 47-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-14\">Harrell told Investigator Murphy that he later went with Williams to the motel, where Williams used a key to enter the first and second floor utility hallways. They did not find Presley, though they did find \u201ctwo pallets ... as if someone had been sleeping on them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50. Williams then told Harrell that \u201c[Presley] killed them both and took what drugs they had left.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Williams told Harrell that his mother worked in the motel and let him sleep in the utility hallway. Harrell then gave Williams a ride to a gas station where he dropped him off. Harrell did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>indicate whether he had reported the alleged murders to law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Harrell also told Investigator Murphy that some tools and plastic containers had been missing from his barn a few days after Williams visited him. Investigator Murphy testified that he took Harrell\u2019s fingerprints and Harrell stated that they might find his fingerprints on the walls inside the utility hallway at the motel. Investigator Murphy further testified that two days later, Harrell called him and he went to visit Harrell at his rented shed. Investigator Murphy testified that Harrell was wearing a baseball cap, jeans, work boots, and a \u201clarge farm type jacket.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61. He told Investigator Murphy he had found that he was missing a pump sprayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">When Investigator Murphy asked Harrell about his relationship with Harrison, Harrell stated that they were neighbors and that he had sold some land to Harrison. When Investigator Murphy told Harrell that Harrison owned the motel, Harrell did not react. Later, Harrell also told Investigator Murphy that he went to the same church as Harrison and stated that Harrison \u201cwas a wealthy man that lived in [a] mansion that wasn\u2019t going to give him any money, and he damn sure wasn\u2019t going to give him any money to burn a motel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Murphy also testified to interviewing Harrison, who stated that he was the sole owner of the motel and the president of Harrison and Associates. Harrison further stated that he had never increased the insurance on the motel after it was built. Harrison told Murphy that the motel was for sale for $1.3 million, and that it was subject to a $1.1 million mortgage. Harrison also stated that business at the motel was better than it had ever been.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Stella Williams also testified that her stepson, Stacy Williams, had died on 10 January 2002, of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. She testified that he had been \u201cseverely handicapped\u201d in a serious ear accident, that he had surgery twice, the second time only \u201ctwo or three months before the fire,\u201d and that he always used crutches, could not lift heavy objects, and \u201chad to have help doing everything.\u201d \u2022 R9 at 27-28. She also testified that he was addicted to prescription pain medication. Williams testified that she did not know Harrell, and that she did not think her step-son knew someone named Russ Presley.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">A surgeon testified regarding the surgery he had performed on Stella Williams\u2019s step-son, Stacy, noting that he had been in the hospital until 29 November 2001, after his second surgery. In addition, two physical therapists testified that: (1) Stacy had a \u201csignificant limp\u201d when he walked due to his accident; and (2) following his second surgery he was \u201cstrictly on crutches\u201d and was allowed to walk \u201cno more than 75 feet.\u201d Rll at 150-54, 158-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">Williams testified that she had never given the metal key to the utility hallway to her step-son, and that she had never seen him with the key. She also stated that during the period from October 2001 until the fire she was not aware of any vagrants or homeless people sleeping in the utility hallway or otherwise hanging around the motel. She also never saw any evidence in the utility hallway of someone sleeping there. Finally, she testified that the utility hallway was only two or three feet wide, with unfinished boards for a floor, and doubted that it would have been possible for anyone to live there.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">Julie, Harrell\u2019s wife, testified that Harrison was a close family friend that Harrell had introduced her to when they started dating and that the family referred to him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>as \u201cUncle Dexter.\u201d She stated that he attended their wedding, came to family birthday parties and cookouts, and even went to the same church she attended. She understood that Harrison had gone to school with Harrell\u2019s father, her father-in-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The government then turned Julie\u2019s attention to the fall of 2001, and she testified that on the evening of 18 October 2001, Harrell took Dennis Weaver, who worked on the farm with him, out to dinner. Harrell left with Julie\u2019s pistol. While Weaver was waiting for Harrell, Julie asked Weaver where they were going, and he said he did not know. Julie testified that the men did not return until 11:00 p.m. that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">\u201c[T]he next day or the next ... week,\u201d Weaver told Julie where they had gone. R10 at 137-38. Julie testified that what he told her made her pay close attention to the telephone calls that Harrell received from Harrison. When she would answer Harrison\u2019s calls, she would either give the phone to Harrell or take a message. Although \u201c[m]ost of the time\u201d when Harrell talked on the phone he would talk in the house, on \u201c[s]everal occasions\u201d he took Harrison\u2019s calls on the cordless phone and went outside to the carport. <em>Id. </em>at 139. Asked to estimate how many times Harrison called in this way, Julie replied: \u201cI would say maybe five.\u201d <em>Id. </em>She was not aware of any business dealings that the two men had at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Julie next testified that on 6 January 2002, she went to her sister-in-law\u2019s house to pick up her children and Harrell stayed at home. That evening, Harrell laid out his work clothes and put a flashlight, with brand new batteries, with his clothes\u2014 something he had never done before. Julie lay in bed that night only pretending to sleep. At about 11:00 p.m., the phone rang once, and Harrell got up and left in his Explorer. After Harrell was gone, Julie dialed *69 on her phone to see who had called before Harrell left, but it was an unknown number. Finally, Harrell came back at \u201cabout eight minutes to three,\u201d driving his father\u2019s red pickup truck. <em>Id. </em>at 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">Julie testified that she waited outside the kitchen door for Harrell, and that she heard him start their washing machine, which was in the carport, before he came to the house wearing only his boxer shorts and \u201creek[ing] of diesel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144. The next morning, Julie observed \u201ca black ring around the tub\u201d in the washing machine that she recognized, from prior experiences, was caused by diesel. <em>Id. </em>at 144-45. That afternoon, Harrell brought the Explorer back, and Julie noticed that, although it had been raining the night before, the vehicle was clean.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">On cross-examination by Harrell\u2019s counsel, Julie admitted keeping a diary and making notes concerning the events in question. Although the diary itself was not in evidence, Harrell\u2019s counsel pointed out that an entry dated 12/29 was followed by an entry dated 12/5. Julie stated that she tried to write things down on the day they happened, but did not always do so. She could not explain why the 12/29 entry came before the 12/5 entry, but did suggest she may have been trying to use up paper. She rejected Harrell\u2019s counsel\u2019s suggestion that she had \u201crecreated\u201d any entries after the fact. <em>Id. </em>at 171-72. Harrell\u2019s counsel asked Julie when she had written an entry dated 6 January 2002, but she could not remember. She did state, however, that it \u201cwould have been within a day or two.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-11\">Harrell\u2019s counsel noted that this was the last entry in the diary, and came on the Sunday before the fire at the hotel. Counsel then read from the diary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-12\">I haven\u2019t said a word, went to ... Ruby Tuesday\u2019s to eat and then grocery shop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>ping, retum[ed] at 4:45, Alicia calls and wants me to come get the boys.... [Harrison] called, so he [Harrell] goes to see him. We get home at 6:30, and he\u2014 [Harrell] returns at 6:50, said the horse was out. Laid clothes out before Garrett and I went to bed at 9:30. Woke me at 10:30, said his daddy called and had horse in the road. He returned from coming home, Arline direction, at 2:35 in the morning in the red truck. Came home and put his clothes in the washing machine, had strong diesel smell to him and clothes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 173-75. Julie admitted to writing that, but could not remember when she had written it.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">At a brief sidebar out of the presence of the jury, the government argued that, by asking Julie about the diary notes reflecting the communications between herself and Harrell on the night before the fire recorded in her diary, the defense had waived the marital privilege and requested permission to question her on redirect about those issues. After a recess, the court found that Harrell\u2019s counsel had waived the privilege with respect to the communications raised during the cross-examination, and granted the government\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">In response to the court\u2019s ruling, Harrison\u2019s counsel objected, on the basis of hearsay, to the admission into evidence of any communication by Harrell regarding the fact that he was going to meet Harrison. Further, Harrison\u2019s counsel moved \u201cto preclude [Julie] from testifying as to anything that Mr. Harrell may have told her about Dexter Harrison or going to [Harrison\u2019s].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 219. The court overruled that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">After the jury returned, Julie testified on redirect that the 6 January 2002, entry was the last one in her diary because she had taken them to her friends for safe keeping after Harrell had asked her if she had ever documented anything and she was afraid he would find them. She further testified that when she went to pick up her children from her sister-in-law\u2019s house on 6 January 2002, Harrell did not go with her because he said he \u201chad a meeting with [Harrison] over a land deal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223. She further testified that after the phone rang later that night, Harrell had \u201cleaned down and told [her] that a tree had [fallen] across the fence, ... that his dad had called and said that [Harrell\u2019s horse] was out in the road, and that he was going to get her in.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 224. Still later, after Harrell came home again, she asked him why he had been out so long and he said he \u201chad gotten bogged down\u201d and had walked back to his father\u2019s house to get his truck. <em>Id. </em>at 225. Finally, he had told her that \u201cit would be in [her] best interest to go to bed and forget all that had happened if [she] did not want to wake up dead one morning.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">Thomas Gamier, an agent in the financial investigative service division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, testified that a review of Harrison and Associates\u2019 records showed that the financing of the motel \u201calmost quadrupled\u201d the company\u2019s liabilities, was its single largest liability, caused the company to have a negative cash flow, annually pay thousands of dollars in overdraft charges, and created large fluctuations in its annual income. Rll at 186-89, 191-93, 199. Finally, Agent Gamier testified that Harrison and Associates lost $92,000 in 1998, the first year of operating the motel, $137,000 in 1999, $105,000 in 2000, and $118,000 in 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">Charles Davis, the senior vice-president of the Capital City Bank, in Cairo, Georgia, testified that the bank had loaned Harrison over one million dollars to build the motel, and that it was not generating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>enough money to cover the monthly payments on the loan. He also testified that during a six year period, the monthly payment was paid between 30 and 59 days late four times, and was paid between 10 and 29 days late 48 times. Davis also testified that Harrison had acted as a personal guarantor on the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Emmet Brock, Harrison\u2019s accountant, testified that in 1998, Harrison and Associates had a net income of $83,193, and that the motel \u201cwas a net loss of $92,178\u201d that year. R12 at 64. In 1999, the company\u2019s \u201coverall profit was $78,650,\u201d and the motel was a $137,364 loss. <em>Id. </em>In 2000, the company turned $20,112 in profit, and the motel was a loss of $104,707. In 2001, the company\u2019s profit was $57,724, and the motel was a loss of $117,502. Thus, he testified the \u201cthe construction segment of the business\u201d made the payments on the motel\u2019s note. <em>Id. </em>at 67. On redirected examination, after being asked on cross-examination about tax savings due to the losses incurred by the motel, Brock testified that he had not included tax savings in his annual financial statements for the company. Further, he did recall one time when Harrison pointed out that, even though the motel was losing money, it was saving them on taxes, and Brock replied, \u201cyes, ... but you\u2019re still losing money.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Emo Lie T. Jones, the officer manager and secretary-treasurer of Harrison and Associates, testified that she \u201cremember[ed] something\u201d about Harrison and Harrell having a lunch meeting the day after the fire, but she did not know what they had spoken about. <em>Id. </em>at 175-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Craig Presley (\u201cCraig\u201d), who had been friends with Harrell since childhood, testified that Russ Presley was his brother, and that Harrell had called him in February 2002 \u201cwanting to know where [Presley] was at, wanting] to know if he was in jail or not.\u201d R13 at 33. He testified that Harrell had not spoken to him for four or five years prior to the phone call. Craig told Harrell that Presley was living in the area with his grandfather.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">Before Dennis Weaver testified, the court held a hearing, in accordance with <em>United States v. James, </em>510 F.2d 546 (5th Cir.1975) <em>(en banc), </em>to determine whether Weaver could testify regarding statements made to him by Harrell under the co-conspirator statement provision of Fed. R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). First, the government summarized much of the testimony given and evidence submitted to argue that it had established the existence of a conspiracy between Harrison and Harrell.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">Among other things, the government argued that the evidence showed that: (1) an arson occurred at the motel; (2) the arson was an inside job\u2014there was no forced entry; (3) the motel was Harrison\u2019s only asset that was losing money; (4) only Harrison had a financial motive to burn down the motel; (5) Harrell returned from his trip out that night smelling of diesel fuel and threatened his wife, Julie, to forget what she had seen; (6) Harrison and Harrell were friends and Harrell had no obvious motive to harm Harrison, but they downplayed and misrepresented their relationship during the investigation; (7) Harrison and Harrell were in contact a number of times preceding the fire, and Harrell hid the nature of their conversation from Julie; (8) Harrell met with Harrison the evening before the fire and went out to lunch with him afterwards; (9) Harrell admitted he had been in the utility hallway; (10) Harrell\u2019s statement to the police was necessarily a fabrication because he did not indicate that Stacy Williams was disabled, and because Williams could not have climbed the stairs as Harrell claimed; (11) Harrell\u2019s knowledge of Stella and Stacy Williams showed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>he had access to the motel from an insider, such as Harrison; and (12) Harrell checked up on Presley to make sure he was not in prison and was in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">The government also alleged that Weaver would testify that Harrell: (1) offered to pay him to assist him while he burned the motel; (2) told him Harrison owned the motel and that it was a losing $10,000 a month; (3) told him Harrison would be providing him with a key to the utility hallway and he would burn it with diesel fuel; and (3) told him he was working on a cover story involving Stacy Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">In response, the defense argued that the government had failed to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a conspiracy existed or that Harrison was a member of the conspiracy. In this regard, the defense argued, among other things, that all of the government\u2019s evidence of the conspiracy was based on inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">The court found that the government had shown with a preponderance of the evidence that a conspiracy existed and that Harrison and Harrell were members of the conspiracy. It further found that the government had shown that Harrell\u2019s statements to Weaver were made in furtherance of the conspiracy. Accordingly, the court found that Weaver\u2019s testimony was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Thereafter, Weaver, who worked for Harrell as a farmhand, testified that Harrell stored up to a thousand gallons of red-dyed diesel on his farm. He also testified that while working for Harrell he had seen him use a mixture of diesel and gasoline to burn brush piles.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">Weaver testified that, while he worked for Harrell part-time, he was attending Bainbridge college full-time and that Julie was also attending that college and he would see her on campus. Weaver testified that he had \u201ca number of conversations\u201d with Julie in the fall of 2001 and into 2002. R14 at 28. In October 2001, approximately 12-13 weeks before the fire, Harrell invited Weaver to dinner to discuss a \u201cbusiness opportunity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">After they had eaten, Harrell drove them to the motel. When they got there, Harrell told Weaver he had been asked to \u201cset the hotel on fire.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31. Using a key that he said the owner had given him, Harrell took Weaver into the first floor utility hallway. Harrell told Weaver that the owner wanted the motel burned because it was losing $10,000 a month.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">Harrell told Weaver he intended to apply diesel and gasoline to the walls and ceiling with a sprayer and he wanted Weaver to act as a lookout. On the way back to the ear, Harrell told Weaver he would pay him $1,000 for his help. On the way home from the motel, Harrell told Weaver that Harrison owned the motel.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">Weaver tried to talk Harrell out of doing it, arguing that \u201cthere [was] no guarantee that everybody would make it out of the hotel, and he said that he had thought about that, but that was just one of the things he\u2019d have to deal with.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34-35. Harrell told Weaver that he had planned to burn the building over Christmas, but had moved the date back after Harrison told him that the motel would be nearly full at that time. Harrell told Weaver to lie to Julie about their trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-13\">Weaver testified that Harrell twice asked him if he would reconsider his decision, but Weaver refused. He testified that he spoke to Harrell in person the day after the fire, and that Harrell told him he \u201cgot a little careless,\u201d almost got caught in the fire, was seen by someone, and left fingerprints behind. <em>Id. </em>at 38. Harrell also told Weaver that he was going to blame the fire on Stacy Williams, who he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>said had mental problems, and Russ Presley, who had a drug problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Weaver also testified that he had conversations with Julie both in the days leading up to the arson and after the arson occurred, when he and Julie had returned to college for the Spring 2002 semester. In this regard, the government generally asked Weaver if Julie had told him about her husband, Harrell, speaking to Harrison on the phone. Before Weaver answered, Harrell\u2019s counsel objected, arguing that the answer would require hearsay. The government argued, however, that it was being \u201coffered as a prior consistent statement after Juliet\u2019s] testimony [had] been attacked as a recent fabrication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After the court looked at Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) and heard brief argument, it overruled the initial objection. The government then asked the question again, and Weaver stated that Julie told him that Harrell \u201chad ... been receiving numerous phone calls from [Harrison] each night leading up to the arson.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 43. At this, Harrison\u2019s counsel objected, arguing that Julie had not said that in her testimony, that it therefore was not consistent, and was hearsay. The court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">After the government rested its case, Harrison submitted evidence and presented eight witnesses in his defense. Testifying in his own defense, Harrison denied all the charges. Further, he stated that he did not recall speaking to Harrell or meeting with him the day before the fire, although he admitted that he and Harrell were working on a land deal around that time. Harrell did not testify. Finally, the government presented a brief rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">After deliberating, the jury found Harrison guilty of all of the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) recounted the facts of the case, and noted that the hotel and its contents were insured in the amount of $1,505,270. The PSI grouped the counts of conviction into two groups for the purpose of calculating Harrison\u2019s offense level. Group 1 consisted of conspiracy to commit arson, arson, and making misleading statements, and Group 2 consisted of conspiracy to commit mail fraud, mail fraud, and misleading statements. After calculating the total offense levels for each group, which included enhancements for obstruction of justice, the PSI applied a multiple count adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.4 that added two levels to the higher of the two group\u2019s total offense levels, resulting in a total offense level of 28 as to all of the offenses of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">The PSI noted no convictions, arrests, or other criminal conduct, resulting in zero criminal history points, and a criminal history category of I.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">With an offense level of 28 and a criminal history of I, the PSI calculated an advisory guideline sentencing range of 78 to 97 months of imprisonment. The PSI noted that the statutory maximum terms of imprisonment were: (1) as to Count 5, 5 years; (2) as to Count 6, 20 years; (3) as to Count 7, 40 years; and (4) as to Count 13, 10 years. The PSI also noted that Harrison was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 7 years (or 84 months) <em>of </em>imprisonment as to Count 7. The PSI calculated a guideline sentence of supervised release of 2-3 years, as to Counts 5, 6, and 13, and 3-5 years as to Count 7. The fine range was $12,500 to $125,000. Finally, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(a) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.1, restitution was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">The government raised six objections to the PSI, including essentially arguing that the court should vary upwards under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Meanwhile, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Harrison only objected to the loss amount and to a statement in the fact section that alleged that more than one witness saw Harrell leave the scene of the arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">At the sentencing hearing, Harrison waived any objections to the PSI and argued that the court should reject all of the government\u2019s objections. The court then heard argument on all of the government\u2019s objections, the government called Stella Williams to testify, and Harrison called five witnesses in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">After Harrison declined to address the court in allocution, the court stated that it had considered the advisory guidelines and \u201cdetermined that the advisory sentencing range [was] 84 to 97 months, considering an offense level of 28 and a criminal history category of one.\u201d R17 at 81, 83-84. The court then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-6\">The Court is of the opinion that a sentence outside the advisory guidelines range, however, is appropriate in this ease upon considering the nature and the circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, and the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide for just punishment for the offense, as well as to afford adequate deterrence] to criminal conduct and to protect the public from further crimes from the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-7\">In all of this conversation and hair splitting about the provisions of the Guidelines, the Court simply cannot ignore the fact that the defendant has been found guilty of deliberately and intentionally setting or causing to be set a fire to the motel in question at a time when it was occupied by at least 16 people, some of whom were of tender age, some of whom may have been disabled, at a time when all of those people likely were in bed and under circumstances which very likely could have caused a loss of life or very serious bodily injury to many, many people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-9\">If, as [Harrison\u2019s counsel] urges, the Guidelines take those factors into consideration and come up with a range of 84 to 97 months, if that is true, then it is the opinion of this Court that that is an unreasonable application of fact to law, and the Court feels that that does not adequately address the circumstances in this case or the seriousness of what Mr. Harrison has been found guilty of doing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AI7\"><em>Id. </em>at 84-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">The court then orally sentenced Harrison to 60 months of imprisonment as to Count 5,180 months of imprisonment as to Count 6,180 months of imprisonment as to Count 7, and 120 months of imprisonment as to Count 13, all to run concurrently, for a total sentence of 180 months. The court imposed a fine of $50,000 and a period of five years of supervised release. Finally, the court stated that \u201c[t]he sentence as imposed is an appropriate sentence in this case, complies with the factors that are to be considered as set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and adequately addresses the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87. When the court asked the parties if they had any objections, Harrison\u2019s counsel responded that he did not, other than to preserve his objection \u201cto the upward departure.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">Thereafter, the court entered a written judgment in accordance with its oral pronouncement, and then later entered a separate order imposing restitution. Harrison timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ABh\">A. Co-conspirator Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b672-13\">First, Harrison argues that the district court erred by finding that Harrell\u2019s statements to Weaver were admissible as non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>hearsay statements of a eoeonspirator. Specifically, he contends that the government failed to establish that a conspiracy existed. In this regard, Harrison claims that the government\u2019s evidence was comprised of mostly inferences, and that the government\u2019s assertion that the motel was a financial drain on Harrison was \u201chotly disputed.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 36. Harrison also argues that, because Julie\u2019s testimony that Harrell said he was going to meet Harrison was inadmissible hearsay, it should not be included in the evidence of the conspiracy. But, as discussed below, because we find that Julie\u2019s testimony in this regard was admissible, this argument is meritless. Second, Harrison contends that the district court erred by permitting Julie to testify regarding Harrell\u2019s statement that he met with Harrison the day before the arson to discuss a land deal. Among other things, he claims that Harrell\u2019s statement was not admissible as a co-conspirator statement because it was not made in the furtherance of a conspiracy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">We review the admission of evidence for abuse of discretion and will \u201coverturn findings of fact only if clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v.

Van Hemelryck, </em>945 F.2d 1493, 1498 n. 3 (11th Cir.1991) (quotations and citations omitted). \u201cA district court\u2019s determination that a statement was made in furtherance of a conspiracy is a finding of fact subject to a clearly erroneous standard of review.\u201d <em>United States v. Miles, </em>290 F.3d 1341, 1351 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam) (citation omitted). A failure by the district court to specifically determine whether the government had satisfied the requirements of Rule 801(d)(2)(E) \u201cis harmless error if the record demonstrates admissibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>797 F.2d 943, 946 (11th Cir.1986) (citation omitted). Although it is possible that some of Harrison\u2019s objections with regard to this issue were not preserved, the standard of review is not dispositive here, and we will review this issue as if fully preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">\u201cA statement is not hearsay if ... (2) ... [it] is offered against a party and is ... (E) a statement by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy. The contents of the statement shall be considered but are not alone sufficient to establish ... the existence of the conspiracy and the participation therein of the declarant and the party against whom the statement is offered under subdivision (E).\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">\u201cFor a declaration by one defendant to be admissible against other defendants under this [rule], the government must establish by a preponderance of the evidence: (1) that a conspiracy existed, (2) that the defendant and the declarant were members of the conspiracy, and (3) that the statement was made during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>Van </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number><em>Hemelryck, </em>945 F.2d at 1497-98 (citations omitted). Although the preferred method of proving these requirements is in a hearing prior to the admission of the evidence, it is nevertheless within the court\u2019s discretion to admit the alleged co-conspirator statements subject to be proven during trial. <em>Fernandez, </em>797 F.2d at 945 (citation omitted). \u201cIn determining the admissibility of co-conspirator statements, the trial court may consider both the co-conspirator\u2019s statements and independent external evidence.\u201d <em>Magluta, </em>418 F.3d at 1178 (quotations and citation omitted)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">\u201cThis circuit applies a liberal standard in determining whether a statement is made in furtherance of a conspiracy.\u201d <em>Miles, </em>290 F.3d at 1351 (citation and internal quotations omitted). \u201cStatements made by the coconspirator to allay suspicions are also admissible.\u201d <em>United States v. Miller, </em>664 F.2d 94, 98 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981) (per curiam) (citation omitted). Finally, \u201cconcealment is sometimes a necessary part of a conspiracy, so that statements made solely to aid the concealment are in fact made during and in furtherance of the charged conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Griggs, </em>735 F.2d 1318, 1325 (11th Cir.1984) (per curiam) (quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">After a careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error with regard to this issue. At trial, the government established that Harrison and Harrell had entered into a conspiracy to burn down Harrison\u2019s motel. The evidence presented by the government to support this finding included the facts that: (1) there was an arson, it was apparently an \u201cinside job,\u201d and it was started by a gasoline-diesel fuel mixture; (2) Harrell returned to his home early on the morning of the fire smelling strongly of diesel and threatened Julie to forget what she had seen; (3) Harrison and Harrell were friends and Harrell had no apparent motive to harm Harrison; (4) Harrison had a motive to burn the motel, because it was his only asset that was losing money, and he was struggling to maintain its financing; (5) Harrison and Harrell were in contact a number of times preceding the fire, and Harrell hid the nature of their conversations from Julie; and (6) Harrison and Harrell went out to lunch on the day after the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">The government also presented evidence that, during the investigation of the fire, an anonymous tip led the investigators to Harrell. In his statement to the investigators, Harrell admitted to being in the utility hallway where the fire started. He then told the investigators a story to explain this that involved Stacy Williams and Russ Presley. Evidence showed, however, that Williams was noticeably disabled and may not have been able to do some of the things Harrell described. It also showed that Harrell inquired as to Presley\u2019s whereabouts prior to making his statement to the police. In addition, there was evidence that Harrell downplayed and misrepresented his relationship with Harrison during the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">The court was also permitted to consider the proffered co-conspirator statements in determining whether a conspiracy existed. <em>See Magluta, </em>418 F.3d at 1178. In this regard, the government explained that Weaver would testify regarding Harrell\u2019s attempt to recruit him into the conspiracy, including that Harrell stated that Harrison had hired him to burn down the motel because it was losing money, and that Harrison had given him the key to the utility hallway. Julie also would testify, as fully addressed below, that Harrison and Harrell had met the day before the arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">On this evidence, the district court did not abuse its discretion by finding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>government had established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a conspiracy existed between Harrison and Harrell. The fact that this decision relied, in part, on circumstantial evidence or logical inferences does not render it unsound. <em>See United States v. Kennard, </em>472 F.3d 851, 856 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 3004, 168 L.Ed.2d 732 (2007) (\u201c[cjonspiracy may be proven by circumstantial evidence\u201d (quotations and citation omitted)). Further, it was in the court\u2019s discretion to weigh the evidence as to the \u201chotly contested\u201d question of the motel\u2019s true value to Harrison\u2019s business, and there is no evidence to suggest that its decision in this regard was an abuse of that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Thus, the court did not clearly err by, following a <em>James </em>hearing on the matter out of the presence of the jury, admitting the testimony of Dennis Weaver, who testified that Harrell tried to recruit him into the conspiracy and explained the details of the plan to him, as non-hearsay co-conspirator statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">Similarly, the court did not clearly err by admitting the testimony of Julie Harrell, Harrell\u2019s wife, that he told her he was meeting Harrison the day before the arson to discuss a land deal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although the court did not hold a hearing regarding this evidence and did not state the basis for its decision, because it could have provisionally admitted Julie\u2019s testimony as a non-hearsay co-conspirator statement pending the satisfaction of Rule 801(d)(2)(E), any error was harmless, as long as the evidence was ultimately admissible. See <em>Fernandez, </em>797 F.2d at 946. Because, as already discussed, the government ultimately established that Harrison and Harrell were in a conspiracy, and because Harrell\u2019s statement to Julie was in the furtherance of that conspiracy in that it was reasonable to infer that it was intended to allay her suspicions, the statement was admissible. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E); <em>James, </em>510 F.2d at 550 (holding that because the coconspirator \u201cwas acting in the interests of the conspiracy by allaying these suspicions!, t]he statement was made in furtherance of the conspiracy\u201d). Accordingly, the court did not abuse its discretion by admitting Julie\u2019s testimony either.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-14\">B. Prior Consistent Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b675-15\">On appeal, Harrison essentially argues that the district court abused its discretion by admitting Weaver\u2019s testimony about Julie\u2019s statement regarding Harrison calling Harrell as a non-hearsay prior consistent statement. Harrison contends that Julie\u2019s two references to calls by Harrison: her direct testimony that Harrell received five calls from Harrison in the months preceding the fire, and her diary entry that Harrison called on the day before the fire, were not consistent with Weaver\u2019s testimony that she told him Harrison called \u201cnumerous\u201d times \u201ceach night lead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>ing up to the arson.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 23-25. Harrison further argues that Julie\u2019s veracity regarding the five calls was not attacked as a recent fabrication, and that her statement in her diary was only briefly referenced on cross-examination. Finally, Harrison argues that this error prejudiced him as it was \u201cone of only two items that directly and undeniably demonstrated that [he] was involved in the arson.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">\u201cA district court is granted broad discretion in determining the admissibility of a prior consistent statement under Fed. R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(B) and will not be reversed absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Drury, </em>396 F.3d 1303, 1317 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations and citation omitted). Even if an evidentiary ruling is erroneous, that \u201cruling will result in reversal only if the resulting error was not harmless.\u201d <em>United States v. Hands, </em>184 F.3d 1322, 1329 (11th Cir.1999) (citations omitted). An error is harmless \u201cunless there is a reasonable likelihood that [it] affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citation omitted). No reversal will result if \u201csufficient evidence uninfected by error supports the verdict,\u201d and the error did not have a \u201csubstantial influence on the outcome\u201d of the case. <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citation omitted). We will examine the entire record, comparing the error with \u201cthe strength of the evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt,\u201d to determine \u201cwhether an error had substantial influence on the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">\u201cA statement is not hearsay if ... [t]he declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is ... consistent with the declarant\u2019s testimony and is offered to rebut an express or implied charge against the declarant of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive.... \u201d Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Under this rule, \u201c[p]rior consistent statements may not be admitted to counter all forms of impeachment or to bolster the witness merely because she has been discredited.\u201d <em>Tome v. United States, </em>513 U.S. 150, 157, 115 S.Ct. 696, 701, 130 L.Ed.2d 574 (1995). Further, \u201c[a] prior consistent statement is admissible only if it was \u2018made before the alleged influence, or motive to fabricate, arose.\u2019\u201d <em>Drury, </em>396 F.3d at 1317 (quoting <em>Tome, </em>513 U.S. at 158, 115 S.Ct. at 701).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">After a careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error with regard to this issue. Here, the court admitted Weaver\u2019s testimony that Julie (the declarant) told him that Harrison had called numerous times \u201ceach night leading up to the arson\u201d on the government\u2019s argument that it was a non-hearsay prior consistent statement. R14424 at 43. The government, however, did not explain what statement by Julie was confirmed by her statement to Weaver. There are only two possibilities: (1) Julie\u2019s direct testimony that Harrison called five times between October 2001 and January 2002; or (2) Julie\u2019s statement, in the entry in her diary read by counsel during her cross-examination, that Harrison called Harrell on the day before the arson.</p>\n<p id=\"ArZ\">Even assuming Julie\u2019s statement in her direct testimony is \u201cconsistent\u201d with Weaver\u2019s testimony, the defense did not specifically challenge the truth of Julie\u2019s statement while on cross-examination. As a result, Weaver\u2019s testimony was not necessary to \u201crebut an express or implied charge\u201d that this statement was a fabrication. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(B); <em>Tome, </em>513 U.S. at 157, 115 S.Ct. at 701. As for Julie\u2019s statement in her diary, the court made no finding that suggests that Julie made the statement to Weaver before she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>made the entry in her diary or otherwise \u201cbefore the alleged influence, or motive to fabricate, arose,\u2019 \u201d <em>see Tome, </em>513 U.S. at 158, 115 S.Ct. at 701, and none of the other evidence in the record directly bears on this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Even if we assume <em>arguendo </em>that neither of Julie\u2019s statements supported the admission of Weaver\u2019s testimony, the error, if any, was harmless, because there was more than sufficient properly admitted evidence to support the verdict. <em>See Hands, </em>184 F.3d at 1329. Further, considering the record as a whole, and the lack of any compounding error, it does not appear that any error here had a \u201csubstantial influence on the outcome.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Julie had already testified that Harrison had been calling Harrell during this period. Weaver\u2019s improperly admitted testimony only accentuated or emphasized this properly admitted statement. Further, Weaver\u2019s properly admitted testimony included the statement that Harrison had hired Harrell to commit the arson and had even given him a key to the motel. Accordingly, even if the admission of Weaver\u2019s testimony on this issue was error, it was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">C. Reasonableness of Harrison\u2019s Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Harrison essentially argues that his 180-month sentence, imposed following the court\u2019s decision to vary upwards from the guideline sentencing range as permitted by Booker, was unreasonable. Specifically, he argues that because the district court correctly calculated the guideline sentencing range, and because the court based the variance on factors already considered in that calculation, that variance was unreasonable. Further, he argues that the court did not apply any \u201creasonableness analysis\u201d but simply rejected the range because it disagreed with the guidelines\u2019 policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">\u201cAfter the district court has accurately calculated the [guideline range, it may impose a more severe or more lenient sentence that we review for reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244-45 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (citations and internal quotations omitted). Such review is deferential, requiring us to \u201cevaluate whether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in [\u00a7 3553(a) ].\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). The party challenging the sentence has the burden of establishing that it is unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[Tjhere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">Sentencing <em>post-Booker </em>is a two step process. <em>Id. </em>at 786. First, the district court must consult the guidelines by accurately calculating a defendant\u2019s guideline range. <em>Id. </em>In this first step, if the court decides to apply a guideline departure, it must do so in accordance with the guidelines. <em>See United States v. Ellis, </em>419 F.3d 1189, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2005) (reversing, post <em>-Booker, </em>application of a guided \u00a7 5K2.7 upward departure because it was misapplied, but noting that this did not diminish the court\u2019s power to vary upwards under <em>Booker). </em>Second, the district must \u201cconsider [the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing] factors to determine a reasonable sentence.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>After a careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error with regard to this issue, either. Because both parties concede that the court correctly calculated the advisory guideline range, and it is clear from the record that the court adopted the PSI\u2019s advisory guideline calculation, the district court properly consulted the advisory guidelines. The court then found that, because the unique circumstances of this case were not adequately contemplated by the advisory guidelines, a sentence above those guidelines, based its independent analysis of the sentencing factors, was warranted. It based this decision on the fact that Harrison had conspired to set the motel on fire without any regard for its occupants, some of whom were especially vulnerable, and under circumstances where serious injury or even death was very likely. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(A). On this record, we cannot say the district court\u2019s sentencing rationale was unreasonable under <em>Booker. </em>Accordingly, Harrison has failed to demonstrate that his 180-month sentence was either procedurally or substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by permitting two witnesses to testify about inculpatory statements a co-conspirator made to them prior to the arson. The district court\u2019s error in allowing a witness to testify regarding another witness\u2019s statement that Harrison had called codefendant Harrell frequently before the arson was harmless. Finally, Harrison\u2019s 180 month total sentence was reasonable. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b664-11\">. The remaining counts in the indictment are not relevant to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b673-8\">. Finally, Harrison also asserts that this error prejudiced him because he testified that he did not meet Harrell the day before the fire, and this claim was the basis of Count 13. The jury, however, could have believed the opposite of Harrison\u2019s testimony. <em>See United States v.
