Sorto\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. Although notified of his right to do so, Sorto has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">After conducting a de novo review of the record as required by <em>Anders, </em>we agree that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. We find that the district court conducted a thorough colloquy pursuant to Fed.R.CrimP. 11 and properly ascertained that Sorto\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary. We also find that the court sentenced Sorto within a properly calculated Guidelines range, after granting the Government\u2019s motion for a five-level downward departure based on substantial assistance. To the extent that counsel notes that Sorto voiced some concerns about trial counsel prior to entering his guilty plea, we decline to address any potential ineffective assistance of counsel claim as no ineffective representation conclusively appears from the record. <em>See United States v. Baldovinos, </em>434 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1203, 126 S.Ct. 1407, 164 L.Ed.2d 107 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Accordingly, we affirm Sorto\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
