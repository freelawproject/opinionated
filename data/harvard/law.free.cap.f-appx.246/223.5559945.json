We note that only the Board\u2019s denial of Levai\u2019s motion to reconsider is properly before this Court as he failed to timely petition this Court for review of the Board\u2019s initial order.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Therefore, Levai\u2019s only cognizable argument before this Court is that the Board\u2019s denial of Levai\u2019s motion to reconsider was arbitrary and contrary to law. We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Levai\u2019s motion for failing to present clear and convincing evidence indicating a strong likelihood that his marriage is bona fide, as required by <em>Matter of Velarde-Pacheco, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 253 (BIA 2002). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b246-9\"> The filing of a motion to reopen or reconsider with the Board does not toll the thirty-day period for seeking review of an underlying order. <em>Stone v.
