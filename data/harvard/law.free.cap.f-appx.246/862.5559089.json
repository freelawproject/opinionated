Palencia argues that the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines by characterizing his previous Texas felony conviction for possession of a controlled substance as an aggravated felony under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). In a prior opinion, this court affirmed the sentence imposed. <em>See United States v. Palenciar-Contreras, </em>141 Fed.Appx. 342, 343 (5th Cir.2005). The Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated this court\u2019s judgment, and remanded the case for further consideration in light of its intervening decision in <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-17\">Because Palencia has now completed the confinement portion of his sentence, any argument that the term of incarceration should be reduced is moot, and the only portion of the sentence remaining for consideration is his term of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Ramon, </em>320 F.3d 519, 519-20 (5th Cir.2003); <em>see also Johnson v. Pettiford, </em>442 F.3d 917, 918 (5th Cir.2006). Palencia, however, has been removed from the United States. Because he is barred from returning to the United States and because there is no indication that he has waived his right to be present for resentencing, Palencia\u2019s challenge to the validity of his sentence is moot. <em>See United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 383 (5th Cir.2007). Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b885-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
