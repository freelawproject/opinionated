He was acquitted of the charge of being an accessory-after-the-fact to a murder. On appeal, Orange claims the district court erred by not incorporating his proposed affirmative defense instruction into the jury instructions. He also claims the district court should have imposed a variant sentence because the advisory guidelines sentence was based in part on acquitted conduct. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Because Orange did not object to the district court\u2019s jury instructions, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Nicolaou, </em>180 F.3d 565, 569 (4th Cir.1999). Under the plain error standard, Orange must show: (1) there was error; (2) the error was plain; and (3) the error affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). When these conditions are satisfied, we may exercise our discretion to notice the error only if the error \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (internal quotation marks omitted). The burden of showing plain error is on the defendant. <em>United States v. Strickland, </em>245 F.3d 368, 379-80 (4th Cir.2001). Orange failed to show the alleged error was obvious or that his substantial rights were affected by the alleged error. As a result, there was no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">With respect to the sentence, we note there was no error in considering acquitted conduct in determining the sentence under the advisory guidelines. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>399 F.3d 450, 454 (2d Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Romulus, </em>949 F.2d 713, 716-17 (4th Cir.1991). We review a <em>post-United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) sentence \u201cto determine whether the sentence is within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014 , 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006). \u201c[A] defendant can only rebut the presumption by demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 3044, 168 L.Ed.2d 759 (2007). While a district court must consider the various \u00a7 3553(a) factors and explain its sentence, it need not explicitly reference \u00a7 3553 or discuss every factor on the record. <em>Johnson, </em>445 F.3d at 345. This is particularly the case when the court imposes a sentence within the applicable guideline range. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-14\">We find Orange\u2019s sentence was reasonable and there was no error in the district court\u2019s decision to deny his request for a variant sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-15\">Accordingly, we affirm the conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>terials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
