The district court found Webster was subject to a 180-month mandatory minimum sentence as an armed career criminal. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000). The court sentenced Webster to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment, remarking this was a \u201cterribly long sentence\u201d but noting it was the shortest allowable sentence under the then-mandatory sentencing guidelines. We affirmed Webster\u2019s conviction but vacated his sentence and remanded to the district court for resentencing in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Webster, </em>198 Fed.Appx. 334 (4th Cir.2006) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-19\">On remand, the district court sentenced Webster to the statutory minimum of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment. Webster appealed, and his counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), contending there are no meritorious issues for appeal but asserting the length of the sentence violated his client\u2019s Eighth Amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishment in light of Webster\u2019s advanced age and myriad medical conditions. The Government avers the district court lacked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>discretion to sentence Webster below the mandatory statutory minimum penalty. Webster did not file a pro se supplemental brief, despite being notified of his right to do so. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><em>Booker </em>\u201cdid nothing to alter the rule that judges cannot depart below a statutorily provided minimum sentence\u201d except upon the Government\u2019s motion on the basis of substantial assistance. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>404 F.3d 850, 862 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 916, 126 S.Ct. 288, 163 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005). The district court appropriately declined to sentence Webster below the mandatory minimum despite considering Webster\u2019s age and medical issues. <em>See Robinson, </em>404 F.3d at 862 (stating 193-year sentence on remand \u201cmay seem manifestly unjust given Robinson\u2019s age and well-documented intellectual limitations, [but] it is the result mandated by Congress.\u201d). Webster\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim necessarily fails, as proportionality review is unavailable \u201cfor any sentence less than life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\u201d <em>United States v. Ming Hong, </em>242 F.3d 528, 532 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Webster\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Webster, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Webster requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Webster.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b247-14\"> We vacated Webster\u2019s sentence because the record provided a nonspeculative basis for concluding the district court's mandatory treatment of the sentencing guidelines affected its selection of the sentence imposed. <em>See United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1023, 126 S.Ct. 668, 163 L.Ed.2d 539 (2005). Therefore, we remanded for resentencing pursuant to <em>Booker </em>and <em>White. </em>We found the district court did not commit Sixth Amendment error under <em>Booker, </em>however, and we upheld Webster\u2019s armed career criminal designation. Pursuant to the mandate rule, the district court appropriately declined to permit relitigation of sentencing guidelines calculations on remand. <em>See United States v. Bell, 5 </em>F.3d 64, 66 (4th Cir. 1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
