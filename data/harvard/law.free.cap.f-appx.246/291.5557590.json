Lucas specifically argues that the district court erred in considering public safety dangers that might arise if Lucas were to use cocaine while at his job as a dumptruek driver in deciding to revoke Lucas\u2019s supervised release. While the district court cited such concerns at Lucas\u2019s revocation hearing, the court expressly based its revocation of Lucas\u2019s supervised release upon Lucas\u2019s admitted, repeated possession and use of cocaine. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in revoking Lucas\u2019s supervised release and imposing a term of imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Spraglin, </em>418 F.3d 479, 480 (5th Cir.2005). Lucas\u2019s 27-month sentence did not exceed the three-year statutory maximum. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). His revocation sentence was therefore neither \u201cunreasonable\u201d nor \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>See United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 120 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1083, 126 S.Ct. 1804, 164 L.Ed.2d 540 (2006). Finally, Lucas argues that the district court erred in citing Lucas\u2019s need for rehabilitation as a basis for its judgment. Lucas properly concedes that this argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Giddings, </em>37 F.3d 1091, 1097 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b314-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
