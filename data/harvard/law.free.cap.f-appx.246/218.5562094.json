At sentencing, the district court found Oaks was an armed career criminal. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (2000). The court sentenced Oaks to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment on the first count and 300 months\u2019 imprisonment on the third count, to be served concurrently. Furthermore, the district court found that Oaks brandished a firearm; accordingly, it sentenced Oaks to a consecutive sentence of eighty-four months\u2019 imprisonment on the second count. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-14\">Oaks appealed, and we affirmed Oaks\u2019 convictions. However, we concluded the district court\u2019s brandishing finding was not properly supported, because the court did not find Oaks had a firearm with him or close at hand, as required by <em>United States v. Groce, </em>398 F.3d 679, 681-82 (4th Cir. 2005). Accordingly, we vacated Oaks\u2019 sentence and remanded to the district court for resentencing. <em>See United States v. Oaks, </em>185 Fed.Appx. 298 (4th Cir.) (unpublished), cer<em>t. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 567, 166 L.Ed.2d 420 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-16\">The district court expressly found on remand that Oaks had a firearm with him or close at hand. The court sentenced Oaks to an identical term of 384 months\u2019 imprisonment, and Oaks appealed. Oaks\u2019 counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), contending there are no meritorious issues for appeal but suggesting the district court erroneously found Oaks brandished a firearm. Oaks filed a pro se supplemental brief asserting the brandishing enhancement was factually erroneous and the imposition of sentence was improper under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The Government declined to file a responding brief. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-17\">Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) (2000), any person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence, uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>any such crime, possesses such a firearm, shall, receive a sentence consecutive to the punishment provided for such crime of violence. If the firearm was brandished, the consecutive sentence is not to be less than seven years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii) (2000). \u201cBrandish\u201d means, with respect to a firearm, \u201cto display all or part of the firearm, or otherwise make the presence of the firearm known to another person, in order to intimidate that person, regardless of whether the firearm is directly visible to that person.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(4) (2000). \u201cPresence\u201d is the fact or condition of being \u201cin view or at hand.\u201d <em>Groce, </em>398 F.3d at 681. Therefore, brandishing occurs in this context upon a finding a firearm was on the person or close at hand. <em>Id. </em>at 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">After thoroughly reviewing the record, including the district court\u2019s findings at the resentencing hearing, we conclude the court properly found Oaks brandished a firearm. Furthermore, absent a Government motion for downward departure on the basis of substantial assistance, the district court lacked discretion to sentence Oaks below the seven-year statutory minimum on this count. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>404 F.3d 850, 862 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 916, 126 S.Ct. 288, 163 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005). We conclude the sentence was proper.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Oaks\u2019s sentence. We deny Oaks\u2019 motion for substitution of counsel. This court requires that counsel inform Oaks, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Oaks requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Oaks.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b242-7\"> Oaks contends the district court did not sufficiently reference the 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006) factors while imposing sentence. To the extent this contention is properly before the court with respect to counts one and three, the sentence was presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied. </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309. 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Furthermore, the district court acknowledged the \u00a7 3553(a) factors at resentencing and was not required to comment more extensively. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2469; <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
