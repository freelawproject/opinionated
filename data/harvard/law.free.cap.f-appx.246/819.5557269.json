He was sentenced to eighty-four months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-24\">On appeal, Caldwell raises the following issues, whether: (1) the Government failed to provide discovery; (2) the district court erred by denying Caldwell\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea; (3) the district court erred at sentencing by relying on evidence withheld by the Government; (4) his sentence was reasonable; and (5) the Government committed prosecutorial mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>conduct at sentencing. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">First, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by delaying Caldwell\u2019s sentencing hearing so that his counsel could be sure he received the disputed discovery items. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a); <em>United States v. Muse, </em>83 F.3d 672, 675 (4th Cir.1996) (stating review standard). To the extent Caldwell alleges <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963) violations, we find no reversible error. <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>536 U.S. 6226, 633, 122 S.Ct. 2450, 153 L.Ed.2d 586 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Second, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision to deny Caldwell\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea. Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(h); <em>United States v. Ubakanma, </em>215 F.3d 421, 424 (4th Cir.2000). Third, there is insufficient record evidence to support Caldwell\u2019s claim that the Government withheld evidence used against him at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">Next, Caldwell alleges that his eight-four-month sentence is unreasonable. Caldwell was sentenced within a properly-calculated Sentencing Guidelines range and thus his sentence presumptively is reasonable. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341-44 (4th Cir.2006); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-67, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (holding that an appellate court may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a district court\u2019s sentence that reflects a proper application of the Sentencing Guidelines). \u201c[A] defendant can only rebut the presumption [of reasonableness] by demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 3044, 168 L.Ed.2d 759 (2006). Caldwell has failed to demonstrate his sentence was unreasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b842-12\">Finally, we find Caldwell\u2019s claims of prosecutorial misconduct without foundation. Accordingly, we affirm Caldwell\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
