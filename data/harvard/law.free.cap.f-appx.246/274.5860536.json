On the same day Schmidt filed his appellee brief, he moved separately to dismiss due to mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-24\">\u201cMany courts, including our own ... have employed the concept of \u2018mootness\u2019 to address equitable concerns unique to bankruptcy proceedings\u201d. <em>Matter of Manges, </em>29 F.3d 1034, 1038 (5th Cir.1994). In that regard, mootness \u201cis not an Article III inquiry as to whether a live controversy is presented; rather, it is a recognition by the appellate courts that there is a point beyond which they cannot order fundamental changes in [bankruptcy] actions\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 1038-39. This \u201ctest for mootness reflects a court\u2019s concern for striking the proper balance between the equitable considerations of finality and good faith reliance on a judgment and the competing interests that underlie the right of a party to seek review of a bankruptcy order adversely affecting him\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 1039 (quoting <em>First Union Real Estate Equity and Mort. Inv. v. Club Assoc., </em>956 F.2d 1065, 1069 (11th Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Peque\u00f1o contests the district court s December 2006 affirmance of the bankruptcy court\u2019s September 2002 approval of a settlement between Schmidt, Peque\u00f1o\u2019s Chapter 7 Trustee, and the City of Brownsville, successfully sued by Peque\u00f1o pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. Peque\u00f1o contends Schmidt should not have been his Chapter 7 Trustee, because Peque\u00f1o moved to convert his Chapter 7 proceeding to Chapter 13. His motion to convert, however, was denied. More importantly for determining mootness, Peque\u00f1o never moved to stay the settlement entered by Schmidt and the City of Brownsville. Nor did he ever request a bond or otherwise act to prevent consummation of the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-2\">That has occurred. The funds from Pe-que\u00f1o\u2019s judgment against Brownsville have been paid to the Trustee, who disbursed them, together with other bankruptcy-estate funds, to creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-3\">Schmidt has acted irreversibly, relying on the settlement. To allow Peque\u00f1o, who never sought a stay, to attack the settlement\u2019s basis would be inequitable. <em>In re Morningside Mobile Home RV Park, </em>32 Fed.Appx. 130 (5th Cir.2002). Therefore, the motion to dismiss is</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-4\">\n<em>GRANTED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1130-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
