We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-30\">Mehr first asserts that the immigration judge erred in denying a fourth continuance to allow him to await approval <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>of a labor certification, and that the Board erred in affirming that ruling. An immigration judge \u201cmay grant a motion for continuance for good cause shown.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29 (2007). We review the denial of a motion for continuance for abuse of discretion. <em>Onyeme v. INS, </em>146 F.3d 227, 231 (4th Cir.1998). In <em>Lendo v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 439 (4th Cir.2007), we concluded that the immigration judge\u2019s refusal to grant even one continuance to await the possible grant of a labor certification was not an abuse of discretion. Here, the immigration judge granted Mehr three continuances to allow processing of the labor certification. Having informed Mehr that the third continuance would be the last, the immigration judge refused to allow further delay. This denial does not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Mehr also asserts that his prosecution by the Department of Homeland Security resulted from his registration pursuant to the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (\u201cNSEERS\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1303, 1305 (2000), and that a decision to prosecute based on alienage, ethnicity, or religion violates his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection. We conclude that this claim entitles Mehr to no relief. <em>See Kandamar v. Gonzales, </em>464 F.3d 65, 73-74 (1st Cir. 2006); <em>Zafar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>461 F.3d 1357, 1367 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Ahmed v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 433, 439-40 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>440 F.3d 678, 681 n. 4 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(g) (West 2005) (providing courts have no jurisdiction to review Government\u2019s decision to \u201ccommence proceedings, adjudicate eases, or execute removal orders against any alien under this chapter\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Accordingly, we deny Mehr\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
