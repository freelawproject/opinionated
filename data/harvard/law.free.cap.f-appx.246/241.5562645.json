Santos appeals the eighty-seven month sentence imposed on resentencing for aggravated bank robbery, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), (d) (2000). <em>See United States v. Savoca, </em>156 Fed.Appx. 545 (4th Cir.2005) (unpublished), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1203, 126 S.Ct. 1407, 164 L.Ed.2d 106 (2006). On appeal, Santos\u2019 counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious issues on appeal, but asking this court to review the district court\u2019s ealculation of the Guidelines range, the court\u2019s refusal to depart downward from the Guidelines range, and the reasonableness of the sentence. Santos was notified of the opportunity to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has failed to do so. Because our review of the record discloses no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-14\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). A court must initially calculate the appropriate Guidelines range, making any appropriate factual findings. <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366, 370 (4th Cir.2006). The court then considers the resulting advisory Guidelines range in conjunction with the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2007), and determines an appropriate sentence. <em>Davenport, </em>445 F.3d at 370. If a district court imposes a sentence outside the Guidelines range, the court must state its reasons for doing so. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. This court will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it is within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546-47. A sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-19\">At the re-sentencing hearing, the district court imposed an obstruction of justice enhancement pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 3C1.2 (2003).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> According to the presentence report, Santos and his co-defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>were engaged in a high-speed chase following the robbery, during which they struck fourteen vehicles in an attempt to cause an accident and block off the police pursuit. Santos did not object to these facts as detailed in the presentence report, nor has he contended that there was an insufficient factual basis to support the enhancement. Further, the court relied on evidence elicited at Santos\u2019 trial regarding the high-speed car chase. Accordingly, we find that the district court did not err in determining that the two-level enhancement was supported by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">As to whether the district court erred in refusing to depart below the Sentencing Guidelines range, the court did not mistakenly believe it lacked jurisdiction to depart; therefore, its decision not to depart is not subject to appellate review. <em>See United States v. Quinn, </em>359 F.3d 666, 682 (4th Cir.2004) (citing <em>United States v. Bayerle, </em>898 F.2d 28, 30-31 (4th Cir.1990)); <em>see also United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 333 (3d Cir.2006) (collecting eases adopting this rule following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)). Moreover, in imposing Santos\u2019 sentence, the district court appropriately treated the Guidelines as advisory, considered the relevant factors under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a), and sentenced Santos at the low end of the properly calculated Guidelines range. We discern no reason to conclude that the district court\u2019s decision to impose a sentence within the Guidelines range was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Santos\u2019 sentence. This court requires counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b264-12\"> Pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3C1.2, a two-level enhancement is imposed if \u201cthe defendant recklessly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person in the course of fleeing from a law enforcement officer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
