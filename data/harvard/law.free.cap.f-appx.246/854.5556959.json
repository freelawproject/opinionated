The district court enhanced Vigil\u2019s sentence based upon its finding that his prior California conviction for unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor was a conviction for a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). Vigil argues that the enhancement was improper because the statute under which he was convicted sets the legal age for consent to sexual activity at 18 years of age while the Model Penal Code and the majority of the states set the legal age of consent for sexual activity at 16 years of age or younger.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-13\">Vigil\u2019s prior conviction was under CalPenal Code Ann. \u00a7 261.5(c) which proscribes \u201cunlawful sexual intercourse with a minor who is more than three years younger than the perpetrator.\u201d Section 261.5(a) provides that \u201cunlawful sexual intercourse\u201d is that with a \u201cminor\u201d not married to the perpetrator, defining \u201cminor\u201d as \u201ca person under the age of 18 years\u201d and \u201cadult\u201d as \u201ca person who is at least 18 years of age.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under a common-sense approach, Vigil\u2019s conviction was for the enumerated offenses of statutory rape and sexual abuse of a minor and, accordingly, a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). See \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(b)(iii)); <em>United States v. Acosta, </em>214 Fed.Appx. 398 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Lopez-Garcia, </em>163 Fed.Appx. 306 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 275 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Hemandez-Castillo, </em>449 F.3d 1127, 1131 (10th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 936, 166 L.Ed.2d 703 (2007) (\u00a7 261.5(c)); <em>United States v. Vargas-Garnica, </em>332 F.3d 471, 474 <em>&amp; </em>n. 1 (7th Cir.2003) (\u00a7 261.5(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-16\">Vigil also argues that the felony and aggravated felony provisions contained in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). This constitutional argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>Vigil contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). Vigil properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b877-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5 the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
