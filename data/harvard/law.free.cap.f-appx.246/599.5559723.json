After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-28\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b621-29\">In Florida state court, Chrispen was charged with one count of sexual battery upon a child and twelve counts of possessing photographs depicting sexual perform<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>anee by a child. The photographs that provided the basis for Chrispen\u2019s charges were found in Chrispen\u2019s briefcase, which he inadvertently left in an apartment complex parking lot on the trunk of a third party\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Officer Gayle Good was called to an apartment building to cheek on an unattended briefcase sitting on the trunk of a car in the parking lot. Officer Good arrived, ran the license plate number of the ear and learned that the car belonged to a woman living in the apartment complex. Officer Good spoke with the woman, who did not know to whom the briefcase belonged.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Officer Good returned to her car and tried to open the briefcase to identify the owner. Although one side of the briefcase was locked, Officer Good was easily able to pull the briefcase open. In the briefcase Officer Good found paperwork with Chris-pen\u2019s name on it and a yellow envelope (folded in half but not sealed). Inside the envelope were the photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">During trial, Chrispen moved to suppress the photographs, claiming that Officer Good\u2019s warrantless search of his locked briefcase violated his Fourth Amendment rights. The state trial court denied Chris-pen\u2019s motion without explanation. The jury found Chrispen guilty on all counts. The state trial court sentenced Chrispen to a term of life imprisonment, with a minimum of 25 years, on the sexual battery count, and a consecutive five-year term on the twelve counts of possessing the prohibited photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">On direct appeal, Chrispen challenged the denial of his motion to suppress. The Florida appellate court affirmed without comment. <em>See Chrispen v. State, </em>912 So.2d 1239 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1181, 126 S.Ct. 1356, 164 L.Ed.2d 67 (2006). After Chrispen\u2019s petition for certiorari with the United States Supreme Court was denied, Chrispen filed this \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">The district court concluded that the state trial court properly denied Chris-pen\u2019s motion to suppress because: (1) the briefcase appeared to be abandoned, and (2) the briefcase and the envelope containing the photographs were opened pursuant to a valid inventory search of the briefcase to determine the owner\u2019s identity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Chris-pen filed this appeal. We granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the issue of \u201c[w]hether the district court erred in finding that the state trial court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the fruits of an unlawful search of his briefcase was [not] contrary to, or [did not] involve[ ] an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b622-12\">Pursuant to \u00a7 2254, we may grant habeas relief on a claim that the state court adjudicated on the merits only if the state court decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Here, Chrispen does not argue that the state court\u2019s decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d federal law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rather, the gravamen of Chris-pen\u2019s argument is that the state court\u2019s ruling on his motion to suppress was an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent with regard to searches of personal effects, such as locked containers and packages.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">\u201c[A] federal habeas court making the \u2018unreasonable application\u2019 inquiry should ask whether the state court\u2019s application of clearly established federal law was objectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 409, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1521, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). Even if the federal habeas court concludes that the state court applied federal law incorrectly, relief is only appropriate if the application is also objectively unreasonable. <em>Bell v. Cone, </em>535 U.S. 685, 694, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 1850, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002); <em>see also Wright v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>278 F.3d 1245, 1256 (11th Cir.2002) (noting that the test does not involve deciding whether this Court would have reached the same result as the state court if it had been deciding the issue in the first instance).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">We first review Supreme Court precedent about searches of personal property under the Fourth Amendment. In order to successfully challenge a search on Fourth Amendment grounds, an individual must have \u201cmanifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the object of the challenged search\u201d and society must be \u201cwilling to recognize that expectation as reasonable.\u201d <em>California v. Ciraolo, </em>476 U.S. 207, 211, 106 S.Ct. 1809, 1811, 90 L.Ed.2d 210 (1986). An officer may lawfully search without a warrant property that has been abandoned by its owner. <em>Abel v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 217, 241, 80 S.Ct. 683, 698, 4 L.Ed.2d 668 (1960). If a person sufficiently exposes property to the public, his subjective expectation of privacy may no longer be reasonable. <em>California v. Greenwood, </em>486 U.S. 35, 39-40, 108 S.Ct. 1625, 1628, 100 L.Ed.2d 30 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">In addition, inventory searches of personal property are \u201ca well-defined exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Colorado v. Bertine, </em>479 U.S. 367, 371, 107 S.Ct. 738, 741, 93 L.Ed.2d 739 (1987). An inventory search of a defendant\u2019s personal effects is a routine administrative procedure conducted by police incident to arrest. <em>Illinois v. Lafayette, </em>462 U.S. 640, 643, 103 S.Ct. 2605, 2608, 77 L.Ed.2d 65 (1983). \u201cThe justification for such searches does not rest on probable cause, and hence the absence of a warrant is immaterial to the reasonableness of the search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The purpose of an inventory search is to protect the owner\u2019s property while it is in police custody, to protect the police from claims over lost or stolen property and to protect the police from potential dangers. <em>South Dakota v. Opperman, </em>428 U.S. 364, 369, 96 S.Ct. 3092, 3097, 49 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">We cannot say that the Florida state court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress was objectively unreasonable in light of the foregoing Supreme Court precedent. The evidence presented to the state trial court indicates that the challenged search was not conducted as part of a criminal investigation. Instead, Officer Good examined the contents of what appeared to be an abandoned briefcase to identify the owner so that the property could be returned. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>No evidence was presented that Officer Good used the guise of an identification search to look for evidence of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">The two state courts\u2019 rejection of Chrispen\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim implicitly reflects one (or both) of the following conclusions: (1) that Chrispen did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the briefcase after he \u201cabandoned\u201d it partially unlocked and unattended on the trunk of a third party\u2019s car in an apartment complex parking lot, or (2) that Officer Good\u2019s search constituted a reasonable inventory-like administrative search conducted for the purpose of identifying the seemingly abandoned briefcase\u2019s owner. Neither of these conclusions is an objectively unreasonable application of the Supreme Court\u2019s Fourth Amendment jurisprudence to the facts presented.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The district court thus properly denied Chrispen\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-7\">. Before so doing, the district court determined that the <em>Stone v. Powell </em>bar to federal habeas review of Fourth Amendment issues did not apply because the state courts did not consider Chrispen's Fourth Amendment claim fully and fairly. <em>See Tukes v. Dugger, </em>911 F.2d 508, 513-14 (11th Cir.1990) (explaining that the <em>Stone v. Powell </em>bar does not apply when the state trial court makes no explicit factual findings relating to the Fourth Amendment issue and the state appellate court summarily affirms). The parties do not dispute this determination on appeal, and thus we do not consider the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b622-14\">. We note that, although our COA was misworded, our mistake did not impair the parties' briefing of the appropriate issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b623-7\">. A state court decision is \"contrary to\u201d federal law only if: (1) the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the United States Supreme Court on a question of law; or (2) the state court confronts facts that are \"materially indistinguishable\u201d from relevant Supreme Court precedent but arrives at an opposite result from that arrived at by the Supreme Court. <em>See Putman v. Head, </em>268 F.3d 1223, 1241 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b624-16\">. We do not address the government\u2019s alternative argument that the motion to suppress was properly denied based on the inevitable discovery doctrine.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
