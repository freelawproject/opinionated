Rochell, Mississippi prisoner #83848, seeks leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) regarding his appeal from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 lawsuit for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. His motion to proceed IFP on appeal is construed as a challenge to the district court\u2019s decision certifying that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Rochell has failed to allege facts that raise a deliberate indifference claim. <em>See Domino v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991). Because this appeal does not raise legal points arguable on their merits, Rochell\u2019s IFP motion is denied and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 42.2. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). With this dismissal and the district court\u2019s dismissal, as well as an earlier dismissal of an appeal as frivolous, Rochell has accumulated at least three strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Rochell v. Barnett, </em>84 F.3d 432, 1996 WL 248845 at *1 (5th Cir. Apr.5, 1996) (unpublished). Rochell is advised that he will no longer be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b275-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
