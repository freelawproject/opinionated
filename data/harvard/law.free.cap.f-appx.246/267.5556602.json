He appeals the district court\u2019s remand of the case to state court. Because Robertson did not file a state habeas petition, his motion for a certificate of appealability is DENIED as unnecessary. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-19\">Robertson also seeks leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal. He is effectively challenging the district court\u2019s certification that he should not be granted IFP status because his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-20\">In state court, Robertson was convicted of bank robbery, and his conviction had been affirmed on direct appeal. His notice of removal was untimely. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(c)(1). Moreover, as Robertson did not allege that a specific federal law protects the criminal conduct with which he was charged, he has not shown that removal of the criminal action was appropriate under \u00a7 1443. <em>See City of Greenwood, Miss. v. Peacock, </em>384 U.S. 808, 824-28, 86 S.Ct. 1800, 16 L.Ed.2d 944 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-21\">Because Robertson has failed to show that his case presented nonfrivolous issues for appeal, we uphold the district court\u2019s order certifying that the appeal is not taken in good faith. Robertson\u2019s request for IFP status is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b290-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
