After considerable proceedings and the accumulation of a large record, the district court granted motions for summary judgment, dismissing all federal claims against all defendants with prejudice and dismissing all state law claims without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-18\">We have now reviewed with care the considerable record on appeal, including the district court\u2019s extensive Memorandum Opinion and Order signed on January 12, 2007, and the facts and law as explicated in the excellent appellate briefs filed by opposing counsel. As a result, we are in complete agreement with the rulings of the district court and the reasons and reasoning supporting those rulings; and we can see no reason for writing substantively, as our doing so would merely replicate the writing of the district court. We therefore incorporate herein by reference the aforesaid Memorandum Opinion and Order of that court and affirm the rulings and judgments of the district court in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b288-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under file limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
