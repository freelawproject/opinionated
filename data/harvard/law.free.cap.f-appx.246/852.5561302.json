The district court granted LSI\u2019s motion for summary judgment on all of the plaintiffs discrimination claims. The district court also concluded that Gomez\u2019s retaliation claims, which were raised for the first time in response to the defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion, were not properly before the court and, in any event, meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-18\">The district court\u2019s judgment, which we review <em>de novo </em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is affirmed for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b875-19\">1. To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination in a failure to promote case, Gomez must show that he was qualified for the position he sought.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to LSI\u2019s neutral promotion policy, a position applied for must be the next level in the applicant\u2019s job progression or the applicant must be \u201cotherwise qualified.\u201d Under the promotion policy, an applicant is \u201cotherwise qualified\u201d if he \u201cworked previously in the applied for job progression at a qualifying grade.\u201d At the time Gomez applied for the promotion at issue, Gomez was employed as a grade 5 machine operator. The promotion Gomez sought was a grade 15 team leader position, which was not the next level in his job progression. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>Moreover, there was no evidence that Gomez was otherwise qualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">2. Gomez alleges that a former supervisor\u2019s comments in 2001 are direct evidence of age and religious discrimination. However, that supervisor was terminated shortly after those comments were allegedly made, he was not employed by LSI at the time the promotion decision was made, and there is no allegation that he either participated in the decision to deny Gomez the promotion or otherwise influenced the decisionmakers. The comments are too remote in time to the 2004 employment decision to be considered direct evidence of age or religious discrimination.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">3. Gomez did not assert a \u00a7 1981 retaliation claim in his original complaint before the district court and neither amended nor sought leave to amend his complaint to add a charge of retaliation. As a result, the district court correctly determined that the retaliation claim was not properly before the court, and such claim is beyond the scope of this appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Gomez has not appealed the district court\u2019s disposition of his similarly unpled Title VII and ADEA retaliation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b875-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
