The district court dismissed the application as time-barred. We granted a certificate of appealability (COA) on the issue whether \u201cthe limitations period should have been equitably tolled because Radke did not receive timely notice of the denial of his state habeas application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-25\">Radke argues on appeal that he is entitled to equitable tolling because (1) he did not receive notice of the denial of his state habeas application until 37 days after the denial, and (2) the district court erred in not considering his objections concerning equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-26\">As Radke\u2019s petition is time-barred irrespective of the applicability of the doctrine of equitable tolling to his case, we need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>reach the question for which the COA was granted. Radke\u2019s conviction became final on February 22, 2000, 90 days after his petition for discretionary review was denied on November 24, 1999. <em>See </em>Sup.Ct. R. 13. The one-year limitations period thus expired in February 2001, more than five months before Radke filed his state habeas application on August 6, 2001, and more than 20 months before he filed his \u00a7 2254 application on November 2, 2002. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). As the statute of limitations expired before Radke filed his state habeas application, the issue whether he should receive equitable tolling because of his failure to receive timely notice of the denial of his state habeas application is irrelevant. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b291-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
