ObandoRomero appeals his sentence, contending that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court applied a two-level enhancement for bodily injury. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2A2.4(b)(2) (2005). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">During a search which revealed that he was in possession of marijuana, federal inmate Obando-Romero elbowed Correctional Officer Doyle Cox in the face, breaking his glasses. Cox suffered abrasions on his nose and cheeks, and subsequently developed a black eye. At the sentencing hearing, over Obando-Romero\u2019s objection, the district court determined that Cox\u2019s injury was sufficient to warrant the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-14\">Application Note 1 to \u00a7 2A2.4 provides that the term \u201cbodily injury,\u201d as used in \u00a7 2A2.4, is defined in the commentary to USSG \u00a7 1B1.1. Application Note 1(B) to \u00a7 1B1.1 defines \u201cbodily injury\u201d as \u201cany significant injury; <em>e.g., </em>an injury that is painful and obvious, or is of a type for which medical attention ordinarily would be sought.\u201d We review the district court\u2019s determination that a significant injury was sustained under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. Lancaster, </em>6 F.3d 208, 210 (4th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Isaacs, </em>947 F.2d 112, 114 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-15\">Here, the court viewed a photograph of Cox which showed his black eye. The injury was obvious and the court could safely infer that it was painful. We conclude that the district court did not clearly err in determining that the enhancement applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-16\">Accordingly, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
