Gilbert to set the frame of reference of this appeal, we now consider the question: \u201cWhen is a police officer a police officer?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>\n<em>The Agreed Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Robert Andrew Sawyer and Dean Hundley sued Edwin M. Humphries in the Circuit Court for Carroll County. The thrust of the complaint was that the plaintiffs were assaulted and battered by Humphries on June 10, 1988. At the time of the incident, Humphries was a Maryland State Trooper, off duty, attired in civilian clothing, and operating his personal vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">From the facts we infer that Sawyer and his passenger Hundley were driving behind Humphries on Route 31 near Westminster, Carroll County, Maryland. Humphries drove his vehicle onto the shoulder of the roadway, thus allowing Sawyer to pass. Humphries then re-entered Route 31, proceeding along his original route.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">In the interim Sawyer turned off of Route 31 onto Stone Chapel Road, made a U-turn, and headed back toward Route 31. Humphries, in passing Stone Chapel Road, observed Sawyer at that intersection waiting to turn back onto Route 31. Humphries once again drove his vehicle onto the shoulder of the roadway, alit from the driver\u2019s side, and positioned himself near the back bumper of his automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Sawyer\u2019s and Humphries\u2019s versions of the subsequent events are diametrically opposed to each other. Irrespective of which version is correct, it is undisputed that, as Sawyer\u2019s vehicle passed Humphries, the latter hurled a rock at Sawyer\u2019s car, striking and damaging the passengers\u2019 side of it. Sawyer then made a U-turn and stopped opposite Humphries. Sawyer then got out of his automobile, and both he and Humphries started toward each other. Sawyer contends that Humphries was armed with rocks. In self-defense, Sawyer says, he picked up a beer bottle from the roadway. Humphries, however, asserts that, as he approached Sawyer, the latter picked up a beer bottle and came toward him.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">An altercation between the two ensued, resulting in the beer bottle\u2019s being forcibly taken from Sawyer. Mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>while, during the struggle between Sawyer and Humphries, Hundley began to leave Sawyer\u2019s vehicle, apparently to aid Sawyer. Noticing Hundley\u2019s movements, Humphries ordered Hundley to stay in the car. Hundley obeyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">It is not clear what next ensued. Nevertheless, Sawyer managed to return to his motor car and leave the scene with Hundley driving. Humphries re-entered his vehicle and proceeded to chase Sawyer\u2019s automobile. When Hundley stopped at a stop sign located at New Windsor Road,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Humphries stopped his car behind, got out, and approached the vehicle in which Hundley and Sawyer were seated. Humphries identified himself as a Maryland State Trooper. He placed Sawyer under arrest and detained him until an on-duty uniformed State Trooper arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">One day prior to the claim\u2019s being barred by the statute of limitations,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Sawyer and Hundley filed their complaint in the circuit court. Humphries, relying on Md. Rule 2-322, moved to dismiss the action. His motion was grounded on \u201clack of jurisdiction over the subject matter.\u201d Md. Rule 2-322(b)(l). Humphries asserted that he was, at the time of the incident, a Maryland State Trooper, acting within the scope of his employment. Therefore, he contended, if any claim were to be filed against him, it should have been brought in accordance with the Maryland Tort Claims Act, Md. State Gov\u2019t Code Ann. (State Gov\u2019t Article) \u00a7\u00a7 12-101, <em>et seq. </em>Sawyer and Hundley averred that Humphries was acting as a citizen and not within the scope of his employment as a Maryland State Trooper. The motions judge, Luke K. Burns, agreed with Humphries, the case was dismissed, and this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>\n<em>A Truncated History of the Maryland State Police</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The Maryland State Police were created pursuant to 1935 Md.Laws, ch. 303.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Its members are commonly known as troopers, and they have statewide law enforcement jurisdiction except in incorporated municipalities. Yet, even within those particular municipalities, the State Police possess certain limited jurisdiction. <em>See, e.g., </em>Md.Ann.Code art. 88B, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4, 9, 10, and 13. The State Police exercise full police authority on land, water, and in the air within the territorial confines of Maryland. <em>See Maryland State Police Patrol Manual, 2d ed., </em>Chapter 21, \u00a7 1-2, July 1989; <em>see also </em>Md.Ann.Code art. 88B, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The State Police are charged specifically with the duty of preserving the public peace, detecting and preventing crime, and enforcing the laws and ordinances of this State and its local subdivisions. Troopers \u201capprehend and arrest criminals and those who violated or are lawfully accused of violating such laws and ordinances,\u201d and they preserve order in public places. <em>Maryland Manual, 1989-90, </em>p. 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">When a county of this State elects not to establish and maintain a county police force, that county may agree with the State Police that the latter shall function as the county police force. Those \u201cresident trooper\u201d agreements provide that the State Police, as represented by the resident trooper, shall</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">\u201cenforce the public local laws of the county or municipality and perform related police services, in addition to ... [their] other and regular duties____ For this purpose the Department shall provide such employees, buildings, and facilities as may be required by the agreement or, if not so required, as may be reasonable and proper in the discretion of the Department to perform the objects of the agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Md.Ann.Code art. 88B, \u00a7 63. Carroll County has no county police force. Therefore, under the authority of Md.Ann. Code art. 88B, \u00a7 63, above quoted, the county entered into a resident trooper agreement with the State Police.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\n<em>The Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">All Maryland State Troopers are required to take an Oath of Office, which declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">\u201cI do solemnly swear that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the United States of America and to the State of Maryland; that I will serve honestly and faithfully to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of Maryland; that I will enforce the laws of the State of Maryland; and that I will obey the orders of the Governor and of the officers appointed over me according to the rules and regulations of the Maryland State Police.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The oath is silent as to when a trooper is \u201con duty\u201d or \u201coff duty.\u201d It does, however, without qualification, command that the trooper \u201cwill enforce the laws of the State____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">We observe that the trooper\u2019s oath does not, as the appellants seem to imply, limit enforcement of State laws or local ordinances to prescribed or delineated hours, times, or places.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">The trooper, upon being sworn as a law enforcement officer, becomes part of a cohesive group of men and women whose lives virtually revolve around each other. Troopers are required to conduct themselves \u201cat all times, both on and off duty, in a manner which reflects most favorably on the\u201d State Police, <em>Maryland State Police Administrative Manual, 2d ed., </em>July 1989, Chapter 5, \u00a7 1(3-1), maintaining \u201ca level of moral conduct in ... [their] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>personal affairs which is in keeping with the highest standards of the law enforcement profession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1(8-0).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Justice Sydney H. Asch<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> wrote in <em>Police Authority and the Rights of the Individual, </em>p. 35 (1968):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-6\">\u201cThe nature of a policeman\u2019s life, out of uniform, does not substantially strengthen his ties with the rest of the community. While on duty, the policeman must condition himself not to inject his private personality into the performance of his job. <em>But the policeman in America is considered to be on duty twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. </em>As a consequence, he is always on \u2018good behavior.\u2019 He cannot entirely give himself to his own interests and his own life. His friends always feel the shadow of the policeman\u2019s official position darkening their relationship.<footnotemark>[7]</footnotemark> The officer\u2019s personal life is hedged with restrictions as to associations and activities. These limitations are designed to restrict him from corruption, compromising situations, or the appearance of either. <em>He is at the call of neighbors, more than other persons, much as the physician is.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Despite Justice Asch\u2019s unequivocal declaration that police officers in America are \u201cconsidered to be on duty twenty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>four hours a day, seven days a week,\u201d there is a paucity of written authority to support him. Nevertheless, it seems that most people assume the truth of the saw, and the accuracy <em>vel non </em>of Asch\u2019s statement is meaningless in light of its general acceptance as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">Irrespective of how one views Justice Asch\u2019s assertion, the State Police Patrol Manual, \u00a7 2-l(a) provides: \u201cEmployees of the Agency sworn as <em>police officers of the State of Maryland are considered to be available for duty at all times.\u201d </em>Moreover, off-duty troopers must carry their badge or State Police Identification Card and, at their option, <em>may </em>carry an issued or approved firearm. <em>See Maryland State Police Manual, supra, </em>Chapter 22, \u00a7 11(2-1); <em>Maryland State Police Administrative Manual, supra, </em>Chapter 5, \u00a7 1(26-0). The failure of a trooper to take appropriate action, either on duty or off duty, when matters arise over which the State Police have jurisdiction \u201cis considered neglect of duty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at Chapter 5, \u00a7 1(28-3).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The State Police Manuals are authorized statements of policy. Md.Ann.Code art. 88B, \u00a7 15(a) confers upon the Superintendent of the State Police \u201cthe power to make <em>any rules </em>necessary to promote the effective and efficient performance of the duties of the Department and to insure the good government of the Department and its employees.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) We interpret the Manuals to be composed of a series of rules governing a State Trooper\u2019s conduct. Those rules are promulgated by the Superintendent under the delegation of authority contained in \u00a7 15(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Sir William Blackstone in his well-known <em>Commentaries on the Laws of England </em>has written that constables, the ancestors of today\u2019s police officer, might in \u201cwalled towns\u201d appoint \u201cwatchmen\u201d to keep watch \u201cto apprehend all rogues, vagabonds, and night-walkers and make them give an account of themselves.\u201d The watchmen, during their watch, had \u201cthe authority of the principal [constable].\u201d Implicit in that statement, we think, is the rational inference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>that the constable, of necessity, was always on duty. 1 W. Blackstone, <em>Commentaries </em>*357.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">We have not been directed by counsel to any cases dealing with the issue at hand. Notwithstanding that lack of guidance, we have, however, found authority in other States.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division, addressed the matter in <em>Hanmer v. Wells Fargo and Co. </em>Express, 174 A.D. 724, 160 N.Y.S. 651 (1916). There, the court, holding that police officers are not entitled to rewards because they are, in effect, always on duty, said: \u201cPublic officers such as policemen, constables, etc., are under a <em>special duty at all times, </em>because of the nature of their employment, to use their best efforts to apprehend criminals____\u201d <em>Hanmer, </em>160 N.Y.S. at 654 (emphasis supplied). <em>See also Kick v. Merry, </em>23 Mo. 72, 66 Am.Dec. 658 (1856); <em>Lees v. Colgan, </em>120 Cal. 262, 52 P. 502, 40 L.R.A. 355 (1898).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">Similarly, in <em>People v. Derby, </em>177 C.A.2d 626, 2 Cal.Rptr. 401 (1960), the California courts were called upon to determine the scope of the California Highway Patrol in effectuating an arrest of a person for a breach of the peace. The court held that members of the Highway Patrol are not required to ignore criminal activity after their particular hours of duty had been completed. Looking for authority for their holding, the court turned to the Motor Vehicle Code of California, which stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-9\">\u201cFor the purpose of determining the scope of employment of any member of the California Highway Patrol under the workers\u2019 compensation laws, any such member shall be deemed to be on duty and acting within the scope of the person\u2019s employment when actually exercising any of the powers or performing any of the duties imposed or authorized by law at any time during the 24 hours of the day.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Cal.Veh.Code \u00a7 2253 (West 1989).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The California Supreme Court discussed the question in <em>Cervantez v. J.C. Penney Co., Inc., </em>24 Cal.3d 579, 156 Cal.Rptr. 198, 595 P.2d 975 (1979). There, the court said that, if a peace officer takes on secondary employment, the employment prevents him from acting in what would otherwise be his official capacity. The court made crystalline that only the private employment would convert a police officer into a private citizen:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">\u201c[I]t is thus the fact of private employment which operates to prevent a peace officer from acting in what would otherwise be his official capacity. We do not suggest that a peace officer\u2019s official duties necessarily cease at the end of his normal working hours (cf. <em>People v. Derby </em>(1960) 177 Cal.App.2d 626, 630-631, 2 Cal.Rptr. 401) where there are no private contractual duties of the nature involved in this case. (See <em>People v. Corey, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d [738] at p. 746, 147 Cal.Rptr. 639, 581 P.2d 644.) We disapprove <em>Dowdell v. Owl Drug Co. </em>(1932) 121 Cal.App. 316, 8 P.2d 890 and <em>People v. Millard </em>(1971) 15 Cal.App. 3d 759, 93 Cal.Rptr. 402, to the extent they are inconsistent with this opinion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-7\"><em>Cervantez, </em>156 Cal.Rptr. at 203, 595 P.2d at 980. <em>See also People v. Wittig, </em>158 Cal.App.3d 124, 204 Cal.Rptr. 378 (1984). <em>But see State v. Childs, </em>269 N.W.2d 25 (Minn.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">Illinois discussed a police officer\u2019s being on duty and off duty in <em>Banks v. City of Chicago, </em>11 Ill.App.3d 543, 297 N.E.2d 343 (1973). The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-9\">\u201cThe nature of a policeman\u2019s job is that he be fit and armed at all times, whether on or off duty, and subject to respond to any call to enforce the laws and preserve the peace. It is true that his being considered \u2018on duty\u2019 at all hours of the day or night does not result in all of his acts being deemed to have been taken in the performance of his duties as a police officer. <em>(Karas v. Snell, </em>11 Ill.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>233, 142 N.E.2d 46.) However, since he is always obligated to attempt to prevent the commission of crime in his presence, any action taken by him toward that end, even in his official off-duty hours, falls within the performance of his duties as a police officer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-5\"><em>Banks, </em>11 Ill.App.3d at 550, 297 N.E.2d 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The same court stated in <em>Dzing v. City of Chicago, </em>84 Ill.App.3d 704, 40 Ill.Dec. 420, 406 N.E.2d 121 (1980), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqE\">\u201c[police] officers are required to be armed at all times, whether on or off duty and subject to respond to any call to enforce the laws and preserve the peace. We noted in <em>Banks v. City of Chicago </em>(1973), 11 Ill.App.3d 543, 550, 297 N.E.2d 343, 349, that \u2018It is true that his being considered \u201con duty\u201d at all hours of the day or night does not result in all of his acts being deemed to have been taken in the performance of his duties as a police officer.\u2019 For this reason a municipality was held not liable for the conduct of a police officer who intentionally threatened to kill and did kill complainant\u2019s son so as to cause complainant great emotional distress. <em>(Nelson v. Nuccio </em>[131 Ill.App.2d 261, 268 N.E.2d 543 (1971) ].) Outrageous conduct such as that was outside the scope of the officer\u2019s employment. Likewise, police officers were held not acting within the scope of their employment when they allegedly committed torts of false arrest, false imprisonment and sexual assault, even though their status as police officers was what enabled them to retain custody of the complainant. <em>Gambling v. Cornish </em>(N.D.Ill.1977), 426 F.Supp. 1153. [(1977)]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-7\"><em>Dzing, </em>84 Ill.App.3d at 706-07, 40 Ill.Dec. 420, 406 N.E.2d 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">The Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania ruled in <em>City of Pittsburgh v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, </em>108 Pa.Comm. 477, 529 A.2d 1196 (1987), that any injured officer acting in the scope of employment was entitled to compensation. The court noted, \u201c[W]e would [be] loath to hold that claimant [an off-duty police officer] should sit by idly while a fellow officer must fend for himself against a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>crowd of ruffians because he would go uncompensated if seriously injured because of his entry into a fracas.\u201d <em>City of Pittsburgh, </em>529 A.2d at 1197.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">Atlantic City police officers were declared in <em>Connell v. Board of Review, </em>216 N.J.Super. <em>403, 523 </em>A.2d 1099 (1987), to be on duty twenty-four hours a day. Affirming the New Jersey Board of Review, the Superior Court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-5\">\u201cWe agree with the board\u2019s conclusion that the regulations of the Atlantic City Police Department provide that its members \u2018are always subject to duty although periodically relieved of its routine duties.\u2019 <em>Atlantic City Police Reg. </em>3:1-6. Its officers are required to be armed and carry identification at all times. By law they are empowered to make arrests for crimes committed in their presence anywhere in the State.

They carry this duty <em>twenty-four hours a day, on and off duty.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) <em>Duncan v.

The officer here remained an officer of the law, and his obligation to preserve the peace was not nullified by the fact he was working for Kroger in this case.\u201d <em>State v. Glover, 52 </em>Ohio App.2d 35, 38, 367 N.E.2d 1202, 6 Ohio Op.3d 20 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">The Minnesota Supreme Court held in <em>State v. Childs, </em>269 N.W.2d 25 (1978), that a city police officer, working off duty as a private security officer, served a dual capacity. The officer was both the merchant\u2019s employee and a peace officer whose duty as a peace officer was to arrest persons suspected of shoplifting.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">Based on the foregoing discussion, we hold that an employee of the Maryland State Police, who is sworn as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>police officer, is for police purposes on duty twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, fifty-two weeks a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Since Trooper Humphries acted as a law enforcement officer, at the time of the incident about which Sawyer and Hundley complain, he was under the umbrella of the Maryland Tort Claims Act, State Gov\u2019t Article \u00a7\u00a7 12-101 to 12-110, inclusive. Specifically, \u00a7 12-105(a) of that Act confers immunity upon State employees who are acting \u201cwithin the scope of the public duties of the State personnel and ... without malice or gross negligence, and for which the State or its units have waived immunity under this subtitle, even if damages exceed the limits of that waiver.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Because the trooper was within the ambit of the Act, it was necessary for the appellants, in order to recover from the State, not only to prove their case at trial but to place the State Treasurer on notice within the time prescription of the Act itself.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Our holding that Trooper Humphries was on duty and acting within the scope of his employment does not, however, end our discourse. State Gov\u2019t Article, \u00a7 12-105(a) excludes from immunity malice or gross negligence. If Humphries\u2019s conduct was either malicious or grossly negligent, the State would fold its protective umbrella and expose Humphries to both self-help and a personally fi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>nanced defense of the claim. <em>Elliott v.

Defendant\u2019s [Humphries\u2019s] intentional actions in taking hold of Plaintiff Sawyer and repeatedly attempting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>remove him from his vehicle while he was strapped into the passenger\u2019s seat were willful and malicious and were offensive and caused harm to Plaintiff Sawyer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ab1\">Common to all of the above allegations is the assertion that Humphries acted with malicious intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Malice is defined as the intentional doing of a wrongful act without just cause, excuse, or justification which is reasonably calculated to injure another. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(rev. 5th ed. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Our review of the agreed facts and complaint reveals that the allegations of Sawyer and Hundley do not set out a case that ousts Humphries from the coverage of the Maryland Tort Claims Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Bald allegations of malice or gross negligence, absent more, are not sufficient to remove the immunity protective umbrella from police officers. To allow bald allegations to serve to close the immunity umbrella would, in effect, render all law enforcement officers susceptible to the pleader\u2019s pen. Moreover, the purpose of the statute would be frustrated if a police officer would be fiscally penalized by having to defend himself or herself against bald allegations of malice or gross negligence. When the Legislature enacted the exception to immunity contained in State Gov\u2019t Article, \u00a7 12-105(a), it never intended that a State employee be deprived of immunity and called upon to bear the costs of his or her defense simply because the complaint contained the words \u201cmalice or gross negligence.\u201d We think Trooper Humphries was entitled to \u201cthe whole nine yards\u201d insofar as immunity is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">We iterate what was said in <em>Boyer v.

A police officer\u2019s presently difficult job would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>nearly impossible if every act committed in a non-malicious, discretionary manner would become the basis of a law suit.
