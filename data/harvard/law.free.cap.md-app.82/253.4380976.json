Respess (Respess) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed suit in the Circuit Court for Frederick County against the City of Frederick and Baseball and Sports Associates, Inc., appellees. The complaint as amended sought relief under six counts. Count I alleged that the land where the stadium was to be built was burdened by a restrictive covenant. Count II alleged that the erection of a stadium at this location violated the local zoning ordinance. Count III alleged breach of contract. Count IV alleged that the City\u2019s actions were <em>ultra vires. </em>Count V alleged nuisance and Count VI requested a declaratory judgment. In conjunction with the amended complaint, Respess filed a motion for summary judgment, or alternatively for an interlocutory injunction. Both the City and Baseball and Sports opposed these motions. Baseball and Sports filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>The Circuit Court for Frederick County (Stepler, J.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> held a hearing on these motions and subsequently dismissed Counts I through V of the amended complaint and granted summary judgment against Respess on the final count (VI). Appellant Respess alone appeals this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Appellant asks this Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">I. Whether the circuit court erred when it dismissed appellant\u2019s contention that the construction of the stadium violated the City Zoning Ordinance on the ground that he failed to first exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">II. Whether the City is exempt from the City Zoning Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">III. Whether the circuit court properly dismissed appellant\u2019s challenge to the construction of a stadium on the' basis that the land is burdened by a charitable trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">IV. Whether appellant has standing as a taxpayer asserting a common law right to challenge an <em>ultra vires </em>governmental action.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">V. Whether the Loats will imposes a charitable trust on the land that prohibits the construction or use of a stadium for professional baseball thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">VI. Whether the circuit court erred in failing to declare the rights of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">When John Loats signed and sealed his last will and testament on November 21, 1876 his generous bequests sowed the seeds for more than a century of conflict and litigation. The will established the Loats Female Orphan Asylum of Frederick City<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> [Asylum] so that female orphan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>children \u201cmay be saved from want and protected from the snares of vice and may be properly taught educated and instructed and morally trained____\u201d Loats devised the real property to his niece for her life or until she should marry and then to the Asylum.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">A short synopsis of the consequences of this bequest is provided in <em>Loats Female Orphan Asylum of Frederick City v. Essom, </em>220 Md. 11, 150 A.2d 742 (1959). Between 1881 and September 1956 the Asylum operated the home described in the will.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">On September 5, 1883, the \u201ctrustees\u201d named in the second alternative devise executed, and later recorded, a deed of real estate to the corporation. For some years the Asylum admitted only \u201corphan\u201d girls, in the strict sense of the word, but about twenty-five years ago it also began to admit girls from \u201cbroken homes.\u201d By June 1955, it became apparent that the continued operation of the Asylum was impractical, for various reasons and the Asylum was closed in July, 1956.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 17, 150 A.2d 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">Seeking to sell its real estate, the Asylum sought a decree that it had good and marketable title. <em>Id. </em>at 14, 150 A.2d 742. That action eventually reached the Court of Appeals. The Court rejected claims by Loats\u2019 heirs that the property reverted to them, and held that the Asylum could convey real estate as the purposes of the trust were broader than the literal operation of an orphanage. <em>Id. </em>at 24, 150 A.2d 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">After the orphanage closed, the Asylum donated the income from its property to the Children\u2019s Aid Society of Frederick. After the Society ceased to exist, the Asylum\u2019s Board promulgated a plan to fund student services programs, scholarships and the nursery center of the Evangelical Lutheran Church. Financial aid was no longer re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>stricted to female orphans between the ages of three and eighteen. Contending that the Asylum had completely abandoned its intended purpose, the heirs of John Loats filed an action in equity seeking title to the property. <em>Florence L. Essom, et al. v. The Loats Female Orphanage Asylum of Frederick City, in the County of Frederick, </em>(Equity Action No. 22,813). The court disagreed with the heirs\u2019 assertions and concurring with the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision discussed <em>supra </em>found that the Board did not depart \u201cfrom the objects designated by John Loats; and that the change is dictated by altered circumstances and new theories of treatment; that the broad purpose and intent of John Loats was to help children.\u201d Further, the court found that no implied condition subsequent could be read into the will. Even if the will created such a condition, the court reasoned, it could not be breached unless the Board totally abandoned its purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">The Asylum conveyed the Loats Asylum Farm property in fee simple to the City of Frederick on January 16, 1986. There is evidence in the record that the City made a commitment to the trustees that the park, renamed John Loats Park, would operate with a concentration on youth activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The City of Frederick has since operated the parcel as a park. Planning to construct a 4,200 seat baseball stadium on a portion of this land, the City entered into a lease agreement with Baseball and Sports Associates, Inc. Baseball and Sports owns and operates the Hagerstown Suns and the Frederick Keys. Both are minor league baseball teams affiliated with the Baltimore Orioles. The corporation leases the stadium from the city for the Keys\u2019 home games.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Appellant Respess is a taxpayer and member of the Frederick Seventh Day Adventist Church which is located adjacent to the property in issue. The church operates a school and sponsors after-school and weekend activities for children. In addition to religious services, it sponsors community activities such as Alcoholic Anonymous meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">I. <em>Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ahq\">Count II of Respess\u2019 amended complaint alleged that the construction of a stadium is in violation of the City of Frederick\u2019s Zoning Ordinance because a stadium is not a permissible use of land which is zoned R-l and that the City is subject to and is in violation of its own zoning ordinance. The court dismissed this count because appellant failed to submit a complaint to the Zoning Administrator under the City Zoning Ordinance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\">[Primarily I feel that the plaintiffs have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. It\u2019s under ordinance 21.05 that the zoning administrator shall promptly investigate any written complaint alleging violation of this ordinance and of course if they aren\u2019t satisfied they may then take their appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">... I think it should also be dismissed because the construction of a stadium is a governmental act and is not subject to the city zoning ordinance. I don\u2019t find it to be a proprietary act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Appellant contends that this ruling is incorrect because he interprets the City\u2019s Zoning Ordinance to permit direct appeal of a Planning Commission decision to the circuit court. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">The City of Frederick Zoning Ordinance contains its own enforcement procedures. Frederick, Md., Zoning Ordinance \u00a7 21.05 (ordinance). Any written complaint alleging a violation of the ordinance shall be investigated by a zoning administrator. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 21.05(1). The zoning administrator\u2019s decision may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals within thirty (30) days. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 19.14(1). Individuals dissatisfied by the Board\u2019s review of the decision may then appeal to the circuit court. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 19.09.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">The integrity of any administrative scheme requires that the agency\u2019s remedies must first be exhausted before a party can pursue a civil appeal. Ordinarily, to exhaust administrative remedies a party must pursue the prescribed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>administrative procedures and await the final outcome. Only after a final order may a party resort to the courts. <em>Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Co., </em>296 Md. 46, 50-52, 459 A.2d 205 (1983). <em>Accord, Comm \u2019n on Human Relations v. Mass Transit Auth., </em>294 Md. 225, 230-231, 449 A.2d 385 (1982); <em>Steuart Investment Co. v. Board of Comm\u2019rs St. Mary\u2019s County, </em>38 Md.App. 381, 390, 381 A.2d 1174 (1978); <em>Comm\u2019rs of Cambridge v. Henry, </em>263 Md. 370, 373-374, 283 A.2d 415 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">In <em>Comm\u2019rs of Cambridge v. Henry, supra, </em>several private citizens sought to enjoin the City of Cambridge\u2019s proposed construction of a waterfront park on the ground, <em>inter alia, </em>the construction violated a local zoning ordinance. Though the circuit court enjoined the construction, the Court reversed and dismissed the bill of complaint holding that the action should have been brought before the Board of Zoning Appeals instead of the circuit court. Observing that Cambridge\u2019s zoning ordinance provides that the issue be decided initially by the Board of Appeals with judicial review by the circuit court, Judge Henderson writing for the Court emphasized that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">It is well established that a claimant ordinarily must seek to redress the wrong of which he complains by using the statutory procedure the legislature has established for that kind of case, if it is adequate and available, and that if he is unsuccessful and wishes aid from the courts, he must take judicial appeals in the manner the legislature has specified rather than by seeking to invoke the ordinary general jurisdiction of the courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 373-374, 283 A.2d 415 <em>quoting Agrarian, Inc. v. Zoning Inspector of Harford County, </em>262 Md. 329, 332, 277 A.2d 591 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">In the case <em>sub judice </em>Respess\u2019 complaint stated that the proposed commercial stadium is not within the uses permitted in an area zoned R-l. This allegation, that the use violates the area\u2019s zoning ordinance, should have been brought before the zoning administrator for determination. The zoning administrator shall consult the ordinance\u2019s table <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>of permitted uses and decide whether any proposed use not specifically included in the table is permissible. <em>See, </em>Ordinance \u00a7 402(1), (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Appellant submits that he properly brought the action before the circuit court pursuant to Ordinance \u00a7 6.10(2) which permits direct appeals from Planning Commission decisions on site plans to the circuit court. This provision is inapposite. Though appellant\u2019s complaint does allege that he objected to the proposed stadium before the Frederick County Planning Commission, the count as a whole complains that the zoning ordinance was violated by the City and not that the Planning Commission\u2019s approval of the site plan was improper. As Respess was aggrieved by what he perceived to be the City\u2019s violation of the zoning ordinance, that complaint should have been taken first before the zoning administrator.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Because we affirm the court\u2019s dismissal of Count II, we will not address Respess\u2019 contention in that count that the City is barred by its own zoning ordinance from constructing a stadium for commercial uses in an R-l zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">II. <em>Standing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Respess alleged in Count I of the amended complaint that the property was still encumbered by the restriction of uses contained in the Loats will. Further, the use contemplated by the City of Frederick and Baseball and Sports was not in accordance with the charitable uses intended by the testator. Appellant requested an interlocutory and permanent injunction on the construction of the stadium and requested, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court impose a trust upon the property to carry out the charitable purposes. Similarly, Count IV alleged that the city\u2019s acts were <em>ultra vires </em>in part because they violated the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>The court found that Respess did not have standing to enforce the trust, and that the property was not impressed with a charitable trust:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-4\">Now, what, in essence, Count I is seeking to do is enforce a trust, and under Maryland law the only persons having standing to enforce a trust for charitable uses or purposes are the Maryland Attorney General or certain other interested persons. And this was defined in 1938 in the <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Peabody Institute of </em>Baltimore,[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] and in that case the court said that only upon the instigation of the suit of The Attorney General or a person interested can this action lie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">Now, there\u2019s been a great deal of dispute as to what \u201cinterested person\u201d is, whether it\u2019s the same thing as a person having an interest in land, and under Section 14-301[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] and 101[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] of the Estates &amp; Trust Article of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Annotated Code, it defines what \u201cinterested persons\u201d are. I don\u2019t think that any of the plaintiff\u2019s qualify as interested person under those definitions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-4\">I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that Respess is not an interested person, and I think also that Maryland courts have generally followed the rule that a member of the general public, though a taxpayer, has no standing to maintain a suit to enforce a charitable trust or to prevent violations of a charitable trust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">* * * <em>* </em>*je *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">And also, if we\u2019re assuming that there is a trust imposed, as I said, we have a necessary party that\u2019s not joined, and that\u2019s essentially the trustees of the Loats Foundation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">... [A]s to Count I, there\u2019s really no dispute as to the facts. And as a matter of law, I have found that the property is not impressed with a charitable trust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Respess does not appeal the court\u2019s decision with regard to his standing to enforce the charitable trust. He asserts, however, that Count IV was improperly dismissed because he has standing as a taxpayer to challenge the <em>ultra vires </em>act of violating a charitable trust. Appellant contends that the allegations in the amended complaint that his taxes may increase to cover the additional financial burden imposed on the city by the building and maintenance of the stadium are sufficient to warrant standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">In <em>Carroll Park Manor Community Ass\u2019n., Inc. v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs of Frederick County, Maryland, </em>50 Md.App. 819, 487 A.2d 689 <em>cert. denied, </em>292 Md. 595 (1981) four citizen taxpayers and an incorporated association of homeowners appealed an order that they had no standing to obtain a declaratory judgment and injunction to restrict Frederick County\u2019s use of a tract of land. This property had been obtained by the county in 1828 by a deed which limited use of the land \u201cfor the benefit of the poor of said county and to and for no other use, intent or purpose, whatsoever.\u201d The bill of complaint claimed that the terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>of the deed created a charitable trust which would be violated by the present and prospective uses of the tract. <em>Id. </em>50 Md.App. at 320, 437 A.2d 689. This Court held that appellants did not seek to enforce a charitable trust but \u201cas taxpayers and citizens of Frederick County to enjoin allegedly <em>ultra vires </em>acts by the County authorities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>ultra vires </em>acts cited by this Court were the \u201cuses in violation of trust as established in the deed of the Monte-ville Tract to the County in 1828.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321, 437 A.2d 689. This Court went on to note that taxpayers seeking to invoke the aid of an equity court to challenge an <em>ultra vires </em>act by public officials must allege that the challenged action results in a pecuniary loss or increase in taxes to them as taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">We find <em>Carroll Park </em>to be controlling in this case and conclude that Respess\u2019 allegation that the proposed stadium may result in increased taxes is sufficient to warrant standing to challenge the County\u2019s use of the property as an <em>ultra vires </em>act. Our holding that Respess has standing to challenge use of the property as an <em>ultra vires </em>act will offer him little solace as we conclude <em>infra </em>that use of the property is not restricted by the will of John Loats.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">III. <em>Charitable Trust</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Respess states that the primary purpose of the stadium which the city leases to Baseball and Sports is to create a profit. He alleges that a stadium located on land which had been conveyed by Loats to the Asylum violates the purpose of the charitable trust which limits use to the aid of the needy children of Frederick. Citing <em>Loats Female Orphan Asylum of Frederick City v. Essom, </em>220 Md. 11, 150 A.2d 742 (1959), the court found that the property was not impressed with a charitable trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">In <em>Loats, </em>the Loats Female Orphan Asylum of Frederick City instituted a declaratory decree to permit it to sell good and marketable title. The Court reviewed the will of John Loats (discussed <em>supra) </em>and held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>[t]he sale of the real estate is necessary to the continued fulfillment of these objects, within the purview of the testator\u2019s primary purpose to aid destitute and deserving female orphan children. We think there was no right of entry or reverter and no resulting trust under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 24, 150 A.2d 742. The case was remanded to the circuit court for a decree in accordance with that decision. <em>Id. </em>The circuit court ordered that no cloud remain on the title to the property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">It is thereupon, accordingly, and in obedience to the said mandate of the Court of Appeals, this 27th day of July, 1959, by the Circuit Court for Frederick County, sitting as a Court of Equity, ADJUDGED, ORDERED AND DECREED that any cloud upon the title of the Loats Female Orphan Asylum of Frederick City, in the County of Frederick, a body corporate of the State of Maryland, in and to the rea<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> estate and improvements described in these proceedings, caused or existing by reason of the claims of Florence L. Essom and the unknown heirs, devisees, personal representatives, descendants or successors of John Loats, deceased, and of Louis Loats, deceased, be and the same is hereby removed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">And it is further ADJUDGED, ORDERED AND DECREED that the said The Loats Female Asylum of Frederick City, in the County of Frederick, a body corporate of the State of Maryland, may sell and convey said real estate and improvements described in these proceedings or any part thereof without regard to the claims of the said Florence L. Essom or of the unknown heirs, devisees, personal representatives, descendants or successors of John Loats, deceased, or of Louis Loats, deceased.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACl\">Despite the holding of the Court and the passage of the foregoing order, title to the property was again challenged by the heirs of Loats. <em>See, Essom v. Loats Asylum, </em>No. 22,813, Equity. The court (McLaughlin, J.) held that while Loats intended to create a lasting and permanent institution, the language in his will burdened the Board to carry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>out his intentions and did not create any implied condition subsequent in the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">We concur with the judgment of the circuit court in the case <em>sub judice </em>because the Court of Appeals held in <em>Loots, supra, </em>that the sale of the property was consistent with the purposes of the charitable trust, free of any of the trust restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">IV. <em>Declaratory Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"A-J\">Count VI sought declaratory judgment. The court dismissed the previous counts and ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">With respect to the allegations of Count VI, for the reasons detailed by the Court on the record, the Court determined that plaintiffs are not entitled to any of the relief prayed for in that Court as a matter of law. As a consequence, Plaintiffs Motion for Summary Judgment as to that count be and the same is hereby DENIED. For the same reasons and because it considered matters in addition to the allegations in the pleadings in reaching its decision, the Court, pursuant to Rule 2-322(c) of the Maryland Rules of Procedure, hereby treats defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss as to Count VI as a Motion for Summary Judgment which is hereby granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred because it failed to declare the rights of the parties. We hold that the trial court\u2019s ruling from the bench did declare the rights of the parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">Now, essentially they have asked whether the will imposes charitable trust on the land, and I, in the ruling on the other motion, have ruled that it doesn\u2019t. Whether the deed conveyed the property free of charitable purposes; and I, in essence, on another count, have ruled that it does. Whether the construction of the stadium and lease complies with the agreement between Frederick and Loats concerning the use of the land, and in essence I have said they don\u2019t have standing on that count, and that if there was an agreement it had merged with the deed. I believe that that Count VI is disposed of by reason of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>my ruling on the other counts____ I don\u2019t think its appropriate to dismiss it. I think its a matter of rulings; I\u2019ve ruled on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">MR. BOULAND [Counsel for plaintiff]: I think what Your Honor\u2019s doing is issuing a declaratory judgment, although one adverse to what my clients requested. So you\u2019re not dismissing it; you\u2019re saying, \u201cI\u2019m granting declaratory judgment, and this is it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">THE COURT: Well, I\u2019m not so sure I am. We\u2019re talking about a procedural point here, which I\u2019m not clear about. What I\u2019ve said is that as a result of ruling on the other motions, all the questions that have been asked by the plaintiff are answered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">MR. BOULAND: I believe that\u2019s correct. Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aad\">It is well settled that \u201cseldom, if ever, in a declaratory judgment proceeding should a ... petition [be] dismissed without a declaration one way or the other of the rights of the parties.\u201d <em>Hunt v. Montgomery County, </em>248 Md. 403, 410, 237 A.2d 35 (1968); <em>Koontz v. Ass\u2019n. of Classified Employees, </em>297 Md. 521, 529, 467 A.2d 753 (1983). Even where a declaration may be contrary to the desires of a movant, a trial judge should make a declaration. <em>Broadwater v. State, </em>303 Md. 461, 467, 494 A.2d 934 (1985). Indeed, \u201c[n]umerous ... cases have said that in a declaratory judgment action the court must declare the rights of the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 468, 494 A.2d 934. Instances where a trial court in a declaratory judgment proceeding may properly not declare the rights of the parties are quite limited. <em>Id. </em>Situations where a court may dismiss a declaratory judgment proceeding include a finding that the question was moot and inability to make a declaration where the case lacked the necessary parties. <em>See Koontz, supra, </em>297 Md. at 529-530, 467 A.2d 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Ordinarily we would affirm the judgment; however, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>since the court declared the rights of the parties on the record but did not reduce the declaration to a judgment, we remand and direct that the court formalize its declaration into a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>JUDGMENT NEITHER AFFIRMED NOR REVERSED; CASE REMANDED FOR PROCEEDINGS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-9\">.
