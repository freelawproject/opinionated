BELL, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">This is an appeal by R &amp; T Construction Company and its insurer, Maryland Casualty Company, appellants, from a judgment in favor of Thomas C. Judge, appellee, entered, on a jury verdict, by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. It raises four issues, namely:</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">1. Whether the lower court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion for judgment and in ruling that, as a matter of law, further home modifications, a specially equipped van for non-medical purposes and increased electrical expenses were covered under Maryland Annotated Code, Art. 101, \u00a7 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">2. Whether the lower court erred in allowing Dr. Robert Menter to testify that the appellee is in need of a van modified for non-medical purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-12\">3. Whether the lower court erred in allowing a psychologist to testify as to claimant\u2019s need for home modifications and his need of a van modified for his use for non-medical purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-13\">4. Whether the lower court erred in ruling that the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission had jurisdiction over this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-14\">We answer each of the questions in the negative, thus, we will affirm the lower court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>The facts are, for the most part, undisputed. Appellee, while employed as a construction worker for a Virginia based employer, was seriously injured in an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment. The accident occurred in Gaithersburg, Maryland in October, 1981. As a result of the injuries he received, appellee was rendered a respirator-dependent quadriplegic, requiring around-the-clock nursing care.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Although he initially filed a claim with the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, he later voluntarily withdrew it, in order to file a claim with the Virginia Industrial Accident Commission. Appellee was, and is, a resident of Virginia. The Virginia Commission \u201cawarded ... Judge compensation benefits during the course of his disability, and further awarded him medical benefits for as long as required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Notwithstanding that appellants had made certain modifications to appellee\u2019s home \u2014 constructing a ramp and installing air conditioning \u2014 and supplied appellee with a specially equipped van to provide transportation for medical purposes, on two subsequent occasions, appellee filed applications with the Virginia Commission seeking additional benefits. On the first occasion, he sought to purchase \u201ca van to be permanently situated at his home on a 24 hour per day basis that would allow him to leave his home and ultimately give him more freedom of movement____\u201d On the second occasion, he sought additional modifications to his home, which would \u201cmake it accessible for his uses as a wheelchair bound quadriplegic accident victim.\u201d <em>Judge v. R &amp; T Construction, </em>68 Md.App. 57, 59, 509 A.2d 1236, <em>cert. denied, </em>307 Md. 433, 514 A.2d 1211 (1986). The Virginia Commission denied both applications.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ruling on the home modifications was premised on the employer and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>insurer having exceeded the statutory liability limits. Appellee did not seek as he did here, reimbursement of the increase in utility expenses necessitated by the life support and other medically required equipment he must use.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">Appellee filed another compensation claim in Maryland.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his application, appellee sought from the Maryland Commission the same relief that the Virginia Commission had just denied, namely, additional modifications to his home for purposes of making it wheelchair accessible and a modified van for transportation purposes other than medical appointments. In addition, he sought reimbursement of the increases in electrical expense necessitated by the life support systems and other equipment he had to use. Although the Commission determined that it had jurisdiction to entertain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>the claim and that it was not barred by limitations or precluded from acting by Article 101 \u00a7 21(c)(4),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it found \u201cthat the claimant is not entitled to payment for increases in electric bills, a van, and further modifications to his home pursuant to the provisions of Art. 101, sub-section 37.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Appellee appealed to the circuit court, challenging only the Commission\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 37(a). Appellants like<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>wise appealed; they challenged the Commission\u2019s determination that it had jurisdiction over the case. Both sides moved for summary judgment. Appellants sought summary judgment on the jurisdictional issue and appellee sought partial summary judgment with respect to the interpretation of \u00a7 37(a). The circuit court denied appellants\u2019 motion, but granted appellee\u2019s. It entered partial summary judgment, on the grounds presented, in favor of appellee. The case was then set for jury trial \u201cfor the purpose of determining the extent of benefits, if any, which the claimant should receive, under \u00a7 37 of the Act____\u201d At the conclusion of the trial, the jury returned special verdicts in favor of appellee, finding that he was entitled to home modifications, a modified van, and reimbursement for increased utility costs. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">As phrased by appellants, the first issue presented has two aspects. The first involves the interpretation of \u00a7 37(a). As to it, appellants maintained below, as they do on appeal, that the court erred in interpreting \u00a7 37(a) to include \u201cnon-medical-type treatment, apparatus, and the like.\u201d The second aspect relates to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict. As to it, appellants assert that the evidence presented at trial was wholly insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdicts. We will address each aspect separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">A. INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">Maryland Code Annotated Art. 101, \u00a7 37(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-9\">(a) <em>Employer to provide medical, etc., treatment and services. </em>\u2014 In addition to the compensation provided for herein the employer shall promptly provide for an injured employee, for such period as the nature of the injury may require, such medical, surgical or other attendance or treatment, nurse and hospital services, medicines, crutches, apparatus, artificial hands, arms, feet and legs and other prosthetic applicances as may be required by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>Commission, provided, however, that any order or award of the Commission, under this subsection, shall not be construed to reopen any case, or permit any previous award to be changed or modified, except as provided in \u00a7 40(c) and 40(d) of this article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">In <em>Harris v. Janco Enterprises, </em>53 Md.App. 674, 677, 455 A.2d 453 (1983), this Court, referring to the appropriate interpretation of \u00a7 37(a), observed: \u201cIt is perfectly clear that this language deals with medical services necessary or desirable to treat the effects of the injury, and not with services rendered by physicians solely for the purpose of evaluating the extent of disability in order to present testimony on that issue.\u201d At issue in that case was, as is obvious from the above, the question whether \u00a7 37(a) covered fees paid to an evaluating physician for his or her testimony at a hearing. Except as to the issue directly presented, the court was not called upon to interpret what constitutes \u201cmedical services\u201d. As such, it had no occasion to address the meaning of \u201cother attendance\u201d, \u201capparatus\u201d, and \u201cother prosthetic appliances\u201d. In fact, this issue has never been addressed by any Maryland court. It is our task to undertake that interpretation now.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">We approach this task fully aware that, consistent with Maryland Code Annotated Art. 101 \u00a7 63, \u201cthis article shall be so interpreted and construed as to effectuate its general purpose\u201d \u2014 as liberally in favor of injured employees as its provisions will permit in order to effectuate its benevolent purposes. <em>Soper v. Montgomery County, </em>294 Md. 331, 335, 449 A.2d 1158 (1982); <em>Howard County Association for Retarded Citizens v. Walls, </em>288 Md. 526, 530, 418 A.2d 1210 (1980); <em>W.C. &amp; A.N. Miller Development Company v. Honaker, </em>40 Md.App. 185, 189, 388 A.2d 562 (1978), <em>aff'd, </em>285 Md. 216, 401 A.2d 1013 (1979). Furthermore, where a provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is ambiguous, the uncertainty or conflict should be resolved in favor of the claimant. <em>Ryder Truck Lines v. Kennedy, </em>296 Md. 528, 537, 463 A.2d 850 (1983). <em>Coats &amp; Clark\u2019s Sales Corp. v. Stewart, </em>39 Md.App. 10, 16-17, 383 A.2d 67 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>(1978); <em>Keene v. Insley, </em>26 Md.App. 1, 11-12, 337 A.2d 168 (1975). Of course, \u201cneither statutory language nor legislative intent can be stretched beyond the fair implication of the statute\u2019s word or its purpose,\u201d <em>Soper v. Montgomery County, </em>294 Md. at 335, 449 A.2d 1158, in order to create ambiguity or conflict. Rather, any construction of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act should take account of its clear meaning. In other words, a construction should not disregard the plain language of a provision of the Act in order to create a conflict of ambiguity so that the provision may be interpreted in favor of the injured worker. <em>See Crowner v. Baltimore United Butchers Association, </em>226 Md. 606, 610, 175 A.2d 7 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">As we have seen, we have construed \u00a7 37(a) as dealing with \u201cmedical services\u201d. Neither this Court nor the Court of Appeals has, however, been faced with the question of what \u201cmedical services\u201d specifically entails. On the other hand, a noted commentator has observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahe\">\u201cMedical benefits ordinarily include not only medical and hospital services and nursing care, which may be compensable even when supplied at home by a member of claimants\u2019 family but also necessary incidentals such as transportation, appartus, supplies, and sometimes even special housing facilities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">2 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (1989), \u00a7 61.00. <em>See also Squeo v. Comfort Control Corporation, </em>99 N.J. 588, 494 A.2d 313 (1985); <em>Derebery v. Pitt County Fire Marshall, </em>347 S.E.2d 814 (N.C.1986) <em>rev\u2019g, </em>76 N.C.App. 67, 332 S.E.2d 94 (1985); <em>Peace River Electric Corp. v. Choate, </em>417 So.2d 831 (Fla.App.1982), <em>Pet. for Rev. dism., </em>429 So.2d 7 (Fla.1983). This is to be contrasted with cases from other jurisdictions which narrowly construe \u201cmedical services\u201d. <em>See e.g. Low Splint Coal Company, Inc. v. Bolling, </em>297 S.E.2d 665 (Va.1982); <em>Savaria v. DiSano, </em>118 R.I. 357, 373 A.2d 820 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">In <em>Bolling, </em>the claimant was a paraplegic confined to a wheelchair. He sought construction of a concrete ramp and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>modifications to his bathroom. Although the Virginia Industrial Commission granted the relief, the lower court reversed. The Virginia Supreme Court affirmed the lower court. The statute at issue in that case provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-4\">As long as necessary after an accident the employer shall furnish or cause to be furnished, free of charge to the injured employee, a physician chosen by the injured employee from a panel of at least three physicians selected by the employer and <em>such other necessary medical attention, </em>and where such accident results in the amputation of an arm, hand, leg or foot or the enucleation of an eye or the loss of any natural teeth or loss of hearing, the employer shall furnish prosthetic appliances, proper fitting thereof, and training in the use thereof, as the nature of the injury may require ... and in addition, such surgical and hospital service and supplies as may be deemed necessary by the attending physician or the Industrial Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-5\">4c 4* 4\u00ab 4s 4* 4*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-6\">The employer shall also furnish or cause to be furnished, at the direction of the Industrial Commission, <em>reasonable and necessary vocational rehabilitation services. </em>(Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Code of Virginia, 65.1-88 (Repl.Vol.1980). Construing this statute, the Court concluded that \u201cother necessary medical attention\u201d was limited to services and, thus, did not contemplate structural renovations. Nor did the phrase \u201creasonable and necessary vocational rehabilitation training services\u201d encompass such renovations. 297 S.E.2d at 667. Indeed, the Court said, \u201cthe employer [was] responsible for providing only those services and those prosthetic appliances specifically delineated in the statute.\u201d 297 S.E.2d at 668. In short, the Supreme Court opined that the statute \u201ccannot properly be read to include the structural improvements in question as either \u2018other necessary medical attention\u2019 or \u2018reasonable and necessary vocational rehabilitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>training services.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>297 S.E.2d at 666.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">The statute at issue in <em>Savaria, supra, </em>provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-5\">The employer shall ... promptly provide for an injured employee such reasonable medical, surgical, dental, optical or other attendance or treatment, nurse and hospital service, medicines, crutches and apparatus for such period as is necessary, in order to cure, rehabilitate or relieve the employee from the effects of his injury and to restore the function of the injured member organ where such restoration is possible____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">In that case, the claimant, who was unable to use his legs and could barely move his arms, sought to be provided with an electric wheelchair and an automatic lift or elevator. Interpreting the statute, the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission granted the request for a wheelchair but denied the request for the automatic lift or elevator. The Supreme Court of Rhode Island affirmed. Interpreting the statute, and notwithstanding testimony from the treating physician that although the claimant\u2019s health would not be improved or his mobility increased, the claimant would benefit from the automatic lift or elevator because it would relieve him from the effects of his injury, the Court concluded that \u201cit [was] not enough that the means used to relieve the employee from the effects of his injury [had] been prescribed by [a] physician; to be chargeable to the employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>er under the statute, they must be medical in nature as well.\u201d 373 A.2d at 822.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Those cases in which home modifications have been permitted evidence application of a broader interpretation of what constitutes \u201cmedical services\u201d. In <em>Squeo, </em>for example, the claimant, a quadriplegic, sought construction of a self-contained apartment to be attached to his parents\u2019 home. The statute pursuant to which the application was made required the employer to furnish the injured worker \u201csuch medical, surgical and other treatment, and hospital service as shall be necessary to cure and relieve the worker of the effects of the injury and to restore the functions of the injured member or organ where such restoration is possible ...\u201d and, where \u201can artificial limb or other appliance\u201d may partially or completely relieve the effects of the permanent injury, to supply such artificial limb or other appliance. N.J.S.A. 34:15-15. The evidence in support of the application demonstrated that the claimant, who had been placed in a nursing home predominantly inhabited by elderly residents, had attempted suicide on three occasions; expert testimony tended to prove that a change in his environment would have a beneficial effect on the claimant\u2019s state of mind and, conversely, that more suicide attempts would occur should he remain in the nursing home; other expert testimony was to the effect that the claimant\u2019s \u201cability to choose his own living environment was the \u2018utmost important issue\u2019 for his physical and psychological health.\u201d 494 A.2d at 315, 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of both the Compensation Commission and the appellate division of the Superior Court. Construing the act \u201cso as to comport with its presumptive beneficient and remedial objectives favorable to the injured workman\u201d, the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-6\">\u201c... [Ujnder certain unique circumstances, when there is sufficient and competent medical evidence to establish that the requested \u201cother treatment\u201d or \u201cappliance\u201d is reasonable and necessary to relieve the injured worker of the effect of his injuries, the construction of an apart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>ment addition may be in the ambit of N.J.S.A. 34:15-15. We caution, however, that it is only the unusual case that may warrant such extraordinary relief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-6\"><em>Squeo, </em>494 A.2d at 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\"><em>Derebery, supra, </em>is to like effect. There, the Supreme Court of North Carolina construed the phrase \u201cother treatment or care\u201d as used in that State\u2019s Act,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as including treatment or services not specifically delineated in the statute. 347 S.E.2d at 819. As was the case in <em>Squeo, </em>the Court relied upon testimony from claimant\u2019s physician that claimant had a need of \u201carchitecturally modified housing\u201d, <em>id., </em>347 S.E.2d at 822, and testimony of a registered nurse that separate modified housing would meet the claimant\u2019s emotional needs. <em>Id., </em>347 S.E.2d at 816. In addition, the Court noted that the applicable statute had been legislatively expanded since its initial enactment. 347 S.E.2d at 819. <em>See also Peace River Electric Corp. v. Choate, </em>417 So.2d 831 (Fla.App.1982), <em>Pet. for Rev. dism., </em>429 So.2d 7 (Fla.1983); <em>Rieger v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, </em>104 Pa.Cmwlth. 42, 521 A.2d 84, 87 (1987) (If a \u201cwheelchair is necessary, then it logically follows that minor modification needed to facilitate use of the appliance must also be considered a necessity\u201d); <em>Langford v. William Rogers, Inc., </em>144 A.D.2d 785, 534 N.Y.S.2d 761 (3 Dept.1988) (the phrase \u201cother attendance or treatment\u201d provides authority for ordering carrier to pay for reasonable modifications to facilitate use of a wheelchair); <em>Terry Grantham Company v. Industrial Commission of Arizona, </em>154 Ariz. 180, 741 P.2d 313 (App.1987); <em>Butler v. Lanzo Construction Company, </em>509 So.2d 965 (Fla.App.1987); <em>Zylbergleit v. Irving Rubber &amp; Metal Company, </em>87 A.D.2d 929, 450 N.Y.S.2d 87 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>(1982); <em>Pine Bluff Parks and Recreation v. Porter, </em>6 Ark.App. 154, 639 S.W.2d 363 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">A similar situation exists as to appellee\u2019s request for a modified van. In <em>Terry Grantham Company, supra, </em>the Arizona Court of Appeals rejected an insurer\u2019s argument that a \u201cvan, unlike a wheelchair, is \u2018merely a form of transportation which allows one to travel [a] greater distance in a shorter period of time.\u2019 \u201d 741 P.2d at 316. As in the instant case, the claimant was a quadriplegic whose injuries resulted in loss of control over his body temperature. Commenting on this fact, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">As a result of Boy\u2019s industrial injury, he has lost, among other things, his ability to perspire, and he is therefore exposed to the danger of his body temperature reaching critical levels. For Boy, a wheelchair is simply inappropriate for travel beyond limited distances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-7\"><em>Id. </em>The Court thus interpreted \u201cother apparatus\u201d, as used in the statute,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as an apparatus required to replace a lost bodily function. It agreed with the administrative law judge\u2019s finding that \u201cthe van was a reasonably required \u2018other apparatus\u2019 \u201d under the statute. <em>Id. See also Edgewood Boys\u2019 Ranch Foundation v. Robinson, </em>451 So.2d 532 (Fla.App.1984), <em>aff'd, </em>456 So.2d 1270 (Fla.App.1984), in which the Court affirmed a workers\u2019 compensation order requiring the employer to furnish quadriplegic claimant with a specially-equipped van, an order which it determined to be fully substantiated by claimant\u2019s doctor. The Court in <em>Terry Grantham Company </em>adopted reasoning that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Avv\">\u201cWhere an industrial injury necessitates the modification or substitution of an automobile in order to accomodate a wheelchair or artificial member and to restore in part a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>claimant\u2019s former ambulatory ability, such costs may be awarded as \u201cother apparatus\u201d [pursuant to the act]\u201d. (Citation omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-5\"><em>Fidelity &amp; Casualty Company of New York v. Cooper, </em>382 So.2d 1331, 1332 (Fla.App.1980). 741 P.2d at 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">There are, of course, cases on the other side of this issue as well. <em>See </em>2 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 61.13(a), p. 10-863 and cases there cited. Those cases turn upon an interpretation of \u201cmedical apparatus or device\u201d and, generally, reflect that that interpretation is approached from a narrow perspective. <em>See e.g. DeCroix v. Sumergrade and Sons, 20 </em>A.D.2d 735, 246 N.Y.S.2d 852 (3 Dept.1964) where claimant fractured his leg resulting in limitation of his motion at the ankle, traumatic arthritis of the ankle and an ankle ulcer, an automobile held not to be \u201cmedical apparatus or device\u201d and, hence, commission award with respect to the cost of driving the claimant\u2019s car to and from the work was reversed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Nallan v. Motion Picture Studio Mechanics Union, Local #52, </em>49 A.D.2d 365, 375 N.Y.S.2d 164 (A.D. 3 Dept.1975), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>40 N.Y.2d 1042, 391 N.Y.S.2d 853, 360 N.E.2d 353 (1976) (same, applied to a paraplegic); <em>Kranis v. Trunz, Inc., </em>91 A.D.2d 765, 458 N.Y.S.2d 10 (3 Dept.1982) (same); <em>McDonald v. Brunswick Electric Membership Corp., </em>77 N.C.App. 753, 336 S.E.2d 407 (App.1985) (specially equipped van for use of a double amputee did not qualify as \u201cother treatment or care\u201d or \u201crehabilitative services\u201d as those terms are used in the workers\u2019 compensation statute<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">We find more persuasive those cases in which the terms \u201cmedical treatment\u201d and the like are interpreted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>more broadly. Moreover, we believe such an interpretation of such terms is consistent with the statutory mandate that this social legislation be interpreted liberally and in favor of those whom it was designed to protect. Therefore, we hold that, given an appropriate factual predicate, \u00a7 37(a) may permit the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission to order modifications to an injured worker\u2019s home, as well as providing, for the use of the injured worker, a specially modified and equipped van. Indeed, we believe that the latter fits quite comfortably within the Maryland statute \u2014 as an \u201cother prosthetic appliance.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Appellants maintain that, with regard to increased electrical expenses, \u00a7 37(a) contains no category covering this benefit. Thus, while they do not maintain that the electrical devices furnished appellee are not necessary medical treatment or apparatus, they nevertheless argue that the increased utility bills are not themselves \u201cmedical, surgical, attendance, treatment or apparatus\u201d, even under the most liberal view of those terms. At oral argument, however, appellants all but conceded the illogic of their position. It makes absolutely no sense for a statute to require an employer to furnish an injured worker with equipment, and yet not require that same employer to supply that same injured worker the means with which to operate it. This is particularly true when the equipment is necessary for the preservation of the injured employee\u2019s life. We hold that the amount of the increase of the utility bills in respect of the electrical apparatus necessary to maintain appellee\u2019s life is covered by \u00a7 37(a), encompassed within the phrase \u201cother attendance\u201d.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>B. SUFFICIENCY</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">Appellants assert that the evidence adduced in the instant case is insufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> They do so on the basis of a comparison of the facts <em>sub judice </em>with those in cases in which courts have ordered modifications to an injured employee\u2019s home and, in particular, <em>Squeo </em>and <em>Peace River Electric Corp. </em>In their view, the facts of the instant case compare unfavorably; they characterize them as less extreme and less fraught with human misery.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Appellants perceive the following passage from <em>Squeo </em>as illustrative of the difference between the facts in that case and the facts <em>sub judice:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">Apart from his quadriplegia, which cannot be reversed, and physical complications, which are treated as they arise, Squeo has suffered serious psychological setbacks. No one disputes that these emotional problems are a result of his work-connected injury and its consequences. Nor is it disputed that Squeo\u2019s depression is so aggravated by living in the nursing home that he has tried to kill himself on three occasions. We find these three factors \u2014Squeo\u2019s unremitting physical ailments, his age and his having lived independently of his parents for several years prior to the accident, and his psychological dread of institutional living, culminating in three suicide attempts \u2014 are sufficient to consider this an unusual case calling for unusual relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-7\">Moreover, we find that competent medical testimony exists on this record to hold that the construction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>apartment addition was reasonable and necessary treatment to relieve Squeo of his severe mental depression----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">494 A.2d at 322. After recapitulating the testimony concerning the detrimental effect of Squeo\u2019s continuing to live in the nursing home, the Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-5\">We stress that in determining what is reasonable and necessary, the touchstone is not the injured worker\u2019s desires or what he thinks to be most beneficial. Rather, it is what is shown by sufficient competent evidence to be reasonable and necessary to cure and relieve him. Here, that relief is of a psychological nature. The source of Squeo\u2019s severe mental depression is his fear of institutionalization. The testimony of all witnesses substantiate that this psychological disturbance can be relieved only by Squeo\u2019s living in an independent setting. Thus, we find sufficient credible evidence on the record to establish that construction of the apartment addition is necessary to cure and relieve the mental depression caused by Squeo\u2019s work-related injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">494 A.2d at 322-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">In <em>Peace River Electric Corp., </em>upon which appellants also rely, the claimant was a paraplegic confined to a wheelchair as a result of a compensable accident. \u201cHe ha[d] lost all sensation and control from his waist downward, including control over bowel and bladder functions.\u201d 417 So.2d at 831. Moreover, he was \u201cpresently existing by himself in a dilapidated makeshift dwelling consisting of an ancient trailer and a ramshackle wooden shed that are difficult or impossible to negotiate by wheelchair.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It was under these circumstances that the District Court of Appeals of Florida having cautioned that \u201conly extreme cases of disability might warrant such extraordinary relief,\u201d <em>id., </em>417 So.2d at 832, concluded that \u201c[t]he circumstances of this case are unique and fraught with human misery____\u201d <em>Id., </em>417 So.2d at 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">Appellants characterize appellee\u2019s situation, in comparison with the facts in those two cases, as \u201cfar from being a case \u2018fraught with human misery\u2019 \u201d. In addition, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>maintain that there was no evidence of \u201cmedical necessity\u201d for further home modifications <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">Accepting the premise of these cases and maintaining that the trial court also accepted those premises, as witnessed by the fact that he instructed the jury that modifications could be awarded only \u201cunder extreme or extraordinarily unique situations,\u201d appellee maintains that ample evidence was presented to the jury to support the verdicts. As previously noted, appellee is, and the evidence reflects, a respirator-dependent high level quadriplegic. As such, he is unable to breathe on his own or control his body temperature or his bowel and bladder functions. Moreover, his paralysis is so severe that it extends to the muscles of his eyes, face and neck. Due to his inability to control his body temperature, it is necessary that appellee have a climate controlled environment, that is air conditioned and heated. And, the extent to which he is able to go outside in his wheelchair is extremely limited. Only on a weather-perfect day, <em>i.e,, </em>when the temperature is between 70 and 75 degrees, may he go outside in his wheelchair and, then, only for a distance of about one mile. Since grocery stores, movie theaters or restaurants are at least two miles from his home, they are beyond the range of his wheelchair mobility.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Although appellee lives with his wife, in a two-story dwelling in Dale City, Virginia, his condition confines him to the first level. Evidence presented by appellee tended to prove that his living space consisted realistically, and practically, of but one room, his bedroom. This is so because the hallway spaces are not sufficiently large to accomodate his wheelchair. That being so, he is unable to use the bathroom on the first level; hence, he is bathed and treated and disposes of bladder and bowel waste in his bedroom. There is no way, as the house is presently situated, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>appellee to access the second level of the home.. Indeed, he can be moved into and out of his house, the evidence demonstrated, only with great difficulty. And his return to the home is equally fraught with difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Furthermore, as appellee points out, Dr. Menter, who was accepted, without objection, as an expert in the management and care of respirator-dependent high level quadriplegics, testified, \u201cbased upon a reasonable degree of medical certainty,\u201d that the home in which appellee lived was in need of modifications so as to \u201c[allow] access to the primary living quarters of the family____\u201d He also testified that a modified bathroom was necessary both for appellee\u2019s need and care. This testimony, we believe, was sufficient on the question of the need for the modifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">We discern no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">2, 3</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">The next arguments made by appellants pertain to the expert testimony appellee presented on his need for a modified van. They address the testimony of Dr. Menter and Dr. Harrison in separate arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">We address appellants\u2019 arguments pertaining to Dr. Menter first. On direct examination, Dr. Menter was asked by appellee\u2019s counsel, assuming that appellee was furnished with a modified van for transportation only for visits to doctors and for other medically related purposes, whether he had an opinion, \u201cbased upon reasonable medical certainty, as to whether Tom Judge is in need of a van modified for his uses for other transportation?\u201d Appellants\u2019 objection to that question was overruled and Dr. Menter was allowed to give his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">Recognizing that expert testimony reasonably calculated to assist, rather than confuse, the trier of facts is admissible within the discretion of the court, citing <em>Andrews v. Andrews, </em>242 Md. 143, 218 A.2d 194 (1966); <em>see also Radman v. Harold, </em>279 Md. 167, 173, 367 A.2d 472 (1977), appellants maintain that admission of that testimony was error. They reason, since Dr. Menter, on cross-examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>conceded that the van was not \u201cmedical treatment\u201d, the testimony did not assist the jury. Indeed, they assert that the initial opinion question was itself self-contradictory.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">We see the issue somewhat differently. To the extent that Dr. Menter\u2019s testimony can be viewed as being contradictory, the weight, rather than its admissibility, is affected. Moreover, Dr. Menter explained, in answer to a question by appellants\u2019s counsel, how he used the term \u201cmedical treatment\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-5\">Q. [By appellants\u2019 counsel]: What medical \u2014 you testified that that \u2014 I believe you testified that a van would be appropriate. What medical \u2014 for what medical treatment would a van provide him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-6\">A. \u201cMedical treatment\u201d is a term that is very difficult to relate to all of the complex things that an individual with this type of a problem needs. \u201cMedical treatment\u201d is a term that evolved many years ago, when a \u201cmedical treatment\u201d was something you applied to a wound or something that a nurse does, or this or that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-7\">Over the years, without changing the specific term, it has been expanded broadly to keep up with ongoing technology and innovations in the care of individuals with whatever their disease or medical problem is, and \u201cmedical treatment\u201d has expanded itself into areas that aren\u2019t treatments at all and are not provided by nurses, and I think we have a community of professional givers and vendors and providers, and the receivers are trapped by the use of the same old terminology, which doesn\u2019t adequately relate to the problems that we deal with today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AK0\">The value of Dr. Menter\u2019s testimony must be viewed in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">Appellants also challenge the admissibility of the testimony of Dr. Harrison. Dr. Harrison testified, \u201cbased upon a reasonable degree of [professional] certainty\u201d that appellee had a \u201cpsychological\u201d need for access to other areas of the house and for a van to be used for purposes other than transportation to and from doctors and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>medical visits. Appellants\u2019 objection to that evidence was on the basis \u201cthat \u00a7 37 is for medical treatment and to allow benefits, there must be <em>medical evidence. </em>Dr. Harrison is not a medical doctor.\u201d (Emphasis in original) The trial court admitted the evidence. It stated when doing so: \u201cIf Mr. Canter offers evidence that meets that test [that it be shown to be medically necessary], then I am not sure that it would be appropriate to strike Dr. Harrison\u2019s testimony----\u201d Because, appellants maintain, no medical necessity was shown by medical evidence, the lower court should have stricken Dr. Harrison\u2019s testimony in reference to the request contained in their later objections. It is obvious that the thrust of appellants\u2019 argument is that Dr. Menter\u2019s testimony was not medical in nature. We have determined, however, that it was. Moreover we have determined that it was properly admitted on the very point at issue here. Accordingly, the court did not err in refusing to strike Dr. Harrison\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">4</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Finally, appellants challenge the circuit court\u2019s ruling that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission had jurisdiction over this case. Once again, appellee gets the better of the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">In <em>Thomas v. Washington Gas Light Company, </em>448 U.S. 261, 100 S.Ct. 2647, 65 L.Ed.2d 757 (1980), the Supreme Court faced, for the third time, the issue whether the obligation of a state to give full faith and credit to another state\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation award bars a supplemental award being made by the second state.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> On this occasion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>the Court took a fresh look at the full faith and credit issue. 448 U.S. at 277, 100 S.Ct. at 2658. At issue in <em>Thomas </em>was the propriety of the District of Columbia making a Workers\u2019 Compensation award when the Virginia Commission had already made a disability award to the claimant. The Court\u2019s analysis identified three different state interests affected by the potential conflict between Virginia and the District of Columbia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-4\">Virginia has a valid interest in placing a limit on the potential liability of companies that transact business within its borders. Both jurisdictions have a valid interest in the welfare of the injured employee \u2014 Virginia because the injury occurred within that State, and the District because the injured party was employed and resided there. And finally, Virginia has an interest in having the integrity of its formal determinations of contested issues respected by other sovereigns.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-5\"><em>Id. </em>Weighing those interests, the Court concluded that \u201cthe ultimate issue ... is whether Virginia\u2019s interest in the integrity of its tribunal\u2019s determinations forecloses a second proceeding to obtain a supplemental award in the District of Columbia.\u201d 448 U.S. at 280, 100 S.Ct. at 2660.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Analyzing this ultimate issue, the Court contrasted the \u201cunexceptionable full faith and credit principle that resolutions of factual matters underlying a judgment must be given the same res judicata effect in the forum State as they have in the rendering State\u201d, 448 U.S. at 281, 100 S.Ct. at 2661, with the situation before it, where the same set of facts could support an award of compensation under two statutes, <em>id,., </em>and concluded that, in the latter, \u201cthere is neither inconsistency nor double recovery\u201d. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, while recognizing that \u201cthe factfindings of state administrative tribunals are entitled to the same res judicata effect in the second State as findings by a court,\u201d <em>id., </em>it noted that \u201cconstitutional rules applicable to court judgments are necessarily [inapplicable to workmen\u2019s compensation awards.\u201d 448 U.S. at 282, 100 S.Ct. at 2661. While \u201c[fjull faith and credit must be given to the determination that the Virginia Commission had the authority to make; ... by a parity of reasoning, full faith and credit need not be given to determinations that it had no power to make.\u201d <em>Id., </em>448 U.S. at 282-83, 100 S.Ct. at 2661.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">The Court concluded that Virginia\u2019s separate interest in placing a ceiling on the potential liability of companies transacting business there was not strong enough to prevent other states with overlapping jurisdiction over particular injuries from giving effect to their more generous compensation policies, whether application was made to that State in the first instance or only after an award had been made in Virginia. 448 U.S. at 284-85, 100 S.Ct. at 2662-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Appellants\u2019s jurisdictional argument has two parts. First, focusing upon the Supreme Court\u2019s statement that \u201cthe finding of a state administrative tribunal is entitled to the same <em>res judicata </em>effect in a second state as a finding by a court,\u201d and noting that \u201ca full range of hearings were held in Virginia on these issues, and the decisions were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>appealed by the claimant,\u201d they argue that the Virginia decision is res judicata.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Second, appellants rely upon the Court\u2019s recognition that \u201cit is for each State to formulate its own policy whether to grant supplemental awards according to its perception of its own interests.\u201d 448 U.S. at 285,100 S.Ct. at 2663. From that premise, citing 4 Larson\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 85.60, pp. 16-42, they argue that a second state\u2019s allowance of a supplementary award after the first state has already made an initial award \u201cmay subject the employer and carrier to repeated claims in different jurisdictions, protracting litigation and making it impossible for the employer and carrier to know with assurance when a claim has been fully satisfied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">With respect to the former argument, the Supreme Court, as we have seen, in <em>Thomas, </em>noted critical differences between a court of general jurisdiction and an administrative agency with limited statutory authority; those differences, it pointed out, make patent that constitutional rules applicable to court judgments are inapplicable to worker\u2019s compensation awards. 448 U.S. at 281-82, 100 S.Ct. at 2660-61. In other words, the Court indicated that an administrative agency may make determinations only in areas in which it possesses authority and, \u201c[sjince it was not requested, and had no authority, to pass on petitioner\u2019s rights under District of Columbia law, there can be no constitutional objection to a fresh adjudication of those rights.\u201d 448 U.S. at 283, 100 S.Ct. at 2661-62. In short, since the fact finding of the Virginia Commission is not at issue, res judicata simply does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The Virginia Industrial Commission, finding that a van was not a form of necessary medical treatment or service, determined that it was not within the scope of the Virginia statute; it simply interpreted the Virginia statute rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>than make findings of fact. With respect to the home modifications issue, the Commission\u2019s decision was based upon the fact that the employer had already exceeded the statutory maximum of $10,000.00 and, therefore, was not required to provide further modifications. To the extent that that determination required facts to be found, the facts found were not inconsistent with the findings of the Maryland Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Appellants fare no better with reference to the policy argument. The Court of Appeals, in <em>Wood v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Company, </em>260 Md. 651, 273 A.2d 125 (1971), has already made the policy decision favorable to appellee. In any event, where, as here, the proper result depends upon interpretation of Maryland law, rather than Virginia law, and the Virginia Industrial Commission has interpreted only Virginia law, there is no impediment to this State\u2019s commission and courts acting, even if the result reached in Maryland is different than that reached in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b732-8\">. Before July, 1983, Virginia\u2019s statute did not provide for, and, indeed, had been interpreted by its highest court as excluding, home modifications. <em>See infra. </em>Appellee\u2019s application for additional modifications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>to his home was filed subsequent to the July, 1983 effective date of the amendment to the Virginia Act which added explicit language allowing home modifications.

Believing that, because he had voluntarily withdrawn his first claim, he need only \u201creopen\u201d that claim, appellee\u2019s request of the Maryland Commission was that it do just that \u2014 reopen his claim. The Commission denied that request, dismissing it \"for lack of jurisdiction.....\u201d <em>Judge, </em>68 Md.App. at 59, 509 A.2d 1236, and, on appeal, the circuit court affirmed. We reversed. Analogizing the situation to one in which a lawsuit is voluntarily dismissed by a plaintiff and noting that appellee\u2019s subsequent claim was made within the period of limitations, we reasoned that there was nothing to prevent appellee from filing a new compensation claim. Thus, we held \"that the Commission should have treated [the application to reopen] as the filing of a new claim, just as a court would treat the filing of a lawsuit after voluntary dismissal without prejudice.\u201d 68 Md.App. at 63-64, 509 A.2d 1236.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b734-6\">.

Thus, the Court concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"AKI\">petitioner could have sought a compensation award in the first instance either in Virginia, the State in which the injury occurred ... or in the District of Columbia, where petitioner resided, his employer was principally located, and the employment relation was formed____ And ... compensation could have been sought under either compensation scheme even if one statute or the other purported to confer an exclusive remedy on petitioner. Thus, for all practical purposes, respondent and its insurer would have had to measure their potential liability exposure by the more generous of the two workmen\u2019s compensation schemes in any event. It follows that a State\u2019s interest in limiting the potential liability of businesses within the State is not of controlling importance.</p>\n<p id=\"Ax3\">It is also manifest that the interest in providing adequate compensation to the injured worker would be fully served by the allowance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>successive awards. In this respect the two jurisdictions share a common interest and there is no danger of significant conflict. 448 U.S. at 279-80, 100 S.Ct. at 2660.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b753-6\">.
