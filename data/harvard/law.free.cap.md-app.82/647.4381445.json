Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 727-734D, warrants dismissal of an indictment against that officer. A Prince George\u2019s County grand jury indicted the appellant, George B. Steffey, on six counts, including misconduct in office. Appellant moved to dismiss the indictments. At a pre-trial motions hearing, Judge Robert J. Woods denied appellant\u2019s motion. Appellant then was tried before a jury, which found him guilty on the misconduct count. He appeals from that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Appellant was an officer with the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department working the night shift at the time of the subject incident in September 1988. The following statement of facts is based upon his unrefuted testimony concerning the incident. On the night before the incident, while assisting another officer in a routine arrest following a traffic stop, appellant found a BB handgun in the arrestee\u2019s car. He placed the gun in the back of his police cruiser so he could inventory the gun when he returned to the station at the end of his shift. Appellant did not perform the inventory, however, because he did not see the officer he had assisted in the arrest and therefore could not get the case number from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">While working a second job as a security guard later that day (following the night shift), appellant purchased a C02 cartridge and a package of BBs from a hardware store at Eastover Shopping Center where he worked. At one point, he went behind the shopping center and fired the BB gun several times, discovering that it only fired about every fourth time because of a malfunctioning spring.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">That night, appellant and Corporal Clarence Voundy were specially assigned to patrol certain open-air \u201cdrug markets.\u201d On the way to one of the drug areas in two separate cruisers, the officers stopped behind an elementary school to allow appellant to put on his blue jumpsuit uniform over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>his standard uniform. While appellant was putting his uniform on, Voundy noticed the BB gun in the back of appellant\u2019s car. After asking appellant if he could see the gun, Voundy took it out and began shooting at nearby signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Appellant and Voundy then proceeded to the assigned drug area. As they exited their vehicles, Voundy again asked appellant for the BB gun. Appellant handed the gun and the remaining pellets to Voundy, who outranked appellant. The officers took a concealed route toward the drug market, hoping to surprise the alleged dealers who were standing around possibly engaging in drug transactions. Before appellant and Voundy \u201ccould implement their plan of attack,\u201d someone else fired a gunshot and the crowd dispersed.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Moments later, the officers came upon three individuals whom they believed had run from the drug area. Appellant and Voundy identified themselves as police officers and told the three suspects to lie on the ground. Appellant took control of two of the suspects, Calvin Proctor and another, unidentified man. Voundy handled the third suspect, Rodney L. Simms. Appellant had conducted a search of his two suspects and was beginning to question Proctor about drugs he had found on the ground near Proctor when he heard Simms yell, \u201cOuch! Ouch! That hurt.\u201d Appellant then looked over and saw Voundy standing over Simms, pointing the BB gun at him. Appellant noticed blood running down the side of Simms\u2019s face. Appellant testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-7\">I didn\u2019t know what to do. I took and told Mr. Proctor to get on the ground. Clarence started hollering. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing coming out of the damn gun.\u201d He was taking the gun and he was doing this (indicating) with his hand with the gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-8\">I walked over to Clarence and I placed my left hand on Corporal Voundy\u2019s left shoulder and I said, \u201cWhat did you do that for?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>Corporal Voundy started laughing and said, \u201cSteffey, they\u2019re drug dealers. They\u2019re never going to say nothing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Within hours after the incident, Simms filed a complaint with the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department, alleging the use of unnecessary and excessive force in effecting an arrest. According to Simms\u2019s version of the incident, he and Proctor were on their way to pick up a friend when they were stopped by two officers, one black and one white. (Voundy is black; appellant is white.) When Simms denied having any drugs, the black officer took out a gun and began firing at the back of his head. Simms felt only air coming out of the gun until the black officer yelled, \u201cIt\u2019s nuthin\u2019 in this damn gun. It\u2019s nuthin\u2019 in this damn gun.\u201d The white officer then went over to the black officer and Simms heard what sounded like a pinging sound against metal. Moments later, the black officer fired two more times at the back of Simms\u2019s head, striking him with BBs both times. The black officer then lifted up Simms\u2019s jacket and shirt and shot him in the back six times. After the attack, Simms and Proctor were ordered to run away from the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">At the trial Simms admitted that he never saw the white officer pass any BE pellets to the black officer. He alleged, however, that he had heard the white officer say to the black officer, \u201cI have something for you to put in this gun.\u201d Simms admitted during cross-examination that his written statement to the police on the night of the incident made no mention of the white officer saying anything to the black officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Appellant was called into the police department\u2019s Internal Affairs Section (IAS) a few hours after the incident. Pursuant to the LEOBOR, Lieutenant Phillip Constantino informed appellant (1) that he was under investigation in connection with the incident, (2) that he was being ordered to write a \u201cduress statement\u201d concerning the incident, and (3) that he had the right to postpone making the duress statement for ten days in order to obtain an attorney. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Appellant exercised his right to wait until he found an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">That night appellant was again called into IAS. During this period, appellant was not free to leave the police station. Constantino served appellant with a document notifying him of the administrative charges against him. According to Constantino\u2019s testimony at the motions hearing, while he was serving appellant with the document, appellant said, \u201cThat is not me. I was there. I didn\u2019t do this.\u201d Constantino testified that he then advised appellant that he should have an attorney present. Because Constantino felt \u201cuncomfortable\u201d listening to what he termed appellant's \u201cutterances,\u201d he called his commanding officer, Captain McDonald, into the room. According to Constantino, McDonald then asked appellant where he got the BBs. The trial judge and Constantino then held the following discussion:</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">THE COURT: So, who asked that question?</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">THE WITNESS: The Captain did, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">THE COURT: He asked him . that question?</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">THE WITNESS: And then it was realized that we were probably wrong in asking that and everything stopped. He was told he should have his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">THE COURT: Did he answer the question?</p>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-12\">THE COURT: And what did he say?</p>\n<p id=\"b680-13\">THE WITNESS: He got it on Nova Avenue from a drug arrest made by Officer Qualls, that the drug [sic] had been in the vehicle that\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b680-14\">THE COURT: What else did he say as a response to that as to the BB\u2019s and\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b680-15\">THE WITNESS: Again, that was the second time. He had already told me about where he had gotten the BB\u2019s, and he reiterated that statement in front of Captain McDonald.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-16\">THE COURT: And what did he say to Captain McDonald?<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>THE WITNESS: That he was there, he got the BB\u2019s and the C02 at Eastover Shopping Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">THE COURT: Did he tell you that he had gotten the BB\u2019s at Eastover Shopping Center, or did he just tell you \u2014 I\u2019m looking now at page 13 of the Grand Jury testimony\u2014 that he had bought the BB\u2019s, you had said to the Grand Jury that he said, yeah, I was there and I bought the BB\u2019s?</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">THE WITNESS: That was originally what he had said to me. The second time the word \u201cEastover Shopping Center\u201d did come out.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">MS. GWINN [for the State]: I\u2019m not sure what he\u2019s referring to as the second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">THE WITNESS: When he reiterated to Captain McDonald\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">THE COURT: That\u2019s when he said they were bought at Eastover.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">Appellant eventually submitted a written duress statement, apparently after he had made the \u201cutterances\u201d to Constantino.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">Appellant and Voundy were indicted by a Prince George\u2019s County grand jury and charged in a six-count indictment with two counts of assault, one count of assault and battery, false imprisonment, carrying a dangerous weapon openly with the intent to injure, and misconduct in office. The court severed the cases for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">Appellant was tried before a jury, with Judge Woods presiding. The jury found him not guilty of the first five counts but guilty of the sixth count, misconduct in office. Judge Woods sentenced appellant to 30 days\u2019 incarceration. Appellant filed a timely appeal and presents to this court three arguments which we shall set forth in order.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-12\">I. The Court erred by not granting Steffey\u2019s Motion to Dismiss the Indictment based on the ground that the State violated his right, created by statute in the Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights, that compelled testimony not be used in a criminal proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AU1\">Maryland Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 728(b)(7)(h), part of the LEOBOR, provides in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-6\">The results of any ... interrogation, as may be required by the law enforcement agency under this subparagraph are not admissible or discoverable in any criminal proceedings against the law enforcement officer when the law enforcement officer has been ordered to submit thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">While testifying before the grand jury, Lieutenant Constantino discussed what occurred immediately after he served the administrative charges on appellant. According to Constantino,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-8\">[Appellant] became distraught, and he looked at me, said, \u201cWhy are you doing this? Are you doing this because I didn\u2019t make a statement?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-9\">At that time I told him, \u201cNo. Because the evidence is there, and you didn\u2019t notify your sergeant of the incident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-10\">That\u2019s when he stated to me, <em>\u201cI </em>didn\u2019t do this. This is not me.\u201d He said, \u201cYeah, I was there, and I bought the BBs.\u201d He said, \u201cI bought the C02, but I did not do the shooting.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-11\">It was then I told him, \u201cYou have already asked for an attorney. You are violating your own rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-12\">Feeling uncomfortable myself that he was now this distraught and making these statements, I went and asked Captain McDonald, who is my immediate supervisor, to come into the room. That\u2019s when he also made utterance that, yes, he had gotten the BB gun from another officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-13\">Okay. Again I told him, \u201cYou have to make none of these statements. You have already asked for an attorney.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-14\">When asked by a grand juror whether appellant had admitted to buying the pellets and C02, Constantino replied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>\u201cThat\u2019s right. At that time he had said that he had bought the BBs and C02 at Eastover....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Appellant filed a number of pre-trial motions, including a motion to suppress and a motion to dismiss the indictment. During the motions hearing before Judge Woods, appellant moved to supplement his motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that Lieutenant Constantino revealed some of appellant\u2019s compelled statements to the grand jury and that this revelation violated appellant\u2019s statutory rights under \u00a7 728(b)(7)(ii). Defense counsel argued (1) that Constantino could only have known where appellant bought the BBs and C02 from the written duress statement, and (2) that all of the statements appellant made to Constantino were made under duress. Appellant\u2019s attorney admitted, however, that appellant also had made statements about the incident to officers other than Lieutenant Constantino.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Judge Woods denied appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment, saying,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">[Cjlearly the lieutenant did add the words \u201cat Eastover\u201d, and Officer Steffey was under duress when those words were added to the Grand Jury and he was under duress when the entire proceedings started in the police station.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-8\">I\u2019m not going to dismiss the indictment, and the reason I\u2019m not going to do it is ... the Court finds that Officer Steffey not only to Lieutenant Constantino, but with other officers had the habit \u2014 habit because he was distraught because of what was occurring and apparently wanted to explain himself, made a lot of gratuitous statements. In fact, they got so gratuitous in this case that the lieutenant became uneasy and went out to get Captain McDonald.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-9\">Captain McDonald came back and asked a question that should not have been asked, and as to that statement and as to anything else that was said as a result of that, of course, I would suppress it, but I will not dismiss the indictment. I do not think it reaches that stage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>We note first that, according to Lieutenant Constantino\u2019s unrefuted testimony at the motions hearing, appellant told him without being prompted that he was there when Corporal Voundy shot Simms with the BB gun, and that he had bought the BBs (and, presumably the C02 cartridge).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These admissions clearly were \u201cblurts,\u201d <em>see Ciriago v. State, </em>57 Md.App. 563, 573-76, 471 A.2d 320, <em>cert. denied, </em>300 Md. 152, 476 A.2d 721 (1984), rather than compelled testimony. Thus, their admission before the grand jury did not constitute a violation of \u00a7 728(b)(7)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The only portion of Lieutenant Constantino\u2019s grand jury testimony, therefore, that conceivably could have violated \u00a7 728(b)(7)(h) was his statement that appellant admitted to buying the BBs and C02 \u201cat Eastover.\u201d Constantino testified at the motions hearing that he had never seen the written duress statement, and appellant offered no evidence to the contrary. Thus, appellant\u2019s argument that the lieutenant obtained the information about Eastover from the written statement was without merit. As the State admits on appeal, however, appellant only mentioned where he bought the BBs and C02 in response to Captain McDonald\u2019s ill-advised, one-question interrogation. The admission about Eastover Shopping Center, therefore, did constitute compelled testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Appellant acknowledges that \u201can indictment valid on its face is not subject to challenge on the ground that the grand jury acted on the basis of inadequate or incompetent evidence, or even on the basis of information obtained in violation of a defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d <em>United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 344-45, 94 S.Ct. 613, 618, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974) (citations omitted). <em>See also Lawn v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 339, 348-49, 78 S.Ct. 311, 317-18, 2 L.Ed.2d 321, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>355 U.S. 967, 78 S.Ct. 529, 2 L.Ed.2d 532 (1958) (petitioners, whose indictments by one grand jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>were dismissed because petitioners testified and were not warned of Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, could not challenge indictments by a later grand jury on grounds that second grand jury might have considered self-incriminating evidence that petitioners revealed to first grand jury); <em>Costello v. United States, </em>350 U.S. 359, 363, 76 S.Ct. 406, 408-09, 100 L.Ed. 397, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>351 U.S. 904, 76 S.Ct. 692, 100 L.Ed. 1440 (1956) (indictment will not be dismissed even if only evidence presented to grand jury was hearsay evidence); <em>Holt v. United States, </em>218 U.S. 245, 247-48, 31 S.Ct. 2, 4, 54 L.Ed. 1021 (1910) (\u201cThe abuses of criminal practice would be enhanced if indictments could be upset\u201d on the ground that the grand jury based its indictments on incompetent evidence.). Appellant cites a Tenth Circuit case, <em>United States v. Beery, </em>678 F.2d 856 (10th Cir.1982), however, for the proposition that the <em>Calandra </em>analysis does not preclude dismissal of an indictment where the prosecutor\u2019s presentation of evidence before the grand jury violated a separate statutorily created privilege of the defendant, such as the \u00a7 728(b)(7)(h) privilege against the admission of compelled statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Appellant\u2019s analysis of <em>Beery </em>is a correct one. We disagree, however, with the <em>Beery </em>court\u2019s interpretation of <em>Calandra. </em>Because the holding in <em>Beery </em>rests on that interpretation, we decline to follow the Tenth Circuit\u2019s decision. We explain. Immediately after paraphrasing the above quote from <em>Calandra, </em>the <em>Beery </em>court wrote,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">The Supreme Court, however, has recognized that there may be a different result where what was transpiring before the grand jury would itself violate a constitutional or statutory privilege. <em>See United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U.S. at 346, 94 S.Ct. at 619.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-6\"><em>Beery, </em>678 F.2d at 860 (citation in original). The portion of <em>Calandra </em>that <em>Beery </em>cites, however, pertains only to the actions of grand juries themselves. The Supreme Court stated, for example, that: the grand jury \u201cmay consider incompetent evidence, but it may not itself violate a valid privilege, whether established by the Constitution, statutes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>or the common law\u201d; \u201cthe grand jury may not force a witness to answer questions in violation of [the Fifth Amendment]\u201d; \u201ca grand jury may not compel a person to produce books and papers that would incriminate him\u201d; and \u201c[t]he grand jury is also without power to invade a legitimate privacy interest protected by the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Calandra, </em>414 U.S. at 346, 94 S.Ct. at 619. The <em>Beery </em>court incorrectly applied this discussion as support for its holding that an indictment must be dismissed if a defendant\u2019s testimony that has been immunized by statute <em>is used </em>during grand jury proceedings, unless the error is held harmless, beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Beery, </em>678 F.2d at 860. <em>Calandra </em>did not hold that courts must dismiss indictments based upon the evidence <em>presented </em>to grand juries and thus <em>used </em>during grand jury proceedings. Rather, <em>Calandra </em>simply pointed out which actions by grand juries themselves would not be tolerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">In <em>Gelbard v. United States, </em>408 U.S. 41, 60, 92 S.Ct. 2357, 2367, 33 L.Ed.2d 179 (1972), the Supreme Court stated that \u201ca defendant is not entitled to have his indictment dismissed before trial simply because the Government \u2018acquire[d] incriminating evidence in violation of the [law],\u2019 even if the \u2018tainted evidence was presented to the grand jury.\u2019 \u201d Quoting <em>Gelbard </em>in <em>Hopkins v. State, </em>19 Md.App. 414, 426, 311 A.2d 483 (1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>271 Md. 738 (1974), we added,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">The grand jury is an inquisitional and accusatory body. It does not determine the guilt or innocence of the accused as that decision is vested in the petit jury or court, if there be a non-jury trial. That an indictment is founded on tainted evidence is no grounds for dismissal____ The rules of evidence are not applicable to grand jury proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-8\"><em>See also United States v. Lawson, </em>502 F.Supp. 158, 168 (D.Md.1980) (\u201c[T]he grand jury is permitted to consider any evidence bearing upon a defendant\u2019s factual guilt, regardless of whether it would be excluded at trial to protect a constitutional right or to deter government misconduct.\u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number><em>In re: A Special Investigation No. 228, </em>54 Md.App. 149, 183, 458 A.2d 820, <em>cert. denied, </em>296 Md. 414 (1983) (\u201cEven to vindicate the loftiest of constitutional ideals, we do not suppress evidence at the grand jury level.\u201d); <em>Bartram v. State, </em>33 Md.App. 115, 182, 364 A.2d 1119 (1976), <em>aff'd, </em>280 Md. 616, 374 A.2d 1144 (1977) (\u201c[I]t is not within the power of this Court, or of courts generally, to interfere with the decision-making process of the grand jury or to inquire into the sources of, or sufficiency of, the knowledge upon which they base their decisions.\u201d); 1 J.

Tillers rev. 1983) (\u201cFederal constitutional law ... does not make an indictment void or mandate its dismissal merely because the indictment rests in part on evidence presented to the grand jury in violation of a constitutional privilege.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Based upon these authorities, we hold that appellant was not entitled to a dismissal of his indictment, even though a portion of Lieutenant Constantino\u2019s statement to the grand jury, concerning where appellant bought the BBs and the C02, was tainted evidence. Finally, an exhaustive search of the legislative history of \u00a7 728(b)(7)(h) revealed nothing to indicate that a court must dismiss an indictment against a police officer simply because the grand jury heard testimony based on statements the officer was compelled to make under the LEOBOR.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">II. The Court erred by refusing to instruct the jury properly on Count Six where the jury was instructed as to malfeasance, misfeasance and nonfeasance as the alleged misconduct in office where the count only alleged malfeasance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">While instructing the petit jury concerning Count Six, misconduct in office, Judge Woods said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-8\">Misconduct in office takes one of three forms, malfeasance, misfeasance and nonfeasance. Malfeasance, misfeasance and nonfeasance. Although the three terms are sometimes used interchangeably, they do not mean the same thing. The name by which the crime is called does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>not control, but the facts alleged do control. The facts alleged and the facts proven.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\">Malfeasance means this. Malfeasance means that a person in office has performed an act that he ought not to have performed. The root of the offense is the corrupt nature of the act and not the motive of the officeholder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">Misfeasance is the performing of a lawful act in an unlawful manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">And nonfeasance is the failure by the public officer or official to do what he ought to have done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">Defense counsel then excepted to a number of Judge Woods\u2019s instructions. Regarding the misconduct instructions, the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">MR. BRENNAN: The other thing, in this misconduct charge, Your Honor, there\u2019s also a to wit, and it says \u2014 basically it\u2019s the last paragraph on that page, Your Honor. And again, it doesn\u2019t say anything about not reporting it. It basically focuses in on the assault and battery of Mr. Simms and Mr. Proctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">THE COURT: ____ So, you want me to say that because you don\u2019t want to get into the fact that he didn\u2019t tell about Voundy?</p>\n<p id=\"b688-12\">MR. BRENNAN: Right, since the indictment says \u2014 more particularly and specifically says what it is as to the alleged misconduct, I think the jury should be instructed on that.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-13\">THE COURT: .... Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-14\">MR. BRENNAN: And there\u2019s the other thing. I think I did say this before. I don\u2019t like the jury picking between nonfeasance, misfeasance and malfeasance.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-15\">THE COURT: All right.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-16\">MR. BRENNAN: I think the State should be more specifically and the State should elect which one they\u2019re going under.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-17\">THE COURT: All right.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>The judge then gave additional instructions, including the following amended instruction concerning the misconduct charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-5\">Going back and looking at the last charge, which is misconduct in office, when George Bennett Steffey was charged, let me read you the charge, which I think will clear up any misunderstanding as to what misconduct the State must prove.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">That George Bennett Steffey, Jr., well and knowing the premises, in wilful disregard of his oath, corruption to his public office and in violation of the lawful conduct of his duty, more particularly while acting under the color of his office, and this is what they said he did that constitutes misconduct, did forcibly and illegally apprehend and detain Rodney Lamont Simms and Calvin Proctor and did then make an assault and did beat, batter and wound and ill-treat said Rodney Lamont Simms and Calvin Proctor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-7\">That is what the misconduct in office applies to, the illegal \u2014 what they allege and must prove is the illegal apprehension and the beating, battering and wounding or ill-treating Rodney Simms and Lamont \u2014 and Calvin Proctor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Defense counsel did not object to the amended instructions. He said, \u201cWith the exception of the other matters we discussed at the bench [which did not involve the misconduct charge], we are satisfied, Your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">Appellant appears to contend on appeal that defense counsel did object to the amended instruction when he argued (before the amended instruction was given) that the State should elect whether the jury was being asked to find malfeasance, misfeasance or nonfeasance. As we noted above, defense counsel said at that time, \u201cI don\u2019t like the jury picking between nonfeasance, misfeasance and malfeasance ____ I think the State ... should elect which one they\u2019re going under.\u201d Such statements clearly do not qualify as an objection to the trial judge\u2019s amended instruction that followed. Because defense counsel did not object to the amended instruction, we will review the instruction only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>to determine if it involved plain error. Md.Rule 4-325(e). We perceive no error at all since the State was obviously relying on the facts constituting malfeasance as alleged in the indictment, and quoted by Judge Woods, to establish misconduct.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-5\">III. The Court erred by not granting Steffey\u2019s Motion for a New Trial based on the ground that since Stef fey was found not guilty of all the predicate acts (Counts One to Five) alleged in Count Six the verdict could not stand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Appellant acknowledges that inconsistent jury verdicts generally are not sufficient grounds for reversing a jury\u2019s verdict or granting a new trial. <em>See, e.g., Mack v. State, </em>300 Md. 583, 594, 479 A.2d 1344 (1984); <em>Ford v. State, </em>274 Md. 546, 552-53, 337 A.2d 81 (1975). He contends, however, that this rule does not apply to his case because \u201cCount Six of the indictment does not merely stand alone as a separate legal theory for the same alleged criminal activity, but rather Count Six contains <em>within itself </em>certain specified predicate acts which constitute the crime.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Even though the misconduct alleged in Count Six does appear to consist only of criminal acts of which the jury found appellant not guilty, we cannot reverse appellant\u2019s conviction. As the Court of Appeals stated in <em>Mack, supra, </em>\u201cThat the verdict may have been the result of compromise, or of a mistake on the part of the jury, is possible. But verdicts cannot be upset by speculation or inquiry into such matters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594, 479 A.2d 1344 (quoting Justice Holmes in <em>Dunn v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 390, 394, 52 S.Ct. 189, 191, 76 L.Ed. 356 (1932)).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-7\">. The parties appear to agree that the BBs and the C02 were purchased at the same time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
