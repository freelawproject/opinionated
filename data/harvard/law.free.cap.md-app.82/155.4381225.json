Beasley, filed an appeal to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The employer moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that it was untimely. The court rejected that defense and, in disposition of the appeal, remanded the case to the Commission. Aggrieved by both the holding that the appeal was timely and the remand to the Commission, the employer has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">The underlying facts are essentially undisputed. The claimant sustained an accidental injury on October 7, 1980, while in the course of her employment with appellant. She claimed to have injured her head, neck, back, and shoulder. Benefits for temporary total disability were paid for the period October 11, 1980-February 15, 1981. By order dated July 24, 1981, the Commission found that she had a permanent partial disability amounting to 5% industrial loss of use of the body by reason of an injury to her neck and a permanent partial disability amounting to 15% industrial loss of use of the body by reason of an injury to her low back. Of that latter disability, 5% was attributed to the accident and 10% to a preexisting condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>On September 2, 1983, following a hearing on the claimant\u2019s petition to reopen the case, the Commission found that Ms. Beasley had suffered another period of temporary total disability from April 21 to May 22, 1983 and that her permanent partial disability had increased to 772% with respect to the neck and to 1772% with respect to the back. As before, 10% of the body loss arising from the back injury was attributed to a preexisting condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">On October 27, 1987, the claimant filed another petition to reopen the case, alleging that, since the last award, her injuries \u201chave become worse requiring her to seek additional medical treatment and she is now temporarily totally disabled. In addition, her permanent partial disability has increased.\u201d On September 7, 1988, the Commission certified three specific issues to be considered: temporary total disability from October 1 to 15, 1987; nature and extent of permanent partial disability to the neck and back; and certain medical expenses allegedly incurred by the claimant. A hearing on those issues was held on October 27, 1988. Three days later, the Commission, through Commissioner L. Douglas Jefferson, issued the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-5\">\u201cHearing was held in the above claim at Baltimore, Maryland on October 27, 1988, on the claimant\u2019s Petition to Reopen for worsening of condition; and it is this 31st day of October, 1988, by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission ORDERED that the Petition to Reopen is hereby denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">On November 2, 1988, claimant\u2019s counsel wrote to Commissioner Jefferson complaining about the lack of any findings. He noted that at the hearing the Commissioner indicated that he was \u201cin all probability going to make a finding that any worsening of the claimant\u2019s condition was not causally related to her accidental injury of October 7, 1980,\u201d but that the order \u201csimply denies the claimant\u2019s petition to re-open.\u201d The letter concluded: \u201cIf in fact your finding is that the worsening of the claimant\u2019s condition is not causally related to her October 7, 1980 accidental injury, it is requested that you amend your decision to reflect this.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>On November 18, Commissioner Jefferson acknowledged claimant\u2019s request and the employer\u2019s opposition to it and informed the parties that \u201c[t]he Commission has decided to set the matter for hearing,\u201d notice of which \u201cwill be forthcoming.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">On March 31, 1989, a hearing was held before Commissioner Jefferson. The claimant\u2019s attorney again pointed out that the order contained no findings, whereupon Commissioner Jefferson announced that he was under no obligation to give any reasons for a decision on a motion to reopen. He opined: \u201cI don\u2019t think we have to render an opinion or tell you why we\u2019re making that decision, and when the court reviews it, if there\u2019s any evidence in the record to support the decision, the court is supposed to uphold us.\u201d When asked whether it was necessary for him to make a finding in order to reach a decision, the Commissioner acknowledged that it was but that \u201cI don\u2019t have to share that finding of fact with anyone.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This, he said, was true even though the Commission, in addressing a petition to reopen a case, often considers the merits of the case in conjunction with the threshold question of whether to reopen:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">\u201c[T]his is a Petition to Reopen, this is not a hearing on the merit[s], even though many times we merge the two. You file a Petition to Reopen, we come in, and we hear the case on the merit[s]. That\u2019s what we do; <em>we don\u2019t hear the case on whether or not you should be allowed to reopen it. We do both at one time; we do your Petition to Reopen and we do the case on the merit[s]. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>And I\u2019m saying, even though I heard them both, that doesn\u2019t mean that you reached the second prong of what you were doing, because I didn\u2019t grant the Petition to Reopen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">After some further discussion along these lines, counsel asked the Commissioner at least to review again the medical reports in the file, which the Commissioner agreed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">On April 18, 1989, Commissioner Jefferson issued the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">\u201cHearing was scheduled in the above claim at Baltimore, Maryland, on March 31, 1989 <em>on the claimant\u2019s Motion for Rehearing.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">At said hearing, no testimony was taken, argument was heard; and the Commission, <em>having granted the claimant\u2019s Motion for Rehearing, </em>will affirm its Order dated October 31, 1988.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">On April 24, 1989, the claimant filed her appeal to the circuit court from the decision of the Commission \u201cdated April 17, 1989, affirming its previous Order of October 31, 1988, denying the Claimant\u2019s Petition to Re-Open.\u201d In the petition accompanying the order of appeal, the claimant alleged that, in denying the petition to reopen, the Commission misconstrued applicable law and facts and that its decision was contrary to the evidence and erroneous in its application of the law to the facts. The employer\u2019s motion to dismiss was based on the assertions that (1) no appeal lies from the denial of a motion to reopen, and (2) if such an appeal did lie, it would have to have been filed within 30 days after the October 31 denial of the petition to reopen. As noted, the court denied the motion to dismiss, \u201cbeing of the opinion that the denial of the Claimant\u2019s Petition to Reopen was a denial of a Petition filed under Article 101 Section 40b and is appealable.\u201d On the merits, the court remanded the case to the Commission for the \u201cissuance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>findings of fact or law relative to each issue raised by the Claimant in her Petition to Reopen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">In this appeal to us, the employer presses its argument that the claimant\u2019s appeal was filed too late and should therefore have been dismissed. It also urges that the appeal to the circuit court sought relief not requested in the Petition to Reopen, and that the court erred in remanding for a decision on an issue never raised before the agency. Finding no reversible error, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The procedural aspects of appeals from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission are governed by Ch. 1100, Subt. B of the Maryland Rules. Rule B la. provides that the Subtitle B Rules apply to the review of any \u201cfinal action\u201d of an administrative agency. This is in accord with the general rule that \u201can action for judicial review of an administrative order will lie only if the administrative order is final.\u201d <em>Holiday Spas v. Montgomery County, </em>315 Md. 390, 395, 554 A.2d 1197 (1989). To be \u201cfinal\u201d for purposes of judicial review, the order must \u201cleave nothing further for the agency to do.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396, 554 A.2d 1197, quoting <em>Md. Comm\u2019n on Human Rel. v. B.G. &amp; E. Co., </em>296 Md. 46, 56, 459 A.2d 205 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">We have no doubt that the October 31 order denying the petition to reopen, when issued, was final and could have been appealed. But because the order assigned no reasons for rejecting the petition, it would have been very difficult for the claimant to present an appeal on the merits. Although an appeal from a Commission order is often regarded as involving a <em>de novo </em>trial <em>(cf. General Motors Corp. v. Bark, </em>79 Md.App. 68, 555 A.2d 542 (1989)), the actual issues to be reviewed by the court are whether the Commission justly considered all the facts concerning the injury, whether it exceeded its statutory powers, and whether it misconstrued the facts and law applicable to the case. Md.Ann. Code art. 101, \u00a7 56(a). Those questions obviously cannot be reviewed in a vacuum. A request that the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>amend its order by stating the basis for its decision was therefore entirely appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Notwithstanding the practical difficulty in framing an appeal on the merits from an order assigning no reasons for the decision, the mere filing of a request for clarification does not ordinarily stay the time for filing an appeal. If the order sought to be amended is indeed final, the time prescribed by Md. Rule B 4 would run from the time it is issued and sent to the parties. Thus, had the Commission either denied the request for clarification or done nothing with respect to it, the claimant would have had 30 days from October 31 to file her appeal. The appeal would have been a somewhat difficult one, no doubt, perhaps limited to challenging the Commission\u2019s failure to give reasons, but, subject to any extensions granted by the court pursuant to Md. Rule B 4 b., it would have to have been filed as we indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Here, of course, the Commission neither summarily denied the request nor sat idle. In effect, it divided the request into two parts \u2014 one being a request that it consider making some amendment to the October 31 order and the other being a request that it actually amend the order in a particular way. The Commission had the statutory authority to do that. Art. 101, \u00a7 40(c) provides that the jurisdiction of the Commission over a case is continuing and that the Commission may, from time to time, \u201cmake such modifications or changes with respect thereto as in its opinion may be justified.\u201d The order entered on November 18, setting the request in for a hearing, effectively granted the first part of the request; the Commission agreed to consider the request for modification. When it did so, pursuant to its statutory power, the order of October 31 lost its finality. The question of reopening the case was back before the Commission for further review, and it would have been fruitless to pursue an appeal at that point, for the claimant could not then tell what the final resolution of the matter would be. As we indicated, the Commissioner agreed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>review again the medical reports and it was entirely possible that a different decision on the merits might have been forthcoming. The final decision did not come until April 17, 1989, when the relief sought by the request for clarification was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">Even if we were to regard the October 81 order as being the Commission\u2019s final decision, under the circumstances of this case the appeal would still have been timely. Art. 101, \u00a7 56(e) allows a party, within 15 days after the Commission\u2019s decision, to file a motion for rehearing on the ground of newly discovered evidence or that the Commission committed an error of law. If a motion for rehearing is filed, the time for appeal does not commence until the motion is ruled upon. It is evident, of course, that the claimant\u2019s request for modification alleged neither error of law nor newly discovered evidence, and thus could not properly have been regarded as a motion for rehearing. But that is precisely how the Commission treated the request, and, having treated it that way \u2014 even if wrongly \u2014 it must be regarded for purposes of \u00a7 56 as a motion for rehearing. Accordingly, under this theory as well, the time for appeal did not begin to run until April 17. The motion to dismiss the appeal in circuit court was therefore properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Appellant\u2019s second complaint in this appeal is that the appeal to the circuit court should have been dismissed because the claimant was asking for relief that had not been considered by the Commission. In her petition filed in the circuit court, the claimant alleged that she had sustained an increase in permanent disability rendering her permanently <em>totally </em>disabled. That issue \u2014 of permanent total disability \u2014 had not been presented in her petition to reopen the case. It would, therefore, have been appropriate for the court to decline to address that issue, as it had not been raised before or decided by the Commission. But that was not the sole basis of the appeal, which rested principally on the Commission\u2019s refusal to reopen the case for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>purpose of finding additional temporary total disability and requiring the employer to pay certain medical expenses. That one issue was not proper does not require that the entire appeal be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">We have already commented to some extent on the extraordinary notion expressed by Commissioner Jefferson that the Commission is free to make factual findings and legal conclusions and not disclose them to anyone. That is simply not the law. For those agencies subject to the Administrative Procedure Act, the requirement that the agency make and disclose specific findings of fact and conclusions of law is statutory. <em>See </em>Md. State Gov\u2019t Code Ann., \u00a7 10-214. But even agencies, such as the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, that are not under that Act are subject to that requirement. In <em>Blue Bird Cab v. Dep\u2019t Emp. Sec., </em>251 Md. 458, 466, 248 A.2d 331 (1968), the Court held that \u201ca fundamental requirement of due process of law in a quasi-judicial proceeding is the right of the parties to be apprised of the facts relied upon by the tribunal in its decision.\u201d <em>See also Baker v. Board of Trustees, </em>269 Md. 740, 747, 309 A.2d 768 (1973); <em>Turner v. Hammond, </em>270 Md. 41, 55-56, 310 A.2d 543 (1973); <em>Ocean Hideaway Condo. v. Boardwalk Plaza, </em>68 Md.App. 650, 656, 515 A.2d 485 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">It is not necessary for the Commission to write lengthy opinions, and indeed that is not what the claimant sought in this case. It is necessary only that, when deciding a claim or otherwise ruling upon substantive issues, the Commission state the basis for its decision or ruling. In this case, it would have sufficed (if it were the case) had the Commissioner simply stated a finding that there was no worsening of the claimant\u2019s condition or that any such worsening was not causally related to the accident. That, at least, would have informed her of why her petition to reopen was denied and given her a reasonable basis for deciding whether to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>appeal. Because he failed in this obligation, the court acted properly in remanding the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b187-6\">. Commissioner Jefferson based this notion on the Commission\u2019s caseload. In a later remark, he said: \"I\u2019m going to tell you what the reason is. It\u2019s a very simple one. You know, we set, generally, 15 to 25 eases a day. The courts probably set maybe three to four. They may hear one, two a week, if they go to jury trial. Okay. So they have a lot more time to fool around with opinions, facts. Okay. We fool around with them but we don\u2019t have the time to write them down. <em>If I had to render a finding of fact in every case that I heard, this Commission would stop. </em>It would not work. And this is why we render decisions and not opinion.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
