Colt, Henry W. Paine and William A. Richardson, Esquires, were appointed as such commissioners and, after hearing the parties, they made a report, of which the material portions were as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-11\">\u201c It was claimed in the outset by the Metropolitan Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>that the Quincy, under the provisions of its charter, had no right to enter upon the track of the Metropolitan, and pass over it with its cars, horses, drivers and conductors, and that by its charter the cars only of the Quincy were permitted to enter upon and pass over its road. We are of opinion that, upon a true construction of the charters, and under the petitions and proceedings in this case, the claim of the Metropolitan is not well founded; and this award is accordingly based on the assumption that there is no legal objection in allowing the Quincy to enter upon and pass over the Metropolitan track with cars, horses, drivers and conductors. We submit this question to the court for revision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-4\">\u201c The Quincy Corporation is the owner of a road extending from a point on the Metropolitan line, known as Field\u2019s Corner, to the town of Quincy, a distance of five and sixty-nine one-hundredths miles. It was chartered and constructed after the line from Field\u2019s Corner to State Street, Boston, a distance of four and twenty one-hundredths miles, was chartered and built. Thus located, a continuous line of road from Quincy to Boston is established. The charter of the Quincy was granted, as it seems to us, to enable it to transport passengers from points on its own line to Boston as its principal business; but such is the nature of the business of street railroads, that the convenience of the public requires that the cars of the Quincy, in their transit over the Metropolitan, should take up those designing to pass only between points on that line; and we think that the Quincy should take up and receive toll from such passengers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-6\">\u201c The grant of the franchise to the Metropolitan to locate and construct its road, and take toll from passengers upon it, with the obligation which as passenger carriers it is obliged to assume, entitles the Metropolitan to the exclusive use of its tracks, and to the tolls from passengers taken up and set down on its line, in the absence of any legislative interference ; and if another road is authorized by charter to enter upon and take toll from such passengers, with a provision for compensation, we understand it to mean compensation based upon these views of the rights of the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-7\">\u201cWe are of opinion that the interests of both roads and th\u00ae <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>public require that the cars of the Quincy, with its own horses, drivers and conductors, should pass over the Metropolitan line, taking up and receiving tolls from all passengers, without reference to their destination; and that the Quincy, in such use of the Metropolitan track, should conform to the rules and regulations adopted by the last named company for the regulation of its own cars and employ\u00e9s; and that each company should conduct business in the enjoyment of its rights, so as to interfere as little as possible with the business of the other; and we accordingly so award.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-4\">\u201c In the matter of the compensation to be allowed the Metropolitan for such use, we think, as a general rule, the gross receipts of the company entering upon and using the tracks of another, from passengers carried over the whole or part of both roads, should be divided so as to give to each the reasonable profits from such passengers, so far as they may be carried on or rightly belong to the business of their respective roads, having regard to the capital and work contributed by each in the transportation ; and that from the gross receipts from passengers carried wholly on the road entered upon, only the cost of transportation should be allowed to the entering road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-5\">\u201c We have aimed, as far as the data furnished will enable, to give a rule by which the amount of compensation will depend upon the amount of business done, so that each company will be interested in the fare received from every passenger carried by the Quincy, union of interest to some extent created, competition removed, and the legitimate profits of the business for which each is incorporated will be received by each.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-6\">\u201c We award and direct that, at the end of each month, the Quincy Company shall furnish the Metropolitan a statement in writing, which shall truly exhibit,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-7\">\u201c First.

Said commissioners decide that each company shall be interested in the fare received from every passenger carried by the Quincy Railroad Company; and said commissioners attempt to create a union of interests, while they are, only authorized to determine the rate of compensation for the entry upon and use of tracks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-6\">\u201c4.

The Quincy Railroad Company is required to divide its gross receipts during the entire year, although during a part of the year the track may not be used at all on account of snow, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>and during the past year the track of the Metropolitan Railroad Company has not been used for several weeks by the respon dents.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-4\">The case was thereupon reserved, by <em>Hoar, </em>J., for the determination of the whole court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b276-5\"><em>P. W. Chandler &amp; G. O. Shattuck, </em>for the respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ak\">The petitioners by their charter have no right to tolls from passengers not carried in their cars. They accepted the grant, thus limited in terms. It is plain that a street railway company would have no right to exact tolls from persons who drive their private teams upon its tracks. And there is no statute which expressly or by implication gives any better right to tolls from passengers carried in the cars of another company. The questions involved are of vast importance to all the street railways in this vicinity. The petitioners have purchased several roads. All the other companies must pay tribute to them, if the principles of this report are established. A railroad, for example, from Quincy to Field\u2019s Corner alone cannot pay its expenses. This consideration is important, as throwing light on the intention of the legislature, in granting the charter to the petitioners. It was never intended to grant such privileges as are now claimed. The only idea then was, that others who used the tracks should pay a portion of the expense of keeping them in repair. And the commissioners in fixing upon the principle of compensation have in our judgment made an enormous mistake. The principle here adopted cannot as a general principle be carried out. There is a perfect network of tracks here in Boston. One car will run over the tracks of several companies. How shall the division be made ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-6\">The franchise of a street railway company is essentially different from that of a steam railroad company. See Gen. Sts. e. 63, \u00a7 <em>139; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Temple, </em>14 Gray, 77; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Mayor, </em>&amp;c. <em>of New York, </em>14 N. Y. 517. A steam railroad company cannot lay its tracks in a street without compensation to the owner of the fee. <em>Springfield </em>v. <em>Connecticut River Railroad, </em>4 Cush. 63. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>New York Central Railroad </em>16 N. Y. 97. With a street railway company it is otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number><em>Brooklyn, &amp;c. Railroad </em>v. <em>Brooklyn City Railroad, </em>33 Barb, 420.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-5\">The provision by which the respondents are only to be allowed the cost of transportation for passengers carried wholly on the petitioners\u2019 road is unjust. Ample compensation would be afforded by a provision for compensation simply for the use of the tracks. The chief injury to street railway tracks is caused by ordinary vehicles running against and across them. The award of the commissioners creates a partnership between the two corporations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-6\">The respondents under their charter cannot be compelled to exhibit their books to the petitioners, and the commissioners had no authority to order this.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b277-7\"><em>E.

Derby, </em>for the petitioners.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b277-8\">Gray, J.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"A9A\">A brief general consideration of the nature, of the rights acquired by a street railway corporation under a charter from the legislature, and of the extent of the powers of commissioners appointed under the <em>St. </em>of 1864, <em>c. </em>229, \u00a7 29, when one such corporation enters upon or uses the tracks of another, will go far towards disposing of the respondents\u2019 exceptions to this award.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">The charter of a street railway corporation is the grant of a franchise to lay iron rails on part of the public highways, to run horses and cars thereon for the transportation of passengers, and to receive fares for such transportation, in consideration of the benefit to the public resulting from the establishment of such means of travel, and in compensation for the expenses ncurred by the grantees in laying their rails and running their cars. Although such a grant does not deprive ordinary travellers of the right to pass over the whole highway, including that part on which the rails are laid, so long as they do not unreasonably interfere with the passage of such cars; it is clearly inconsistent with the use of the tracks by other similar corporations for the running of vehicles of the same kind for the transportation of passengers for hire, without like authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>from the legislature; for the grant of such a franchise would be of no benefit to the grantees, if it merely authorized them to incur the expense of laying rails adapted to the drawing of passenger cars, upon which, when laid, all other corporations, without compensation or reimbursement to them, would have equal rights to run similar cars and to receive like fares. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Temple, </em>14 Gray, 74-77. <em>St. </em>1864, c. 229, \u00a7\u00a7 22, 23, 26, 33. 1 Redfield on Railways, (3d ed.) 319, 320, 322. The legislature indeed reserves to itself the right to repeal or modify the charter, and to the municipal authorities the power of fixing, changing and discontinuing the location of the tracks and of regulating their use. Gen. Sts. c. 68, \u00a7 41. <em>St. </em>1864, <em>c. </em>229, \u00a7\u00a7 14-20, 31, 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Such was the nature of the franchise granted by the <em>St. </em>of 1854, <em>c. </em>435, and the acts in addition thereto, to the Dorchester Avenue Railroad Company, and now owned by the Metropolitan Railroad Company. The Quincy Railroad Company are authorized by their charter \u201c to enter upon and travel over with their cars and vehicles the tracks of said Dorchester Avenue Railroad,\u201d in a manner and upon terms to be fixed by commissioners appointed by this court, if the parties do not agree; and are made \u201c subject to all general laws which have been or may hereafter be enacted relating to horse railroads.\u201d <em>St. </em>1861, <em>c. </em>48, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The general act of 1864, concerning such companies, provides that whenever any street railway corporation, duly authorized by law, enters upon and uses the \u201c tracks, or any portion thereof, of another such corporation, and the corporations cannot agree upon the manner and conditions of such entry and use, or the compensation to be paid therefor, the supreme judicial court, upon the petition of either party and notice to the other, shall appoint three commissioners, who, after due notice to and hearing of the parties interested, shall determine the rate of compensation to be paid for future use, and if desired by either party, for past use, or fix the manner and stated periods of such use, or the mode of connection of the tracks, having reference to the convenience and interest of the corporations, and of the public to be accommodated thereby; \u201d and their award, being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>returned to and approved by the court, shall be binding for one year and until revised in the same manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">By this statute the rate of compensation to be paid by one corporation for the use of the tracks of the other is submitted in the broadest and most general terms to the determination of the commissioners. The weight to be allowed to the extent of the franchise granted in either charter, to the expenses incurred by each corporation, the amount of business done upon each of the connecting roads, and all other circumstances bearing upon the question, is left entirely to their discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"A8u\">The compensation which each corporation would in fact have received for their outlay and expenditures, in case no other corporation had entered upon their tracks, would have been the amount of the fares of all passengers transported in cars over those tracks. In the award made in this case, the commissioners, exercising the discretionary powers intrusted to them by the statute, appear to have been much influenced by this ; and have determined that the suitable compensation to be paid to the Metropolitan Railroad Company for the use of their tracks by the Quincy Railroad Company is that portion of the profits from passengers carried over -the whole or part of both roads, which is derived from carrying them on the road of the Metropolitan Railroad Company, or rightly belongs to the business of that road, having regard to the capital and work contributed by each company in the transportation; and also the entire receipts from passengers carried wholly on that road, allowing to the Quincy Railroad Company only the cost of transportation, which must of course be held to include an allowance for the interest on the capital invested in the horses and cars used by that corporation in such transportation of passengers. There is nothing in the facts of this case, as presented to the court, to show that this mode of estimating the compensation was unreasonable or beyond the authority of the commissioners. The question whether any other rate of compensation would have been more just and equitable was a question to be decided by the commissioners, and not by the court. The court must presume that the reasons in favor of a different mode of computation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>from that adopted in the award were presented to the commissioners and duly considered by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">With these general views of the nature of the questions to be decided by the court, we now come to the examination of the particular exceptions of the respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The first exception is based upon the assumption that the corporation whose tracks are entered upon have no peculiar right to transport passengers in cars over their own road; an assumption which, as already stated, is inconsistent with the nature of the franchise granted by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The ground alleged for the second, fourth and seventh exceptions is that the commissioners have been guided, in estimating the compensation, by the amount of business done by the respondents upon the petitioners\u2019 road. This was within the authority given to the commissioners by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">The third exception is groundless. There is nothing in the award which recognizes any interest of the petitioners in any passengers not carried over their own road, or which creates a partnership between the two corporations. The \u201c union of interest,\u201d which the commissioners declare it to be their object to create, is carefully limited by the words <em>\u201c </em>to some extent,\u201d and explained by the other objects stated, of removing competition, and giving to each corporation the legitimate profits of the business to do which they were incorporated. The commissioners in this have done no more than follow that clause of the statute which directs them to <em>\u201c </em>have reference to the convenience and interest of the corporations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">The statements and accounts required to be made and exhibited by the respondents to the petitioners, which are the subjects of the fifth and sixth exceptions, are no more than reasonable means to secure the payment of the compensation at the rate fixed by the commissioners. There is nothing in the case to show that it is impracticable or difficult to keep or render such accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">The obligation of each corporation to keep their tracks in repair is fixed by statute, and need not be expressed in the award. <em>St. </em>1864, <em>c. </em>229, \u00a7 18. The allowance, if any, to bs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>made for the fact that the tracks were not used during part of the winter was to be, and doubtless was, considered by the commissioners. The eighth and ninth exceptions cannot therefore be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">This disposes of all the exceptions taken by the respondents to this award. It may be added that many of them are very similar to exceptions which have been heretofore taken to like awards between ordinary railroad corporations, under the Sts. of 1845, <em>c, </em>191, and 1857, <em>c. </em>291, and overruled by this court, upon reasons which apply with equal force to this case. <em>Boston &amp; Worcester Railroad </em>v. <em>Western Railroad, </em>14 Gray, 253. <em>Lexington &amp; West Cambridge Railroad </em>v. <em>Fitchburg </em>Railroad, lb. 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\n<em>Award accepted and judgment thereon.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b277-10\"> Colt, J. did not sit in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
