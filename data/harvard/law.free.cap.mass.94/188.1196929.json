The complaint was not dated, but the <em>jurat </em>showed that it was received and sworn to on the 20th of September 1865. The defendant pleaded not guilty in the police court, but was convicted, and appealed to the superior court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-11\">In the superior court, the defendant moved for leave to withdraw bis plea of not guilty, and to file an answer in demurrer and a special plea in bar, the substance of which was that he had a license as a common seller of liquors under the internal revenue laws of the United States, and that he had paid a national and state, tax on the liquors kept by him; but the motion was overruled by <em>Brigham, </em>J. The defendant also moved to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>dismiss the complaint on the ground that it was not dated; and that the time of the commission of the offence was insufficiently alleged; but this motion was overruled. The defendant, having been found guilty by the jury, moved in arrest of judgment for the same reasons; but this motion was also overruled. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b197-5\"><em>C. H. </em>Hudson, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b197-6\"><em>Reed, A. </em>G., for the Commonwealth,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AlY\">cited, as to the refusal to allow the defendant to plead anew, <em>2 </em>Gabbett Crim. L. 326; <em>Strahan\u2019s case, </em>7 Cox Crim. Cas. 85; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>11 Cush. 422.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b197-7\">Dewey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZQ\">The ruling of the superior court, refusing leave to file a special plea in that court, is not subject to exception, the party having no right to withdraw the plea of not guilty, upon which the case was tried in the police court, and plead anew, except by leave of the court. At common law, the defendant was only entitled to a single plea. The <em>St. </em>of 4 Anne, <em>c. </em>16, has not enlarged the right of pleading in criminal cases. Further, when the defendant has once pleaded he is bound to abide by the defence thus taken, and cannot as a matter of right withdraw it, in order to rely on another. 1 Chit. Crim. L 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">The plea of not guilty in criminal cases opens a very wide defence as to all matters connected with the merits of the case, and a. special plea can rarely be necessary or proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">The time of filing the original complaint is sufficiently shown by the certificate of the time of its reception, and the oath an \u25a0 nexed thereto. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kingman, </em>14 Gray, 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">No ground exists for sustaining any motion in arrest of judgment. <em>Exceptions overruled</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b197-11\"> At the same term, a similar decision was made in the case of Commonwealth <em>vs. </em>John E.
