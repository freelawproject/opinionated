The facts showing the title to the ice and the circumstances under which it was destroyed are also stated in the preceding case. Upon facts agreed in the superior court, judgments were rendered for the plaintiffs for the full amount of the several insurances ; and the defendants appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b389-8\"><em>D.

When the ice was destroyed, it was the property of the Ice Company; and though they had made a contract to sell it to Weed, and had received an instalment of the purchase money, the property had not passed; it remained at their risk; and when the execution of the contract became impossible, they were bound to refund what had been paid to them, as money received on a consideration which had failed. <em>Res perit domino. </em>The plaintiffs\u2019 interest was as great at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>loss as at the time when their policies were effected; and they are entitled to recover to the fall extent of their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\"><em>Judgment according to the agreement in each case for the fuU amount of the </em>insurance, <em>interest and costs.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
