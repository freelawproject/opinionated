Moreover, defendant\u2019s attorney was not ineffective for failing to request the instruction. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Defendant\u2019s conviction arises from the brutal rape and murder of the victim, Carol Easlick. Testimony established that on the day of the offense, defendant and his friend, Woodrow Couch, visited the victim in her apartment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After a short stay, both men left the apartment. Later in the day, defendant returned to the victim\u2019s apartment alone.' While there, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>raped the victim, battered her to death, and then set her corpse on fire.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Defendant was arrested and charged with first-degree premeditated murder, MCL 750.316(l)(a); first-degree felony murder, MCL 750.316(l)(b); first-degree arson of a dwelling house, MCL 750.72; and CSC I, MCL 750.520b(l). Defendant denied involvement in the crime. At the close of the proofs, before instructing the jury, the court asked both parties whether they wanted to comment or object to the proposed jury instructions. Defendant\u2019s attorney responded, \u201cother than the alibi, I find nothing objectionable.\u201d Significantly, defendant\u2019s attorney neither requested a cautionary instruction regarding accomplice testimony nor objected to the trial court\u2019s failure to give sua sponte the cautionary instruction. Defendant was convicted by a jury of all the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals, raising several claims: (1) the evidence was insufficient to support the first-degree premeditated murder conviction, (2) the trial court erred by failing to give sua sponte a cautionary instruction regarding accomplice testimony, (3) his attorney was ineffective for failing to request the cautionary instruction, and (4) the convictions of both felony murder and CSC I violated his double jeopardy rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">The Court of Appeals vacated the arson and CSC I convictions, but affirmed the remaining convictions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>Regarding defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court erred when it failed to give sua sponte a cautionary instruction (and that defense counsel was ineffective for failing to request one), the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-6\">Here, it is apparent that defendant\u2019s theory of the case was that he did not commit the crimes and was not present during the commission of the crimes. In this regard, Couch\u2019s testimony to this effect as well as his credibility was attacked by defense counsel during both cross-examination and closing arguments. The instructions provided by the trial court properly presented the elements of the crimes and properly informed the jury as to what should be considered when determining the credibility of a particular witness. Further, dna analysis of the sperm swabs taken from the victim\u2019s vagina, rectum, and mouth established a match with defendant\u2019s dna and excluded Couch as a potential donor. Under these circumstances, the trial court did not err when it failed to provide cautionary instructions regarding accomplice testimony in this case. [Slip op at 2 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Defendant applied for leave to appeal here, which was granted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">H. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">\u201cThe test for determining the sufficiency of evidence in a criminal case is whether the evidence, viewed in a light most favorable to the people, would warrant a reasonable juror in finding guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d \u201cThe standard of review is deferential: a reviewing court is required to draw all reasonable inferences and make credibility choices in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>support of the jury verdict.\u201d <em>People v Nowack, </em>462 Mich 392, 399-400; 614 NW2d 78 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Whether a trial court\u2019s failure to give sua sponte a cautionary instruction about accomplice testimony under <em>McCoy </em>was error is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>People v Hamilton, </em>465 Mich 526, 529; 638 NW2d 92 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">HI. ANALYSIS A</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Defendant first argues that .there was insufficient evidence to support his first-degree premeditated murder conviction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">To show first-degree premeditated murder, \u201c \u2018[s]ome time span between [the] initial homicidal intent and ultimate action is necessary to establish premeditation and deliberation.\u2019 \u201d <em>People v Tilley, </em>405 Mich 38, 45; 273 NW2d 471 (1979), quoting <em>People v Hoffmeister, </em>394 Mich 155, 161; 229 NW2d 305 (1975). The interval between the initial thought and ultimate action should be long enough to afford a reasonable person time to take a \u201csecond look.\u201d <em>People v Vail, </em>393 Mich 460, 469; 227 NW2d 535 (1975), quoting <em>People v Morrin, </em>31 Mich App 301, 328-330; 187 NW2d 434 (1971). See also <em>People v Johnson, </em>460 Mich 720, 733; 597 NW2d 73 (1999) (applying a \u201csecond-look\u201d analysis). Manual strangulation can be used as evidence that a defendant had an opportunity to take a \u201csecond look.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, a defendant\u2019s attempt to conceal the killing can be used as evidence of premeditation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>In this case, there was evidence that the victim was manually strangled. Also, there was evidence that the defendant attempted to conceal his crime by burning the victim\u2019s body. Viewing this evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecutor, we conclude there was sufficient evidence for the jury to convict defendant of first-degree premeditated murder. Accordingly, this conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Defendant next argues that the trial court erred by failing to give sua sponte a cautionary instruction regarding accomplice testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">As an initial matter, we conclude that defendant\u2019s failure to either request a cautionary accomplice instruction or to object to the trial court\u2019s failure to give one sua sponte, precludes defendant from seeking relief in the appellate courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">MCL 768.29 provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[t]he failure of the court to instruct on any point of law shall not be ground for setting aside the verdict of the jury <em>unless such instruction is requested by the accused.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). MCR 2.516(C) further provides that \u201c[a] party may assign as error the . . . failure to give an instruction <em>only if the party objects on the record </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">In this case, defendant neither requested a cautionary accomplice instruction nor objected to the court\u2019s failure to give one. Therefore, defendant is precluded from arguing that the omitted instruction was error. MCR 2.516(C). Furthermore, because he failed to request the omitted instruction, defendant is not entitled to have the verdict set aside. MCL 768.29. Conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>quentiy, defendant\u2019s only remaining avenue for relief is for review under <em>People v Grant, </em>445 Mich 535; 520 NW2d 123 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Because defendant failed to object to the omitted instruction, defendant\u2019s claim of error was forfeited. A forfeited, nonconstitutional error may not be considered by an appellate. court unless the error was plain and it affected defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>G)-ant, supra </em>at 552-553.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Defendant maintains that the failure to give a cautionary accomplice instruction with regard to Couch\u2019s testimony was plain error under <em>McCoy, supra </em>at 240, which held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-7\">For cases tried after the publication of this opinion, it will be deemed reversible error ... to fail upon request to give a cautionary instruction concerning accomplice testimony and, if the issue is closely drawn,[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] it may be reversible error to fail to give'such a cautionary instruction even in the absence of a request to charge.\u201d[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">We conclude that it was not error for the trial court to omit the cautionary accomplice instruction because there is no evidence that Couch, the alleged accomplice, was involved in the crimes at all. Signifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>cantly, the DNA evidence <em>excluded </em>Couch as a potential donor of the sperm found on the victim. Moreover, the cautionary accomplice instruction would have been inconsistent with defendant\u2019s theory. Defendant\u2019s theory was that he neither committed the charged crimes, nor was he involved in any way. In fact, defendant\u2019s own attorney claimed that someone other than Couch committed the offense during his closing argument.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">For these reasons, it was not error for the trial court to fail to give sua sponte a cautionary instruction regarding accomplice testimony. Because defendant cannot show error, he cannot demonstrate plain error that affected his substantial rights. Accordingly, defendant is not entitled to relief for the forfeited claim. <em>Grant, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">In a related argument, defendant claims that his trial counsel was ineffective because counsel failed to request a cautionary accomplice instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">To demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, defendant must show that his attorney\u2019s conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that the representation so prejudiced defendant that he was deprived of a fair trial. <em>People v Reed, </em>449 Mich 375, 390; 535 NW2d 496 (1995) (opinion by Boyle, J.). Moreover, courts will not second-guess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>matters of trial strategy. <em>People v Rice (On Remand), </em>235 Mich App 429, 444; 597 NW2d 843 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Here, defendant is unable to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel. As discussed above, a cautionary instruction regarding accomplice testimony was inappropriate because it was inconsistent with the evidence and it was inconsistent with defendant\u2019s theory at trial. Further, it is reasonable to presume that the attorney\u2019s failure to request the cautionary instruction was a matter of trial strategy. In addition to its inconsistency with defendant\u2019s theory, the instruction might have damaged defendant\u2019s case inasmuch as it would have suggested to the jury that defendant was involved in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that defendant\u2019s attorney was not ineffective for failing to request the cautionary instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">In sum, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant\u2019s first-degree premeditated murder conviction. Additionally, the trial court did not err by failing to give sua sponte a cautionary accomplice instruction, nor was defendant\u2019s attorney ineffective for failing to request one.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b745-10\">Corrigan, C.J., and Weaver, Taylor, and Markman, JJ., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b745-11\">Cavanagh and Kelly, JJ., concurred in the result only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b738-8\"> Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued June 19, 2001 (Docket No. 220715). The Court of Appeals explained that it was unclear whether the arson or esc i conviction served as the predicate felony. However, because defendant ultimately faced life in prison without the possibility of parole, the panel thought it appropriate to vacate both convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b738-9\"> Couch was a key prosecution witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b739-8\"> Defendant gave two conflicting versions of what happened that day. In his first statement to the police, defendant denied returning to the victim\u2019s apartment after he and Couch left. He also denied having sexual relations with the victim. In his second statement, defendant stated that he had consensual sex with the victim. However, he claimed that she was alive when he left, and that Couch remained in the apartment with the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b740-10\"> 467 Mich 899 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b743-9\"> An issue is \u201cclosely drawn\u201d if its resolution depends on a credibility contest between the defendant and the accomplice-witness. <em>McCoy, supra </em>at 238-239; <em>People v Tucker, </em>181 Mich App 246, 256; 448 NW2d 811 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b743-10\"> The latter half of this holding, commonly called the \u201cclosely drawn\u201d rule, states that it may be an error requiring reversal for a court to fail to give sua sponte a cautionary instruction when the issue of defendant\u2019s involvement is \u201cclosely drawn.\u201d This rule arguably conflicts with MCL 768.29, which provides that a verdict may not be set aside because of an omitted instruction if the defendant failed to request the instruction. However, for reasons discussed below, we conclude that there was no evidence of an accomplice in this case, and, therefore, <em>McCoy\u2019s </em>\u201cclosely drawn\u201d rule is not implicated. For that reason, we do not reach the question whether <em>McCoy </em>conflicts with MCL 768.29.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b744-9\"> Defendant\u2019s attorney argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-10\">I submit to you that there could be some unknown person that went in after [defendant] left, <em>after [Couch] left, </em>and got mad at Carol and committed this crime and then left.
