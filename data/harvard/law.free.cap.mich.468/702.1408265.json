Washtenaw County must comply with plaintiff Pittsfield Charter Township\u2019s zoning ordinance in the locating of the county\u2019s proposed homeless shelter. We hold that the county does not need to comply with the township\u2019s zoning ordinance and, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the summary-disposition order entered by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">Washtenaw County owns property in Pittsfield Charter Township that the township\u2019s zoning ordinance has designated as i-l (limited industrial). With the financial participation of the city of Ann Arbor, the county advertised a proposal to construct a new homeless shelter, which it would own, on the property. The i-l district ordinance neither expressly nor conditionally permits such a use.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">Pittsfield Township took the position that the proposed use violated its zoning ordinance and thus was impermissible because the Township Zoning Act (tza), MCL 125.271 <em>et seq., </em>and specifically MCL 125.271(1),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> gives its zoning priority that the county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>cannot ignore. The county, however, asserted that, pursuant to the county commissioners act (CCA), MCL 46.1 <em>et seq., </em>specifically MCL 46.11, county boards of commissioners are not subject to the township zoning ordinances when determining the site of, or prescribing the time and manner of erecting, county buildings. MCL 46.11(b), (d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>The township filed a complaint in the Washtenaw Circuit Court seeking a declaration that the county must comply with the township\u2019s zoning ordinance, and seeking to enjoin the county from disregarding the zoning ordinance and proceeding with the construction of the proposed homeless shelter. The complaint also named the city of Ann Arbor as a codefendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The county filed a motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(8), asserting that, as a matter of law, it was immune from the zoning requirements of the township.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The township filed a similar motion asserting the converse, that the tza gave it priority and that, accordingly, the county was not immune. The circuit court, while denying the township\u2019s motion, granted the county\u2019s motion on the basis that MCL 46.11 granted the county plenary authority to choose sites for buildings and that the county was exempt from Pittsfield Township\u2019s zoning ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court outlined that the tests for determining exemptions from the requirements of a township zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>ordinance were set out in <em>Dearden v Detroit, </em>403 Mich 257; 269 NW2d 139 (1978), <em>Burt Twp v Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, </em>459 Mich 659, 669; 593 NW2d 534 (1999), and <em>Byrne v Michigan, </em>463 Mich 652; 624 NW2d 906 (2001). It then characterized this case law as holding that, to be exempt from the zoning ordinances, the statute granting the county authority to site buildings must explicitly state that it supersedes the zoning ordinance. As the Court described it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-4\">If the Legislature meant to say that the county\u2019s power to site and use its property is plenary (not subject to, but exempt from, any legal restrictions), the Legislature could have easily and expressly said so. It did not, and we conclude that it is neither permissible nor appropriate for us to graft such a plenary gloss on this statutory provision. [246 Mich App 362.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">We granted the county leave to appeal. 466 Mich 859 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">This case is before us on a matter of statutory interpretation. Because this is a matter of law, our review is de novo. <em>Robertson v DaimlerChrysler Corp, </em>465 Mich 732, 739; 641 NW2d 567 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">HI</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">We are called on to examine the two acts that are the sources of township and county authority, the tza and the CCA. The tza vests townships with broad authority to enact zoning ordinances to regulate land development and to \u201cinsure that the use of land shall be situated in appropriate locations and relationships <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>. . . MCL 125.271(1).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The tza further directs townships to define zones \u201cto meet the needs of the state\u2019s residents for . . . places of residence, recreation, industry, trade, service, and other uses of land . . . <em>Id.; </em>MCL 125.273.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This authority given to the townships, however, does not extend to the regulation or control of oil or other wells that are under the jurisdiction of the supervisor of wells pursuant to the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act, MCL 324.101 <em>et seq., </em>particularly MCL 324.61501 <em>et seq., </em>or power lines that are subject to the Electric Transmission Line Certification Act, MCL 460.561 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The CCA, upon which the county relies, states at MCL 46. II<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that counties can determine site selection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>and the time and manner of erecting county buildings. However, there is one limitation on this power. It is found in the second sentence of MCL 46.11(b) and it limits the site-selection authority by directing that the county cannot disregard any requirement of law holding that a county building be located at the county seat. These provisions are, of course, potentially in tension with each other in their grants of authority. It is our undertaking to establish the proper priority between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-3\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">In adjudicating this matter, the Court of Appeals found a conflict between the authority given to the townships and the counties under the tza and the CCA. It then resolved this conflict by construing our holdings in <em>Dearden, Burt Twp, </em>and <em>Byrne </em>to mean that there must be express indications in the statute granting the county immunity from the township\u2019s zoning power before the county could be immune.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">This Court articulated in <em>Dearden, supra </em>at 264, that in resolving a conflict between units of government the legislative intent \u201cwhere it can be discerned\u201d controls the question whether a governmental unit is subject to the provisions of another\u2019s zoning ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">In <em>Burt Twp, supra </em>at 669, we reiterated this approach and cautioned that there are no \u201ctalismanic words\u201d that convey the Legislature\u2019s intent to create immunity from local zoning. Rather, the Legislature \u201cneed only use terms that convey its clear intention that the grant of jurisdiction given is, in fact, exclusive.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>This Court has also conceded that discerning the legislative intent regarding whether a government unit is immune from the provisions of local zoning ordinances has \u201cproven difficult to apply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 664 n 3. The insight of this observation is made apparent when one looks at the difficulties the Court of Appeals discussed here<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and which eventuated in what is best described as an almost mechanistic approach for determining priority. The panel essentially held that if the county\u2019s authority is not addressed explicitly by the Legislature, the township ordinances prevail. As we have attempted in the past to explain, the test is not this simple. The analysis requires more than merely searching for words of exclusion. Recently in <em>Burt Twp </em>we gave guidance to courts searching for this intent, stating that the Legislature need not \u201cuse any particular talismanic words to indicate its intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 669. This may not, as we had hoped it would, make the task easier, but, at least, it must mean that there are no special words, the absence of which engenders a specific outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Nevertheless, whether easy or not, the question remains: Where do we look to find the intent? The answer is that we must look for guidance to the statutes themselves to see if there are any textual indications that would convey the Legislature\u2019s intent on the issue of priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">We believe that, closely read, the statutes here at issue indicate that the higher priority is with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>county. We draw this first from the fact that in the CCA the Legislature expressly stated only one limitation on the authority of the county to site buildings. That limitation is that the county cannot use the power that was given in MCL 46.11 to site buildings if there is any other requirement of law that county buildings be located at the county seat. This language became part of the act in 1998, when the Legislature amended the CCA.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We believe this shows that the Legislature, by explicitly turning its attention to limits on the county siting power and deciding on only one limitation, must have considered the issue of limits and intended no other limitation. This conclusion is analogous to the discernment of intent undertaken by this Court in <em>Dearden. </em>There we held that the authority given to the state to site prisons gave priority over local zoning ordinances on the basis of the authorizing statute, MCL 791.204, which said that \u201cthe department shall have exclusive jurisdiction over . . . penal institutions . . . .\u201d <em>Dearden, supra </em>at 265. From this we found the intent of the Legislature, stating that we read this language as \u201ca clear expression of the Legislature\u2019s intent to vest the department with complete jurisdiction over the state\u2019s penal institutions, subject only to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>the constitutional powers of the executive and the judiciary, and not subject in any way to any other legislative act, such as the zoning enabling act.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">In response to this argument, which is properly characterized as applying the doctrine of expressio unius est exclusio alterius, the expression of one thing suggests the exclusion of all others,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the township counters that the same approach applied to the tza yields an outcome that gives the township an equal claim to priority. It argues that the tza itself has two exemptions from township zoning power, certain wells and electric transmission lines, and that this must mean that, except for these, nothing else should be held to be exempt from township zoning power. The township\u2019s position has some appeal certainly, but we believe that a thorough analysis of the application of the doctrine to each statute makes the township\u2019s position less defensible than the county\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">While it is correct that the tza does have exemptions to disallow township zoning regulation or control of the activities surrounding the siting of oil and gas wells or electric transmission lines, in our view, the Legislature, in creating these exemptions, was not concerned with the issue of limits on township zoning power, but was merely engaged in efforts to coordinate the later enacted Electric Transmission Line Certification Act, even as the Legislature in 1943 had attempted to reconcile the then new tza<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> with the power created four years earlier for the supervisor of wells.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Confirmation that mere coordination was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>Legislature\u2019s goal, at least in 1995, can be discerned from the fact that the Legislature expressly stated in the latest substantive amendment of the tza, 1995 PA 35,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> that unless the Electric Transmission Line Certification Act was enacted that the amendment to the tza would not be effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">Further, even if expressio unius est exclusio alter\u00e1is applied equally to benefit each party\u2019s arguments, the township\u2019s argument, that each has a statute giving priority over the other, would yield to the doctrine of last enactment. <em>Old Orchard by the Bay Assoc v Hamilton Mut Ins Co, </em>434 Mich 244, 257; 454 NW2d 73 (1990). That doctrine presumes that the Legislature is aware of the existence of the law in effect at the time of its enactments and recognizes that, since one Legislature cannot bind the power of its successor, existing statutory language cannot be a bar to further exceptions set forth in subsequent, substantive enactments. See <em>Malcolm v East Detroit, </em>437 Mich 132, 139; 468 NW2d 479 (1991). In relation to this case, the CCA was substantively amended in 1998, whereas the tza has not been substantively amended regarding this issue any time since then. Therefore, in the effort to establish priority, the CCA, as the most recent statement of the Legislature, prevails over the TZA.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Further, and perhaps most compellingly, the township\u2019s argument, that it also has an equally valid claim to application of the doctrine of expressio unius est exclusio alter\u00e1is, is flawed because this approach would cause MCL 46.11(b) to be mere surplusage. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>The reason is that, as argued by the township, MCL 46.11 would only give authority to the county to site buildings as it desired as long as the placement was in harmony with the township\u2019s existing zoning plan. Yet this very power was one the county, as well as any other land user, already had before the enactment of MCL 46.11(b). To aver that MCL 46.11(b) simply reiterates a power already possessed is to rob it of any meaning, that is, to make it surplusage. This violates \u201cthe fundamental rule of [statutory] construction that every word of a statute should be given meaning and no word should be treated as surplusage or rendered nugatory if at all possible.\u201d <em>Feld v Robert &amp; Charles Beauty Salon, </em>435 Mich 352, 364; 459 NW2d 279 (1990). The county\u2019s position has no defect of this sort. Its argument causes no portion of the tza to be surplusage. Accordingly, we decline for these reasons also to adopt the township\u2019s analysis of these statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Moreover, it is significant to us that the language of the tza, on which the township relied, is less specific to the particular matter at hand than was the language relied on in <em>Burt Twp, </em>in which we determined that the Department of Natural Resources\u2019 boat-launch sites were subject to local zoning. <em>Burt Twp, supra </em>at 671. In <em>Burt Twp, </em>we noted that the tza authorized a township to regulate land development to facilitate \u201crecreation\u201d and that zoning plans were to be designed to \u201cconserve natural resources.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 665. Further, we noted that under the township planning act, MCL 125.321 <em>et seq., </em>the township plan was to include recommendations for, inter alia, \u201c \u2018waterways and waterfront developments.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 666, quoting MCL 125.327(2)(b). These topics \u2014 recreation, nat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>ural resources, waterways, and waterfront development \u2014 suggested to us in <em>Burt Twp </em>that there had been legislative consideration of the priority issue in the area of recreational water access and usage and accordingly led us to the conclusion that the township authority was meant to have priority. In the present case, however, when one reviews the mandates of the tza, as relevant to siting county buildings, the tza yields only highly generalized references to \u201cplaces of residence,\u201d \u201cother uses of land,\u201d and \u201cother public requirements . . . .\u201d MCL 125.273. These seem to suggest no conclusion by the Legislature that the location of county buildings of any kind should be controlled by township zoning. Therefore, when these tza provisions are viewed alongside the structure of the county power in MCL 46.11, the lack of focus on county buildings in the tza reinforces our view that the Legislature in this circumstance intended that priority be given to the county in siting its buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-3\">We note also that the Court of Appeals made reference to the County Zoning Act, MCL 125.201 <em>ei seq., </em>and attempted, by dovetailing it with the tza, specifically MCL 125.298, to buttress its analysis. This approach is less helpful than the Court thought, however, because it failed to fully consider that we are not dealing here with a decision taken pursuant to the county\u2019s zoning authority and thus the effort to analyze this matter as implicating \u201ca comprehensive statutory scheme\u201d is unpersuasive. 246 Mich App 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">Finally, we also are mindful of the <em>Dearden </em>Court\u2019s policy analysis, which, while undoubtedly less implicated here, still has relevance. The <em>Dearden </em>Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>[T]he zoning enabling act does not indicate whether or not the Legislature intended to subject the department to local zoning ordinances. We can find no expression of a legislative intent in the language of that act to subject the department\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction over the state\u2019s penal institutions, and its duty to coordinate and adjust those institutions as an integral part of a unified, general correctional system, to the many and varied municipal zoning ordinances throughout the state. If the department were subject to those ordinances, the underlying policies of the general correctional system could be effectively thwarted by community after community prohibiting the placement of certain penal institutions in appropriate locations. A careful reading of the statute establishing the department evidences a contrary legislative intent. <em>[Id. </em>at 266-267.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">For these reasons, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the circuit court\u2019s order of summary disposition.</p>\n<judges id=\"b816-5\">Corrigan, C.J., and Cavanagh, Kelly, Young, and Markman, JJ., concurred with Taylor, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b804-9\"> MCL 125.271(1) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-10\">The township board of an organized township in this state may provide by zoning ordinance for the regulation of land development and the establishment of districts in the portions of the township outside the limits of cities and villages which regulate the use of land and structures; to meet the needs of the state\u2019s citizens for food, fiber, energy, and other natural resources, places of residence, recreation, industry, trade, service, and other uses of land; to insure that use of the land shall be situated in appropriate locations and relationships; to limit the inappropriate overcrowding of land and congestion of population, transportation systems, and other public facilities; to facilitate adequate and efficient provision for transportation systems, sewage disposal, water, energy, education, recreation, and other public service and facility requirements; and to promote public health, safety, and welfare.

In my view, the plain text of the county commissioners act (cca) clearly conveys the Legislature\u2019s intent to grant county boards of commissioners exclusive jurisdiction over site selection for and construction of county buildings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>MCL 46.11 of the CCA provides in pertinent part that county boards of commissioners may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-4\">(b) Determine the site of, remove, or designate a new site for a county building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-6\">(d) Erect the necessary buildings for jails, clerks\u2019 offices, and other county buildings, and prescribe the time and manner of erecting them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">On the other hand, the Township Zoning Act (tza), MCL 125.271 <em>et seq., </em>vests townships with broad authority to enact zoning ordinances to regulate land development and \u201cto insure that the use of land shall be situated in appropriate locations and relationships ____\u201d MCL 125.271(1), cf. MCL 125.273. Anticipated or not by the Legislature, county-commission authority over site selection for, and the time and manner of erecting, county buildings as stated by MCL 46.11 conflicts with the township\u2019s statutory authority over both the process and substance of township zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">Three powers vested by the Legislature in county commissions through MCL 46.11 are relevant to and decisive of this case. MCL 46.11 provides that county boards may \u201cdetermine the site of,\u201d \u201cprescribe the time ... of erecting,\u201d and \u201cprescribe the . . . manner of erecting\u201d county buildings. Because county commissions have had this express statutory authority over site selection and the time and manner of erecting county buildings since the CCA was first enacted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>1851, the majority\u2019s application of the last-enactment doctrine is unpersuasive.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">\u201cDetermine\u201d and \u201cprescribe\u201d convey the scope of county-commission authority over the development of county buildings (i.e., site selection and the time and manner of construction). To \u201cdetermine\u201d is to \u201cset limits to; bound; define\u201d or to \u201csettle (a dispute, question, etc.) conclusively; decide.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary </em>(3d College ed). To \u201cprescribe\u201d is \u201cto write beforehand ... to set down as a rule or direction; order; ordain; direct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While the CCA does not include the words \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d in reference to county-commission authority over site selection for and construction of county buildings, this Court has emphasized that such \u201ctalismanic words\u201d are unnecessary to convey the Legislature\u2019s intent to create immunity from local zoning. <em>Burt, supra </em>at 669.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Where, as here, a county board seeks to site a county building in a township zoning district where the commission\u2019s intended use for the building is not permitted., the commission\u2019s power to \u201cdetermine the site of\u201d a county building conflicts with the township\u2019s authority to create zoning districts that exclude defined land uses. MCL 46.11, 125.271(1). Moreover, the authority to \u201cprescribe the time ... of erecting\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>county buildings affects the township\u2019s process for reviewing site plans. More critically, in my view, the authority to \u201cprescribe the . . . manner of erecting\u201d county buildings overrides a township\u2019s control through the enactment of ordinances of the physical details of erecting buildings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-3\">In circumstances such as those presented, the county commission\u2019s site-selection authority and its authority to prescribe the time and manner of erecting county buildings is diminished if the county board must comply with a township\u2019s zoning districts just as the township\u2019s authority to establish zoning districts is diminished if the county commission need not comply with township zoning districts when determining a site for a county building. In light of the conflict, either the township or the county must relinquish some statutory authority.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In this dispute, I would hold that the combined effect of the power to \u201cdetermine the site\u201d and the powers to \u201cprescribe the time and manner of erecting\u201d county buildings conveys a clear legislative intent to convey exclusive jurisdiction over the siting and construction of county buildings to county commissions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>Further, the majority reads more than can be justified into the 1998 amendments of MCL 46.11 regarding a limitation of county-commission authority over buildings required by law to be at a county seat. Any modification of the county-seat limitation on a county board\u2019s site-selection authority does not, as suggested by the majority, show that the Legislature \u201cmust have considered the issue of limits [on commission authority over county buildings] and intended no other limitation.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 711. Such reasoning is sheer speculation and especially unconvincing because a county-seat limitation on site selection for certain county buildings appears consistently to have been included in the CCA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">The Court of Appeals panel suggested this conclusion and interpretation of MCL 46.11 would impermissibly \u201cgraft . . . plenary gloss on this statutory provision,\u201d 246 Mich App 356, 362; 633 NW2d 10 (2001). I disagree by noting that the powers vested in county commissions over county buildings are conveyed in terms analogous to those by which the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>vested control over the state\u2019s penal system in the Department of Corrections.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Dearden, </em>the Department of Corrections\u2019 enabling statute expressed the Legislature\u2019s \u201cintent to vest the [Department of Corrections] with complete jurisdiction over the state\u2019s penal institutions . . . .\u201d <em>Dearden, supra </em>at 265. The language of the department\u2019s enabling statute vested the department with \u201c \u2018exclusive jurisdiction over . . . penal institutions ....\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting MCL 791.204. Moreover, the Legislature expressly authorized the department to provide for the \u201c \u2018unified development\u2019 \u201d of penal institutions \u201c \u2018so that each shall form an integral part of a general system.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266, quoting MCL 791.202.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">For these reasons, I concur in the result of the majority opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-7\"> As this Court held in <em>Dearden v Detroit, </em>403 Mich 257, 264; 269 NW2d 139 (1978), the legislative intent, \u201cwhere it can be discerned,\u201d controls the question whether a governmental unit is subject to the provisions of another\u2019s zoning ordinances. In <em>Burt Twp v Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>459 Mich 659, 669; 593 NW2d 534 (1999), we held that the Legislature \u201cneed only use terms that convey its clear intention that the grant of jurisdiction given is, in fact, exclusive.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b818-7\"> The majority suggests that MCL 46.11 was \u201csubstantively amended in 1998,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 713, but fails to explain how the 1998 amendments were relevant to the powers county commissions have held since 1851. Further, the doctrine of last enactment seems an odd choice in resolving this case because the doctrine is most often argued to support the implied repeal of one law by a later enacted law. Not even the county argues that the CCA repealed any portion of the tza. Perhaps that is because repeals by implication are not favored. <em>Washtenaw Co Rd Comm\u2019rs v Pub Service Comm, </em>349 Mich 663, 680; 85 NW2d 134 (1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b819-4\"> MCL 125.271(1) provides that \u201c[o]rdinances regulating land development may also be adopted designating or limiting the location, height, number of stories, and size of dwellings, buildings, and structures [that] may be erected or altered; the area of yards, courts, and other open spaces, and sanitary, safety, and protective measures that shall be required for the dwellings, buildings, and structures . . . erected or altered.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b819-5\"> Therefore, the surplusage argument that the majority finds so compelling is of small assistance in determining which party prevails.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b819-6\"> The authority of county boards pursuant to MCL 46.11 is distinguishable from that of the Department of Natural Resources (dnr) as expressed in the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act (nrepa), MCL 324.101 <em>et seq. </em>The nrepa vests the dnr with the authority to construct public boat launches. In <em>Burt Twp, supra, </em>this Court concluded that while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>the nrepa gave the dnr the \u201c \u2018power and jurisdiction\u2019 to manage land within its control,\u201d such authority was \u201cnot the same as granting it <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 669-670 (emphasis in original), reasoning that \u201cthe fact that the dnr is mandated to create recreational facilities on public land it manages and controls does not indicate a legislative intent that the dnr may do so in contravention of local zoning ordinances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 670.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b820-8\"> As noted by the majority, before 1998, MCL 46.11(e) provided: \u201cRemove or designate a new site for a county building required to be at the county seat, <em>if the new site is not outside the limits of the village or city in which the county seat is situated </em>. . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.) Similarly, 1851 PA 156, \u00a7 11, \u00b6 5, provided that the county commission may \u201cremove or designate a new site for any county buildings required to be at the county seats, <em>when such removal shall not exceed the limits of the village or city at which the county seat is situated as previously located. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) The actual text of these incarnations of the county-seat limitation do not appear significantly different from the limitation as it is currently drafted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b821-5\"> It is worth noting that, contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, the majority\u2019s construction of the county seat site selection limitation is in no way \u201canalogous to the discernment of intent undertaken by this Court in <em>Dearden.\u201d Ante </em>at 711. <em>Dearden </em>focused on the text of the statute to discern the Legislature\u2019s intent; the majority fails to consider the text of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
