The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that gender-based harassment is sufficient to establish a claim of sexual harassment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree. The cra prohibits sexual harassment, which is defined in that act as \u201cunwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature . . . .\u201d MCL 37.2103(i). Accordingly, conduct or communication that is gender-based, but is not sexual in nature, does not constitute sexual harassment as that term is clearly defined in the CRA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the circuit court\u2019s order granting summary disposition in favor of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Two capitol security officers with the Michigan State Police, Virginia Rich and Canute Findsen, shot and killed each other, while on duty. After the incident, plaintiff, the personal representative of the estate of decedent Rich, brought suit under the cra against the state of Michigan, the Michigan Department of State Police, and two state police supervisors. Plaintiff claimed that Findsen had sexually harassed Rich by making hostile and offensive comments about her gender, thus creating a hostile work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>environment that caused Rich to complain to her supervisors, who failed to take remedial action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">Defendants filed a motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(7) and (8), arguing that the alleged conduct was not sexual in nature and, thus, not sufficient to establish a claim of sexual harassment. Although plaintiff conceded that the alleged offensive conduct was not sexual in nature, she argued that the conduct was gender-based and that allegations of gender-based harassment are also sufficient to establish a claim of sexual harassment. The circuit court granted defendants summary disposition, concluding that plaintiff had failed to plead three of the five necessary elements to establish a prima facie case of hostile work environment based on sexual harassment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, it concluded that plaintiff had failed to plead that Rich was subjected to unwelcome sexual conduct or communication; that the unwelcome sexual conduct or communication was intended to, or, in fact, did, substantially interfere with Rich\u2019s employment or create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment; and respondeat superior.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>The Court of Appeals reversed the circuit court\u2019s order granting summary disposition for defendants. The Court relied on <em>Koester v Novi, </em>458 Mich 1; 580 NW2d 835 (1998), which held that allegations of gender-based harassment can establish a claim of sexual harassment under the CRA. Defendants, the state of Michigan and the Michigan Department of State Police, applied for leave to appeal to this Court, which we granted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">H. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\u201cThe decision to grant or deny summary disposition is a question of law that is reviewed de novo.\u201d <em>Veenstra v Washtenaw Country Club, </em>466 Mich 155, 159; 645 NW2d 643 (2002). Also reviewed de novo are questions of statutory interpretation, such as the question at issue here \u2014 whether harassment that is not sexual in nature, but is gender-based, is sufficient to establish a claim of sexual harassment under the cra. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">The cra, MCL 37.2202(1), provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>An employer shall not do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-4\">(a) Fail or refuse to hire or recruit, discharge, or otherwise discriminate against an individual with respect to employment, compensation, or a term, condition, or privilege of employment, because of religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight, or marital status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Accordingly, it is unlawful for employers to discriminate against an individual with respect to a condition of employment because of sex. The cra, MCL 37.2103(i), further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">Discrimination because of sex includes sexual harassment. Sexual harassment means unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature under the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">(i) Submission to the conduct or communication is made a term or condition either explicitly or implicitly to obtain employment, public accommodations or public services, education, or housing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-8\">(ii) Submission to or rejection of the conduct or communication by an individual is used as a factor in decisions affecting the individual\u2019s employment, public accommodations or public services, education, or housing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">(iii) The conduct or communication has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual\u2019s employment, public accommodations or public services, education, or housing, or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive employment, public accommodations, public services, educational, or housing environment.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">Plaintiff alleges that the conduct in this case violated subsection iii by creating a hostile work environment. To establish a prima facie case of hostile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>work environment based on sexual harassment, plaintiff must show the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">(1) the employee belonged to a protected group;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">(2) the employee was subjected to communication or conduct on the basis of sex;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">(3) the employee was subjected to unwelcome sexual conduct or communication;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">(4) the unwelcome sexual conduct or communication was intended to or in fact did substantially interfere with the employee\u2019s employment or created an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-10\">(5) respondeat superior. <em>[Radtke v Everett, </em>442 Mich 368, 382-383; 501 NW2d 155 (1993); see also <em>Chambers v Trettco, Inc, </em>463 Mich 297, 311; 614 NW2d 910 (2000).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">The first element is easily met because \u201call employees are inherently members of a protected class in hostile work environment cases because all persons may be discriminated against on the basis of sex.\u201d <em>Radtke, supra </em>at 383. In this case, plaintiff meets the first element because Rich was <em>an </em>employee who was allegedly discriminated against on the basis of sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">This Court concluded that, in order to meet the second element, a plaintiff need not show that the conduct at issue was sexual in nature; rather, a plaintiff need only show that \u201c \u2018but for the fact of her sex, she would not have been the object of harassment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). This second element is derived from the language of MCL 37.2202(1), which prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee \u201cbecause of\u201d sex. Obviously, an employer cannot be said to have discriminated against an employee \u201cbecause of\u201d sex unless, but for the fact of the employee\u2019s sex, the employer would not have discriminated against the employee. In this case, plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>alleges that Findsen sexually harassed Rich by making hostile and offensive comments about her gender. Accordingly, plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that, but for the fact of Rich\u2019s sex, she would not have been the object of harassment, and thus plaintiff meets the second element.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">However, in order to recover for sexual harassment, plaintiff must not only show that the employee was discriminated against because of sex, she must also show that the employee was \u201csubjected to unwelcome sexual conduct or communication.\u201d <em>Radtke, supra </em>at 382. This third element is derived from MCL 37.2103(i), which provides that \u201c[s]exual harassment means unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature . ...\u201d In this case, plaintiff concedes that there were no \u201cunwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, [or] other verbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature . . . .\u201d Plaintiff argues, instead, that the communication was gender-based and that this type of communication can also constitute sexual harassment, pursuant to <em>Koester.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">In <em>Koester, supra </em>at 10, this Court, in a four-to-three decision, concluded that \u201charassment on the basis of a woman\u2019s pregnancy is sexual harassment.\u201d Again, the CRA, MCL 37.2202(1), prohibits employers from discriminating against individuals on the basis of sex with respect to a condition of employment. The CRA, MCL 37.2201(d), further provides that \u201c \u2018[s]ex\u2019 includes, but is not limited to, pregnancy . . . .\u201d Accordingly, discrimination because of a woman\u2019s pregnancy is a form of discrimination because of sex. However, it is obviously not the only type of discrimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>nation because of sex under the CRA. MCL 37.2103(f) also provides that \u201c[discrimination because of sex includes sexual harassment.\u201d Accordingly, sexual harassment is another type of discrimination because of sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Although <em>Koester, supra </em>at 11, correctly recognized that \u201cdiscrimination on the basis of a woman\u2019s pregnancy and sexual harassment are \u2018two subsets of sex discrimination,\u2019 \u201d it incorrectly concluded, in our judgment, that \u201charassment on the basis of a woman\u2019s pregnancy is sexual harassment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10. Even assuming that <em>harassment </em>based on pregnancy may constitute <em>discrimination </em>based on pregnancy, and thus sex discrimination, harassment based on pregnancy that is not at all sexual in nature simply is not sexual harassment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That is, although harassment based on pregnancy and sexual harassment <em>may </em>both constitute sex discrimination, they clearly do not both constitute sexual harassment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Pregnancy discrimination is sex discrimination, but it is not sexual harassment. In order to prove pregnancy discrimination, one must show that the employer discriminated against the employee on the basis of a pregnancy. However, in order for one to prove sexual harassment, one must show that there was either \u201cunwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, [or] other verbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> MCL 37.2103(f). Accordingly, pregnancy discrimination and sexual harassment consist of substantially different elements, and thus a person asserting a claim of sexual harassment must prove something considerably different from a person asserting a claim of pregnancy discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">Further, although article two of the CRA, MCL 37.2201(d), defines \u201csex\u201d to include pregnancy, the Supreme Court in <em>Koester </em>erred in applying this definition of \u201csex\u201d to the definition of \u201csexual harassment\u201d found in article one of the CRA, MCL 37.2103(i). <em>Koester </em>stated, \u201cto say that comments of a \u2018sexual nature\u2019 do not include comments about a woman\u2019s pregnancy ignores the specific definition of sex as contained in the act.\u201d <em>Koester, </em>458 Mich 10-11. However, the definition of \u201csex\u201d found in article two, which includes pregnancy, is preceded by the lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>guage, \u201cAs used in this <em>article </em>. <em>. . </em>.\u201d MCL 37.2201 (emphasis added). Therefore, this definition of <em>\u201csex\u201d </em>is only applicable to article two. That is, although \u201csex\u201d includes pregnancy for the purposes of article two, \u201csex\u201d does not include pregnancy for the purposes of article one, the article at issue here. Accordingly, the <em>Koester </em>Court erred in applying article two\u2019s definition of \u201csex\u201d to the definition of \u201csexual harassment\u201d found in article one.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">To recapitulate, the CRA, MCL 37.2202(l)(a), prohibits employment discrimination because of sex. The cra, MCL 37.2201(d), defines \u201csex\u201d to include pregnancy. Therefore, by concluding that harassment based on pregnancy is sexual harassment, the <em>Koester </em>Court also concluded that harassment based on <em>gender </em>is <em>sexual </em>harassment, even though such harassment is not at all of a <em>sexual </em>nature. However, the CRA, MCL 37.2103(i), defines \u201csexual harassment\u201d as \u201cunwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature . ...\u201d It is clear from this definition of sexual harassment that only conduct or communication that is sexual in nature can constitute sexual harassment, and thus conduct or communication that is gender-based, but that is not sexual in nature, cannot constitute sexual harassment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, we overrule <em>Koester </em>to the extent that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>concludes that harassment based on gender that is not at all sexual in nature constitutes sexual harassment under the cra.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">The CRA, MCL 37.2103(i), clearly defines a hostile-work-environment claim based on sexual harassment as one involving \u201cunwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, [or] other verbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature . ...\u201d In this case, plaintiff concedes that there were no \u201cunwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, [or] other verbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>plaintiff clearly has not established a claim of sexual harassment under the CRA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>[U]nlike the general language of title VII, the CRA specifically defines \u201csexual harassment\u201d as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature. The Legislature\u2019s choice of language forecloses our reliance on title VII precedents to interpret sexual harassment under the cra. [213 Mich App 668-669.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>IV. STARE DECISIS</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Overruling precedent must, of course, be undertaken with caution and must only be done after careful consideration of the effect of stare decisis. That is, courts must consider \u201c(a) whether the earlier decision was wrongly decided, and (b) whether overruling such decision would work an undue hardship because of reliance interests or expectations that have arisen.\u201d <em>Robertson v DaimlerChrysler Corp, </em>465 Mich 732, 757; 641 NW2d 567 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">With regard to the first inquiry, we believe, as we have already observed, that <em>Koester </em>was wrongly decided. The CRA, MCL 37.2103(i), specifically defines \u201csexual harassment\u201d as \u201cunwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature . . . .\u201d Therefore, the conclusion reached in <em>Koester </em>that gender-based harassment that is not at all sexual in nature can constitute sexual harassment is clearly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">With regard to the second inquiry, we must examine \u201cwhether the previous decision has become so embedded, so accepted, so fundamental, to everyone\u2019s expectations that to change it would produce</p>\n<p id=\"b415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>not just readjustments, but practical real-world dislocations.\u201d <em>Robinson v Detroit, </em>462 Mich 439, 466; 613 NW2d 307 (2000). We conclude that the decision in <em>Koester </em>has not become \u201cso embedded, so accepted, so fundamental\u201d within our legal system that overruling it will interfere with any legitimate reliance or expectation interests. \u201c[T]o have reliance, the knowledge must be of the sort that causes a person or entity to attempt to conform his conduct to a certain norm before the triggering event.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 467. Overruling <em>Koester </em>will not disrupt any reliance interests as neither the plaintiffs decedent nor the defendants could conceivably have relied on our decision in <em>Koester </em>to their detriment. In no respect did any of them alter conduct in an attempt to conform such conduct to our decision in <em>Koester. </em>That is, assuming that the employer here did harass the plaintiffs decedent on the basis of gender, it certainly did not do so in reliance on our decision in <em>Koester, </em>which concluded that such conduct, in fact, constituted sexual harassment under the CRA. Nor could the plaintiffs decedent here have altered her conduct in any way in detrimental reliance on Koester.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Moreover, it is hard to envision how <em>any </em>employer or employee conceivably could have altered their conduct in any way in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>detrimental reliance on <em>Koester. </em>Further, as this Court stated in <em>Robinson, supra </em>at 467:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">[I]t is well to recall in discussing reliance, when dealing with an area of the law that is statutory . . . , that it is to the words of the statute itself that a citizen first looks for guidance in directing his actions. This is the essence of the rule of law: to know in advance what the rules of society are. Thus, if the words of the statute are clear, the actor should be able to expect... that they will be carried out by all in society, including the courts. In fact, should a court confound those legitimate citizen expectations by misreading or misconstruing a statute, it is that court itself that has disrupted the reliance interest.[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Accordingly, our decision today, that gender-based harassment that is not sexual in nature does not constitute sexual harassment under the plain language of the cra, will not create any \u201cpractical real-world dislocations.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>For these reasons, we conclude that <em>Koester </em>was wrongly decided and that overruling it will not interfere with legitimate reliance or expectation interests. Accordingly, after considering the imperatives of stare decisis, we believe that it is appropriate to overrule <em>Koester </em>to the extent that it is inconsistent with our decision here today, and with the CRA, that harassment on the basis of gender that is not at all sexual in nature does not constitute sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">V. RESPONSE TO THE DISSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">First and foremost, the dissent seems to be confused about what this case is and is not about. This confusion has led the dissent to construe our opinion to mean something that it clearly does not mean. That is, the dissent repeatedly mischaracterizes our opinion as concluding that hostile-work-environment actions are limited to claims of a sexual nature. At no point in this opinion do we draw such a conclusion. Rather, the only conclusion that we reach is the unremarkable one that, because the CRA specifically defines sexual harassment as \u201cconduct or communication of a sexual nature,\u201d MCL 37.2103(i), in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>establish a hostile-work-environment case based on sexual harassment, a plaintiff must show that the conduct complained of was sexual in nature. That is sexual harassment means <em>sexual </em>harassment. The dissent would construe sexual harassment to mean harassment of any kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">The dissent argues that we should reach this conclusion because, since an employer cannot discriminate against an employee on the basis of gender, MCL 37.2202(l)(a), it necessarily follows that \u201can employer may not turn a blind eye to conduct that creates a hostile work atmosphere,\u201d <em>post </em>at 328, on the basis of gender. However, we do not even address the substance of this argument because plaintiffs only allegation here is that the employee was <em>sexually </em>harassed and that this sexual harassment created a hostile work environment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Therefore, the only issue before us is whether plaintiff has established a prima facie case of <em>sexual </em>harassment. Accordingly, there is no need for us to reach out and address whether the cra recognizes a claim for hostile work environment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>based on anything other than sexual harassment.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See n 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">Further, we disagree with the dissent\u2019s assertion that this Court is somehow bound to interpret Michigan\u2019s Civil Rights Act in accordance with the federal courts\u2019 interpretation of the federal civil rights act. See n 11. Even if, as the dissent states, the Michigan Legislature relied heavily on the federal civil rights act in drafting Michigan\u2019s Civil Rights Act, the Michigan Legislature was clearly not bound by the federal civil rights act. That is, the Michigan Legislature was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>free to adopt a civil rights act that differed from the federal civil rights act, and although, as the dissent points out, there are many similarities between the two acts, the Michigan Legislature did, in fact, choose to adopt an act that is different from the federal act. Despite the dissent\u2019s determination not to allow them to do so, the Michigan Legislature is allowed to determine for itself the extent to which it wishes to track the language of the federal law. In particular, Michigan\u2019s Civil Rights Act is different from the federal civil rights act with regard to its treatment of sexual harassment. The dissent fails to respect this difference and, instead, concludes that because these acts are nearly identical they must be construed to mean exactly the same thing. We cannot agree that any time the Michigan Legislature creates a law that is \u201csimilar\u201d to a federal law, it must be made identical, and the two laws must be interpreted to mean exactly the same thing.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Title VII of the federal civil rights act, like the Michigan Civil Rights Act, prohibits discrimination because of sex. However, unlike our civil rights act, title VII does not specifically prohibit and define \u201csexual harassment.\u201d Our civil rights act specifically defines \u201csexual harassment\u201d as \u201cconduct or communication of a sexual nature . . . .\u201d MCL 37.2103(f). Title VII, on the other hand, simply prohibits discrimination because of sex and the federal courts have construed this to include sexual harassment. <em>Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v Vinson, </em>477 US 57, 66-67; 106 S Ct 2399; 91 L Ed 2d 49 (1986). That is, \u201cfederal case law has created a cause of action for sexual harassment under the general prohibition against gender discrimination,\u201d <em>Koester, </em>213 Mich App 668, while, the Michigan Legislature has specifically created a cause of action for both sex discrimination and sexual harassment.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The CRA prohibits sexual harassment, which is defined in that act as \u201cunwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature . . . .\u201d MCL 37.2103(f). Accordingly, conduct or communication that is gender-based, but is not sexual in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>nature, does not constitute \u201csexual harassment\u201d as that term is defined in the CRA. Therefore, in this case, where plaintiff concedes that the communication was not sexual in nature, but contends that it was gender-based, plaintiff has not set forth a claim of sexual harassment under the cra.

Further, at the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition, plaintiff\u2019s counsel specifically stated that the alleged harassment was <em>not </em>sexual in nature. The dissent mistakenly looks to plaintiffs motion for reconsideration and its accompanying affidavits for support for its assertion that plaintiff alleged harassment of a sexual nature. The trial court denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for reconsideration and the merits of that decision are not presently before this Court.

Nor does the dissent appear to recognize that a recurrent source of disagreement between this majority and the dissent arises from the majority\u2019s determination to give meaning to the clear words of the law. A principal rationale for doing this, of course, is to limit the extent to which this Court in the future must contribute to <em>either </em>of these potential sources of legal instability.

Reviewing the text of each confirms this design. MCL 37.2202(1) of Michigan\u2019s Civil Rights Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-6\">An employer shall not do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-7\">(a) Fail or refuse to hire or recruit, discharge, or otherwise discriminate against an individual with respect to employment, compensation, or a term, condition, or privilege of employment, because of religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight, or marital status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-8\">(b) Limit, segregate, or classify an employee or applicant for employment in a way that deprives or tends to deprive the employee or applicant of an employment opportunity, or otherwise adversely affects the status of an employee or applicant because of religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight, or marital status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Similarly, the federal statute provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">(a) It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>(2) to limit, segregate, or classify Ms employees or applicants for employment in any way wMch would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportumties or otherwise adversely affect Ms status as an employee, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origm. [42 USC 2000e-2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">But for the addition of age, height, weight, and marital status as prohibited grounds of discrimination, as well as a few minor drafting variations, MCL 37.2202(1) and 42 USC 2000e-2 would be identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">As with any statute subject to judicial review, our courts have developed rules that articulate the necessary elements of statutory claims. Because Michigan\u2019s employment-discrimination statute so closely mirrors federal law, we often rely on federal precedent for guidance. See <em>Radtke v Everett, </em>442 Mich 368, 381-382; 501 NW2d 155 (1993), quoting <em>Sumner v Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co, </em>427 Mich 505, 525; 398 NW2d 368 (1986) (\u201cWhile this Court is not compelled to follow federal precedent or guidelines in interpreting Michigan law, this Court may, \u2018as we have done in the past in discrimination cases, turn to federal precedent for guidance in reaching our decision.\u2019 \u201d). As a result, employment-discrimination actions under state law are nearly identical to federal actions. For example, our courts have recognized both disparate-treatment and disparate-impact actions identical to those articulated by the United States Supreme Court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Regrettably, the majority now departs from this sound tradition and, in doing so, makes sweeping changes to our employment-discrimination jurisprudence. Hostile-work-environment actions, available on the basis of any ground articulated in the federal statute, will now be limited to claims of a sexual nature under our state Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">By dismissing plaintiffs allegedly nonsexual hostile-work-environment action, the majority necessarily confines hostile-work-environment claims to those authorized by MCL 37.2103(i)(iii) and rejects federal precedent that recognizes hostile-work-environment actions on the basis of statutory text nearly <em>identical </em>to our own, i.e., \u00a7 2202. Although the majority has not acknowledged the effect of its holding, it is important to emphasize that the Court would not dismiss plaintiff\u2019s sex-based claim if it recognized that hostile-work-environment actions could be brought under \u00a7 2202.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Today\u2019s ruling is particularly significant because a hostile-work-environment claim is the only statutory remedy cognizable when an employee suffers pervasive and severe forms of discrimination, but experiences no tangible employment action. No longer will an employee subject to a sex-based (but not overtly sexual) hostile work environment find redress, even though an employer may fail to adequately respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">HOSTILE-WORK-ENVIRONMENT ACTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Although this Court has never before expressly analyzed the origin of nonsexual hostile-work-environment claims under our Civil Rights Act, our courts have recognized that such claims may be asserted on the basis of any ground enumerated in Michigan\u2019s Civil Rights Act in MCL 37.2202. <em>Malan v Gen </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number><em>Dynamics Land Sys, Inc, </em>212 Mich App 585, 587; 538 NW2d 76 (1995) (holding that a hostile-work-environment claim is actionable on the basis of any one of the enumerated classifications in MCL 37.2202), citing <em>Rasheed v Chrysler Corp, </em>445 Mich 109; 517 NW2d 19 (1994) (religion-based harassment from coworkers and supervisors); <em>Sumner, supra </em>at 538 (race-based harassment from supervisors as a continuing violation); <em>Meek v Michigan Bell Co, </em>193 Mich App 340, 342-343; 483 NW2d 407 (1992) (sex-based and religion-based harassment from supervisors); see also <em>Jackson v Quanex Corp, </em>191 F3d 647 (CA 6, 1999) (recognizing race-based, hostile-environment action under the Civil Rights Act); <em>Downey v Charlevoix Co Bd of Rd Comm\u2019rs, </em>227 Mich App 621; 576 NW2d 712 (1998) (recognizing disability-based, hostile-work-environment action). These rulings both identify and effectuate our Legislature\u2019s intent to prohibit prejudicial discrimination in the employment realm.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">Lamentably, the majority now eviscerates Michigan\u2019s hostile-work-environment jurisprudence with a perfunctory textual analysis that misconstrues our Legislature\u2019s intent. To clarify the errors present in the majority\u2019s reasoning, I will examine the text of the statute in light of its history and context.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">MCL 37.2202</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The broad language of Michigan\u2019s Civil Rights Act expressly prohibits acts that \u201cdiscriminate against an individual with respect to employment, compensation, or a term, condition, or privilege of employment . . . .\u201d MCL 37.2202(l)(a). Neither may an employer \u201c[l]imit, segregate, or classify an employee ... in a way that deprives or tends to deprive the employee ... of an employment opportunity, or otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>adversely affects the status of an employee . . . MCL 37.2202(l)(b). This mandate prohibits employment conditions that are likely to deprive an employee of an opportunity or negatively affect her employment status. In other words, an employer may not turn a blind eye to conduct that creates a hostile work atmosphere on the grounds enumerated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The United States Supreme Court has interpreted the analogous federal statute \u2014 containing language nearly identical to MCL 37.2202 of our Civil Rights Act \u2014 and has concluded that its text supports hostile-work-environment claims on the basis of any ground enumerated in 42 USC 2000e-2. According to that Court, the prohibition on discrimination \u201cis not limited to \u2018economic\u2019 or \u2018tangible\u2019 discrimination.\u201d <em>Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v Vinson, </em>477 US 57, 64; 106 S Ct 2399; 91 L Ed 2d 49 (1986). \u201cThe phrase \u2018terms, conditions, or privileges of employment\u2019 evinces a congressional intent \u2018to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women,\u2019 \u201d and extends to all forms of discrimination prohibited by the federal statute. <em>Meritor, supra </em>at 64, and at 66, citing <em>Firefighters Institute for Racial Equality v St Louis, </em>549 F2d 506 (CA 8, 1977) (race); <em>Compston v Borden, Inc, </em>424 F Supp 157 (SD Ohio, 1976) (religion); and <em>Cariddi v Kansas City Chiefs Football Club, </em>568 F2d 87, 88 (CA 8, 1977) (national origin).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">The phrase terms, conditions or privileges of employment in [title VII] is an expansive concept which sweeps within its protective ambit the practice of creating a working environment heavily charged with ethnic or racial discrimination ....

Instead of acknowledging our identical legislative directive in \u00a7 2202, which imposes no economic-loss requirement, the majority ignores its relevance and focuses exclusively on subsection 2103(i), which simply clarifies that sex discrimination includes sexual harassment. While I agree that subsection 2103(i) clarifies which forms of sexual harassment are prohibited, it does not narrow MCL 37.2202, which outlaws employer-sanctioned work environments hostile to employees on the basis of, inter alia, sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">MCL 37.2103(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The majority rejects my interpretation because MCL 37.2103(i) expressly authorizes sexual-harassment, hostile-work-environment claims, while the federal statute contains no similar statutory counterpart. Apparently, the majority assumes the legislative directive with regard to sexual harassment in subsection 2103(i) precludes hostile-environment claims on other bases, i.e., if our Legislature had wanted to prohibit work environments inhospitable to employees on the basis of, inter alia, race, religion, or sex, it would have stated as much. However, this often disfavored canon of negative implication is less than persuasive, particularly when the origin of MCL 37.2103(1) is understood in context.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>As the text indicates, our Legislature enacted 1980 PA 202, later codified as MCL 37.2103(f), to clarify that sexual harassment was, indeed, prohibited by Michigan\u2019s Civil Rights Act. In drafting the text, the Legislature relied heavily on language used by the federal agency charged with enforcing the federal employment rights act, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">As originally enacted, 29 CFR 1604.11 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">(a) Harassment on the basis of sex is a violation of Sec. 703 of Title VII.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">(1) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual\u2019s employment,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-10\">(2) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-11\">(3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual\u2019s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-12\">Our statute is nearly identical. MCL 37.2103(f) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-13\">Discrimination because of sex includes sexual harassment. Sexual harassment means unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature under the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-14\">(i) Submission to the conduct or communication is made a term or condition either explicitly or implicitly to obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>employment, public accommodations or public services, education, or housing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-4\">(ii) Submission to or rejection of the conduct or communication by an individual is used as a factor in decisions affecting the individual\u2019s employment, public accommodations or public services, education, or housing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-5\">(iii) The conduct or communication has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual\u2019s employment, public accommodations or public services, education, or housing, or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive employment, public accommodations, public services, educational, or housing environment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">By codifying the federal guidelines, our Legislature merely clarified that the sexual-harassment protections in the federal statutes were analogous in scope to those in Michigan\u2019s Civil Rights Act. Both those lobbying for and against the bill agreed that harassment cases in general \u2014 and sexual-harassment cases in particular \u2014 could be brought under the current statute. House Analysis, HB 4407 (August 15, 1980). In fact, opponents of the bill argued the amendment might cause confusion within the judicial branch:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">The civil rights act\u2019s coverage of sexual harassment should not be changed as proposed by the bill. The act currently covers sexual harassment in the same manner as it is covered by the federal government in Title VII cases. That is, sexual harassment is covered under the general language prohibiting sexual discrimination. There has been a series of administrative and judicial cases clearly enunciating the appropriateness of this coverage, and it is feared that future anti-sexual harassment court decisions based on federal provisions and precedents would not be applicable or have a significant impact on Michigan if this state was prohibiting sexual harassment under different statutory language than used on the federal level. <em>[Id. </em>at 3.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>While acknowledging this concern, those in favor of the provision felt that the amendment was \u201cnecessary to \u2018motivate\u2019 the [Michigan Department of Civil Rights] to treat sexual harassment as a bona fide civil rights violation . ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. Before this enactment, the Department of Civil Rights often refused to pursue sexual-harassment claims unless the victim was also a member of a minority group. <em>Id. </em>Forebodingly, members of the Legislature worried that, with the addition of MCL 37.2103(i), the Michigan judiciary might reject the utility of federal precedent in nonsexual hostile-work-environment actions even though clearly authorized by MCL 37.2202(1). Unfortunately, this fear has come to pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The majority would reject my construction, claiming it gives limited meaning to 1980 PA 202. After all, if the Civil Rights Act already prohibited discriminatory and hostile work environments, 1980 PA 202 added little. Adding little, however, does not mean adding nothing. As noted in the House Bill Analysis, the enactment did <em>clarify </em>that sexual harassment was prohibited. This affirmation was necessary in light of the number of federal district court decisions that refused to acknowledge that quid pro quo sexual harassment constituted discrimination based on sex. See <em>Miller v Bank of America, </em>418 F Supp 233, 234 (ND Cal, 1976) (\u201cessentially the isolated and unauthorized sex misconduct of one employee to another\u201d not recognizable under title VII), rev\u2019d <em>Miller v Bank of America, </em>600 F2d 211 (CA 9, 1979) (finding as a matter of law that conduct of a sexual nature constituted discrimination based on sex). Because the Michigan Department of Civil Rights, which was responsible for enforcing the act, all but refused to pursue such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>claims, our Legislature could not leave it to the agency to address the issue as Congress could. Viewed in context, one has little doubt that 1980 PA 202 served a significant purpose, even if it merely reiterated the scope of protections afforded by the Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">Moreover, any alleged redundancy under my interpretation of MCL 37.2103(i)(iii) is also present in the majority\u2019s interpretation of subsections 2103(i)(i) and 2103(i)(ii) (often referred to as quid pro quo harassment). Unless the majority would construe the discrimination ban in employment (MCL 37.2202), public accommodations (MCL 37.2302), and education (MCL 37.2402) in a manner that would otherwise permit unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, then it must agree that subsection 2103(i) merely clarified what the Civil Rights Act had already proscribed. To now construe MCL 37.2103(1) in a fashion that limits the scope of protections present throughout the act ignores both its specific text and overall structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Although, on occasion, I have agreed with earlier holdings that note that Michigan\u2019s sexual-harassment doctrine has a specific statutory basis in contrast to its federal statutory counterpart,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> I find no legitimate reason to conclude that hostile-work-environment claims should be limited to incidents of harassment that are sexual in nature. The plain text of the Michigan Civil Rights Act requires this interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The majority\u2019s failure to acknowledge the effect of its decision is quite unfortunate. If plaintiff\u2019s gender-based hostile-work-environment claim must be dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>missed because it is not of an overtly \u201csexual\u201d nature, then work environments inimical to a reasonable person on the basis of religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex (inasmuch as it refers to \u201cgender-based\u201d discrimination), height, weight, or marital status are no longer actionable. This interpretation cannot be rationally construed from the text of Michigan\u2019s Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">STAKE DECISIS</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">In its hasty attempt to explain Michigan\u2019s civil-rights jurisprudence, the majority continues by overruling <em>Koester v Novi, </em>458 Mich 1; 580 NW2d 835 (1998), and clarifying that pregnancy, though not at issue here, is not of a sexual nature. However, as I indicated in the <em>Koester </em>majority opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">Under [that] reasoning, claims of racial harassment would also fail (despite being recognized by the federal courts), because the act prohibits racial \u201cdiscrimination\u201d not \u201cracial harassment.\u201d This interpretation defies logic. See <em>Harrison v Metropolitan Gov\u2019t of Nashville &amp; Davidson Co, </em>80 F3d 1107 (CA 6, 1996), and <em>Snell v Suffolk Co, </em>782 F2d 1094 (CA 2, 1986) (allowing a claim for racial harassment). <em>[Koester, supra </em>at 11 n 3.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">The majority purportedly justifies this shift by attempting to clearly mark the boundaries of all things \u201csexual.\u201d In narrowly defining subsection 2103(i), the Court attempts to foreclose actions previously recognized on the basis of, inter alia, race, \u201cgender,\u201d national origin, or religion. No longer may victims of discrimination assert hostile-work-environment claims unless the activity at issue is \u201csexual\u201d in nature. This sweeping change is a direct result of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>majority\u2019s rejection of <em>Koester. </em>Though the majority opinion belies the significance of this shift, Justice Taylor clarified the stakes at oral argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-4\"><em>Justice Taylor-. </em>Wouldn\u2019t the distinction between these two causes of action be that in the case of discrimination the employee has to endure certain kinds of unpleasant remarks until such time as there is an adverse job action of some kind. In the case of sexual harassment that isn\u2019t true. The person who is the victim of that only need prove that there has been a substantial interference with the employee\u2019s employment or that this is creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\"><em>[Attorney for Plaintiff: </em>I would agree with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\"><em>Justice Taylor: </em>Isn\u2019t that the great sort of overarching sort of written in neon understanding of this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\"><em>[Attorney for Plaintiff: </em>I would agree with that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">Although a majority now claims that overruling <em>Koester </em>would work no \u201cundue hardship because of reliance interests or expectations that have arisen,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 314, I suspect few advocates in plaintiffs\u2019 bar would agree. <em>Robertson v DaimlerChrysler Corp, </em>465 Mich 732, 757 (2002). Moreover, the contention that overruling <em>Koester </em>would produce no \u201creal-world dislocations,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 316, ignores the effect on this particular plaintiff, and any plaintiff with a pending hostile-environment claim that is not specifically sexual in nature. To claim that \u201cit is hard to envision how <em>any </em>employer or employee conceivably could have altered their conduct in any way in detrimental reliance on Koester\u201d ignores the instability that results from this Court\u2019s weak adherence to the principle of stare decisis. <em>Ante </em>at 315-316 (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>To summarize, the majority overrules precedent and rejects plaintiff\u2019s claim because our Legislature did not specifically articulate the parameters of hostile-work-environment claims for conduct not overtly sexual in nature. In doing so, the Court relies on a rather weak canon of negative implication<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and ignores the plain text of MCL 37.2202, which does not require an economic injury. The Court also dismisses our Legislature\u2019s intention to mimic the scope of protections afforded by federal antidiscrimination law, as evident in the textual similarities of MCL 37.2202 and 42 USC 2000e-2. Finally, in a most ironic twist, the majority overrules <em>Koester </em>under the guise of its respect for the rule of law, i.e, statutory meaning should be predictable, accessible, and neutrally applied. In light of the text employed by our Legislature, which indicates a desire to extend protections parallel in scope with federal law, our Court\u2019s reliance on federal precedent for guidance, and this Court\u2019s precedent in <em>Koester, </em>I cannot agree that the major<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>ity\u2019s interpretation furthers either our Legislature\u2019s intent or the rule of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">SEXUAL HARASSMENT INCLUDES GENDER-BASED DISCRIMINATION</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Though unnecessary to clarify the availability of \u201cgender-based\u201d hostile-work-environment claims for the reasons stated above, it is worth noting that the plain text of subsection 2103(i) alone permits gender-based claims. When \u201cverbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature\u201d is made a condition of or substantially interferes with, inter alia, employment, the conduct is proscribed. <em>Id. </em>This prohibition was enacted not because all things sexual are inherently discriminatory when targeted at an individual on the basis of her sex, but because sexual conduct that exploits our socially constructed concepts of gender perpetuates unlawful discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Our courts have recognized that conduct of a \u201csexual\u201d nature is not prohibited simply because it is \u201cof or pertaining to sex or the attribute of being either male or female\u201d or \u201cexisting or predicated with regard to sex.\u201d <em>Oxford English Dictionary </em>(2d ed). Rather, unwelcome sexual conduct is prohibited because it risks exploiting gender-based inequality.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As noted in Radtke:</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>[S]exual harassment is prohibited in the workplace because it violates civil liberty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-4\">\u201cSexual harassment should be explicitly . . . prohibited because it is a demeaning, degrading, and coercive activity directed at persons on the basis of their sex, the continuation of which is often contingent on the harasser\u2019s economic control over the person being harassed. It should be outlawed because it violates basic human rights of privacy, freedom, sexual integrity and personal security.\u201d <em>[Radtke, supra </em>at 380-381, quoting House Bill Analysis 4407 (August 15, 1980).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Just five years ago, in <em>Koester, </em>this Court acknowledged that harassing conduct need not be specifically motivated by sexual desire to support an inference of discrimination.

Ultimately, the reader will judge the accuracy of that accusation. Nevertheless, I believe a certain degree of clarification is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The majority claims that plaintiff only alleged a sexual-harassment claim and, therefore, \u201cthere is no need for [it] to reach out and address whether the CRA recognizes a claim for hostile work environment based on anything other than sexual harassment.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 318-319. However, this position disregards the allegations articulated in plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Plaintiff claimed the conduct of defendant\u2019s employees, \u201cin sexually harassing [d]ecedent Rich, constitutes sexual <em>discrimination </em>in violation of MCL 37.2101 . . . <em>et seq.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Plaintiff stated that the \u201charassment included, but was not limited to, frequent comments regarding [d]ecedent Rich\u2019s gender, weight and ability as a Capitol Security Officer\u201d and, \u201con many occasions, [Findsen] made hostile and offensive comments to [d]ecedent Rich regarding her sex, weight and ability as a Capitol Security Officer.\u201d Though the majority cannot dispute \u201csex discrimination,\u201d as proscribed by MCL 37.2202(1), has been alleged, it apparently presumes that plaintiff seeks recovery only under a narrow subcategory of \u201csex discrimination,\u201d i.e., sexual harassment as defined by MCL 37.2103(i)(iii)- The majority claims that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>assumption justifies its refusal to entertain a hostile-work-environment claim based on sex, which includes gender.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Unfortunately, this interpretation deprives plaintiff of a fair and honest reading of the complaint and altogether ignores plaintiffs position, as repeatedly documented in her briefs to the circuit court, the Court of Appeals, and this Court. Plaintiff noted that both federal and Michigan courts \u201care increasingly recognizing claims for workplace harassment that go beyond traditional sexual harassment cases.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> To support this claim, plaintiffs counsel cited Michigan precedent holding \u201cthat harassment based on any one of the enumerated classifications [in MCL 37.2202] is an actionable offense.\u201d See n 11, each citing <em>Malan v General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc, </em>212 Mich App 585; 538 NW2d 76 (1995). I am unable to identify what more plaintiff\u2019s counsel could have pleaded or argued in the written submissions to clarify plaintiff\u2019s theory for the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Perhaps because the written submissions are adequate to establish plaintiffs claim, the majority attempts to support its narrow interpretation by shifting the focus to counsel\u2019s comments at oral argument. <em>Ante </em>at 318 n 17. Justice Markman queried plaintiff\u2019s counsel, asking him whether he agreed with defense counsel that \u201call of [plaintiff\u2019s] eggs in this case are in the sexual harassment basket and that sexual discrimination other than sexual harassment hasn\u2019t been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>pleaded here.\u201d Plaintiffs counsel, Mr. Boog, responded.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-4\"><em>Mr. Boog: </em>We haven\u2019t been given an opportunity to plead that because we could not amend our complaint but at the time we did this it was considered a sexual harassment based on gender based on federal decisions that came down at that time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Justice Taylor continued this line of questioning.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\"><em>Justice Taylor: </em>Now, that being the case, you are attempting to come under the sexual harassment, is that right</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\"><em>Mr. Boog: </em>Yes, but with the understanding that I don\u2019t believe the statutory language excludes other types of sexual harassment besides what\u2019s in Section 103 and 104, the definitions that we\u2019ve talked about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-9\"><em>Justice Taylor: </em>You\u2019re not trying to suggest that the activity here fell within the section 103 definition of sex harassment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-10\"><em>Mr. Boog: </em>Yes I do your honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">When viewed in context, this exchange clarifies that plaintiff alleged a gender- or sex-harassment claim based on MCL 37.2202(1) and MCL 37.2103(i). As noted above, plaintiff\u2019s counsel consistently relied on <em>Malan, </em>which interpreted MCL 37.2202(1) in light of federal precedent. Counsel\u2019s response to Justice Markman concerning federal precedent clarified plaintiff\u2019s MCL 37.2202(1) gender-based harassment theory, in light of the fact that the circuit court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition concerning the sexual-harassment claim, thereby precluding an amendment to the complaint that would have ciar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>ified the overtly sexual nature of some of the conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">In addition, before the Court of Appeals issued plaintiffs judgment, this Court issued <em>Koester, </em>which held that harassment as proscribed by MCL 37.2103(i)(iii) need not be overtly sexual in nature. Not wanting to minimize the value of <em>Koester </em>(and unaware that a majority of this Court intended to overrule it), plaintiffs counsel clarified that he did, in fact, allege a violation under MCL 37.2103(i) (iii) when asked by Justice Taylor. The clarification, however, does not negate plaintiffs continued reliance on MCL 37.2202(1) or <em>Matan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Nor can the majority rely on plaintiffs use of \u201csexual harassment\u201d rather than \u201cgender harassment\u201d to artificially narrow the scope of plaintiffs claim. Plaintiffs counsel did allege harassment of a sexual nature, providing specific proof of unwanted sexual communication in the motion for reconsideration submitted to the circuit court.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Hence, the reference to MCL 37.2103(i)(iii) was not made simply as an attempt to equate gender-based conduct with conduct of a sexual nature \u2014 although the concepts are, at times, used interchangeably by the bench and bar. Rather, plaintiffs counsel employed the term that best described the behavior to which plaintiff was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>subjected, while also drawing upon the protections afforded by MCL 37.2202(1) and <em>Malan, supra, </em>in support of a hostile-environment claim not purely sexual in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">In response, the majority might claim a narrow reading of plaintiff\u2019s briefs is required because plaintiff did not specifically establish that \u201csevere and pervasive harassment\u201d could constitute \u201cdiscrimination.\u201d Assuming this is an accurate reflection of the majority\u2019s position, the Court apparently does not find it self-evident that repeated exposure to derisive insults could constitute discrimination \u2014 even if unaccompanied by a \u201ctangible employment action.\u201d Hence, with the issuance of this opinion, no longer will a victim of repeated racist, sexist, or otherwise offensive conduct be permitted to bring a claim against a remiss employer unless the victim has also been the target of a tangible employment action or behavior of a sexual nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">In sum, the majority unfairly neglects plaintiff\u2019s arguments and attempts to ignore the difficult and inescapable issue presented by this case, i.e., whether hostile-work-environment actions may be alleged on the basis of nonsexual conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">One wonders what the majority gains by adhering to an artificially constrained reading of plaintiff\u2019s theory of the case. If done in an attempt to respect its role as a mere interpreter of legislative intent, its decision today has the opposite result, ignoring the text-based evidence that our Civil Rights Act was intended to provide \u2014 at a minimum \u2014 those protections afforded by federal law, in favor of a stilted inteipretation arguably motivated by policy considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"AJi\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">As acknowledged by the majority, plaintiff alleged that her decedent suffered a hostile work environment because of her status as a woman. She maintained that the decedent was subjected to severe and pervasive conduct because of her gender. The decedent\u2019s employer purportedly did not resolve the issues or adequately respond to her complaints. These allegations of harassment, motivated by sex-based animus, are sufficient to withstand a motion for summary disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Because the text of MCL 37.2202(1) indicates our Legislature\u2019s intent to track the scope of protections provided by federal law, and because federal law recognizes hostile-work-environment claims on any ground articulated in 42 USC 2000e-2, <em>Meritor, supra, </em>it is proper to conclude that Michigan employees share the right to assert hostile-work-environment claims on the basis of any ground articulated in MCL 37.2202(1). The text of Michigan\u2019s Civil Rights Act cannot reasonably be construed to permit work environments hostile to an employee\u2019s religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight, or marital status. Further, sexual harassment is not limited to conduct of a strictly sexual nature. For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. Any other interpretation violates fundamental principles of equality.</p>\n<judges id=\"b444-8\">Kelly, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-8\"> Joint Appendix, p 19a (para 31), citing MCL 37.2101.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b423-9\"> Brief in Support of Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Rehearing and Reconsideration, filed May 5, 1998, in the Ingham Circuit Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b423-10\"> Perreault Affidavit, paragraphs 5, 10, p 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b423-11\"> See attachment to plaintiffs motion for reconsideration, filed May 5, 1998.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b423-12\"> <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b425-6\"> See <em>Lytle v Malady (On Rehearing), </em>458 Mich 153, 173 n 19; 579 NW2d 906 (1998), citing <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp v Green, </em>411 US 792; 93 S Ct 1817; 36 L Ed 2d 668 (1973) (observing that Michigan adopted the four-part disparate-treatment proof from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test to prove a prima facie case of discrimination); <em>Smith v Consolidated Rail Corp, </em>168 Mich App 773, 776; 425 NW2d 220 (1988), citing <em>Albemarle Paper Co v Moody, </em>422 US 405, 425; 95 S Ct 2362; 45 L Ed 2d 280 (1975) (articulating disparate-impact action as prescribed by the Supreme Court).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b430-15\"> The principles involved here continue to apply to race, color, religion or national origin.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b433-7\"> See <em>Chambers v Trettco, Inc, </em>463 Mich 297; 614 NW2d 910 (2000); <em>Quinto v Cross &amp; Peters Co, </em>451 Mich 358; 547 NW2d 314 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b435-9\"> To reassure its audience that overruling <em>Koester </em>is appropriate, the majority quotes from Justice Young\u2019s dialogue with plaintiffs counsel at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>oral argument. <em>Ante </em>at 316-317 n 16. However, simply because counsel agreed that rejecting <em>Koester </em>would produce no \u201cpractical real-world dislocations . . . .\u201d, it is important to note that only those employers subject to the federal statutes will be forced to adhere to the higher standards. Moreover, while employment handbooks provide useful indicators of employers\u2019 policies, few harassing work environments are officially condoned. More often, employers or their supervisors simply fail to respond adequately to harassment from coworkers, as alleged by plaintiff in this case. Therefore, although responsive to Justice Young\u2019s inquiry, I find little solace in counsel\u2019s claim that he would recommend employers retain their current employment policies \u2014 in spite of their decreased liability pursuant to this decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b436-7\"> Eskridge, Frickey, &amp; Garrett, <em>Legislation and Statutory Interpretation, </em>(Foundation Press: New York, 2000) p 256 (\u201cDescriptively, people do not necessarily intend their list of directed activities to be comprehensive ones or even think through all the permutations to which their directives might be applied.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b437-7\"> Legal scholars have articulated this link:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">[Wjomen are socially defined as women largely in sexual terms.
