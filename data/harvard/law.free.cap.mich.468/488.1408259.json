In <em>People v Hawkins </em>(see unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued September 28, 2001 [Docket No. 230839]), we hold that evidence of firearms and cocaine seized pursuant to a search warrant should not have been suppressed on the ground that the warrant was issued in violation of the affidavit requirements of MCL 780.653(b). In <em>People v Scherf </em>(see 251 Mich App 410; 651 NW2d 77 [2002]), we hold that evidence of marijuana seized from defendant following his arrest should not have been suppressed on the ground that the bench warrant pursuant to which he was arrested was issued in violation of the affidavit requirements of MCR 3.606(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">I. FACTUAL<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"ANxl\">A. <em>PEOPLE v HAWKINS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Detective Todd Butler of the Grand Rapids Police Department received tips from two informants that illegal controlled substances were being sold from a residence located at 921 Humbolt, S.E., in Grand Rapids. On the basis of the information provided by these sources, Butler sought a search warrant to search the residence. Butler\u2019s affidavit set forth the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>following facts in support of the issuance of the warrant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">1. Your affiant received information from an informant on 10/14/99 that the resident of 921 Humbolt S.E. was involved in the sale of narcotics. The informant stated the residence [sic] is selling the controlled substance crack cocaine. The informant described the resident and seller of the controlled substance as \u201cChris,\u201d B/M, approx. 20, 5\u20198\u201d, 170 [lbs], medium build/complexion, short hair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">2. Your affiant met with a reliable and credible informant on 11/3/99. Your affiant was advised that the informant had observed the controlled substance cocaine available for sale from the residence within the past 36 hours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">3. Your affiant was advised by the informant the entry door to the suspects [sic] apartment has been reinforced to delay a police entry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">On November 3, 1999, a judge of the 61st District Court issued the requested warrant, and the residence was searched the same day. During the search, police seized two stolen firearms, approximately 20 grams of cocaine, and other contraband. Defendant, who was not present during the search, was stopped by police while driving his vehicle. Defendant was then arrested and later bound over for trial on several charges.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">Defendant sought suppression of the evidence seized in the execution of the search warrant, arguing that the affidavit in support of the warrant was con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>stitutionally deficient in that it did not support a finding of probable cause, the information it contained was stale, and it did not clearly reveal whether one or two informants had supplied the information. Defendant additionally contended that the affidavit did not meet the requirements of MCL 780.653(B) because it did not include information concerning the credibility of the unnamed informants or the reliability of the information they supplied.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The circuit court granted defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence and dismissed the case on the grounds that the affidavit was both constitutionally deficient and in violation of MCL 780.653. The court declined the prosecutor\u2019s invitation to apply the federal \u201cgood-faith exception,\u201d under which the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule is not applicable to evidence seized by officers acting in reasonable reliance on a warrant that is subsequently adjudged constitutionally deficient.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court\u2019s order to suppress evidence on the sole basis that the affidavit supporting the search warrant did not meet the requirements of MCL 780.653. Slip op at 3. The panel concluded that <em>People v Sloan, </em>450 Mich 160; 538 NW2d 380 (1995), in which this Court held that evidence obtained under a search warrant issued in violation of \u00a7 653 must be suppressed, was dispositive. Slip op at 2. Accordingly, the panel declined to address the constitutionality of the warrant or the prosecution\u2019s argument that the good-faith exception was applicable. <em>Id. </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>We granted the prosecution\u2019s application for leave to appeal to this Court, limited to the issue whether the exclusionary rule applies to a violation of \u00a7 653. 466 Mich 860 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">B. <em>PEOPLE v SCHERF</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">In a prior case, defendant pleaded guilty of manufacturing with intent to deliver between five and forty-five kilograms of marijuana in violation of MCL 333.7401(2)(D)(ii) and was sentenced to probation. Defendant allegedly moved out of Michigan without permission and thereafter failed to report to his probation officer in violation of two of the terms of his probation. Consequently, defendant\u2019s probation officer filed a standard form petition requesting that a bench warrant be issued for his arrest. The petition contained the following statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">Petitioner requests that a bench warrant be issued and Michael Brandon Scherf be arrested and held in contempt of court for the following reason(s):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-8\">Violation of Rule Number 3: The defendant has failed to report as ordered and his whereabouts are unknown. Violation of Rule Number 4: Failure to notify agent of change of address.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">The petition contained the statement, \u201cI declare that the statements above are true to the best of my information, knowledge, and belief,\u201d and was signed by the probation officer. The district court issued the requested bench warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">Subsequently, police were interviewing defendant in connection with an unrelated larceny complaint when they discovered, via the Law Enforcement Information Network (lein), the outstanding bench <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>warrant for his arrest. Defendant was arrested pursuant to the warrant. During a search incident to the arrest, police seized several grams of marijuana from defendant\u2019s person. Thereafter, defendant was charged with possession of marijuana in violation of MCL 333.7403(2)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Defendant sought suppression of evidence of the marijuana on the ground that the bench warrant petition was technically deficient in that it was not supported by affidavits as required by MCR 3.606(A), which governs contempt offenses committed outside the immediate presence of the court. The prosecutor conceded that MCR 3.606(A) was violated because no affidavit was submitted in support of the probation officer\u2019s petition. The prosecutor argued, however, that the district court division of the Isabella County Trial Court should apply the federal \u201cgood-faith exception\u201d to the exclusionary rule. The district court division denied defendant\u2019s motion, holding that the bench warrant petition was confirmed by oath or affirmation and was therefore properly issued. Additionally, the district court division noted that it found <em>Arizona v Evans, </em>514 US 1; 115 S Ct 1185; 131 L Ed 2d 34 (1995), which reaffirmed and applied the good-faith exception, to be persuasive authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Defendant appealed, and the circuit court reversed the district court division\u2019s order, granted defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the marijuana evidence, and dismissed the case. The court held that although the failure to provide an affidavit with the bench warrant petition was merely \u201ctechnical,\u201d it rendered the warrant invalid. The court rejected the prosecutor\u2019s argument that the good-faith exception was applicable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>stating on the record that the exception was not recognized in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">The prosecutor sought leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals, asserting that the good-faith exception should be applied under the circumstances. The Court granted the prosecutor\u2019s application and affirmed the circuit court division\u2019s order. 251 Mich App 410. The majority<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> noted that the bench warrant petition \u201cwas not supported by an affidavit as required by MCR 3.606,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 411, and that \u201cit is undisputed that defendant\u2019s arrest, and the resultant search of defendant and seizure of evidence, were based on an invalid bench warrant and, therefore, the arrest and consequential search were unlawful,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 415. The majority indicated that it would have applied the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule and reversed the circuit court division\u2019s decision if it were not obligated under MCR 7.215(I)(1) to follow <em>People v Hill, </em>192 Mich App 54; 480 NW2d 594 (1991), in which another panel of the Court specifically declined to recognize the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 215 Mich App 415-416.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">This Court granted the prosecutor\u2019s application for leave to appeal the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 467 Mich 856 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Questions of law relevant to a motion to suppress evidence are reviewed de novo. <em>People v Hamilton, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>465 Mich 526, 529; 638 NW2d 92 (2002); <em>People v Stevens (After Remand), </em>460 Mich 626, 631; 597 NW2d 53 (1999).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">We must determine in these cases whether suppression of evidence is required when MCL 780.653 or MCR 3.606(A) has been violated. Where a state statute is involved, \u201cwhether suppression is appropriate is a question of statutory interpretation and thus one of legislative intent.\u201d <em>People v Sobczak-Obetts, </em>463 Mich 687, 694; 625 NW2d 764 (2001), quoting <em>Stevens, supra </em>at 644, quoting <em>People v Wood, </em>450 Mich 399, 408; 538 NW2d 351 (1995) (Boyle, J., concurring). Similarly, \u201c[t]he interpretation of a court rule is a question of law and is reviewed de novo.\u201d <em>Hinkle v Wayne Co Clerk, </em>467 Mich 337, 340; 654 NW2d 315 (2002); see also <em>People v Petit, </em>466 Mich 624, 627; 648 NW2d 193 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AAD\">A. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">First and foremost, it is important to understand what is <em>not </em>before this Court in deciding the issues presented in these cases. We are concerned solely with application of the exclusionary rule to a statutory violation <em>(People v Hawkins) </em>and to a court rule violation <em>(People v Scherf). </em>The judgment of the Court of Appeals in <em>Hawkins </em>was based exclusively on the conceded violation of MCL 780.653, and the Court specifically declined to address the <em>constitutional </em>validity of the search warrant affidavit or the good-faith exception to the <em>constitutional </em>exclusionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>rule. Likewise, in <em>Scherf </em>we are not concerned with the constitutional validity of the bench warrant or of the potential application of the good-faith exception. Although the Court of Appeals majority in <em>Scherf </em>indicated a willingness to apply the good-faith exception in order to avoid suppression of the evidence for the conceded violation of MCR 3.606(A), application of that exception would have been wholly premature, given that neither the circuit court division nor the Court of Appeals panel had found a constitutional violation in the first instance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">With that in mind, we must determine whether the statutory and court rule violations in these cases warrant suppression of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">B. THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The exclusionary rule is a judicially created remedy that originated as a means to protect the Fourth Amendment right of citizens to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. See <em>Stevens, supra </em>at 634-635; see also <em>Weeks v United States, </em>232 US 383; 34 S Ct 341; 58 L Ed 652 (1914), overruled on other grounds in <em>Elkins v United States, </em>364 US 206; 80 S Ct 1437; 4 L Ed 2d 1669 (1960); <em>Adams v New York, </em>192 US 585; 24 S Ct 372; 48 L Ed 575 (1904); <em>Boyd v United States, </em>116 US 616; 6 S Ct 524; 29 L Ed 746 (1886). The exclusionary rule, modified by several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>exceptions,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> generally bars the introduction into evidence of materials seized and observations made during an unconstitutional search. Stevens, <em>supra </em>at 634, 636. However, application of the exclusionary rule is not constitutionally mandated, and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">[t]he question whether the exclusionary rule\u2019s remedy is appropriate in a particular context [is] regarded as an issue separate from the question whether the Fourth Amendment rights of the party seeking to invoke the rule were violated by police conduct. <em>[Illinois v Gates, </em>462 US 213, 223; 103 S Ct 2317; 76 L Ed 2d 527 (1983).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Moreover, the exclusionary rule is not designed to \u201cmake whole\u201d a citizen who has been subjected to an unconstitutional search or seizure. Rather, the aim of the rule is one of police deterrence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">The wrong condemned by the [Fourth] Amendment is \u201cfully accomplished\u201d by the unlawful search or seizure itself . . . and the exclusionary rule is neither intended nor able to \u201ccure the invasion of the defendant\u2019s rights which he has already suffered.\u201d . . . The rule thus operates as \u201ca judicially created remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect, rather than a personal constitutional right of the party aggrieved.\u201d .... <em>[United States v Leon, </em>468 US 897, 906; 104 S Ct 3407; 82 L Ed 2d 677 (1984).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Irrespective of the application of the exclusionary rule in the context of a <em>constitutional </em>violation, the drastic remedy of exclusion of evidence does not necessarily apply to a <em>statutory </em>violation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Whether the exclusionary rule should be applied to evidence seized in violation of a statute is purely a matter of legislative intent. <em>Hamilton, supra </em>at 534.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">\u201c \u2018Because our judicial role precludes imposing different policy choices from those selected by the Legislature, our obligation is, by examining the statutory language, to discern the legislative intent that may reasonably be inferred from the words expressed in the statute. . . . When a statute is clear and unambiguous, judicial construction or interpretation is unnecessary and therefore, precluded.\u2019 \u201d <em>[Sobczak-Obetts, supra </em>at 694-695 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Likewise, whether suppression of evidence on the basis of the violation of a court rule is appropriate is controlled by the language of the rule. \u201cThis Court applies principles of statutory interpretation to the interpretation of court rules. When the language is unambiguous, we must enforce the meaning plainly expressed, and judicial construction is not permitted.\u201d <em>Hinkle, supra at </em>340.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">C. <em>PEOPLE v HAWKINS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">At issue in <em>Hawkins </em>is whether evidence seized from a residence pursuant to a search warrant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>properly suppressed because the affidavit supporting the search warrant did not meet the requirements of MCL 780.653 in Michigan\u2019s search warrant act, MCL 780.651 to 780.659. MCL 780.653 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-5\">The magistrate\u2019s finding of reasonable or probable cause shall be based upon all the facts related within the affidavit made before him or her. The affidavit may be based upon information supplied to the complainant by a named or unnamed person if the affidavit contains 1 of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\"><em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">(b) If the person is unnamed, affirmative allegations from which the magistrate may conclude that the person spoke with personal knowledge of the information and either that the unnamed person is credible or that the information is reliable.[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">MCL 780.653(b) derives from the defunct \u201ctwo-pronged test\u201d enunciated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Aguilar v Texas, </em>378 US 108; 84 S Ct 1509; 12 L Ed 2d 723 (1964), and <em>Spinelli v United States, </em>393 US 410; 89 S Ct 584; 21 L Ed 2d 637 (1969), for detemiining whether an anonymous informant\u2019s tip established probable cause for issuance of a search warrant. See <em>People v Sherbine, </em>421 Mich 502, 509; 364 NW2d 658 (1984). Under the <em>Agui</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number><em>lar-Spinelli </em>formulation as it was generally understood, a search warrant affidavit based on information supplied by an anonymous informant was required to contain both (1) some of the underlying circumstances evidencing the informant\u2019s basis of knowledge and (2) facts establishing either the veracity or the reliability of the information. See <em>Gates, supra </em>at 228-229; <em>Sherbine, supra </em>at 509.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">This Court has previously held that a violation of the affidavit requirements of MCL 780.653 warranted suppression of evidence. <em>Sloan, supra-, Sherbine, supra. </em>Because we are unable to conclude that the Legislature intended application of the exclusionary rule where the requirements of \u00a7 653 have not been met, we overrule <em>Sloan </em>and <em>Sherbine </em>to the extent that they so hold, and we conclude that defendant was not entitled to suppression of evidence on the basis of the statutory violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">In <em>Sherbine, </em>this Court held that suppression of evidence was required where a search warrant affidavit violated a previous version of \u00a7 653<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in that it did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>make any showing that an informant was a credible person <em>and </em>that he supplied reliable information.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although this Court specifically declined to decide whether satisfaction of the federal <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test is required under Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11 \u2014 that is, whether the requirements of \u00a7 653 are rooted in Michigan\u2019s constitutional search and seizure provision\u2014 this Court nevertheless applied the exclusionary rule to the statutory violation. In so doing, this Court failed to examine the language of \u00a7 653 to determine whether the Legislature intended that such a drastic remedy be applied to a violation of the statutory affidavit requirements. Rather, this Court relied on <em>People v Dixon, </em>392 Mich 691; 222 NW2d 749 (1974), in which this Court similarly applied the exclusionary rule to a statutory violation without performing the requisite examination of legislative intent.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We concluded, \u201cThe statutory violation here is clear. The statute requires proof that the informant who sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>plied the information be credible. The affidavit here failed to satisfy this requirement. The evidence must therefore be suppressed.\u201d <em>Sherbine, supra </em>at 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Justice Boyle dissented, opining that preamendment \u00a7 653 required a showing of <em>either </em>reliability <em>or </em>credibility, and that this Court had misconstrued the statute as an expansion of <em>Aguilar. Sherbine, </em>421 Mich 513-514. Additionally, Justice Boyle questioned whether suppression of the evidence was required under the circumstances: \u201cI cannot conceive of a reason why we should apply the exclusionary rule to the supposed violation of a statute where the affidavit would pass constitutional muster under either Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11, or US Const, Am IV . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">In <em>Sloan, </em>this Court held that a violation of a different provision in the current version of \u00a7 653 required application of the exclusionary rule. A search warrant was issued to obtain a blood test from the defendant, who was later charged with manslaughter with a motor vehicle,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor causing death,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and felonious driving.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The portion of \u00a7 653 at issue was the provision that \u201c[t]he magistrate\u2019s finding of reasonable or probable cause shall be based on all the facts related within the affidavit made before him or her.\u201d This Court held that this provision was violated when the magistrate looked beyond the affidavit, to unrecorded oral testimony of a police officer, in issuing the search warrant.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Rely<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>ing on <em>Sherbine, </em>this Court further concluded that the blood test evidence had to be excluded because of the statutory violation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\">In <em>Sherbine, </em>we held that evidence obtained specifically in violation of MCL 780.653 . . . must be excluded. The Legislature appears to have acquiesced in this particular construction of MCL 780.653 .... While the Legislature subsequently amended MCL 780.653 . .. because it disagreed with portions of our statutory analysis provided in <em>Sherbine, </em>it is significant that the Legislature when instituting such amendments did not alter our holding that evidence obtained in violation of the statute must be excluded. To change the law in that regard would have been an easy and convenient task for the Legislature. Neither the language in the amendments, nor the legislative history pertinent to the amendments provide a basis for concluding that a sanction other than exclusion is appropriate for the violation of MCL 780.653 .... Clearly, the Legislature shares our view that no remedy other than exclusion is as likely to assure the full enforcement of all of the requirements under MCL 780.653 . . . \u2014 a statute specifically designed by the Legislature to implement the constitutional mandate for probable cause under Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11. <em>[Sloan, supra </em>at 183-184.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Justice Boyle, joined by Justices Riley and Weaver, dissented, arguing that the statute was complied with and that, in any event, a violation of \u00a7 653 did not require application of the exclusionary rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">Application of the exclusionary rule to any technical violation of our search warrant statute that may have occurred in the present case is unwarranted. Particularly where the magistrate is a sitting judge, as are virtually all magistrates in this state, I cannot conclude that the risk of relying on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>after-the-fact allegations are [sic] so substantial that we must suppress evidence. The exclusionary rule is intended to serve a deterrent purpose, and loses any useful force and effect when applied to technical errors that do not rise to the level of negligent or wilful conduct, serving then only to deprive the trier of fact of relevant and probative evidence. As explained by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Michigan v Tucker, </em>417 US 433, 446-447; 94 S Ct 2357; 41 L Ed 2d 182 (1974):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">\u201cThe deterrent purpose of the exclusionary rale necessarily assumes that the police have engaged in willful, or at the very least negligent, conduct which has deprived the defendant of some right. By refusing to admit evidence gained as a result of such conduct, the courts hope to instill in those particular investigating officers, or in their future counterparts, a greater degree of care toward the rights of an accused. Where the official action was pin-sued in complete good faith, however, the deterrence rationale loses much of its force.\u201d <em>[Sloan, supra </em>at 200 (Boyle, J., dissenting).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">Justice Boyle additionally criticized the majority\u2019s invocation of the \u201clegislative acquiescence\u201d doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-9\">The majority\u2019s assertion of legislative acquiescence in the decision in <em>Sherbine </em>... to use of the exclusionary rale to suppress evidence obtained in alleged violation of the statute before us is wholly mistaken. In <em>Sherbine, </em>this Court\u2019s majority interpreted the former version of the statute as if it imposed a more restrictive standard than the Fourth Amendment and suppressed evidence on the basis of that consideration. The swift reaction of the Legislature was to amend MCL 780.653 ... to make it clear that the Court was incorrect in concluding that what had occurred was a statutory violation. The Legislature had no need to say what should not be excluded; it relied on the Court\u2019s word that were it clear that the Legislature had authorized the warrant, suppression would not be ordered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Acting on our representation, the amended legislation tracked the Fourth Amendment. Because \u201cour holding that evidence obtained in violation of the statute must be excluded\u201d . . . was wholly derived from our narrow reading of MCL 780.653 . . . , the legislative amendment of the statute is not an acquiescence in, but rather a repudiation of, the view in <em>Sherbine </em>that the evidence should be excluded. <em>[Sloan, supra </em>at 202-203 (Boyle, J., dissenting).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">We agree with Justice Boyle and once again reaffirm that where there is no determination that a statutory violation constitutes an error of constitutional dimensions, application of the exclusionary rule is inappropriate unless the plain language of the statute indicates a legislative intent that the rule be applied. <em>Hamilton, supra </em>at 534; <em>Sobczak-Obetts, supra </em>at 694. Moreover, we reject the <em>Sloan </em>Court\u2019s conclusion that the Legislature\u2019s silence constituted agreement with this Court\u2019s application of the exclusionary rule in <em>Sherbine. </em>As we have repeatedly stated, the \u201clegislative acquiescence\u201d principle of statutory construction has been squarely rejected by this Court because it reflects a critical misapprehension of the legislative process. See <em>Robertson v DaimlerChrysler Corp, </em>465 Mich 732, 760 n 15; 641 NW2d 567 (2002); <em>Nawrocki v Macomb Co Rd Comm, </em>463 Mich 143, 177-178 n 33; 615 NW2d 702 (2000). Rather, \u201cMichigan courts [must] determine the Legislature\u2019s intent from its <em>words, </em>not from its silence.\u201d <em>Donajkowski v Alpena Power Co, </em>460 Mich 243, 261; 596 NW2d 574 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The dissent asserts that \u201cthe majority [has] imposed its own policy on the Legislature . . . .\u201d <em>Post </em>at 522. Respectfully, we disagree and believe that it is not <em>this </em>majority but the <em>Sherbine </em>and <em>Sloan </em>majorities that imposed their own policy choices on the Legislature with respect to the application of the exclusion<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>ary rule to a violation of \u00a7 653. Citing nothing in the text of the statute, the <em>Sherbine </em>Court simply declared, without further analysis, that because the statute was violated, \u201c[t]he evidence must... be suppressed.\u201d <em>Sherbine, supra </em>at 512. Similarly, the <em>Sloan </em>majority opined that \u201cno remedy other than exclusion is as likely to assure the full enforcement of all of the requirements under MCL 780.653 . . . .\u201d <em>Sloan, supra </em>at 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The dissent purports to apply a \u201ccontextual analysis\u201d of \u00a7 653 in reaching the conclusion that the Legislature intended the exclusionary rule to apply to a violation of that statute. Yet, as the dissenters readily admit, the text of \u00a7 653 is entirely silent in this regard. <em>Post </em>at 515, generally. Clearly, there is no principled basis for the contention that this Court\u2019s injection of the exclusionary rule in <em>Sherbine </em>and <em>Sloan </em>is grounded in the statutory text.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The dissent attempts to draw a distinction between legislative silence and reenactment of a statute following judicial interpretation. While we have no reason to contest that the \u201creenactment doctrine\u201d can sometimes be a useful tool for determining legislative intent where the statutory language is ambiguous, such a tool of construction may not be utilized to subordinate the plain language of a statute. This Court\u2019s constitutional charge to interpret the laws does not end merely because the Legislature reenacts a statute.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In the absence of a clear indication that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>the Legislature intended to either adopt or repudiate this Court\u2019s prior construction, there is no reason to subordinate our primary principle of construction-to ascertain the Legislature\u2019s intent by first examining the statute\u2019s language-to the reenactment rule.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>The Legislature has stated its views on the construction of its statutes, in part by providing that all words and phrases that are not terms of art<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> be given their \u201ccommon and approved\u201d meanings. MCL 8.3a. Such is consistent with our most fundamental principle of construction that there is no room for judicial interpretation when the Legislature\u2019s intent can be ascertained from the statute\u2019s plain and unambiguous language. See <em>Stanton v Battle </em>Creek, 466 Mich 611, 615; 647 NW2d 508 (2002). Accordingly, we decline to apply the \u201creenactment rule\u201d when the Legislature\u2019s intent is evidenced by the plain language of the statute and there is no clear indication of any intent to adopt or repudiate this Court\u2019s prior construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Nothing in the plain language of \u00a7 653 provides us with a sound basis for concluding that the Legislature intended that noncompliance with its affidavit requirements, standing alone, justifies application of the exclusionary rule to evidence obtained by police in reliance on a search warrant.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Moreover, applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>tion of the exclusionary rule is particularly inappropriate under the circumstances of this case, where the objective of the rule \u2014 to sanction police misconduct as a means of deterrence \u2014 would not be served.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> See <em>Sobczak-Obetts, supra </em>at 712. Because we applied the exclusionary rule to the statutory violations at issue in <em>Sherbine </em>and <em>Sloan </em>without performing the requisite examination of legislative intent, we are compelled to overrule those decisions to the extent that they conflict with today\u2019s holding.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Accordingly, we conclude that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that suppression of the evidence was required as a remedy for the violation of \u00a7 653 in this case. Because the Court of Appeals declined to address the prosecutor\u2019s additional arguments on appeal, we remand this matter to that Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">D. <em>PEOPLE v SCHERF</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The Court of Appeals held in <em>Scherf </em>that a bench warrant issued in violation of a court rule was invalid and that suppression of evidence obtained in connection with defendant\u2019s arrest pursuant to that warrant was therefore required. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">MCR 3.606(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-9\">Initiation of Proceeding.

Indeed, the task of scrutinizing the police papers submitted in support of a warrant for technical compliance with the law falls squarely with the judicial officer. In the absence of language evincing an intent that suppression of evidence should follow from the violation of MCR 3.606(A), we decline to infer one.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The exclusionary rule was improperly applied to the violations of the statutoiy and court rule affidavit requirements at issue in these cases. We cannot conclude, on the basis of the plain language of MCL 780.653, that the Legislature intended that noncompliance with its terms should result in suppression of evidence obtained by police acting in reasonable and good-faith reliance on a search warrant. Likewise, MCR 3.606(A) does not provide for suppression of evidence on the basis of noncompliance with its affidavit requirement, and we decline to infer an intent that the exclusionary rule should apply under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">In <em>Hawkins, </em>we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand to that Court for further proceedings.

See <em>Arizona, supra; Leon, supra. </em>As noted, because of the procedural posture of the instant cases, we do not reach the constitutionality of the warrants at issue and, consequently, we do not address the applicability of the good-faith exception to a violation of Michigan\u2019s counterpart to the Fourth Amendment, Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11.

For example, suppose that the Legislature amends a statutory code to make all pronouns gender-neutral, but otherwise reenacts the code as originally written. It would be neither accurate nor reasonable to pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>sume, as the dissent would have us do, that the Legislature intended to adopt <em>in toto </em>every appellate decision construing or applying the code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b609-7\"> Even the United States Supreme Court has acknowledged that there has been no stable, consistent formulation of this amorphous doctrine. <em>Helvering v Griffiths, </em>318 US 371, 396; 63 S Ct 636; 87 L Ed 843 (1943). Under the broadest formulation of the reenactment doctrine, there is no reason why only <em>judicial </em>interpretations of statutes should be incorporated by implication upon reenactment of a statute. Indeed, even <em>administrative interpretations </em>of statutes have been recognized as binding. See <em>United States v Safety Car Heating &amp; Lighting Co, </em>297 US 88, 95; 56 S Ct 353; 80 L Ed 500 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">Our point is not that the reenactment doctrine, properly limited and applied, is without value as a statutory construction aid, but that it cannot be employed indiscriminately and without recognition of the fact that its more expansive versions impose an unreasonable burden on the Legislature to affirmatively scan our appellate casebooks to discern judicial constructions of statutes that the Legislature desires for entirely other reasons to amend. Applying the reenactment rule here would, in our view, be the effective equivalent of imposing an <em>affirmative duty </em>on the Legislature to keep abreast of all binding judicial pronouncements involving the construction of statutes and to revise those statutes to repudiate any judicial construction with which it disagrees. For similar reasons, we have rejected precisely such a duty in other contexts. See, e.g., <em>Donajkowski, supra </em>at 261-262.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">To apply the reenactment doctrine under these circumstances would not only likely fail to give effect to legislative intent, but would also presumably violate separation of powers principles. See Grabow, <em>Congressional silence and the search for legislative intent: A venture into \u201cspeculative unrealities,\u201d </em>64 BUL R 737, 759-761 (1984). Accordingly, before we ignore the plain meaning of the text of a statute, we reject formulations of the reenactment doctrine involving circumstances that fail to demonstrate the Legislature\u2019s <em>conscious consideration </em>of a judicial decision, coupled with some compelling indication that the Legislature <em>intended </em>to accept or reject that interpretation. As is illustrated by Justice Boyle\u2019s dissent in <em>Sloan, </em>discussed <em>ante </em>at 505-507, it is a perilous exercise to attempt to discern legislative intent from the Legislature\u2019s silence, even when a statutory amendment responds to <em>some portion </em>of a judicial decision. See <em>Sloan, supra </em>at 202-203.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b610-7\"> We note that in the case of a <em>term of art, </em>application of the \u201creenactment rule\u201d would generally be appropriate because such a term by definition carries with it the construction accorded it by the courts. See <em>People v Law, </em>459 Mich 419, 425 n 8; 591 NW2d 20 (1999). In contrast, in this case we are confronted with the amendment of a statute following the imposition of a judicially created remedy that is grounded nowhere in the <em>text </em>of the statute. Our dissenting colleagues opine that \u201cthe Legislature could have easily modified the applicability of the exclusionary rule when enacting 1988 PA 80,\u201d <em>post </em>at 519, and that therefore the Legislature must have intended to adopt, <em>sub silentio, </em>the exclusionary rule. However, an equally plausible conclusion is that, because the Legislature could easily have modified the statute to <em>expressly provide </em>for the application of the exclusionary rule, it must have intended to reject this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sherbine. </em>This precisely illustrates one of the reasons that the \u201clegislative acquiescence\u201d doctrine is an untrustworthy indicator of legislative intent, as well as why the \u201creenactment rule\u201d should not be applied as an aid in interpreting legislative <em>silence.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b610-8\"> Any error concerning the search warrant in this case rests squarely on the shoulders of the district court judge, whose duty it is to ensure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>that warrants are issued in compliance with state and federal law. There is no indication in the record that the officer who applied for the search warrant, or the officers who executed the warrant, acted improperly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b611-7\"> Indeed, we note that the Legislature has specifically provided for a sanction in the case of misconduct in the execution or procurement of a search warrant.

That the Legislature has elected to deter police misconduct in the manner indicated by MCL 780.657 and MCL 780.658 further evidences the lack of any legislative intent that the exclusionary rule be applied under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b611-8\"> Our dissenting colleagues charge us with ignoring this Court\u2019s prohibition-era decisions in <em>People v Knopka, </em>220 Mich 540; 190 NW 731 (1922), <em>People v Moten, </em>233 Mich 169; 206 NW 506 (1925), <em>People v Bules, </em>234 Mich 335; 207 NW 818 (1926), and <em>People v Galnt, </em>235 Mich 646; 209 NW 915 (1926), all of which involved search warrant requirements as set forth in \u00a7 27 of Michigan\u2019s \u201cliquor law,\u201d 1922 CL 7079(27). As we explained in <em>Sobczak-Obetts, supra, Knopka </em>involved a violation of Const 1908, art 2, \u00a7 10, not merely a statutory violation. The <em>Moten, </em>and <em>Buies </em>Courts applied, without analysis, the <em>Knopka </em>exclusionary rule to purely statutory search warrant violations. The <em>Galnt </em>Court, similarly to the <em>Knopka </em>Court, expressly found a <em>constitutional </em>violation. The <em>Moten </em>and <em>Buies </em>decisions, which conclusorily applied the exclusionary rule without determining that there was any constitutional violation, are distinguishable in any event because they did not involve the search warrant statute at issue. See <em>Sobczak-Obetts, supra </em>at 700 n 11. Moreover, as we noted in <em>Sobczak-Obetts, supra </em>at 707, the statutory violations in <em>Moten, Bules, and Galnt </em>pertained to the warrant form; in such a case, \u201cthe resulting search may be <em>constitutionally </em>defective.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)

Because \u201cour holding that evidence obtained in violation of the statute must be excluded,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 183 (Cavanagh, J.), was wholly derived from our narrow reading of MCL 780.653; MSA 28.1259(3), the legislative amendment of the statute is not an acquiescence in, but rather a repudiation of, the view in <em>Sherbine </em>that the evidence should be excluded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>However, while I do not believe the reenactment rale should be relied on in the present cases for the reasons outlined by Justice Boyle, my opinion should not be construed to mean that the rale may not be relied on in other cases where it is appropriate.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-8\"> <em>People v Sherbine, </em>421 Mich 502; 364 NW2d 658 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b615-4\">Cavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQ6\">\n<em>(dissenting).</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ATqO\">Today the majority discounts decades of precedent in order to adopt its preferred policy of limiting application of the exclusionary rale. Because contextual interpretations of the statute and the court rule mandate use of the exclusionary rale, and because the task of altering our state\u2019s policy concerning statutory remedies belongs to the Legislature, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">MCL 780.653</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Like the majority, I agree that a contextual analysis of MCL 780.653 will determine the appropriate remedy for its violation. However, I depart from the majority\u2019s analysis insofar as it neglects material rules of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Since its enactment in 1966, MCL 780.653 has codified the requirement that search warrants issue only upon a finding of probable cause, giving form to the constitutional protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. The provision clarifies that information in support of a warrant must be supplied by an individual who has personal knowledge of the facts alleged. MCL 780.653, as amended by 1988 PA 80, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-8\">The magistrate\u2019s finding of reasonable or probable cause shall be based upon all the facts related within the affidavit made before him or her. The affidavit may be based upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>information supplied to the complainant by a named or unnamed person if the affidavit contains 1 of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-6\">(a) If the person is named, affirmative allegations from which tire magistrate may conclude that the person spoke with personal knowledge of the information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">(b) If the person is unnamed, affirmative allegations from which the magistrate may conclude that the person spoke \u25a0with personal knowledge of the information and either that the unnamed person is credible or that the information is reliable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">Similarly to the federal and state constitutional prohibition against the issuance of a warrant without probable cause, the text of this subsection provides no specific guidance about the requisite judicial response to its violation. Statutory construction is, therefore, required. <em>In re MCI, </em>460 Mich 396; 596 NW2d 164 (1999). Although the consequence of an infraction is not prescribed, 1966 PA 189 does authorize a penalty for those who intentionally exceed their authority when executing a warrant, who exercise such authority with unnecessary severity, or who maliciously procure a warrant. See MCL 780.657, 780.658.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While I agree that these statutory provisions must inform our understanding of MCL 780.653, I am not persuaded that they mandate the result envisioned by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>As an initial matter, the penalty provisions only pertain to a small number of violations. Most violations of 1966 PA 189 are not caused by wilful misconduct. If the criminal provisions are deemed the exclusive remedy for any violation of this act, its directives would have no force. Unlike the majority, I cannot conclude that the presence of criminal penalties for rare incidents of extreme misconduct indicates a legislative intent to displace the exclusionary rule. To so hold would assume the Legislature promulgated an impotent (or ineffectual) statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For this reason, I find several other well-respected doctrines of interpretation more compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">Among them is the strong presumption that a high court\u2019s construction of a statute should be given a heightened stare decisis effect. As noted by the United States Supreme Court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">[the] reluctance to overturn precedents derives in part from institutional concerns about the relationship of the Judiciary to Congress. One reason that we give great weight to <em>stare decisis </em>in the area of statutory construction is that <em>\u201cCongress is free to change this Court\u2019s interpretation of its legislation.\u201d Illinois Brick Co v Illinois, </em>431 US 720, 736[; 97 S Ct 2061; 52 L Ed 2d 707] (1977). We have overruled our precedents when the intervening development of the law has \u201cremoved or weakened the conceptual underpinnings from the prior decision, or where the later law has rendered the decision irreconcilable with competing legal doctrines or policies.\u201d <em>Patterson v McLean Credit Union, </em>491 US 164, 173[; 109 S Ct 2363; 105 L Ed 2d 132] (1989) (citations omitted). Absent those changes or compelling evidence bearing on Congress\u2019 original intent, <em>NLRB v Long</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number><em>shoremen, </em>473 US 61, 84[; 105 S Ct 3045; 87 L Ed 2d 47] (1985), our system demands that we adhere to our prior interpretations of statutes. <em>[Neal v United States, </em>516 US 284, 295; 116 S Ct 763; 133 L Ed 2d 709 (1996) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Because this Court shares a similar relationship with the Michigan Legislature, I find no reason to reject this Court\u2019s precedent in <em>People v Sloan, </em>450 Mich 160; 538 NW2d 380 (1995), <em>or People v Sherbine, </em>421 Mich 502; 364 NW2d 658 (1984), which clarify that evidence obtained in violation of MCL 780.653 must be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">In <em>Sherbine, </em>this Court held that the exclusionary rule is the proper remedy for a violation of MCL 780.653. In support, the Court cited <em>People v Dixon, </em>392 Mich 691; 222 NW2d 749 (1974), <em>People v Chartrand, </em>73 Mich App 645; 252 NW2d 569 (1977), and <em>State v Russell, </em>293 Or 469; 650 P2d 79 (1982). <em>Sherbine, supra </em>at 512 and ns 18-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Ten years later, this Court affirmed the application of the exclusionary rule for violations of MCL 780.653 (\u00a7 653) in <em>Sloan, supra. </em>In <em>Sloan, </em>this Court held that a magistrate must base the probable-cause determination on the record (i.e., an affidavit is necessary; sworn testimony is insufficient), and that a violation of this statute requires the exclusion of tainted evidence. The Court\u2019s rationale was based, in part, on the Legislature\u2019s acquiescence to the application of the exclusionary rule as expressed in <em>Sherbine. </em>In 1988, the Legislature revised \u00a7 653 in response to <em>Sherbine, </em>overruling by legislative enactment the informant-reliability standard. In doing so, it approved the use of the exclusionary rule to redress violations of \u00a7 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Though one might be tempted to dismiss the authoritative value of <em>Sloan </em>on the basis of its stated reliance on the now disfavored doctrine of legislative acquiescence, a close examination reveals the Court utilized a related \u2014 but quite distinct \u2014 rule of interpretation, i.e., the reenactment rule. If a legislature reenacts a statute without modifying a high court\u2019s practical construction of that statute, that construction is implicitly adopted. See Singer, 28 Statutes and Statutory Construction (2000 rev), Contemporaneous Construction, \u00a7 49:09, pp 103-112. The reenactment rule differs from the legislative-acquiescence doctrine in that the former canon provides \u201cprima facie evidence of legislative intent\u201d by the adoption, without modification, of a statutory provision that had already received judicial interpretation. <em>Id. </em>at 107. As articulated by the United States Supreme Court, a legislature \u201cis presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it [reenacts] a statute without change . . . .\u201d <em>Lorillard, a Div of Loew\u2019s Theatres, Inc v Pons, </em>434 US 575, 580; 98 S Ct 866; 55 L Ed 2d 40 (1978). As I noted in <em>Sloan, </em>the Legislature could have easily modified the applicability of the exclusionary rule when enacting 1988 PA 80. By altering the text to renounce the informant rule modified in <em>Sherbine, </em>while reenacting the remaining text, the Legislature indicated its detailed knowledge of <em>Sherbine </em>and approved the use of the exclusionary rule for violations of \u00a7 653.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Long before the Legislature incorporated the exclusionary rule into MCL 780.653, this Court adopted a presumption in favor of utilizing the exclusionary rule for statutory violations. Over eighty years ago, in <em>People v Knopka, </em>220 Mich 540, 545; 190 NW 731 (1922), the Court suppressed evidence obtained by warrant issued without probable cause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">It not appearing that the search warrant was issued upon the constitutional and statutory showing of probable cause, it must be held that the evidence procured by it was inadmissible and should have been suppressed and that, with such evidence out, defendant should have been discharged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">In reaching this conclusion, the Court focused exclusively on the statutes establishing search-warrant requirements. Three years later, in <em>People v Moten, </em>233 Mich 169; 206 NW 506 (1925), the Court again applied the exclusionary rule to remedy a statutory violation, relying, in part, on <em>Knopka. </em>See also <em>People v Bules, </em>234 Mich 335; 207 NW 818 (1926) (reversing a conviction on the basis of evidence obtained in violation of statutory warrant requirements); <em>People v Galnt, </em>235 Mich 646; 209 NW 915 (1926) (discharging the defendant where evidence obtained in violation of statute required suppression).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Although this Court has recently attempted to narrow the import of <em>Moten </em>and its progeny, the distinction is particularly inapposite here. In <em>People v Sobczak-Obetts, </em>463 Mich 687; 625 NW2d 764 (2001), the majority distinguished the <em>Moten-Bules-Galnt </em>trilogy because each analyzed substantive warrant requirements, i.e., the sufficiency of a warrant\u2019s \u201cform,\u201d whereas the statute at issue in <em>Sobczak-Obetts </em>concerned procedures relevant to warrant execution. See also <em>People v Hamilton, </em>465 Mich 526; 638 NW2d 92 (2002) (holding that an absence of statutory authority did not warrant application of the exclusionary rule where the statute was meant to protect the rights of autonomous local governments); <em>People v Stevens (After Remand), </em>460 Mich 626; 597 NW2d 53 (1999) (holding that failure to comply with the knock-and-announce rule did not warrant application of the exclusionary rule). However, this distinction between substantive and procedural interests collapses when applied to defendant Hawkins, who challenged the warrant issued for his arrest on substantive grounds, maintaining the affidavit contained neither credible nor reliable allegations. The trial court agreed: \u201cThe affidavit clearly does not conform with Michigan statutory authority; namely, MCL 780.653(B).\u201d Regrettably, the majority today conflates substantive and procedural concerns, ignores decades of precedent, and \u2014 in spite of evidence to the contrary \u2014 disregards the Legislature\u2019s unambiguous approval of the application of the exclusionary rule for violations of MCL 780.653. See 1988 PA 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">Until the tide began to shift with <em>Stevens (After Remand), </em>the use of the exclusionary rule to remedy statutory violations was well settled. By dismissing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>the import of this Court\u2019s precedent, including <em>Moten, Bules, Sherbine, Sloan, </em>et al., the majority has imposed a policy-based doctrine that requires express statements to authorize application of the exclusionary rule. <em>Ante </em>at 507. This runs afoul of the Legislature\u2019s approval of the rule\u2019s application to MCL 780.653 as articulated in <em>Sherbine. </em>1988 PA 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">While I can appreciate the majority\u2019s need to balance important and competing interests, I take issue with its attempt to ground the analysis in the text of MCL 780.653. Moreover, shifting the focus to a \u201cclear statement\u201d policy works a bait-and-switch on the Legislature. Not only has the majority imposed its own policy on the Legislature, it has displaced the controlling interpretive standard \u2014 on which our Legislature has relied \u2014 under the guise of strict textualism.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">MCR 3.606(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The majority concludes that the exclusionary rule is an inappropriate remedy because the text of MCR 3.606(A) does not specifically demand its application. <em>Ante </em>at 512. \u201cWhen called on to construe a court rule, this Court applies the legal principles that govern the construction and application of statutes. . . . Accordingly, we begin with the plain language of the court rule.\u201d <em>Grievance Administrator v Underwood, </em>462 Mich 188, 193-194; 612 NW2d 116 (2000). Applied here, the doctrine clarifies our rule\u2019s rigorous demands. MCR 3.606(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">Initiation of Proceeding. For a contempt committed outside the immediate view and presence of the court, on a proper showing on ex parte motion supported by affidavits, the court shall either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>(1) order the accused person to show cause, at a reasonable time specified in the order, why that person should not be punished for the alleged misconduct; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-4\">(2) issue a bench warrant for the arrest of the person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">As required by this rule, before contempt proceedings may be initiated for any conduct outside of the court\u2019s \u201cimmediate view,\u201d a party must provide \u201ca proper showing on ex parte motion supported by affidavits . A motion alone is insufficient. An affidavit, i.e., \u201ca signed statement,\u201d must be provided. Once this requirement is met, the court must either order the accused person to prove why punishment should not be inflicted or issue a bench warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">In the light of the potential peril, as well as the substantive safeguards contained in MCR 3.606(A), I find it particularly troublesome that the majority members suggest such rules are mere \u201ctechnical provisions.\u201d This assertion ignores their function as guarantors of procedural rights. MCR 3.606(A) threatens punishment solely on the basis of exclusive communications between an adversarial party and the court. The procedure authorizes the exercise of police power by judicial officers, which \u2014 contrary to the majority\u2019s implication \u2014 may not be used to detain an individual without probable cause. As an arm of the state, our actions must respect the polity\u2019s civil rights, and our court rules are drafted to ensure that the exercise of judicial authority is not arbitrary or unlawful. To deem such rules \u201ctechnical\u201d distorts the substance of the rules and the role of the judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Although the majority holds otherwise, the exclusionary rule would be <em>particularly </em>appropriate in this instance. As a tool to prevent the abuse of state power, this Court promulgated the court rule to mark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>the boundaries of acceptable judicial conduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If the exclusionary rule applied, magistrates and judges would surely take care to confirm that warrants were issued on a proper showing of probable cause. Such proof is all the court rule requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE\u2019S UTILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">I agree that the exclusionary rule wields significant power, but only because it is the sole efficacious method by which to protect individuals from state misconduct, as defined by our laws. If any other method of enforcement worked so well, it, too, would be deemed disproportionate and heavy-handed. Thus, our debate is not simply about which remedy is appropriate, but how sacred we deem the right to be free from unlawful state conduct. Whether codified in federal or state constitutions, statutes, or court rules, the judicial branch must enforce the laws that prescribe the scope of state power and protect individuals from the unreasonable exercise of that authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>In the aftermath of September 11, 2001, as our nation struggles to secure its boundaries while protecting our freedoms, the role of the judiciary\u2014 charged with maintaining the delicate balance between state authority and individual liberty\u2014 becomes increasingly vital. Our statutes and court rules have been drafted to protect these freedoms. Because both the statute, MCL 780.653, and the court rule, MCE 3.606(A), would be without force but for the exclusionary rule, and because this Court should avoid overruling sound precedent and imposing its policy upon the Legislature, I must reject the majority\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Though cloaked in a strict Textualism garb, the majority attempts to justify its decision on the basis of its own policy considerations. According to the majority, in the absence of an express legislative statement indicating an intention to invoke the exclusionary rule, the rule will not be applied. However, a more legitimate analysis would require an inference in favor of its application. In so doing, it could be guaranteed that the well-settled and authoritative interpretation of our statutes could be relied upon, and that a statute\u2019s purpose would be effectuated. Moreover, without this tool, aggrieved individuals would have no opportunity for redress. For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in <em>Hawkins.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">With regard to the proper remedy for a violation of MCE 3.606(A), I would also apply the exclusionary rule. The text of the court rule evinces an intention to impose substantive procedural safeguards into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>warrant-authorization process. To effectuate this end, the exclusionary rule is required to remedy violations of MCR 3.606(A). Therefore, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in <em>Scherf.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b626-6\">Kelly, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-9\"> MCL 780.657 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-10\">Any person who in executing a search warrant, wilfully exceeds his authority or exercises it with unnecessary severity, shall be fined not more than $1,000.00 or imprisoned not more than 1 year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">MCL 780.658 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-12\">Any person who maliciously and without probable cause procures a search warrant to be issued and executed shall be fined not more than $1,000.00 or imprisoned not more than 1 year.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b617-7\"> See <em>People v Sobczak-Obetts, </em>463 Mich 687, 713-716; 625 NW2d 764 (2001) (Cavanagh, J., dissenting); <em>People v Stevens (After Remand), </em>460 Mich 626, 648-666; 597 NW2d 53 (1999) (Cavanagh, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b619-5\"> The majority\u2019s attempt to diminish the value of the reenactment doctrine is misguided. As noted above, the rule merely provides prima facie evidence of legislative intent, and a bill replacing male pronouns with neutral pronouns throughout the code \u2014 as suggested in the majority opinion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number><em>ante </em>at 508-509 n 19 \u2014 would <em>not </em>justify a strong presumption in favor of its application because there would be no indication that the Legislature thoughtfully familiarized itself with the subsections modified. Application of the reenactment rule in this case, by contrast, does shed light on the scope of the Legislature\u2019s familiarity with <em>Sherbine, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Further, unlike the majority, I have more faith in the Legislature\u2019s ability to competently execute its duties. To assume the Legislature would not familiarize itself with the whole of a particular case when revising one subsection of the code in response to that very case does not, as the majority suggests, \u201cviolate separation of powers principles.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 509 n 20. Rather, reference to the reenactment rule under such circumstances simply acknowledges legislative competency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b624-6\"> The majority claims that application of the exclusionary rule to MCL 780.653 or MCR 3.606(A) would not further the purpose of either because \u201cthe aim of the rule is one of police deterrence . . ..\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 499. While I agree that we suppress evidence in an attempt to prevent police misconduct, the exclusionary rule is also utilized to ensure compliance with the law at an <em>institutional </em>level. The ease with which we lose sight of this goal is apparent in <em>People v Cartwright, </em>454 Mich 550; 563 NW2d 208 (1997), where we equated \u201cgood police practice\u201d with violations of the Fourth Amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">While conceding that [the officer\u2019s] entry into the mobile home might have been good police practice, the district court held that, nonetheless, it was not a proper search without a warrant. <em>[Id. </em>at 554.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">One wonders how it can be \u201cgood police practice\u201d to violate the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
