FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">In October 1998, plaintiff was paroled from sentences imposed for controlled substances convictions. Plaintiff tested positively for cocaine on several occasions after his release on parole, and his original twenty-four-month parole term was extended because of various parole violations prior to those at issue in this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In February 2001, plaintiff again tested positively for cocaine, and he subsequently failed to report to his parole officer. These two parole violation charges were first detailed in a warrant issued February 13, 2001. A third parole violation charge was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>added on March 12, 2001, charging plaintiff with fleeing and eluding police.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">Plaintiff waived his right to a preliminary hearing under MCL 791.239a. On April 19, 2001, plaintiff appeared before a Department of Corrections administrative law examiner (ale) and received notice of the charges against him and the time, place, and purpose of the fact-finding hearing as required by MCL 791.240a(2). Plaintiff admitted that he had used cocaine and had failed to report to his parole officer. However, plaintiff denied the third parole violation charge, the commission of the criminal offense of fleeing and eluding police. Plaintiff asked to present evidence in mitigation of the parole violations pursuant to MCL 791.240a(2)(d). He did not object to the date of the fact-finding hearing, which was scheduled for May 16, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">At the fact-finding hearing, the ale noted that the plaintiff had pleaded guilty of the first two counts alleging violation of the conditions of parole. The third count, alleging commission of a criminal offense, was dismissed pursuant to MCL 791.240a(l) for failure to hold a hearing within forty-five days of the date of plaintiffs arrest, March 11, 2001. Nevertheless, the ale accepted evidence in mitigation of that offense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The ale determined that plaintiff was in violation of the conditions of his parole as charged in the first two counts of the warrant, ruling that plaintiff\u2019s guilty plea provided a sufficient factual basis to establish the charged violations by a preponderance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>of the evidence. The ale recommended a revocation of plaintiff\u2019s parole and continuation of plaintiff\u2019s incarceration for eighteen months before again considering plaintiff for parole.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The parole board adopted the ale\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Plaintiff filed a complaint for a writ of habeas coipus in the circuit court, contending that he was entitled to discharge from prison because the fact-finding hearing was not held until the sixty-sixth day of his availability for return to a state correctional facility. The circuit court denied the requested relief. Plaintiff then filed a complaint for habeas corpus relief in the Court of Appeals,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which entered an order of habeas corpus discharging plaintiff from prison and returning him to the jurisdiction of the parole board. Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued November 30, 2001 (Docket No. 236835).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">The Attorney General, on behalf of the Department of Corrections, filed an application for leave to appeal the judgment of the Court of Appeals. This Court issued a stay of the Court of Appeals decision and granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal. 467 Mich 884 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">At issue in this case is whether a parolee accused of a parole violation is entitled to discharge from prison where a fact-finding hearing on the charge is not held within forty-five days as required by MCL 791.240a(l). This Court reviews de novo the interpretation and application of a statute as a question of law. <em>Cruz v State Farm Mut Automobile Ins Co, </em>466 Mich 588, 594; 648 NW2d 591 (2002); <em>People v Thousand, </em>465 Mich 149, 156; 631 NW2d 694 (2001). If the language of the statute is clear, \u201cno further analysis is necessary or allowed to expand what the Legislature clearly intended to cover.\u201d <em>Miller v Mercy Mem Hosp, </em>466 Mich 196, 201; 644 NW2d 730 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">in. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AIs\">A. MCL 791.240a(l)</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">A prisoner enjoys no constitutional or inherent right to be conditionally released from a validly imposed sentence. See <em>Greenholtz v Inmates of Nebraska Penal &amp; Correctional Complex, </em>442 US 1, 7; 99 S Ct 2100; 60 L Ed 2d 668 (1979); <em>People v Malmquist, </em>155 Mich App 521; 400 NW2d 317 (1986).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Furthermore, parole revocation is not a stage of a criminal prosecution. See <em>Gagnon v Scarpelli, </em>411 US 778, 782; 93 S Ct 1756; 36 L Ed 2d 656 (1973); <em>Morissey v Brewer, </em>408 US 471, 480; 92 S Ct 2593; 33 L Ed 2d 484 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>(1972). However, pursuant to <em>Morrissey, </em>limited due process requirements, including notice and the opportunity to be heard, apply to the loss of liberty occasioned by parole revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The granting, rescission, and revocation of parole in Michigan is overseen by the Bureau of Pardons and Paroles pursuant to MCL 791.231 <em>el seq. </em>This statutory scheme makes clear that, with limited exception,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> matters of parole lie solely within the broad discretion of the parole board, and that the freedom enjoyed by a paroled prisoner is a <em>limited </em>freedom.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The release of a prisoner on parole \u201cshall be granted solely upon the initiative of the parole board,\u201d MCL 791.235(1), and a paroled prisoner remains in the legal custody and under the control of the Department of Corrections, MCL 791.238(1). A parole is \u201ca permit to the prisoner to leave the prison,\u201d not a release. MCL 791.238(6). Furthermore, a parolee may be arrested without a warrant where there exists reasonable cause to believe that he has violated parole. MCL 791.239.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">The procedural requirements of MCL 791.240a serve to protect the due process interests, as outlined by <em>Morrissey, </em>of a parolee whose liberty is at stake by virtue of a charge of parole violation. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>contrary to the holding of the Court of Appeals in this case, MCL 791.240a neither deprives the parole board of jurisdiction to revoke parole nor requires the discharge of a parolee where the required hearing has been delayed beyond the forty-five-day period prescribed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-4\">MCL 791.240a(l) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-5\">Within 45 days after a paroled prisoner has been returned or is available for return to a state correctional facility under accusation of a parole violation other than conviction for a felony or misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment under the laws of this state, the United States, or any other state or territory of the United States, the prisoner is entitled to a fact-finding hearing on the charges before 1 member of the parole board or an attorney hearings officer designated by the chairperson of the parole board. The fact-finding hearing shall be conducted only after the accused parolee has had a reasonable amount of time to prepare a defense. The fact-finding hearing may be held at a state correctional facility or at or near the location of the alleged violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The Court of Appeals \u201creluctantly\u201d held that it was required, pursuant to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Stewart v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>382 Mich 474; 170 NW2d 16 (1969), to order plaintiff\u2019s release from prison because the fact-finding hearing was not held within forty-five days of his availability for return to the Department of Corrections as required by MCL 791.240a(l). The panel further opined that habeas corpus relief was appropriate on the basis of this Court\u2019s order granting such relief to an alleged parole violator in <em>In re Lane, </em>377 Mich 695 (1966), after a Court of Appeals panel had determined that a writ of mandamus was the appropriate remedy for the failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>to hold a timely parole violation hearing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, the panel urged this Court to reconsider <em>Stewart </em>and <em>Lane\\</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-6\">In light of these Supreme Court cases, we have little option but to grant plaintiffs requested relief. However, we urge defendant to seek review in the Supreme Court and for the Supreme Court to reverse us. We agree with our prior opinion in <em>Lane </em>[2 Mich App 140; 138 NW2d 541 (1965)] that mandamus is a more appropriate remedy than habeas corpus. We see little rational reason to require that plaintiff be returned to parole status. It would seem to us that if defendant violates the forty-\u00f1ve-day rule, it could properly be remedied by mandamus. It might perhaps even be appropriate to require that a parolee be released from detention on the forty-sixth day. However, we find nothing in the statute or in common sense to justify entitling plaintiff to a return to parole status, particularly in light of parole violations to which he has admitted. [Slip op at 2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">In Stewart, the plaintiff was charged with several alleged parole violations. The plaintiff admitted his guilt on some of the charges. Although the plaintiff demanded a formal hearing under former MCL 791.240, the predecessor of the current MCL 791.240a,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in light of the plaintiffs admission of guilt the parole board denied the request for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>This Court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals granting the plaintiffs writ of superintending control against the Department of Corrections, holding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-4\">[t]he failure of the parole board to conduct the hearing provided for by the statute within 30 days constituted, in effect, a waiver of any claim based upon these violations since the alleged violations were not \u201ca felony or misdemeanor under the laws of this state.\u201d[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] We further conclude that, under these circumstances, the plaintiff is entitled to be discharged from prison but he will remain under the jurisdiction of the parole board as per their order of December 9, 1966. <em>[Stewart, supra </em>at 479.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The <em>Stewart </em>Court erred, in our judgment, by engrafting onto the terms of former MCL 791.240 a remedy that had no basis in the plain language of the statute. As we have recently noted on several occasions, \u201c \u2018our judicial role precludes imposing different policy choices than those selected by the Legislature, [and] our obligation is, by examining the statutory language, to discern the legislative intent that may reasonably be inferred from the words expressed in the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>People v </em>Sobczak-Obetts, 463 Mich 687, 694-695; 625 NW2d 764 (2001), quoting <em>People v McIntire, </em>461 Mich 147, 152; 599 NW2d 102 (1999). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>determining that the parole board had waived its authority and that the plaintiff was entitled to discharge, the <em>Stewart </em>Court created a remedy for a violation of former MCL 791.240 that was not grounded anywhere in the statutory scheme and thus exceeded its judicial authority.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">We decline to impose the relinquishment of the parole board\u2019s statutory authority<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> to revoke parole as a remedy for a violation of the forty-five-day limitation period provided in MCL 791.240a(l). To infer such a legislative intent where none is indicated either in the text of MCL 791.240a or elsewhere in the statutory scheme \u201cwould be an exercise of <em>will </em>rather than judgment.\u201d <em>People v Stevens (After Remand), </em>460 Mich 626, 645; 597 NW2d 53 (1999) (emphasis in original). We overrule <em>Stewart </em>to the extent that it conflicts with today\u2019s holding.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>b. response to the dissent</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">The dissent, invoking the so-called \u201creenactment rule,\u201d asserts that because the <em>post-Stewart </em>revisions to MCL 791.240 and MCL 791.240a do not \u201cclearly show an intention to undo this Court\u2019s holding in Stewart,\u201d we must assume that the Legislature intended to adopt the extra-statutory remedy imposed by the <em>Stewart </em>Court. We decline to impose on the Legislature any such <em>duty </em>to \u201cclearly show\u201d its intention to repudiate any judicial construction with which it disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">As we have recently explained in <em>People v Hawkins, </em>468 Mich 488; 688 NW2d 602 (2003), the reenactment rule cannot be used as a tool to circumvent the plain and unambiguous language of a statute. Nothing in the language of MCL 791.240a indicates the Legislature\u2019s intent to adopt the <em>Stewart </em>Court\u2019s holding that the parole board waives its right to pursue parole violation charges by failing to conduct a hearing within the statutory period. While the dissent opines that the Legislature\u2019s failure to affirmatively limit the holding in <em>Stewart </em>is indicative of its approval of that holding, an equally plausible conclusion to be drawn from the Legislature\u2019s silence is that it intended to <em>reject </em>the <em>Stewart </em>Court\u2019s analysis. See <em>Hawkins, supra </em>at 502-503 n 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">\u201c[0]ur most fundamental principle of statutory construction [is] that there is no room for judicial interpretation when the Legislature\u2019s intent can be ascertained from the statute\u2019s plain and unambiguous language.\u201d <em>Hawkins, supra </em>at 510. Because there is no clear indication in the language of MCL 791.240a(l) that the Legislature intended to either adopt or repu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>diate the <em>Stewart </em>Court\u2019s imposition of an extra-statutory remedy for a violation of that statute, we decline to apply the reenactment rule in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">C. APPROPRIATE REMEDY FOR A VIOLATION OF MCL 791.240a(l)</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Where an official has a clear legal duty to act and fails to do so, the appropriate remedy is an order of mandamus. See <em>In re MCI, </em>460 Mich 396, 442-443; 596 NW2d 164 (1999); <em>Lickfeldt v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>247 Mich App 299, 302; 636 NW2d 272 (2001).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Where, as here, the Legislature has established a clear, ministerial duty, but has failed to prescribe any consequence for a violation of that duty, a plaintiff may seek a writ of mandamus to compel compliance with the statutory duty. Accordingly, we agree with the suggestion of the Court of Appeals in this case\u2014 and in <em>Lane, </em>2 Mich App 144 \u2014 that the proper remedy for the failure to hold a timely hearing as required by MCL 791.240a(l) is a complaint for an order of mandamus rather than for a writ of habeas corpus.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">Because nothing in the text of MCL 791.240a or the remainder of the statutory scheme governing paroles indicates a legislative intent that a violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>forty-five-day time limit established by MCL 791.240a(l) requires the discharge of a prisoner, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the order of the parole board revoking plaintiffs parole. The appropriate remedy for a violation of the forty-five-day requirement is a writ of mandamus. To the extent that this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Stewart </em>and <em>Lane </em>conflict with today\u2019s holding, they are overruled.</p>\n<judges id=\"b759-4\">Corrigan, C.J., and Taylor and Markman, JJ., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b748-7\"> MCL 791.240a(l) provides in part that \u201c[wjithin 45 days after a paroled prisoner has been returned or is available for return to a state correctional facility under accusation of a parole violation . . the prisoner is entitled to a fact-finding hearing on the charges . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b748-8\"> Plaintiffs prior parole violations included an incident in which he punched and threatened a woman; cocaine use; and failure to report to his parole officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b749-6\"> Plaintiff was subsequently convicted in the Washtenaw Circuit Court of fourth-degree fleeing and eluding in violation of MCL 750.479a(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b749-7\"> Apparently, plaintiff\u2019s only mitigation evidence pertained to the dismissed third count of the parole violation warrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b750-7\"> The ale noted: \u201cParolee is a drug offender who has previously violated his parole on charges of assault, using cocaine, failing to enter treatment, and absconding.

The fact-finding hearing may be held at a state correctional facility or at or near the location of the alleged violation.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>In <em>Stewart v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>382 Mich 474, 477; 170 NW2d 16 (1969), this Court considered the predecessor of MCL 791.240a, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>\u201cWhenever a paroled prisoner is accused of a violation of his parole, other than the commission of, and conviction for, a felony or misdemeanor under the laws of this state, he shall be entitled to a fair and impartial hearing of such charges within 30 days before 2 members of the parole board under such rules and regulations as the parole board may adopt. Upon such hearing such paroled prisoner shall be allowed to be heard by counsel of his own choice, at his own expense, and may defend himself, and he shall have the right to produce witnesses and proofs in his favor and to meet the witnesses who are produced against him.\u201d [MCL 791.240.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Stewart\u2019s parole agent submitted a parole-violation report charging that the plaintiff had unlawfully absconded from the jurisdiction, and a parole-violation warrant was issued. Subsequently, the plaintiff pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge in St. Louis, Missouri. He was released to the custody of the Michigan Parole Board, which denied his request for a formal hearing. The parole board\u2019s reasoning for denying the hearing was that the evidence Stewart proposed to offer would be \u201c \u2018incompetent, immaterial, and unduly repetitious,\u2019 \u201d given that he had already admitted his guilt on some of the charges. <em>Stewart, supra </em>at 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">This Court agreed with the Court of Appeals analysis rejecting defendant\u2019s interpretation of the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-6\">\u201cIn our [the Court of Appeals] opinion the parole board misreads the statute. An alleged parole violator (other than one accused of the commission of, and conviction for, a felony or misdemeanor \u2018under the laws of this State\u2019) is entitled to a fair and impartial hearing within 30 days, at such hearing to be heard by counsel and to produce witnesses and proofs in his favor and to meet the witnesses produced against him, without regard to whether he admits his guilt. The statute provides that all such alleged parole violators, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>not merely those that deny guilt, are entitled to such a hearing. The petitioner asserts he requested such a hearing which assertion was neither denied in the affidavit filed in response to the original petition or in the attorney general\u2019s briefs filed in response to petitioner\u2019s complaint and our order. Those responses merely state that the petitioner\u2019s rights were explained to him, that he freely admitted his guilt, and therefore it was not necessary to conduct a hearing.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 478.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">The Court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-5\">We agree with the Court of Appeals\u2019 rejection of defendant\u2019s construction of the statute applicable to this appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-6\">We affirm the [decision of the] Court of Appeals. <em>The failure of the parole board to conduct the hearing provided for by the statute within SO days constituted, in effect, a waiver of any claim based upon these violations since the alleged violations were not \u201ca felony or misdemeanor under the laws of this state.\u201d </em>We further conclude that, under these circumstances, the plaintiff is entitled to be discharged from prison but he will remain under the jurisdiction of the parole board as per their order of December 9, 1966. <em>[Id. </em>at 479 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">The version of the statute at issue in <em>Stewart, </em>MCL 791.240, was repealed by 1968 PA 192.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, at the same time that it was repealed, the substance of that provision was reenacted in MCL 791.240a. The 1968 version of this provision stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-8\">Within 30 days after a paroled prisoner has been returned to a state penal institution under accusation of a violation of his parole, other than the conviction for a felony or mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>demeanor punishable by imprisonment in any jail, a state or federal prison under the laws of this state, the United States or any other state or territory of the United States, he shall be entitled to a hearing on such charges before 2 members of the parole board. Hearings shall be conducted in accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the director, and the accused prisoner shall be given an opportunity to appear personally or with counsel and answer to the charges placed against him. [1968 PA 192.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Subsequent amendments of MCL 791.240a have taken effect in 1982, 1985, and 1994. The 1982 amendments are especially relevant because they altered the time requirement for the formal hearing, increasing it from thirty days after a paroled prisoner has been returned or is available to forty-five days after a paroled prisoner has been returned or is available. The 1982 version of MCL 791.240a(l) stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-7\">Within 45 days after a paroled prisoner has been returned or is available for return to a state penal institution under accusation of a violation of parole, other than the conviction for a felony or misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment under the laws of this state, the United States, or any other state or territory of the United States, the prisoner is entitled to a fact-finding hearing on the charges before 1 member of the parole board or an attorney hearings officer designated by the chairperson of the parole board. The fact-finding hearing shall be conducted only after the accused parolee has had a reasonable amount of time to prepare a defense. The fact-finding hearing may be held at a state penal institution or at or near the location of the alleged violation. [1982 PA 314.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>No revisions were made to the statute, as it was reenacted in 1982, to limit this Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Stewart </em>that the failure to conduct the formal hearing within the requisite time constitutes a waiver of any claim based on the alleged parole violations, nor have any such revisions been made in amendments after the 1982 version of MCL 791.240a. While this Court has disavowed the doctrine of legislative acquiescence in previous cases,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> this case represents something more than legislative acquiescence, or discerning legislative intent from the Legislature\u2019s failure to take any action. In the present case, the Legislature has acted several times to reenact and revise the statute, even increasing the time limit for the fact-finding hearing from thirty days to forty-five days. However, none of the subsequent revisions to the statute since <em>Stewart </em>was decided can be construed as limiting this Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Stewart </em>that the failure to conduct the formal hearing within the requisite time constitutes a waiver of any claim based on the alleged parole violations. The Legislature is presumed to know \u201cthat when a statute, clause or provision thereof, has been construed by the court of last resort of this State and the same is substantially re-enacted the legislature adopts such construction, unless the contrary is clearly shown by the language of the act.\u201d <em>Jeruzal v Wayne Co Drain Comm\u2019r, </em>350 Mich 527, 534; 87 NW2d 122 (1957).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The language used by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>Legislature in subsequent revisions of the provision at issue does not clearly show an intention to undo this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Stewart.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Therefore, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals and order that the stay imposed on February 22, 2002, be lifted and that plaintiff be discharged from prison and returned to the jurisdiction of the parole board.</p>\n<judges id=\"b766-7\">Kelly, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b759-7\"> MCL 791.240a requires that the hearing be held within forty-five days after a paroled prisoner has been returned or is available for return to a state correctional facility.

The hearing was held May 16, 2001.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b760-8\"> The statute further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-9\">(2) An accused parolee shall be given written notice of the charges against him or her and the time, place, and purpose of the fact-finding hearing. At the fact-finding hearing, the accused parolee may be represented by an appointed or retained attorney and is entitled to the following rights:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-10\">(a) Full disclosure of the evidence against him or her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>(b) To testify and present relevant witnesses and documentary evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-5\">(c) To confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses unless the person conducting the fact-finding hearing finds on the record that a witness is subject to risk of harm if his or her identity is revealed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-6\">(d) To present other relevant evidence in mitigation of the charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-7\">(3) A fact-finding hearing may be postponed for cause beyond the 45-day time limit on the written request of the parolee, the parolee\u2019s attorney, or, if a postponement of the preliminary hearing has been granted beyond the 10-day time limit, by the parole board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-8\">(4) If the evidence presented is insufficient to support the allegation that a parole violation occurred, the parolee shall be reinstated to parole status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-9\">(5) If the parole board member or hearings officer conducting the fact-finding hearing determines from a preponderance of the evidence that a parole violation has occurred, the member or hearings officer shall present the relevant facts to the parole board and make a recommendation as to the disposition of the charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-10\">(6) If a preponderance of the evidence supports the allegation that a parole violation occurred, the parole board may revoke parole, and the parolee shall be provided with a written statement of the findings of fact and the reasons for the determination within 60 days after the paroled prisoner has been returned or is available for return to a state correctional facility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-11\">(7) A parolee who is ordered to make restitution under the crime victim\u2019s rights act, Act No. 87 of the Public Acts of 1985, being sections 780.751 to 780.834 of the Michigan Complied Laws, or the code of criminal procedure, Act No. 175 of the Public Acts of 1927, being sections 760.1 to 776.21 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, or to pay an assessment ordered under section 5 of Act No. 196 of the Public Acts of 1989, being section 780.905 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, as a condition of parole may have his or her parole revoked by the parole board if the parolee fails to comply with the order and if the parolee has not made a good faith effort to comply with the order. In determining whether to revoke parole, the parole board shall consider the parolee\u2019s employment status, earning ability, and financial resources, the willfulness of the parolee\u2019s failure to comply with the order, and any other special circumstances that may have a bearing on the parolee\u2019s ability to comply with the order.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b763-9\"> Although <em>Stewart </em>was decided in 1969, after the repeal of MCL 791.240, the issue before the Court at that time was the proper interpretation of MCL 791.240 because the alleged parole violations at issue in <em>Stewart </em>occurred in 1967, before the repeal and subsequent reenactment of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b764-8\"> One of the primary differences between the 1968 version of MCL 791.240a and its predecessor, MCL 791.240, is that the 1968 version of MCL 791.240a also included an exception for misdemeanor and felony convictions in jurisdictions other than the state of Michigan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b765-4\"> See <em>Donajkowski v Alpena Power Co, </em>460 Mich 243, 258-262; 596 NW2d 574 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b765-5\"> See also <em>Smith v Detroit, </em>388 Mich 637, 650-651; 202 NW2d 300 (1972) (\u201c \u2018Even more persuasive is the rule that where the basic provisions of a statute have been construed by the courts and these provisions are subsequently reenacted by the legislature, it may be assumed that the legislature acted with knowledge of the Court\u2019s decisions and that the legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>intended the reenacted statute to carry the Court\u2019s interpretation with it.\u2019 \u201d Quoting <em>Breckon v Franklin Fuel Co, </em>383 Mich 251, 295; 174 NW2d 836 [1970] [Adams, J., dissenting]); <em>Sheppard v Michigan Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>348 Mich 577, 631-632; 83 NW2d 614 (1957) (Chief Justice Dethmers,, concurring, wrote \u201cWhere a statutory provision is re-enacted without change in language, it must be presumed that the action was taken in the light of prior judicial construction placed upon it and with the intent to adopt such construction.
