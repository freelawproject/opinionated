The statement did not qualify for admission under MRE 803A, the tender-years rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">We conclude that the trial court properly admitted the statement. MRE 803(24) permits the admission of hearsay statements that narrowly miss the categorical exceptions of MRE 803, but satisfy the requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>of MRE 803(24), under circumstances such as those present in this case. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">A jury convicted defendant of three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, sexual penetration of a victim under thirteen years of age (CSC i). MCL 750.520b(l)(a). The Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">A. THE TRIAL COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">In the trial court, the prosecution charged defendant with the sexual assaults of a seven-year-old boy (DD) and his five-year-old sister (AD) in the autumn of 1998. Defendant lived in a home with the children, their mother, her ex-husband, and another individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">Before trial, the prosecutor moved to admit the testimony of Angela Bowman, a child-protective-services specialist with the Family Independence Agency (fia). During the hearing, Bowman testified that she had visited DD at his elementary school after the fia received an anonymous report that the children\u2019s mother was physically abusing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">In the course of their conversation, Bowman asked DD to name the members of his household. He named defendant as a relative and spontaneously told Bowman that defendant was doing \u201cnasty stuff\u201d to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">Bowman further testified that, when she asked DD what he meant by nasty stuff, he was initially guarded, but, then, made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>[Defendant] would come into his room, which [DD] shared with his sister [AD] and dis \u2014 totally disrobed, and take off his clothes, which would be a shirt, an underwear \u2014 some underwear or pajamas bottoms, if he were wearing them, and get on top of [DD]. And I ask \u2014 I asked him to describe now \u2014 at the time, because I wasn\u2019t prepared for this interview, I didn\u2019t have any anatomically correct dolls or anything, so I ask him to show \u2014 to demonstrate to the best of his ability what he was describing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Bowman related the details of this and numerous other specific instances of defendant\u2019s abuse as DD had revealed them to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The prosecution conceded that DD\u2019s statement to Bowman was not admissible under the tender-years exception to the hearsay rule, MRE 803A, because it was his second statement about the abuse. Defendant argued that MRE 803A \u201ccovers the field,\u201d meaning that, if a statement falls in the category of a tender-years statement and is inadmissible under MRE 803A, it cannot be admitted under MRE 803(24).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The trial court rejected defendant\u2019s argument and admitted the evidence under MRE 803(24). In ruling that DD\u2019s statements satisfied the requirements of MRE 803(24), the court stated: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Bowman first inquired of [DD] about physical abuse. Then, [DD,] and in this Court\u2019s opinion this is important, not in response to any questioning by Miss Bowman regarding sexual abuse, spontaneously spoke about abuse \u2014 sexual abuse by the defendant. It\u2019s <em>clear that </em>[DD] spoke from his personal knowledge. And, as her duty as a protective service worker, Miss Bowman inquired further. Now, Miss Bowman\u2019s qualifications to interview children were obvious from the record. She is aware of how to . . . interview children. She testified that she avoided leading questions and avoided other pitfalls of questioning young children. And the Court finds that she was totally aware how to get truthful information from [DD]. The Court finds that the record and the dynamics of this exchange between Miss Bowman and [DD] provided a form [sic] that an accurate statement would be uttered by [DD], The Court finds no plan of falsification by [DD] under the circumstances in the record that I have before me, and no \u2014 and I do find a lack of motive to fabricate on the child\u2019s part. The Court also notes that Miss Bowman testified, and I believe her testimony, she had no preconceived notion that anything of a sexual nature occurred when she walked into the room on October 27, [19] 97. Indeed, as I\u2019ve stated before, she was there to talk about physical abuse.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>[I]n the Court\u2019s opinion there are several indicia of trustworthiness in the statements given by [DD] to Miss Bowman. First is the spontaneity of [DD\u2019s] first statements to Miss Bowman. Recall \u2014 The Court\u2019s [sic] heard the testimony, that Miss Bowman was not there to talk about sexual abuse, she was there to talk about physical abuse. I would also note that as far as this Court\u2019s record is concerned [DD and AD\u2019s mother] did not know that her child was going to be interviewed on October 27. Accordingly, there doesn\u2019t appear to be anything on the record here which would establish that somehow [DD] was prepped by somebody to mouth sentences to Miss Bowman that were not true. Miss</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>M= * *</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Accordingly, the Court finds \u2014 from the totality of the circumstances here, I find the required trustworthiness guarantees that [MRE] 803(24) requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">B. THE COURT OF APPEALS</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">On appeal, defendant again contended that DD\u2019s statement to Bowman was not admissible under MRE 803(24). He urged that the Court adopt what has been dubbed the \u201cnear-miss\u201d theory, which \u201cmaintains that a hearsay statement that is close to, but that does not fit precisely into, a recognized hearsay exception is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>not admissible under [the residual hearsay exception.]\u201d <em>United States v Deeb, </em>13 F3d 1532, 1536 (CA 11, 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The Court of Appeals rejected the near miss-theory and defendant\u2019s narrow interpretation of MRE 803(24) and, instead, adopted the approach taken by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in <em>United States v Earles, </em>113 F3d 796 (CA 8, 1997):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">The meaning of the catch-all\u2019s \u201cspecifically covered\u201d language has caused considerable debate. See, e.g., <em>McKethan v United States, </em>439 US 936; 99 S Ct 333; 58 L Ed 2d 333 (1978) (Justices Stewart and Marshall dissenting from the Court\u2019s denial of writs of certiorari and contending that the Court should resolve the circuit split on this issue[.]). However, the majority of circuit courts have held that the phrase \u201cspecifically covered\u201d means only that if a statement is <em>admissible </em>under one of the prior exceptions, such prior subsection should be relied upon instead of [the residual hearsay exception]. If, on the other hand, the statement is <em>inadmissible </em>under the other exceptions, these courts allow the testimony to be considered for admission under [the residual hearsay exception], [248 Mich App 282, 292; 639 NW2d 815 (2001), quoting <em>Earles, supra </em>at 800 (emphasis in 248 Mich App 292).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Defendant next argued that DD\u2019s statement did not meet two of the requirements of MRE 803(24). Specifically, (1) the evidence did not possess \u201cequivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d and (2) it was not more probative than DD\u2019s first statement about the abuse, which was made to his mother before the Bowman interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">The Court of Appeals rejected the first challenge, stating that it agreed with the trial court\u2019s \u201cthorough and well-reasoned assessment that DD\u2019s statement implicating defendant in these crimes contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>ample \u2018circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness\u2019 as required by MRE 803(24).\u201d 248 Mich App 297. Regarding DD\u2019s statements to his mother, the panel found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">there is no indication in the record that either DD or AD recounted the circumstances of the assaults with the same detail. Nor is there any indication that their alleged statements to their mother contained particularized guarantees of trustworthiness similar to those regarding the statement given to Bowman. Indeed, when defense counsel inquired of the mother during trial regarding her knowledge of the alleged sexual abuse, she indicated only that AD had told the children\u2019s uncle about the abuse, who in turn told the mother . . . .\" <em>[Id. </em>at 299-300.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Accordingly, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s admission of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">n. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">The decision whether to admit evidence is within a trial court\u2019s discretion. This Court reverses it only where there has been an abuse of discretion. <em>People v Lukity, </em>460 Mich 484, 488; 596 NW2d 607 (1999). However, the decision frequently involves a preliminary question of law, such as whether a rule of evidence or statute precludes the admission of the evidence. We review questions of law de novo. Id; <em>People v Starr, </em>457 Mich 490, 494; 577 NW2d 673 (1998). Therefore, when such preliminary questions are at issue, we will find an abuse of discretion when a trial court admits evidence that is inadmissible as a matter of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>m. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The Michigan Rules of Evidence contain two residual exceptions: MRE 803(24) and MRE 804(b)(7). MRE 803(24), the exception at issue here, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">(24) Other Exceptions. A statement not specifically covered by any of the foregoing exceptions but having equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness, if the court determines that (A) the statement is offered as evidence of a material fact, (B) the statement is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence that the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts, and (C) the general purposes of these rules and the interests of justice will best be served by admission of the statement into evidence. However, a statement may not be admitted under this exception unless the proponent of the statement makes known to the adverse party, sufficiently in advance of the trial or hearing to provide the adverse party with a fair opportunity to prepare to meet it, the proponent\u2019s intention to offer the statement and the particulars of it, including the name and address of the declarant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Thus, evidence offered under MRE 803(24) must satisfy four elements to be admissible: (1) it must have circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness equal to the categorical exceptions, (2) it must tend to establish a material fact, (3) it must be the most probative evidence on that fact that the offering party could produce through reasonable efforts, and (4) its admission must serve the interests of justice. Also, the offering party must give advance notice of intent to introduce the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>MRE 803(24) is nearly identical to FRE 807.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cThe Michigan Rules of Evidence were based on the Federal Rules of Evidence.\u201d <em>People v Kreiner, </em>415 Mich 372, 378; 329 NW2d 716 (1982). As a result, Michigan courts have referred to federal cases interpreting rules of evidence when there is a dearth of related Michigan case law. See, e.g., <em>People v VanderVliet, </em>444 Mich 52, 60 n 7; 508 NW2d 114 (1993); <em>People v Welch, </em>226 Mich App 461, 466; 574 NW2d 682 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Given that Michigan did not adopt residual exceptions to its rules of evidence until 1996, there is little case law interpreting them. Before this case, no Michigan court had considered whether evidence that is similar to a categorical hearsay exception could still be admitted under one of the residual exceptions. Therefore, it is appropriate to consider the federal courts\u2019 discussions of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>A. THE RESIDUAL EXCEPTIONS AND THEIR APPLICATION IN \u201cNEAR MISS\u201d SITUATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The residual exceptions are designed to be used as safety valves in the hearsay rules. They will allow evidence to be admitted that is not \u201cspecifically covered\u201d by any of the categorical hearsay exceptions under circumstances dictated by the rules. Differing interpretations of the words \u201cspecifically covered\u201d have sparked the current debate over the admissibility of evidence that is factually similar to a categorical hearsay exception, but not admissible under it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">1. THE NEAR-MISS THEORY</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">\u201cThe Near Miss theory . . . states that a piece of hearsay evidence may be offered only under the exception that most nearly describes it. If it is excluded under that exception, it may not be offered under the residua] exceptions.\u201d <em>In re Japanese Electronic Products Antitrust </em>Litigation, 723 F2d 238, 302 (CA 3, 1983), rev\u2019d on other grounds <em>Matsushita Electric Industrial Co, Ltd v Zenith Radio Corp, </em>475 US 574, 580; 106 S Ct 1348; 89 L Ed 2d 538 (1986). Judge Easterbrook gave a concise statement of the rationale behind the near-miss theory in his concurring opinion in <em>United States v Dent, </em>984 F2d 1453, 1465-1466 (CA 7, 1993):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">[The residual exception] reads more naturally if we understand the introductory clause to mean that evidence of a kind specifically addressed (\u201ccovered\u201d) by one of the [categorical exceptions] must satisfy the conditions laid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>down for its admission, and that other kinds of evidence not covered (because the drafters could not be exhaustive) are admissible if the evidence is approximately as reliable as evidence that would be admissible under the [categorical exceptions].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania described another basis for the theory in <em>Zenith Radio Corp v Matsushita Electric Industrial Co, Ltd, </em>505 F Supp 1190 (ED Penn, 1980):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\">The [near-miss theory] is also supported by a basic principle of statutory construction, which we find equally applicable to the Federal Rules of Evidence: that the specific controls the general. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Radzanower v Touche Ross &amp; Co, </em>426 US 148, 153, 48 L Ed 2d 540, 96 S Ct 1989 (1976):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">\u201cIt is a basic principle of <em>statutory construction </em>that a statute dealing with a narrow, precise, and specific subject is not submerged by a later enacted statute covering a more generalized spectrum. \u2018Where there is no clear intention otherwise, a specific statute will not be controlled or nullified by a general one, regardless of the priority of enactment.\u2019 <em>Morton v Mancari, </em>417 US 535, 550-551 (1974).\u201d [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">In conformity with this rule we conclude that the residual exceptions cannot be invoked when there is a specific exception which sets forth conditions governing the admissibility of a clearly defined category of hearsay evidence. <em>[Zenith, supra </em>at 1263 n 91 (discussing former FRE 803[24] before the adoption of FRE 807).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">Thus, the near-miss theory is based on a broad reading of the term \u201cspecifically covered.\u201d Evidence is \u201cspecifically covered\u201d if there is a categorical hearsay exception dealing with the same subject matter or type of evidence. Accordingly, under the near-miss theory, a party could never use a residual exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>to admit evidence that was inadmissible under, but related to, a categorical exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">For example, a strict application of this theory would preclude admission of a business document unless it met the requirements of MRE 803(6). The residual exception would not be available for it under any circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Although the near-miss theory would simplify the resolution of disputes regarding the admission of hearsay, few courts in the nation have adopted it. Those that have done so have softened the rule.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Even the <em>Zenith </em>court declined to hold that the residual exception could never be used to admit evidence that fell within a categorical exception, but was inadmissible under it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">Some of the . . . specific hearsay exceptions similarly apply to a clearly defined category of evidence, and we would follow the \u201cnear miss\u201d doctrine with respect to them ... if the evidence before us were within those categories. E.g., Rule 803(18) (learned treatises); Rule 803(22) (judgment of previous conviction.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">However, most of the hearsay exceptions which plaintiffs invoke are not of this type. They do not apply to a clearly defined category of evidence, as the former testimony exception does. Instead, they apply to a relatively amorphous category of evidence which is delimited solely by the requirements set forth in the rule itself. For instance, the business records exception applies to any \u201cmemorandum, report, record, or data compilation, in any form\u201d which satisfies certain additional requirements. <em>... We do not see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number><em>how the \u201cnear miss\u201d doctrine which defendants urge could practically be applied to those rules, without negating the residual exceptions altogether, a result which is plainly contrary to the intent of Congress. [Id. </em>at 1264 (emphasis added), accord <em>Acme Printing Ink Co v Menard, Inc, </em>812 F Supp 1498, 1527 (ED Wis, 1992).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">2. REJECTING THE NEAR-MISS THEORY</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The great majority of courts have rejected the near-miss theoiy by interpreting the residual exception to omit as \u201cspecifically covered\u201d <em>only those hearsay statements admissible under a categorical exception. </em>A statement not admissible under the categorical exceptions would not be \u201cspecifically covered\u201d by those exceptions, and thus could be a candidate for admissibility under the residual exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">In <em>United States v </em>Clarke,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit explained the rationale for rejecting the near-miss theory.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-9\">Appellant asks us to construe \u201cnot specifically covered\u201d narrowly, limiting [the residual exceptions] to cases in no way touched by one of the [categorical] exceptions. According to appellant, admitting testimony that was a \u201cnear miss\u201d under 804(B)(1) would undermine the protections of the evidentiary rales, as well as violate the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-10\">We disagree. Appellant\u2019s view of \u201cnot specifically covered\u201d would effectively render [the residual exception] a nullity. The plain meaning, and the purpose, of [the residual exception] do not permit such a narrow reading. <em>We believe that \u201cspecifically covered\u201d means exactly what it says: if a statement does not meet all of the requirements for admissibility under one of the prior exceptions, then it is not </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number><em>\u201cspecifically covered. \u201d United States v. Fernandez, </em>892 F2d 976, 981 (11th Cir. 1989). This reading is consistent with the purposes of [the residual exception]. That rule rejects formal categories in favor of a functional inquiry into trustworthiness, thus permitting the admission of statements that fail the strict requirements of the prior exceptions, but are nonetheless shown to be reliable. If we were to adopt appellant\u2019s reading of the rule, we would deprive the jury of probative evidence relevant to the jury\u2019s truth-seeking role.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">... To adopt the \u201cnear miss\u201d theory would create an odd situation where testimony that was equally trustworthy would be distinguishable based merely on its proximity to a specified exception. For instance, in <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>951 F.2d 580 (4th Cir. 1991), this circuit approved the admission of the statement made by a later-deceased witness pursuant to a plea agreement under 804(b)(5), even though that statement was very different from any of the specified exceptions. Given our holding in <em>Ellis, </em>it would contradict common sense to exclude equally reliable testimony here simply because it fell closer to one of the specified exceptions. We thus reject the \u201cnear miss\u201d theory of interpreting Fed. R. Evid. 803(24) and 804(b)(5). <em>[Clarke, </em>2 F3d 83-84 (emphasis added) (discussing the former residual exceptions before the adoption of FRE 807).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit followed suit in <em>United States v Laster,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">Although some courts have held that if proffered evidence fails to meet the requirements of the Fed. R. Evid. 803 hearsay exception, it cannot qualify for admission under the residual exception, the court declines to adopt this narrow interpretation of Fed. R. Evid. 807 as suggested by defendants. Rather, this court interprets Fed. R. Evid. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>807, along with, the majority of circuits, to mean that \u201cif a statement is admissible under one of the hearsay exceptions, that exception should be relied on instead of the residual exception.\u201d 5 Jack B. Weinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger, Weinstein\u2019s Federal Evidence \u00a7 807.03(4) (2d ed. 2000). We endorse the reasoning in <em>United States v </em>Earles, 113 F3d 796 (8th Cir, 1997), which held that \u201cthe phrase \u2018specifically covered\u2019 [by a hearsay exception] means only that if a statement is <em>admissible </em>under one of the [residual] exceptions, such [] subsection should be relied upon\u201d instead of the residual exception. <em>Id. </em>at 800 (emphasis in original). Therefore, the analysis of a hearsay statement should not end when a statement fails to qualify as a prior inconsistent statement, but should be evaluated under the residual hearsay exception. <em>[Laster, </em>258 F3d 530.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">In this case, the Court of Appeals followed the weight of the authority and rejected the near-miss theory. Because we agree that the language of the rule does not support the near-miss theory, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">3. OUR APPROACH TO THE RESIDUAL EXCEPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">We agree with the majority of the federal courts and conclude that a hearsay statement is \u201cspecifically covered\u201d by another exception for purposes of MRE 803(24) only when it is admissible under that exception. Therefore, we decline to adopt the near-miss theory as part of our method for determining when hearsay statements may be admissible under MRE 803(24).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">In our view, the arguments in favor of the near-miss theory are unpersuasive and do not conform to the language of the rule. <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1995) defines \u201ccover\u201d as \u201c8. to deal with or provide for; address: <em>The rules cover </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number><em>working conditions\" </em>(Emphasis in original.) Therefore, a rule concerning the same subject matter as a piece of evidence, or from a similar source, arguably could be said to \u201ccover\u201d that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">If the rule applied to all evidence not \u201ccovered\u201d by other exceptions, the near-miss theory would be more persuasive.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, the rule modifies the term \u201ccovered\u201d with the adjective \u201cspecifically.\u201d Hence, more than simple \u201ccoverage\u201d is required. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th ed) defines \u201cspecific\u201d as \u201c1. Of, relating to, or designating a particular or defined thing; explicit .... 2. Of or relating to a particular named <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>thing .... 3. <em>Conformable to specific requirements </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Reading the words \u201cspecifically covered\u201d together and giving each its normally understood meaning, we conclude that to be \u201cspecifically covered\u201d requires <em>more </em>than to be \u201ccovered.\u201d Since \u201cspecific\u201d can mean \u201cconformable to specific requirements\u201d and \u201ccover\u201d can mean \u201caddressing\u201d or \u201cdealing with,\u201d we understand that a statement is only \u201cspecifically covered\u201d by a categorical exception when it is <em>conformable to all the requirements of that categorical exception.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>To hold otherwise would read \u201cspecifically\u201d out of the rule.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>We also disagree with the <em>Zenith </em>court that interpreting the residual exceptions in this manner will \u201cnullify\u201d the categorical exceptions. Indeed, by their own language the residual exceptions cannot apply to statements admissible under the other exceptions. Moreover, the requirements of the exceptions are stringent and will rarely be met, alleviating concerns that the residual exceptions will \u201cswallow\u201d the categorical exceptions through overuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">We stress that this interpretation of the residual exceptions does not subvert the purpose of the hearsay rules. Each of the categorical exceptions requires a quantum of trustworthiness and each reflects instances in which courts have historically recognized that the required trustworthiness is present.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The residual exceptions require <em>equivalent </em>guarantees of trustworthiness. Thus, if a near-miss statement is deficient in one or more requirements of a categorical exception, those deficiencies must be made up by alternate indicia of trustworthiness. To be admitted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>residual hearsay must reach the same quantum of reliability as categorical hearsay; simply, it must do so in different ways.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Thus, we affirm that the residual exceptions may be used to admit statements that are similar to, but not admissible under, the categorical hearsay exceptions. Next, we turn our attention to the requirements of the residual exceptions themselves. We focus on MRE 803(24), the applicable exception in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The language of MRE 803(24) provides substantial guidance in determining the proper method of analysis. As we noted above, the rule contains four elements. To be admitted under MRE 803(24), a hearsay statement must: (1) demonstrate circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness equivalent to the categorical exceptions, (2) be relevant to a material fact, (3) be the most probative evidence of that fact reasonably available, and (4) serve the interests of justice by its admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">The first and most important requirement is that the proffered statement have circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness equivalent to those of the categorical hearsay exceptions. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit noted in <em>Clarke, </em>\u201cthe inquiry into trustworthiness aligns with the inquiry demanded by the Confrontation Clause, which requires courts to examine the \u2018totality of the circumstances that surround the making of the state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>ment\u2019 for \u2018particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clarke, supra </em>at 84. Thus, courts should consider the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d surrounding each statement to determine whether equivalent guarantees of trustworthiness exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">There is no complete list of factors that establish whether a statement has equivalent guarantees of trustworthiness.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, the Confrontation Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>forbids the use of corroborative evidence to determine the trustworthiness of statements offered under the residual exception in criminal cases if the declarant does not testify at trial. <em>Idaho v Wright, </em>497 US 805, 823; 110 S Ct 3139; 111 L Ed 2d 638 (1990).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Beyond this limitation, courts should consider all factors that add to or detract from the statement\u2019s reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The second requirement is self-explanatory. To be admissible under the residual exceptions, the proffered statements must be directly relevant to a material fact in the case. A material fact is \u201c[a] fact that is significant or essential to the issue or matter at hand.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th ed).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>The third requirement is that the proffered statement be the most probative evidence reasonably available to prove its point. It \u201cessentially creates a \u2018best evidence\u2019 requirement.\u201d <em>Larez, supra </em>at 644. This is a high bar and will effectively limit use of the residual exception to exceptional circumstances. For instance, nonhearsay evidence on a material fact will nearly always have more probative value than hearsay statements, because nonhearsay derives from firsthand knowledge. Thus, the residual exception normally will not be available if there is nonhearsay evidence on point.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The final requirement is that admission of the proffered statement conforms to the \u201crules [of evidence] and serve the interests of justice.\u201d Accordingly, a court may refuse to admit a statement into evidence, even though the first three requirements of the exception have been met. This may occur if the court determines that the purpose of the rules and the interests of justice will not be well served by the statement\u2019s admission.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Finally, we note that the facts of each case determine the answers to questions about the admissibility of evidence. Here, the trial court did an exemplary job of making clear and concise findings on the record. In order to facilitate review in the future, we ask that courts faced with MRE 803(24) questions of the type presented here make similarly explicit supportive findings on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>B. THE LOWER COURTS CORRECTLY APPLIED MRE 803(24) IN THIS CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">We now turn to the facts of this case. In order to invoke MRE 803(24), the proffered statement must \u201cnot [be] specifically covered by any of the foregoing exceptions\u201d of MRE 803. MRE 803(24). As described above, we interpret \u201cspecifically covered\u201d to mean \u201cadmissible.\u201d Defendant does not assert that DD\u2019s statement would be admissible under any of the MRE 803 categorical exceptions. Therefore, the statement is a proper candidate for admissibility under MRE 803(24).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">With respect to the rule\u2019s requirements, there is no dispute that the prosecution gave proper notice to defendant of its intent to submit DD\u2019s hearsay statements under MRE 803(24). Moreover, it cannot be disputed that DD\u2019s statements described the material facts of defendant\u2019s abusive acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The trial court made extensive findings on the record regarding DD\u2019s statement to Ms. Bowman and detailed the manner in which it satisfied each element of MRE 803(24). The court particularly elaborated on its findings regarding the trustworthiness of the statement, noting several times that its spontaneity and the fact it was unanticipated made it particularly reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>The trial court also noted that the timing of the statement negated any motive to fabricate. No investigation had begun when the statement was made, and no one knew that Ms. Bowman was to interview DD that day. Additionally, DD spoke from firsthand knowledge and in terms appropriate for a child of his age. Under the \u201ctotality\u201d of these circumstances, the court concluded that the statement had circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness equivalent to any of the categorical exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The trial court next found that DD\u2019s statement was the most probative evidence available concerning the actual abuse. DD did not anticipate the interview, and Ms. Bowman did not intentionally elicit incriminating information about someone other than the mother. Ms. Bowman also possessed the training to make a proper assessment of DD\u2019s credibility at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Defendant argues before this Court that DD\u2019s first corroborative statement, made to his mother, was more probative than his statement to Ms. Bowman. However, the record contains no information about what DD said to his mother. All that is known is that both parties stipulated at trial that DD\u2019s mother had asked him some questions about defendant\u2019s abuse <em>before </em>DD spoke to Ms. Bowman.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It is not possible to compare the value of a statement of known content with a statement of unknown content.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Moreover, the statement made to Ms. Bowman is more probative than DD\u2019s testimony at trial for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>same reasons that underscore the tender-years rule. As time goes on, a child\u2019s perceptions become more and more influenced by the reactions of the adults with whom the child speaks. It is for that reason that the tender-years rule prefers a child\u2019s first statement over later statements. By analogy, the child\u2019s second statement is preferable to still later statements. Similarly, if DD\u2019s mother had a motive to induce her son to lie, she would have had much more opportunity to influence him before trial than before the Bowman interview.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">In aggregate, the trial court found that these circumstances justified the admission of DD\u2019s statement under MRE 803(24). The spontaneity of the interview, lack of motive to lie, and Ms. Bowman\u2019s interviewing methods combine to give the statement circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness equivalent to the categorical exceptions. The unavailability of DD\u2019s first statement, the timing of the interview, and Ms. Bowman\u2019s careful conduct in eliciting information make this statement the most probative evidence of defendant\u2019s abusive acts. Having found that DD\u2019s statement met the first three requirements of MRE 803(24), the court concluded that admission would not endanger the interests of justice and ruled the statement admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">We agree with the Court of Appeals and hold that (1) the trial court properly analyzed DD\u2019s statement under MRE 803(24), and (2) there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s findings. Consequently, we conclude that the trial court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>abuse its discretion in admitting the statement under MRE 803(24), even though the statement was not admissible under MRE 803A.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The trial court properly admitted DD\u2019s statement to Ms. Bowman under MRE 803(24), although it did not qualify for admission under MRE 803A. All the elements of MRE 803(24) were satisfied. Accordingly, there was no abuse of discretion and we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b397-7\">Corrigan, C.J., and Weaver and Markman, JJ., concurred with Kelly, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b397-8\">Young, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq3J\">I disagree that evidence failing admissibility under one of the enumerated exceptions can nevertheless be admitted under the catch-all exception, MRE 803(24). Because the majority concludes otherwise, I respectfully dissent. I fully acknowledge that I advocate a minority position; however, I believe that this position best comports with the text of the residual hearsay exception as well as our time-honored prohibition against the admission of hearsay evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">The rule against the admissibility of hearsay is a venerable doctrine deeply rooted in our common law. The principle has been called \u201ca rule which may be esteemed, next to jury trial, the greatest contribution of that eminently practical legal system to the world\u2019s methods of procedure.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Traditionally, witnesses were required to be present at trial, be placed under oath, and be subject to cross-examination in order to testify. Under those circumstances, a witness\u2019s credibility, memory, perception, and narration could be evaluated by the trier of fact. 2 McCormick, Evidence (5th ed), Hearsay Rule, \u00a7 245, p 93. The rule against hearsay is designed to maintain the integrity of witness testimony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Over the years, a number of exceptions to the general rule prohibiting the admission of hearsay have been developed. Generally, the exceptions rest on the conclusion that the circumstances of the making of particular statement provide circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness. These guarantees are found because the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement minimize or negate the hearsay dangers, such as insincerity or failure of memory.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">In this case, the hearsay testimony at issue is specifically covered by MRE 803A, but cannot be admitted under that exception because, as the state concedes, the evidence was not the first corroborative statement regarding the incident. Accordingly, under the plain language of MRE 803(24), the evidence is \u201cspecifically covered\u201d by MRE 803A and <em>cannot </em>be admitted under MRE 803(24).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>The approach advanced by the majority subverts our historical prohibition against the admission of hearsay evidence. In the majority view, evidence that is clearly inadmissible under one of the enumerated hearsay exceptions gets a second chance at admissibility under the residual exception if, among other factors, \u201cthe interests of justice\u201d, MRE 803(24)(C), would be served by its admission. The criterion, particularly when coupled with the deferential abuse of discretion standard for appellate review,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> essentially renders the general prohibition against hearsay, and the development of what hearsay is excepted and not excepted, hollow and meaningless.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Against the nearly four hundred-year-old historical development of our hearsay rules, it is clear that the drafters of the rules did not intend a wholesale trampling of the enumerated hearsay exceptions when the federal residual hearsay exceptions were enacted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>The advisory committee noted that the residual exceptions \u201cdo not contemplate an unfettered exercise of judicial discretion, but they do provide for treating <em>new and presently unanticipated situations </em>which demonstrate a trustworthiness within the spirit of the specifically stated exceptions.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">In this case, DD\u2019s statement to Angela Bowman was not a <em>\u201cnew and presently unanticipated situation.\u201d </em>In fact, evidence of second and subsequent corroborative statements are specifically contemplated and explicitly rejected by the clear language of MRE 803(A) \u2014 \u201c [i]f the declarant made more than one corroborative statement about the incident, <em>only the first is admissible </em>under this rule.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">When construing a court rule, which includes a rule of evidence, this Court applies the legal principles that govern the construction of statutes. <em>McAuley v Gen Motors Corp, </em>457 Mich 513, 518; 578 NW2d 282 (1998). Accordingly, we begin with the plain language of the rule. When the language of the rule is unambiguous, we enforce the meaning expressed, without further judicial construction or interpretation. <em>Tryc v Michigan Veterans\u2019 Facility, </em>451 Mich 129, 135; 545 NW2d 642 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The majority treats the residual hearsay exception as if it read \u201cA statement not specifically <em>admissible </em>under any of the foregoing exceptions\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>\u201cspecifically covered.\u201d Clearly, the plain language of the rule does not support such a reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">This Court made deliberate choices in deciding what varieties of hearsay would be admissible and reflected those choices in the words of the hearsay exceptions. The line-drawing efforts reflected in the enumerated hearsay exceptions are rendered purposeless if hearsay that does not meet the textual requirements of a specific hearsay exception is alternatively admitted under the residual exception.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">I believe that the trial court erred in allowing the hearsay testimony to be admitted into evidence. Furthermore, I do not believe that the error was harmless. The testimony of the children at trial was at times vague and inconsistent, and the physical examination of the children was inconclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">While the alternative construction proffered by my colleagues in the majority is a principled one, I believe my construction best harmonizes with the actual text of the evidentiary rule as well as our general and historical prohibition against the admission of hearsay evidence. The clear language of the residual hearsay exception precludes admissibility where the evidence does not meet the specific textual requirements of an enumerated hearsay exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">I urge this Court to consider repealing MRE 803(24) and MRE 804(b)(5).</p>\n<judges id=\"b401-9\">Cavanagh and Taylor, JJ., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b380-7\"> FRE 803(24) contained one of the Federal Rules\u2019 residual exceptions until 1997. At that time, FRE 803(24) was combined with FRE 804(b)(5) and moved to FRE 807. FRE 807 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-8\">A statement not specifically covered by Rule 803 or 804 but having equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness, is not excluded by the hearsay rule, if the court determines that (A) the statement is offered as evidence of a material fact; (B) the statement is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence which the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts; and (C) the general purposes of these rules and the interests of justice will best be served by admission of the statement into evidence. However, a statement may not be admitted under this exception unless the proponent of it makes known to the adverse party sufficiently in advance of the trial or hearing to provide the adverse party with a fair opportunity to prepare to meet it, the proponent\u2019s intention to offer the statement and the particulars of it, including the name and address of the declarant.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b381-9\"> There is no doubt, of course, that statements completely alien to any of the categorical exceptions may be candidates for admission under the residual exceptions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b383-9\"> See <em>United States v Mejia-Valez, </em>855 F Supp 607, 617-618 (ED NY, 1994) (holding that defendant could not use the residual exception to admit hearsay statements from an available declarant when the covered exception required unavailability); <em>In re Fill, </em>68 BR 923, 931 (SD NY, 1987) (holding that \u201chighly unusual casejsj\u201d may be exempted from the near-miss theory).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"A_r\"><em> </em>2 F3d 81 (CA 4, 1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b385-9\"> 258 F3d 525 (CA 6, 2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b387-5\"> We do not hold, however, that similarity in subject matter or scope leads to the conclusion that a particular exception \u201ccovers\u201d evidence; we simply note that the near-miss theory would be more persuasive if the residual exception used the term \u201ccovered\u201d alone rather than \u201cspecifically covered.\u201d In fact, we note that at least one commentator has stated that a statement is <em>not </em>\u201ccovered\u201d by an exception if it is not admissible under that exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">Judge Easterbrook\u2019s literalism, while ingenious, assumes both an unconvincing clarity and a peculiar meaning of \u201ccovered.\u201d156 His complaint that the authors of the rule did not use the term \u201cadmissible\u201d ignores the fact that hearsay exceptions do not make evidence admissible.
