BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">Plaintiff Gwendolyn Collins was employed by defendant Comerica Bank as a customer-service representative. In August 1996, defendant<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> notified plaintiff that an investigation was being conducted to determine whether she had accepted cash gifts from customers or disclosed customer account balances to third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">On September 5, 1996, defendant suspended plaintiff, apparently for failing to cooperate with the investigation. While suspended, plaintiff was required to be available during normal working hours.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>investigation was completed, defendant terminated plaintiffs employment on September 25, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">On September 24, 1999, plaintiff filed a complaint alleging, inter alia, that the termination of her employment was the product of race and gender discrimination. Defendant moved for summary disposition on several grounds. One of the arguments advanced by defendant was that plaintiff failed to meet the applicable three-year period of limitation on filing discrimination claims, MCL 600.5805(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The circuit court denied the motion, concluding that plaintiffs causes of action for discriminatory termination arose on the date of termination, September 25, 1996. Therefore, plaintiffs filing of the complaint on September 24, 1999, satisfied the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">The Court of Appeals granted defendant interlocutory leave to appeal. Relying primarily on <em>Parker v Cadillac Gage Textron, Inc, </em>214 Mich App 288; 542 NW2d 365 (1995), the Court reversed the judgment of the circuit court, concluding that plaintiffs causes of action for discriminatory termination accrued on the last day plaintiff actually worked, September 5, 1996. Because plaintiff\u2019s complaint was filed on September 24, 1999, the Court of Appeals held that it was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">Plaintiff sought leave to appeal with this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>n. standard of review</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Whether a cause of action is barred by a statute of limitations is a question of law, which we review de novo. <em>Roberts v Mecosta Co Gen Hosp, </em>466 Mich 57, 62; 642 NW2d 663 (2002). Similarly, we review de novo decisions on summary disposition motions. <em>First Pub Corp v Parfet, </em>468 Mich 101, 104; 658 NW2d 477 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">m. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">In <em>Parker, </em>the plaintiffs were advised on December 3, 1990, that they would be among the next group of employees to be laid off pursuant to a work force reduction plan. On December 21, 1990, the plaintiffs worked their last day. However, the defendant\u2019s records indicated that the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201ceffective date of separation\u201d was January 7, 1991. The plaintiffs filed claims for discriminatory termination on January 7, 1994, and the defendant moved for summary disposition on the ground that the period of limitation had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Parker </em>rejected the proposition that the period of limitation on a discriminatory employment termination claim begins to run on the \u201ceffective date of separation,\u201d writing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-9\">A claim of discriminatory discharge accrues on the date the plaintiff is discharged. The last day worked is the date of discharge. Subsequent severance or vacation pay does not affect the date of discharge. In this case, plaintiffs filed their case more than three years after the date they were discharged. Despite the fact that January 7, 1991, <em>may have been </em>plaintiffs\u2019 \u201ceffective\u201d date of separation, it is undis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>puted that the last day they actually worked was December 21, 1990. <em>[Parker, supra </em>at 290 (internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Relying on <em>Parker, </em>the Court of Appeals in the present case held that plaintiffs causes of action for discriminatory termination accrued on the last day she actually performed work for defendant. Because plaintiff was a suspended employee on the date of her termination, the Court of Appeals held that the day of her suspension served as her last day worked and, according to <em>Parker, </em>the date of her discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Accordingly, the Court reversed the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition, disagreeing with the trial court that the applicable period of limitation began to run on the date plaintiff was actually terminated from employment as a result of the investigation. The Court of Appeals concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-7\">Because plaintiff\u2019s last day of work was September 5, 1996, claims of race and gender discrimination were required to be filed on or before September 5, 1999. Since plaintiff\u2019s complaint was not filed until September 24, 1999, her discrimination claims were time-barred and the trial court erred when it denied defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition on these claims. [Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued April 30, 2002 (Docket No. 227834), p 3.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">In sum, the Court of Appeals held that the limitation period for plaintiff\u2019s discrimination claims began to run on the date of her suspension, September 5, 1996, even though plaintiff\u2019s employment was not terminated until September 25, 1996. The Court did so because the last day plaintiff \u201cactually worked\u201d was the date of her suspension on September 5, 1996, and the Court read <em>Parker </em>as instructing that the last day worked is <em>always </em>the date of discharge. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>Properly understood, <em>Parker's </em>\u201clast day worked\u201d holding is limited to situations where a discriminatory discharge claim has already surfaced. We agree with <em>Parker's </em>holding because the \u201ceffective date of separation\u201d there was not the date of discharge. Rather, where a plaintiff has already been subjected to an alleged discriminatory termination, a cause of action naturally accrues on the last day an employee worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">However, if a discharge has yet to occur, it cannot be said that the last day worked represents the discharge date. Simply put, a claim for discriminatory discharge cannot arise until a claimant has been discharged. Accordingly, the \u201clast day worked\u201d cannot represent the date of discharge, as held in <em>Parker, </em>where a claimant\u2019s last day actually worked precedes the discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">In the present case, even though plaintiff was suspended on September 5, 1996, and in retrospect that date represents the last day she <em>actually worked, </em>it was not until September 25, 1996 that she was <em>actually discharged, </em>or terminated, from employment. Unlike the plaintiffs in <em>Parker </em>who knew on the last day they worked that their employment had been terminated and that they were being discharged as employees on that date, on September 5, 1996, plaintiff in this case only knew that she had been suspended indefinitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">On September 5, 1996, plaintiff had <em>not </em>been terminated and thus had no causes of action based on her discharge on that date. In fact, although it may have been a foregone conclusion that the investigation would lead to plaintiff\u2019s termination, it is clear that plaintiff\u2019s official status as an employee was nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>other than \u201csuspended\u201d until September 25, 1996, when her employment was terminated as a result of the investigation. \u201cSuspended\u201d does not equate with \u201cterminated\u201d or \u201cdischarged,\u201d and, thus, being suspended does not create a cause of action for discharge or termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Accordingly, plaintiffs causes of action for discriminatory termination had yet to arise on the date of her suspension, September 5, 1996, and the limitation period does not begin to run before a cause of action accrues. Plaintiff had no causes of action for discriminatory <em>termination </em>on September 5, 1996.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Because we hold that plaintiffs causes of action for discriminatory termination did not arise until the date she was discharged as an employee, September 25, 1996, plaintiffs filing of her complaint on September 24, 1999 satisfied the three-year period of limitation. Accordingly, the trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">For these reasons, we reverse in part the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand to that Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>all other respects, leave to appeal is denied.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b735-6\">Corrigan, C.J., and Weaver, Taylor, Young, and Markman, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b735-7\">Cavanagh and Kelly, JJ., concurred in the result only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b729-11\"> For ease of reference, defendants Comerica Bank and Cathy Masalskis will collectively be referred to as \u201cdefendant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b729-12\"> Plaintiff signed the following agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-13\">I, Gwen Collins, understand effective Thursday, Sept. 5, 1996, I am being suspended indefinitely with pay pending further investiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>tion.

Plaintiff has filed suit for discriminatory termination, not discriminatory suspension.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b734-10\"> Because the Court of Appeals dismissed plaintiff\u2019s discrimination claims on .the basis of a statute of limitations analysis, it did not address defendant Masalskis\u2019s alternative issue concerning whether she was prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>erly served. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals should address this matter on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b735-10\"> We do not disrupt the judgment of the Court of Appeals regarding the timeliness of plaintiffs claims for tortious interference of contract and business relations and invasion of privacy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
