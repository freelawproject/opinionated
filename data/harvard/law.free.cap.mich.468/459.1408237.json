The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition. It concluded that the contract was ambiguous and, thus, that its interpretation raised a question of fact that must be decided by the jury, which could consider relevant extrinsic evidence. The jury found in favor of plaintiff. The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the contract unambiguously stated that an agent must be at least sixty-five years old and have worked at least ten years for defendant in order to qualify for retirement renewal commissions and, therefore, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>the trial court erred in not granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition. Because we agree with the trial court that the language of this contract is ambiguous and, thus, that its interpretation raises a question of fact for the jury to determine in light of relevant extrinsic evidence, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the Court of Appeals for consideration of defendant\u2019s other appellate issue and plaintiff\u2019s cross-appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">When plaintiff began working as an insurance agent for defendant in 1990, they entered into a contract, titled the \u201cAgent\u2019s Agreement.\u201d Plaintiff permanently stopped working for defendant in 1997.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiff brought this action, alleging that defendant failed to pay renewal commissions to which plaintiff was entitled pursuant to the vesting schedule in their contract that provided that an agent with seven years of service is entitled to the vesting of one hundred percent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>of his renewals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After discovery, defendant brought a motion for summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(10), contending that, in order for renewal commissions to be vested on the basis of retirement, one must be at least sixty-five years old and have worked for defendant for at least ten years.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> finding the contract to be ambiguous,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the jury subsequently found in favor of plaintiff.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals then reversed, concluding that the contract unambiguously requires that an agent must be at least sixty-five years old and have worked at least ten years for defendant in order to qualify for retirement renewal commissions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We granted plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>tiff\u2019s application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">We review de novo a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary disposition. <em>Stanton v Battle Creek, </em>466 Mich 611, 614; 647 NW2d 508 (2002). Similarly, whether contract language is ambiguous is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>Farm Bureau Mut Ins Co v Nikkel, </em>460 Mich 558, 563; 596 NW2d 915 (1999). Finally, the proper interpretation of a contract is also a question of law that we review de novo. <em>Henderson v State Farm Fire &amp; Cas Co, </em>460 Mich 348, 353; 596 NW2d 190 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">III.

Vestment for retirement is age 65 or 10 years of service whichever is later.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>When defendant moved for summary disposition, it argued that plaintiff was not entitled to renewal commissions because, although plaintiff had disengaged from the insurance industry, he was not at least sixty-five years old and had not worked for defendant for at least ten years, whereas the contract unambiguously required an agent to satisfy all three of these requirements in order to be eligible for retirement renewal commissions. Defendant further argued that, because the contract was unambiguous, extrinsic evidence may not be considered in interpreting the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">Plaintiff, on the other hand, argued that the contract was ambiguous because the vesting schedule in \u00a7 5(B) of the Agent\u2019s Agreement conflicts with the sixty-five years of age and ten years of service requirements in the Agent\u2019s Manual. That is, under the vesting schedule, a percentage of renewal commissions were vested after two years of service, while, under the Agent\u2019s Manual\u2019s definition of retirement, which the Agent\u2019s Agreement incorporated, renewal commissions were not vested at all until an agent reached sixty-five years of age and had served as an agent with defendant for ten years. Plaintiff further argued that, because this contract was ambiguous, its interpretation was a question of fact that must be decided by the jury in light of relevant extrinsic evidence. As already noted, the trial court agreed with plaintiff that the contract was ambiguous and, thus, must be interpreted by the jury in light of relevant extrinsic evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>On appeal to the Court of Appeals, plaintiff argued that the early years of the vesting schedule (years two through nine) directly conflicted with the sixty-five years of age and ten years of service requirements, creating an ambiguity that the jury properly resolved against defendant. Defendant, on the other hand, argued that years two through nine of the vesting schedule should be ignored. The Court of Appeals, correctly recognizing that years two through nine of the vesting schedule had to be given some meaning, but disagreeing with plaintiff that they applied to agents who had retired, concluded that these years of the vesting schedule only applied to agents who died or had become disabled. Plaintiff filed a motion for rehearing, arguing that the Court of Appeals had overlooked \u00a7 5(A) of the Agent\u2019s Agreement, which provided that, regardless of age or years of service, an agent who died or became disabled while still employed was entitled to receive one hundred percent of his renewal commissions. Therefore, plaintiff argued, the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that years two through nine of the vesting schedule applied to agents who died or became disabled. The Court of Appeals denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for rehearing without explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>A. THE CONTRACT LANGUAGE IS AMBIGUOUS</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">\u201cAn insurance contract is ambiguous when its provisions are capable of conflicting interpretations.\u201d <em>Nikkei, supra </em>at 566. Accordingly, if two provisions of the same contract irreconcilably conflict with each other, the language of the contract is ambiguous. Further, courts cannot simply ignore portions of a contract in order to avoid a finding of ambiguity or in order to declare an ambiguity. Instead, contracts must be \u201c \u2018construed so as to give effect to every word or phrase as far as practicable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hunter v Pearl Assurance Co, Ltd, </em>292 Mich 543, 545; 291 NW 58 (1940), quoting <em>Mondou v Lincoln Mut Cas Co, </em>283 Mich 353, 358-359; 278 NW 94 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">In our judgment, the vesting schedule found in \u00a7 5(B) of the Agent\u2019s Agreement irreconcilably conflicts with the Agent\u2019s Manual\u2019s definition of retirement, which the Agent\u2019s Agreement incorporates. Under the vesting schedule, an agent who has served two or more years with defendant is entitled to a percentage of renewal commissions; while, under the Agent\u2019s Manual\u2019s definition of retirement, an agent is only entitled to a percentage of renewal commissions if that agent is at least sixty-five years old and has served ten or more years with defendant. Accordingly, while plaintiff is entitled to renewal commissions under the vesting schedule, he is not entitled to renewal commissions under the Agent\u2019s Manual\u2019s definition of retirement. Therefore, the language of the contract is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The Court of Appeals attempted to avoid a finding of ambiguity by concluding that, if an agent has less than ten years of service with defendant, he cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>be considered retired and, thus, years two through nine of the vesting schedule would not apply to him; however, these years <em>would </em>apply to an agent who died or became disabled without reaching the age of sixty-five and without having ten years of service with defendant. Although the Court of Appeals is correct in recognizing that it must give some meaning to years two through nine of the vesting schedule, in its attempt to give these years some meaning, it has ignored another portion of the contract, that is, \u00a7 5(A) of the Agent\u2019s Agreement. Just as \u201c[c]ourts must give effect to every word, phrase, and clause in a statute and avoid an interpretation that would render any part of the statute surplusage or nugatory,\u201d <em>State Farm &amp; Gas Co v Old Republic Ins Co, </em>466 Mich 142, 146; 644 NW2d 715 (2002), courts must also give effect to every word, phrase, and clause in a contract and avoid an interpretation that would render any part of the contract surplusage or nugatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Section 5(A) of the Agent\u2019s Agreement provides that an agent who dies or becomes disabled is automatically one hundred percent vested. Therefore, contrary to the contention of the Court of Appeals, years two through nine of the vesting schedule, which provide for less than one hundred percent vesting, would have no application to an agent who dies or becomes disabled. If the contract is read, as the Court of Appeals read it, to require an agent to be at least sixty-five years old and to have served as an agent for defendant for at least ten years to be considered retired, years two through nine of the vesting scheduled are rendered meaningless. Because there is no way to read the provisions of this contract in reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>able harmony, the language of the contract is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">B. INTERPRETATION OF AMBIGUOUS CONTRACT</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">It is well settled that the meaning of an ambiguous contract is a question of fact that must be decided by the jury. <em>Hewett Grocery Co v Biddle Purchasing Co, </em>289 Mich 225, 236; 286 NW 221 (1939). \u201c \u2018Where a contract is to be construed by its terms alone, it is the duty of the court to interpret it; but where its meaning is obscure and its construction depends upon other and extrinsic facts in connection with what is written, the question of interpretation should be submitted to the jury, under proper instructions.\u2019 \u201d <em>O\u2019Connor v March Automatic Irrigation Co, </em>242 Mich 204, 210; 242 NW 784 (1928) (citation omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">Where a written contract is ambiguous, a factual question is presented as to the meaning of its provisions, requiring a factual determination as to the intent of the parties in entering the contract. Thus, the fact finder must interpret the contract\u2019s terms, in light of the apparent purpose of the contract as a whole, the rules of contract construction, and extrinsic evidence of intent and meaning. [11 Williston, Contracts (4th ed), \u00a7 30:7, pp 87-91.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">In resolving such a question of fact, i.e., the interpretation of a contract whose language is ambiguous, the jury is to consider relevant extrinsic evidence. As this Court explained in <em>Penzien v Dielectric Products Engineering Co, Inc, </em>374 Mich 444, 449; 132 NW2d 130 (1965):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">\u201cIf the contract in question were ambiguous or \u2018doubtful,\u2019 extrinsic evidence, particularly evidence which would indicate the contemporaneous understanding of the parties, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>would be admissible as an aid in construction of the disputed terms.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-4\">\u201cThe law is clear that where the language of the contract is ambiguous, the court can look to such extrinsic evidence as the parties\u2019 conduct, the statements of its representatives, and past practice to aid in interpretation.\u201d [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Looking at relevant extrinsic evidence to aid in the interpretation of a contract whose language is ambiguous does not violate the parol evidence rule.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">\u201cThe parol evidence rule does not preclude the admission \u2022 of parol or extrinsic evidence for the purpose of aiding in the interpretation or construction of a written instrument, where the language of the instrument itself taken alone is such that it does not clearly express the intention of the parties or the subject of the agreement. Such evidence is admitted not to add to or detract from the writing, but merely to ascertain what the meaning of the parties is. Thus a written instrument is open to explanation by parol or extrinsic evidence when it is expressed in short and incomplete terms, or is fairly susceptible of two constructions, or where the language employed is vague, uncertain, obscure, or ambiguous, and where the words of the contract must be applied to facts ascertainable only by extrinsic evidence, a resort to such evidence is necessarily permitted.\u201d <em>[Edoff v Hecht, </em>270 Mich 689, 695-696; 260 NW 93 (1935) (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">In interpreting a contract whose language is ambiguous, the jury should also consider that ambiguities are to be construed against the drafter of the contract.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Herweyer v Clark Hwy Services, Inc, </em>455 Mich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>14, 22; 564 NW2d 857 (1997).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This is known as the rule of contra proferentem. However, this rule is only to be applied if all conventional means of contract interpretation, including the consideration of relevant extrinsic evidence, have left the jury unable to determine what the parties intended their contract to mean.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, if the extrinsic evidence indicates that the parties intended their contract to have a particular meaning, this is the meaning that should be given to the contract, regardless of whether this meaning is in accord with the drafter\u2019s or the non-drafter\u2019s view of the contract. In other words, if a contract is ambiguous regarding whether a term means \u201ca\u201d or \u201cb,\u201d but relevant extrinsic evidence leads the jury to conclude that the parties intended the term to mean \u201cb,\u201d then the term should be interpreted to mean \u201cb,\u201d even though construing the document in the nondrafter\u2019s favor pursuant to an applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>tion of the rule of contra proferentem would produce an interpretation of the term as \u201ca.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">However, if the language of a contract is ambiguous, and the jury remains unable to determine what the parties intended after considering all relevant extrinsic evidence, the jury should only then find in favor of the nondrafter of the contract pursuant to the rule of contra proferentem. In other words, the rule of contra proferentem should be viewed essentially as a \u201ctie-breaker,\u201d to be utilized only after all conventional means of contract interpretation, including the consideration of relevant extrinsic evidence, have been applied and found wanting.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">This view of the rule of construing against the drafter of the contract is in accordance with 2 Restatement Contracts, 2d, \u00a7 206, p 105, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">In choosing among the reasonable meanings of a promise or agreement or a term thereof, that meaning is generally preferred which operates against the party who supplies the words or from whom a writing otherwise proceeds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">The comments following this rule state that \u201c[i]n cases of doubt, therefore, so long as other factors are not decisive, there is substantial reason for preferring the meaning of the other <em>party. . . </em>.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he rule is \u2018the last one to be resorted to, and never to be applied except when other rules of interpretation fail.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>Reporter\u2019s Note, p 106, citation omitted. Treatises also indicate that this is a so-called \u201crule of last resort.\u201d For example, 5 Corbin, Contracts (rev ed, 1998), \u00a7 24.27, pp 297-300, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-9\">The \u201ccontra proferentem\u201d rule has been described as being applicable only as a last resort, when other tech<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>\u00f1iques of interpretation and construction have not resolved the question of which of two or more possible reasonable meanings the court should choose. One court wrote that it is \u201ca tie breaker when there is no other sound basis for choosing one contract interpretation over another.\u201d . . . Another federal court expressed a similar reservation concerning use of the rule: \u201c[T]his rule of construction should not be enlarged to [clarify] perfunctorily ... an ambiguous meaning; the trier of fact should still consider the drafting party\u2019s evidence.\u201d The \u201ccontra proferentem\u201d rule thus yields to other techniques of interpretation, including the attempt to give a valid, legal, and reasonable meaning to as many of the contract terms as possible. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">In addition, Williston, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 32:12, pp 480-482, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">The rule of contra proferentem is generally said to be a rule of last resort and is applied only where other secondary rules of interpretation have failed to elucidate the contract\u2019s meaning. . . . Finally, the rule does not justify a court in adopting an interpretation contrary to that asserted by the drafter, simply because of his or her status as the drafter. Rather, it is only when consistent with the rules of contract interpretation, the meaning proposed by the non-drafter (or an altogether different meaning determined by the court) is reasonable \u2014 -when there is a true ambiguity and the court must choose between two or more reasonable meanings \u2014 that the rule of contra proferentem is properly invoked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The rule of contra proferentem is a rule of last resort because, \u201cThe primary goal in the construction or interpretation of any contract is to honor the intent of the parties,\u201d <em>Rasheed v Chrysler Corp, </em>445 Mich 109, 127 n 28; 517 NW2d 19 (1994), and the rule of contra proferentem does not aid in determining the parties\u2019 intent. Instead, the comments after the restatement refer to the rule of contra proferentem, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>not as a rule of interpretation, but as \u201ca rule of legal effect.\u201d 2 Restatement, <em>supra </em>at 105. It is a rule of legal effect, rather than a rule of legal interpretation, because its purpose is not to render more accurate or more perfect a jury\u2019s understanding of the meaning of the contract, but is merely to ascertain the winner and the loser in connection with a contract whose meaning has eluded the jury despite all efforts to apply conventional rules of interpretation. As stated in Corbin, <em>supra, </em>p 306:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">The rule is not actually one of interpretation, because its application does not assist in determining the meaning that the two parties gave to the words, or even the meaning that a reasonable person would have assigned to the language used. It is chiefly a rule of policy, generally favoring the underdog. It directs the court to choose between two or more possible reasonable meanings on the basis of their legal operation, i.e., whether they favor the drafter or the other party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">In sum, the jury can consider relevant extrinsic evidence as an aid in interpreting a contract whose language is ambiguous. However, if, after the jury has applied all other conventional means of contract interpretation and considered the relevant extrinsic evidence, the jury is still unable to determine what the parties intended, the jury should then construe the ambiguity against the drafter. That is, the rule of contra proferentem is only to be applied if the intent of the parties cannot be discerned through the use of all conventional rules of interpretation, including an examination of relevant extrinsic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The concurring opinion asserts that, \u201cwhen a contract is drafted entirely by one party, without any bilateral negotiations,\u201d the rule of contra proferentem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>\u201cshould be applied as the primary rule of construction, not as a last resort . . . <em>Post </em>at 482, 483. That is, when a contract whose language is ambiguous is drafted without bilateral negotiations, a jury should not be allowed to look at relevant extrinsic evidence in order to discern the parties\u2019 intent. Instead, the ambiguous language is simply to be construed against the drafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-3\">We respectfully disagree with the concurring opinion\u2019s reference to the rule of contra proferentem as a \u201crule of construction.\u201d In our judgment, the rule of contra proferentem is not a rule of construction, rather, as explained above, it is a rule of legal effect. See pp 473-474. While rules of construction are designed to help determine the parties\u2019 intent, the rule of contra proferentem is designed to resolve a dispute where the parties\u2019 intent cannot be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">Further, as the concurring opinion correctly states, \u201c[t]he ultimate objective in interpreting an ambiguous contract is to ascertain the intent of the parties . . . .\u201d <em>Post </em>at 483. Therefore, in our judgment, it is only obvious that a method of construing a contract that helps ascertain the intent of the parties should be preferred over one that does not.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We agree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>concurring opinion that extrinsic evidence \u201c \u2018provides an incomplete guide with which to interpret contractual language.\u2019 \u201d <em>Post </em>at 483. That is, extrinsic evidence is not the best way to determine what the parties intended. Rather, the language of the parties\u2019 contract is the best way to determine what the parties intended. However, where, as in cases such as this one, it is not possible to determine the parties\u2019 intent from the language of their contract, the <em>next </em>best way to determine the parties\u2019 intent is to use relevant extrinsic evidence. Such evidence at least affords a way by which to ascertain the parties\u2019 intent, unlike the rule of contra proferentem, which focuses solely on the status of the parties to a contract.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Finally, we disagree with the concurring opinion\u2019s contention that \u201cthis Court has consistently applied the rule of construing against the drafter as the primary tool of construction . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 485. Not one of the cases cited in the concurring opinion, in fact, concludes that relevant extrinsic evidence is inadmissible to help a jury determine the parties\u2019 intent where the language of a contract is ambiguous. In other words, not a single one of these cases concludes that the rule of contra proferentem is somehow a \u201cprimary rule of construction.\u201d Instead, in each of these cases, the rule of contra proferentem was, in all likelihood, applied because there was no way to determine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>parties\u2019 intent. That is, the language of the contract was ambiguous, but there was no relevant extrinsic evidence available.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Therefore, the concurring opinion\u2019s reliance on these cases is misplaced.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">In this case, plaintiff introduced as extrinsic evidence an older version of the Agent\u2019s Agreement and deposition testimony from defendant\u2019s executives showing that defendant\u2019s past practice had been to pay former agents the renewal commissions specified by \u00a7 5(B) of the vesting schedule, regardless of whether those agents had ten years of service with defendant or had reached age sixty-five.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Plaintiff argues that the definition of retirement under the contract is simply \u201cdisengagement from the insurance industry\u201d and that the second sentence under the section defining retirement in the Agent\u2019s Manual was unintentionally left over from a time before defendant\u2019s Agent\u2019s Agreement contained a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>vesting schedule. Not only does this construction of the contract accord meaning to the entire vesting schedule, but it is also the construction that defendant itself has applied for the past eight years, that is, since it adopted the new Agent\u2019s Agreement containing the vesting schedule.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In other words, defendant had been paying the specified percentages of renewal commissions to agents, who were not sixty-five years of age and had not worked for defendant for at least ten years, as long as they had disengaged from the insurance industry.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Defendant argues that the jury should not have considered this extrinsic evidence. However, as discussed above, the jury is to consider relevant extrinsic evidence when interpreting a contract whose language is ambiguous. How the drafting party has interpreted ambiguous contractual language in the past is certainly relevant in determining what the parties intended such language to mean. The meaning of a provision in a contract whose language is ambiguous \u201cmust be ascertained in the light of all of the relevant circumstances, . . . including, . . . the meanings accepted by the parties.\u201d <em>Davis v Kramer Bros Freight Lines, Inc, </em>361 Mich 371, 375; 105 NW2d 29 (1960). \u201cThere is no doubt that evidence of practical interpretation by the parties is admissible as an aid in the determination of the meaning to be given legal effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 375-376.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Where parties by such a uniform course of conduct for a long time have given a contract a particular construction, that construction will be adopted by the courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-4\">\u201cThe practical interpretation given to contracts by the parties to them, while engaged in their performance and before any controversy has arisen concerning them, is one of the best indications of their true intent.\u201d <em>[People ex rel Attorney General v Michigan Central R Co, </em>145 Mich 140, 166; 108 NW 772 (1906) (citation omitted) (portion of dissent by Grant, J., assented to by the majority at 150).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Because the language of the contract here is ambiguous, and because defendant had, in the past, construed this contract to require the payment of retirement renewal commissions according to the vesting schedule, even if the agent was not at least sixty-five years old and had not served as an agent with defendant for at least ten years, the trial court did not err in instructing the jury to consider this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Although the trial court correctly instructed the jury that it could consider relevant extrinsic evidence and that any ambiguities should be construed against the drafter pursuant to the rule of contra proferentem, the trial court failed to inform the jury that it could only apply the rule of contra proferentem if it was unable to discern the parties\u2019 intent from the extrinsic evidence. However, in this case, this error was harmless. The jury did one of two things here. The jury either construed the language of the contract in favor of plaintiff pursuant to the rule of contra proferentem, or it construed the language of the contract in favor of plaintiff because the extrinsic evidence pointed to a construction of the contract in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>plaintiffs favor.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Accordingly, regardless of which approach the jury used, it reached the (same) right result and, thus, failure to reverse is not inconsistent with substantial justice.

CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">If two provisions of the same contract irreconcilably conflict with each other, the language of the contract is ambiguous. In this case, the contract\u2019s definition of retirement irreconcilably conflicts with the contract\u2019s vesting schedule. Under the contract\u2019s definition of retirement, plaintiff is not entitled to renewal commissions; while, under the vesting schedule, plaintiff is entitled to renewal commissions. Accordingly, the contract language at issue here is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The interpretation of a contract whose language is ambiguous is a question of fact for the jury to decide. When interpreting a contract whose language is ambiguous, the jury is to consider relevant extrinsic evidence. That the drafting party interpreted the ambiguous contractual language in a certain way for many years is relevant extrinsic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">In interpreting a contract whose language is ambiguous and in which the parties\u2019 intent cannot other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>wise be determined through resort to relevant extrinsic evidence, the jury should construe any ambiguities against the drafter of the contract. That is, if, after the jury has considered all conventional means of contract interpretation and all relevant extrinsic evidence, it is still unable to determine what the parties intended, the jury should then construe the ambiguity against the drafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-3\">Therefore, we conclude that the trial court here did not err in instructing the jury that it should consider relevant extrinsic evidence in order to discern the parties\u2019 intent, and that it should also construe any ambiguities against the drafter. Although the trial court did err in failing to inform the jury that it should only construe ambiguities against the drafter if it cannot discern the parties\u2019 intent from the relevant extrinsic evidence, this error was harmless. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the Court of Appeals for consideration of defendant\u2019s other appellate issue and plaintiff\u2019s cross-appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b581-4\">Corrigan, C.J., and Taylor and Young, JJ., concurred with Markman, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b581-5\">Cavanagh, J., concurred in the result only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b561-7\"> Specifically, on remand, the Court of Appeals shall consider defendant\u2019s alternative argument that the damages award was based on improper speculation about policy renewals, and plaintiff\u2019s cross-appeal, which challenged the trial court\u2019s dismissal of his claim for double damages and actual attorney fees under the sales representative commissions act.

However, when it came time to instruct the jury, the trial court told the jury to consider the contract and the relevant extrinsic evidence and to decide what the contract meant.

I write separately because I disagree with the majority\u2019s holding that \u201cthe rule of contra proferentem is only to be applied if the intent of the parties cannot be discerned through the use of all conventional rules of interpretation, including an examination of relevant extrinsic evidence.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>474. Although I agree that this is the general rule, I would hold that when a contract is drafted entirely by one party, without any bilateral negotiations, the rule that a contract is to be strictly construed against its drafter should be applied as the primary rule of construction, not as a last resort, and extrinsic evidence is not admissible to clarify ambiguity in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The doctrine of contra proferentem, under which a contract that is ambiguous will be construed against the party preparing it, is a well-established rule. See, e.g., <em>Universal Underwriters Ins Co v Kneeland, </em>464 Mich 491, 498; 628 NW2d 491 (2001) (discussing the \u201crule requiring that contractual ambiguities be construed against the drafter\u201d); <em>Herweyer v Clark Hwy Services, Inc, </em>455 Mich 14, 22; 564 NW2d 857 (1997) (\u201cAs the contract period under consideration is ambiguous, it must be construed against the drafter.\u201d). In general, it is a rule of last resort, to be applied only if the intent of the parties cannot be discerned by the use of other rules of interpretation. See 2 Farnsworth, Contracts (2d ed), ch 7 \u00a77.11, and 5 Corbin, Contracts (rev ed, 1998), \u00a7 24.27, pp 297-300.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The questions we asked the parties to address<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are whether extrinsic evidence should be precluded and whether the rule of construing against the drafter should be applied initially, instead of as a rule of last resort, when the contract is drafted entirely by one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>party without bilateral negotiation. I conclude that in such a case, the rule of contra proferentem should be applied as the primary rule of construction, not as a last resort, and that extrinsic evidence is not admissible to clarify the ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">The ultimate objective in interpreting an ambiguous contract is to ascertain the intent of the parties so the agreement can be carried out according to that intent. <em>Loyal Order of Moose, Adrian 1034 v Faulhaber, </em>327 Mich 244, 250; 41 NW2d 535 (1950); <em>Stine v Continental Cas Co, 419 </em>Mich 89, 112; 349 NW2d 127 (1984). When there are bilateral negotiations between the parties, a court can assume that there is a relation between the contract terms that were agreed upon and the parties\u2019 expectations as revealed by extrinsic evidence. However, \u201cunless extrinsic evidence can speak to the intent of <em>all </em>parties to a contract, it provides an incomplete guide with which to inteipret contractual language.\u201d <em>SI Mgt LP v Wininger, </em>707 A2d 37, 43 (Del, 1998) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The Supreme Court of Delaware has held that where ambiguity arises in a contract drafted solely by one side and offered to others on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, the rule of construing against the drafter is determinative. <em>SI Mgt, supra; </em>followed by <em>Intel Corp v Via Technologies, Inc, </em>174 F Supp 2d 1038 (ND Cal, 2001). In <em>SI Mgt </em>the Delaware court analyzed its approach to interpreting insurance contracts. The Delaware courts had said that if an insurance contract is ambiguous, \u201c \u2018the principle of <em>contra proferentem </em>dictates that the contract must be construed against the drafter.\u2019 \u201d <em>SI Management, supra </em>at 42 (citation omitted). The court found that the policy behind that principle of construing against the drafter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>is that the insurer was in complete control of creating and drafting the policy, while the insured had little say about those terms except to take them or leave them or to select from limited terms offered by the insurer. Because of that, the Delaware courts had consistently held that the insurer had an obligation to make the terms clear and should suffer the consequences of convoluted or confusing terms. In <em>SI Mgt </em>the Delaware Supreme Court expanded this principle to other contracts where there was not a bilaterally negotiated agreement, and one party had signed onto an agreement that it had no hand in drafting.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">There are sound public-policy reasons behind a black letter rule that when contractual provision are drafted entirely by one party, any ambiguity in the contract is to be construed against the drafter. First, the rule of contra proferentem provides a strong incentive for a party drafting a contract to use clear and unambiguous language. Second, the use of extrinsic evidence in circumstances involving ambiguity could be destabilizing to contractual relations and require more involved litigation by allowing parties to use assertions of oral understandings and examples of past behavior rather than relying on a written contract with the understanding that any ambiguity should be construed against its drafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">This Court has not previously addressed whether the rule of construing against the drafter should be used as a primary rule of construction in ambiguous contracts or only used after considering any extrinsic evidence available.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, in interpreting ambigu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>ous contracts, this Court has consistently applied the rule of construing against the drafter as its primary, indeed sole, aid to construction. See <em>Herweyer, supra </em>at 22 (\u201cAs the contract period under consideration is ambiguous, it must be construed against the drafter, the defendant.\u201d), <em>Lichnovsky v Ziebart Int\u2019l Corp, </em>414 Mich 228, 239; 324 NW2d 732 (1982) (\u201cAny ambiguity in the expression must be construed against Ziebart, as its predecessor drafted the agreement.\u201d), <em>Ladd v Teichman, </em>359 Mich 587, 592; 103 NW2d 338 (1960) (\u201cWe agree with appellees that appellant having drafted the contract, any ambiguity contained in it must be construed against him.\u201d), and <em>Veenstra v Associated Broadcasting Corp, </em>321 Mich 679, 691; 33 NW2d 115 (1948) (\u201cDefendants caused the drafting of the two contracts and any doubt or ambiguity concerning the nature of the contracts must be resolved against the defendants.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">Similarly, this Court has consistently applied the rule of construing against the drafter as the primary tool of construction in insurance contracts. In insurance contracts, one party decides the terms of the contract, drafts the contract, and presents it to the other party in a take-it-or-leave-it fashion, all with no bilateral negotiation. <em>Michigan Millers Mut Ins Co v Bronson Plating Co, </em>445 Mich 558, 567; 519 NW2d 864 (1994) (in interpreting insurance cases, a well-established principle of construction is, \u201cWhere ambiguity is found, the court must construe the term in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>the manner most favorable to the insured.\u201d). See also <em>State Farm Mut Automobile Ins Co v Enterprise Leasing Co, </em>452 Mich <em>25, </em>38; 549 NW2d 345 (1996) (\u201c[b]ecause State Farm prepared the form insurance contracts, any ambiguity must be strictly construed against it.\u201d), <em>Raska v Farm Bureau Mut Ins Co of Michigan, </em>412 Mich 355, 362; 314 NW2d 440 (1982) (\u201cIf a fair reading of the entire contract of insurance leads one to understand that there is coverage under particular circumstances and another fair reading of it leads one to understand that there is no coverage under the same circumstances the contract is ambiguous and should be construed against its drafter and in favor of coverage.\u201d), and <em>Bonney v Citizens\u2019 Mut Automobile Ins Co, </em>333 Mich 435, 438; 53 NW2d 321 (1952) (\u201cAn ambiguous contract must be construed against the party who prepared it.\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">I would hold that this principle should be extended beyond insurance contracts and applied to other contracts in which there is a similar disparity of control in the creation of the terms of the contract. Here defendant was the entity in sole control of the process of creating and setting forth the terms of the contract. The parties did not engage in bilateral negotiation; the plaintiffs only choice in the terms of the contract was to take them or leave them. In such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>situation, any ambiguity in the contract should have been construed against the drafter, without considering the extrinsic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">In this case, the trial judge allowed the plaintiff to introduce a variety of extrinsic evidence, including references to the older version of the Agent\u2019s Agreement<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and deposition testimony by the defendant\u2019s executives.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> I would hold that the trial court erred in admitting the extrinsic evidence to resolve the contract\u2019s ambiguity. However, that error was harmless, because the same result was achieved as would have been if the contract had been construed against its drafter, defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Accordingly, I concur with the decision to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to that Court for consideration of those issues raised, but not addressed, below.</p>\n<judges id=\"b587-6\">Kelly, J., concurred with Weaver, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-7\"> In granting leave to appeal, this Court directed the parties to include among the issues to be briefed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">Where, as in the present case, a contract is drafted entirely by one party, without any bilateral negotiations, is extrinsic evidence admissible to clarify ambiguity in the contract or is any ambiguity in the contract simply to be construed against the drafter (without considering any extrinsic evidence)?
