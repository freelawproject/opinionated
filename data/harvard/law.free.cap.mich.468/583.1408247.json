The plain language of MCR 6.201(A) applies only to providing reports that already exist. Therefore, we conclude that a trial court may not compel a party in a criminal case to create an expert witness report. We also conclude that while MCR 6.201(1) permits modification of the requirements or prohibitions of MCR 6.201 upon a showing of \u201cgood cause,\u201d such good cause was not demonstrated in this case. The judgment of the Court of Appeals that the trial court abused its discretion in compelling defendant to create an expert report where none existed is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">Defendant was charged with second-degree murder, MCL 750.317, arising out of a single-vehicle acci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>dent that resulted in the death of defendant\u2019s passenger. A preliminary examination was held in February 2000, and defendant was bound over for trial. Defendant engaged three expert witnesses to testify at trial. On February 28, 2000, the prosecutor filed a request for discovery, asking for reports produced by or for any expert witness defendant intended to call at trial. No reports existed at that time. The prosecutor moved to strike the defense expert witnesses on the basis that defendant had not turned over all reports or curricula vitae of the experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">On May 15, 2000, the trial judge ordered defendant to comply with MCR 6.201 by providing to the prosecutor any reports of defendant\u2019s expert witnesses. In August 2000, the prosecutor filed a second motion to strike and again alleged that defendant had not complied with the discovery requests. The prosecutor complained that there were no reports from any of defendant\u2019s expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The trial judge signed an order on September 11, 2000, which, in part, ordered defendant to \u201cobtain reports from the defense expert and provide them within thirty (30) days, to the People.\u201d Defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration was denied on October 20, 2000. In its order, the trial court stated that \u201cthe Court believes that [MCL 767.94a] and MCR 6.201 provide the Court with the discretion to order the creation of such reports.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Defendant filed an application for leave to appeal in the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals granted leave and reversed the order of the trial court. 246 Mich App 201; 632 NW2d 154 (2001). The Court concluded that there was no requirement in MCR 6.201 that an expert actually create a written report that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>could be produced. Further, because nonwritten observations and conclusions are not discoverable, the Court cited <em>People v Elston, </em>462 Mich 751, 759, 762; 614 NW2d 595 (2000), for the proposition that the prosecutor was not entitled to defendant\u2019s expert witnesses\u2019 unwritten observations. The Court of Appeals also rejected the prosecutor\u2019s argument that the trial judge had the authority to modify the rules. The Court noted that MCR 6.201(1) states: \u201cOn good cause shown, the court may order a modification of the requirements and prohibitions of this rule.\u201d Because the trial court did not find that good cause existed and, instead, based its decision on its own discretion, the Court of Appeals concluded that the trial court abused its discretion in compelling defendant to create expert reports where none existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The prosecutor applied for leave to appeal to this Court. Instead of granting leave, this Court remanded the case to the Saginaw Circuit Court for a \u201cgood cause\u201d determination under MCR 6.201(1). 636 NW2d 139 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">On February 6, 2002, on remand, the trial court issued an opinion and order outlining \u201cgood cause\u201d for modifying the discovery mandated by MCR 6.201(A). The trial court noted that defendant did not comply with the trial court\u2019s order for discovery and defendant\u2019s failure to comply provided a legally sufficient reason for \u201cgood cause.\u201d This Court granted leave to appeal on July 10, 2002.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">A trial court\u2019s decision regarding discovery is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>People v Stanaway, </em>446 Mich 643, 680; 521 NW2d 557 (1994). Interpretation of a court rule is treated like interpretation of a statute, it is a question of law that is reviewed de novo. <em>CAM Const v Lake Edgewood Condominium Ass\u2019n, </em>465 Mich 549, 553; 640 NW2d 256 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">III. analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">A. THE COURT RULE, MCR 6.201, NOT THE STATUTE, MCL 767.94a, CONTROLS DISCOVERY IN A CRIMINAL CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">The question that logically must be answered first is whether the court rule, MCR 6.201,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or the statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>MCL 767.94a,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> controls discovery in a criminal case. Both the prosecutor and defendant maintain that the court rule governs. We agree that the court rule is currently the governing provision. As both parties correctly point out, in conjunction with issuing MCR 6.201, this Court issued Administrative Order No. 1994-10. The administrative order provided that \u201cdiscovery in criminal cases heard in the courts of this state is governed by MCR 6.201, and not by MCL 767.94a; MSA 28.1023 (194a).\u201d AO 1994-10. Therefore, we do not need to determine whether MCL 767.94a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>would permit a trial court to compel creation of an expert report because MCR 6.201, not MCL 767.94a, governs discovery in criminal cases.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">B. MCR 6.201</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Having determined that MCR 6.201 governs discovery in criminal cases, we must now determine whether MCR 6.201(A) allows a trial court to compel creation of a report from a proposed expert witness. The prosecutor contends that the trial court can compel creation of a report. We reject the prosecutor\u2019s contention because it is contrary to the plain language of MCR 6.201(A). In <em>CAM Const, supra </em>at 554, we reiterated the proper mode of interpreting a court rule, which was articulated in <em>Grievance Admin v Underwood, </em>462 Mich 188, 193-194; 612 NW2d 116 (2000):</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">When called on to construe a court rule, this Court applies the legal principles that govern the construction and application of statutes. <em>McAuley v Gen Motors Corp, </em>457 Mich 513, 518; 578 NW2d 282 (1998). Accordingly, we begin with the plain language of the court rule. When that language is unambiguous, we must enforce the meaning expressed, without further judicial construction or interpretation. See <em>Tryc v Michigan Veterans\u2019 Facility, </em>451 Mich 129, 135; 545 NW2d 642 (1996). Similarly, common words must be understood to have their everyday, plain meaning. See MCL 8.3a . . .; see also <em>Perez v Keeler Brass Co, </em>461 Mich 602, 609; 608 NW2d 45 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>MCR 6.201(A)(3) provides that a party must provide \u201cany report of any kind produced by or for an expert witness whom the party intends to call at trial.\u201d The plain meaning of the words at issue is as follows. A \u201creport\u201d is defined as: \u201c1. An account presented usually in detail. 2. A formal account of the proceedings or transactions of a group. . . .\u201d <em>The' American Heritage Dictionary </em>(2d college ed). To \u201cproduce\u201d is defined as: \u201c1. To bring forth; yield. 2. To create by mental or physical effort. 3. To manufacture. 4. To cause to occur or exist; give rise to. 5. To bring forward; exhibit. 6. To sponsor and present to the public. ...\u201d Id<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">According to the plain meaning of the words, a \u201creport\u201d is an account of something. A report that has been \u201cproduced\u201d has already been brought forth or created. In other words, the report must already exist. There is nothing in the plain language of MCR 6.201(A) that permits a trial court to compel such a report to be created when it does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Our holding in this regard is consistent with a recent case from this Court, <em>People v Elston, supra. </em>In <em>Elston, </em>the defendant was charged with first-degree criminal sexual conduct. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s request to suppress evidence of sperm fragments found in the victim because neither party learned of their existence until the first day of trial. The trial court denied the motion to suppress. The Court of Appeals reversed. This Court rein<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>stated the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-5\">Apart from the wet swab sample and the wet swab laboratory report, the only other \u201cevidence of sperm\u201d not disclosed to defendant before trial was Dr. Randall\u2019s own personal observations. Clearly, this information was outside the scope of discovery. Because Dr. Randall did not make notes of his observations, they were not subject to mandatory disclosure under MCR 6.201(A)(3). <em>[.Elston </em>at 762.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">The same is true in this case. Defendant has consulted experts, but he maintains that the experts have not generated any reports. Therefore, nothing exists that could be subject to mandatory disclosure under MCR 6.201(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">The plain language of MCR 6.201(A) does not permit a trial court to compel creation of a report from either party\u2019s expert witnesses where no report exists. We, therefore, affirm the Court of Appeals holding that only existing reports that have been \u201cproduced,\u201d or created, by an expert witness are required to be disclosed pursuant to MCR 6.201(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">C. GOOD CAUSE</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">MCR 6.201(1) provides: \u201cOn good cause shown, the court may order a modification of the requirements and prohibitions of this rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">Before granting the prosecutor\u2019s application for leave to appeal in this case, we remanded the case to the trial court for a good-cause determination under MCR 6.201(1). On remand, the trial court found that defendant \u201cfailed to fully comply with the discovery requests and orders by failing to initially disclose the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>addresses of experts and failure to provide information from the experts.\u201d The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">[I]n attempting to fashion an appropriate remedy for the discovery violation caused by the Defendants [sic], [the court] took into account the Defendant\u2019s due process rights to a fair trial, the Prosecutor\u2019s interest in obtaining convictions on relevant and admissible evidence and the Court\u2019s interest in expeditiously administering justice and maintaining judicial integrity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Therefore, the court ordered that defendant \u201cshall provide a Curriculum Vita[] of [each of] defendant\u2019s experts and a basic report on each of the experts\u2019 findings and conclusions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">We agree that a trial court may modify the requirements or prohibitions of MCR 6.201 if good cause is shown. We do not believe, however, that the trial court\u2019s stated reason constituted \u201cgood cause\u201d under the court rule. Defendant may not have adequately responded to the prosecutor\u2019s discovery requests pertaining to his expert witnesses\u2019 curricula vitae. However, as we indicated above, MCR 6.201(A)(3) only requires provision to the opposing party reports \u201cproduced by or for an expert witness.\u201d Because a party is not obligated to disclose reports that do not exist, the fact that defendant did not disclose such reports does not constitute \u201cgood cause\u201d to modify the requirements of MCR 6.201(A). We recognize that there may be circumstances where good cause does exist to permit a trial court to compel a party to create expert witness reports. For example, good cause may exist when a trial court believes a party is intentionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>suppressing reports by an expert witness.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, such circumstances are not present here. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering defendant to create expert reports with the experts\u2019 findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">IV. conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">For these reasons, we conclude that the plain language of MCR 6.201(A) requires disclosing only reports that already exist. A trial court may not compel a party in a criminal case to create a report from an expert witness, absent the good cause required in MCR 6.201(1). We also conclude that the requisite \u201cgood cause\u201d to modify the requirements in the court rule was not demonstrated in this case. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b693-7\">Corrigan, C.J., and Weaver, Kelly, Taylor, Young, and Markman, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b686-7\"> The grant order directed the parties to brief among the issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-8\">(1) [W]hether MCR 6.201 or MCL 767.94a allows a trial court to compel creation of a report from a proposed defense expert witness, (2) whether the court rules authorize a trial court to compel disclosure of a defense, (3) whether the court rule, MCR 6.201, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>the statute, MCL 767.94a, controls discovery in a criminal case, and (4) whether MRE 705 gives the trial court discretion to order disclosure of a defense expert\u2019s opinion.
