The Court of Appeals reversed defendant\u2019s conviction and remanded the case for a new trial, reasoning that the trial court erred when it declined to give an involuntary-manslaughter instruction. This Court granted leave to appeal to consider whether manslaughter is an \u201cinferior\u201d offense of murder under MCL 768.32(1), and if so, whether a rational view of the evidence supported an instruction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">We conclude that manslaughter is an inferior offense of murder. However, an involuntary-manslaughter instruction was not appropriate in this case because a rational view of the evidence did not support it. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate defendant\u2019s conviction. To the extent that <em>People v Van Wyck, </em>402 Mich 266; 262 NW2d 638 (1978), and its progeny conflict with this opinion, they are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Defendant and codefendant Ivan Tims visited the home of victim William Stockdale and Stockdaie\u2019s nephew, Thurman Chillers, with the intent to purchase marijuana. Tims initially waited outside in the car while defendant discussed the price of the drugs with Stockdale and Chillers in the house. Agreeing on a price, defendant indicated to Stockdale that he had to return to the car to get additional money. When defendant returned to the house, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>was accompanied by Tims. Both men brandished handguns.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Chillers testified that, upon entering the home, defendant instructed Tims to \u201cshoot him.\u201d In response, Tims alternately pointed his gun at Chillers and Stockdale. Stockdale, in turn, rushed at defendant, grabbed defendant\u2019s gun and swung it downward. Chillers ran out of the house. As he ran, he saw Stockdale \u201ctussling\u201d with defendant. Chillers further testified that he heard one shot while he was in the house and four or five more shots when he was outside. In the end, Stockdale was shot twice, once in the leg and once in the chest. The chest wound proved fatal.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Defendant was charged with first-degree murder, MCL 750.316, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, MCL 750.227b. His defense was that Tims shot Stockdale. Defendant elicited testimony from various witnesses establishing that defendant was not in the house when the victim was fatally wounded and that the fatal bullet came from a gun traceable to Tims.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">At the close of proofs, defendant requested instructions for voluntary and involuntary manslaughter, MCL 750.321, and careless, reckless, or negligent discharge of a firearm, MCL 752.861. The trial court denied the requests and instructed the jury on first-degree murder, MCL 750.316, and second-degree murder, MCL 750.317. Defendant was convicted of second-degree murder and felony-firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">The Court of Appeals reversed defendant\u2019s conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. The panel treated the manslaughter-instruction requests as requests for instructions on a \u201ccognate\u201d lesser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>included offense and concluded that the trial court erred in refusing to give the involuntary-manslaughter instruction because there was evidence from which the jury could conclude that the victim\u2019s death was unintended and occurred while defendant was engaged in an unlawful act not amounting to a felony. Slip op at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The prosecutor applied for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We granted leave to consider whether manslaughter is an inferior offense of murder within the meaning of MCL 768.32 and, if so, whether an involuntary-manslaughter instruction was supported by a rational view of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Whether manslaughter is an inferior offense of murder within the meaning of MCL 768.32 is a question of law that the Court reviews de novo. <em>Weakland v Toledo Engineering Co, </em>467 Mich 344, 347; 656 NW2d 175 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AsI\">A. MCL 768.32</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">MCL 768.32 governs inferior-offense instructions. Subsection 1 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-10\">[U]pon an indictment for an offense, consisting of different degrees, as prescribed in this chapter, the jury, or the judge in a trial without a jury, may find the accused not guilty of the offense in the degree charged in the indictment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>and may find the accused person guilty of a degree of that offense inferior to that charged in the indictment, or of an attempt to commit that offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">We recently examined this statute in <em>People v Cornell, </em>466 Mich 335; 646 NW2d 127 (2002).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Cornell, </em>the Court considered whether necessarily included lesser offenses<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and cognate lesser included offenses<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were \u201cinferior\u201d offenses under MCL 768.32. In consideration of this issue, we examined the meaning of the word \u201cinferior\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">\u201cWe believe that the word \u2018inferior\u2019 in [MCL 768.32] does not refer to inferiority in the penalty associated with the offense, but, rather, to the absence of an element that distinguishes the charged offense from the lesser offense. The controlling factor is whether the lesser offense can be proved by the same facts that are used to establish the charged offense.\" <em>[Cornell, supra </em>at 354, quoting <em>People v Torres (On Remand), </em>222 Mich App 411, 419-420; 564 NW2d 149 (1997)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">Relying on this definition of \u201cinferior,\u201d this Court concluded that MCL 768.32 only permitted consideration of necessarily included lesser offenses. <em>Cornell, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number><em>supra </em>at 353-354. Thus, we held that an inferior-offense instruction is appropriate only if the lesser offense is necessarily included in the greater offense, meaning, all the elements of the lesser offense are included in the greater offense, and a rational view of the evidence would support such an instruction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">B. MANSLAUGHTER IS AN INFERIOR OFFENSE OF MURDER</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Manslaughter is an inferior offense of murder because manslaughter is a necessarily included lesser offense of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">1. THE ELEMENTS OF COMMON-LAW MURDER AND MANSLAUGHTER</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">Common-law murder encompasses all killings done with malice aforethought and without justification or excuse. <em>People v Scott, </em>6 Mich 287, 292-293 (1859).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>See also <em>People v Potter, </em>5 Mich 1, 6 (1858) (\u201cMurder is where a person of sound memory and discretion unlawfully kills any reasonable creature in being, in the peace of the state, with malice prepense or aforethought, either express or implied.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">First-degree murder is defined in MCL 750.316.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> All other murders are murders in the second degree. MCL 750.317. See also <em>People v Goecke, </em>457 Mich 442, 463-464; 579 NW2d 868 (1998), which enumerated the elements of second-degree murder as (1) death, (2) caused by defendant\u2019s act, (3) with malice, and (4) without justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Manslaughter is murder without malice. See <em>Potter, supra at 9 </em>(noting that without malice aforethought, \u201ca killing would be only manslaughter, if criminal at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>all\u201d). See also <em>People v Palmer, </em>105 Mich 568, 576; 63 NW 656 (1895), remarking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-4\">\u201cManslaughter is perfectly distinguishable from murder, in this: That though the act that causes death be unlawful or willful, though attended with fatal results, yet malice, either expressed or implied, which is the very essence of murder, is to be presumed to be wanting in manslaughter.\u201d [Quoting the trial court jury instructions.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The common law recognizes two forms of manslaughter: voluntary and involuntary. <em>People v Townes, </em>391 Mich 578, 589; 218 NW2d 136 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Common-law voluntary manslaughter is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">[T]he act of killing, though intentional, [is] committed under the influence of passion or in heat of blood, produced by an adequate or reasonable provocation, and before a reasonable time has elapsed for the blood to cool and reason to resume its habitual control, and is the result of the temporary excitement, by which the control of reason was disturbed, rather than of any wickedness of heart or cruelty or recklessness of disposition . . . <em>.[Maher v People, </em>10 Mich 212, 219 (1862).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">See also <em>Townes, supra </em>at 590 (\u201cA defendant properly convicted of voluntary manslaughter is a person who has acted out of a temporary excitement induced by an adequate provocation and not from the deliberation and reflection that marks the crime of murder.\u201d). Thus, to show voluntary manslaughter, one must show that the defendant killed in the heat of passion, the passion was caused by adequate provocation, and there was not a lapse of time during which a reasonable person could control his passions. See <em>People v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number><em>Pouncey, </em>437 Mich 382, 389; 471 NW2d 346 (1991).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Significantly, provocation is not an element of voluntary manslaughter. See <em>People v Moore, </em>189 Mich App 315, 320; 472 NW2d 1 (1991). Rather, provocation is the circumstance that negates the presence of malice. <em>Scott, supra </em>at 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Involuntary manslaughter is the unintentional killing of another, without malice, during the commission of an unlawful act not amounting to a felony and not naturally tending to cause great bodily harm; or dining the commission of some lawful act, negligently performed; or in the negligent omission to perform a legal duty. See <em>Townes, supra </em>at 590. See also <em>People v Helfin, </em>434 Mich 482, 507-508; 456 NW2d 10 (1990) (opinion by Riley, C.J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">2. THE SOLE ELEMENT DISTINGUISHING MANSLAUGHTER AND MURDER IS MALICE</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">An examination of the historical development of homicide law informs this Court that manslaughter is a necessarily included lesser offense of murder because the elements of manslaughter are included in the offense of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">a. HOMICIDE IN ENGLISH COMMON LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">In early English common law, a killing was either justifiable homicide; excusable murder committed by misadventure or accident, or in self-defense; or capi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>tal murder, characterized by \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d and punishable by death. See 2 Pollock and Maitland, <em>The History of English Law </em>(Cambridge: University Press, 1952), ch VIII, Crime and Tort, \u00a7 2, p 485. However, during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, an exemption called the \u201cbenefit of clergy\u201d was widely used as a device to mitigate mandatory death sentences. Hall, <em>Legal fictions and moral reasoning: Capital punishment and the mentally retarded defendant after Penry v Johnson, </em>35 Akron L R 327, 353 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The \u201cbenefit of clergy\u201d was an exemption that allowed an offender to be sentenced by the ecclesiastical courts, which did not impose capital punishment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Though it was initially intended to benefit clergy, it also benefitted persons who could satisfy its literacy test. See Kealy, <em>Hunting the dragon: Reforming the Massachusetts murder statute, </em>10 B U Pub Int L J 203, 205-206 (2001). Thus, it was not long before persons other than clerics claimed the exemption, so that the \u201cbenefit of clergy\u201d exemption benefit-ted <em>anyone </em>who could read. See Justice Harlan\u2019s discussion in <em>McGautha v California, </em>402 US 183, 197; 91 S Ct 1454; 28 L Ed 2d 711 (1971), noting that, although all criminal homicides were prima facie capital cases, the \u201cbenefit of clergy\u201d was available to almost any man who could read.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">In response to the exemption\u2019s widespread availability, statutes were passed throughout the fiffc\u00e9enth and sixteenth centuries proclaiming the exemption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>unavailable for homicides committed under particularly reviled circumstances, collectively termed \u201cmurder with malice aforethought.\u201d Moreland, <em>The Law of Homicide </em>(Indianapolis: The Bobbs-Merrill Co, Inc, 1952), ch 2, The Development of Malice Aforethought, p 9. The \u201cbenefit of clergy\u201d remained available, however, for offenders convicted of less culpable homicides. <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, unjustified and unexcused homicide was divided into two separate crimes: \u201cwilful murder of malice aforethought\u201d, a capital offense for which the \u201cbenefit of clergy\u201d was unavailable, and manslaughter. Plucknett, <em>A Concise History of the Common Law </em>(New York: The Lawyers Co-Operative Pub Co, 1927), ch 2, The Felonies, pp 395-396. The critical difference between murder and manslaughter was the presence or absence of \u201cmalice aforethought.\u201d Moreland, <em>supra </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">b. \u201cMALICE AFORETHOUGHT\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The phrase \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d has evolved over the centuries. During the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d meant that one possessed an intent to kill well in advance of the act itself. <em>Id. </em>at 10. Notably, the emphasis was on \u201caforethought,\u201d so that the critical difference between capital and noncapital murder was the passage of time between the initial formulation of the intent to kill and the act itself. Moylan, Criminal Homicide Law (Maryland Institute for Continuing Professional Education of Lawyers), ch 2, \u00a7 2.7. The term \u201cmalice\u201d alone had little significance beyond meaning an intent to commit an unjustified and unexcusable killing. <em>Id. </em>The purpose of the \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d element was to distinguish between deliberate, calculated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>homicides and homicides committed in the heat of passion. Kealy, <em>supra </em>at 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">As more and more defendants claimed they lacked an intent to kill before the act was committed, juries and courts increasingly rejected this argument. The result was a case-by-case \u201csemantic erosion\u201d of the term \u201caforethought,\u201d until \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d meant nothing more than the intent to kill had to exist <em>at the time </em>the act was committed. Perkins &amp; Boyce, Criminal Law (3rd ed), Murder, \u00a7 1, p 58 (\u201c[a]s case after case came before the courts for determination . . . there came to be less and less emphasis upon the notion of a well-laid plan. And at the present day, the only requirement in this regard is that it must not be an afterthought\u201d). There was, consequently, a parallel erosion of the distinction between capital murder, for which aforethought was required, and non-capital homicide, for which it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Interestingly, although the English courts grew weary of the oft abused \u201clack of aforethought\u201d defense, it was nevertheless evident that there was still some interest in distinguishing between a homicide committed in \u201ccold blood\u201d and one committed under circumstances that mitigated one\u2019s culpability. To express this distinction, the focus shifted from \u201caforethought\u201d to \u201cmalice.\u201d Moreland, <em>supra </em>at 11 (\u201c[t]he law of homicide seems thus to have now progressed from a place where the mental element was of no importance to a place where at the beginning of the seventeenth century it had become a factor of prime importance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Because there was a need to distinguish the most serious homicide from the rest, and because \u201caforethought\u201d no longer had legal significance, malice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>evolved from being merely an intent to kill to also evidencing the absence of mitigating circumstances. Moylan, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 2.7. Consequently, the presence of malice became both synonymous with the absence of mitigating circumstances and the sole element distinguishing murder from manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">We glean from our examination of manslaughter\u2019s historical development that manslaughter is defined to reflect the absence of malice. Thus, the only element distinguishing murder from manslaughter is malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">3. MANSLAUGHTER IS A NECESSARILY LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSE OF MURDER</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">A necessarily lesser included offense is an offense whose elements are completely subsumed in the greater offense. <em>Cornell, supra </em>at 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Regarding voluntary manslaughter, both murder and voluntary manslaughter require a death, caused by defendant, with either an intent to kill, an intent to commit great bodily harm, or an intent to create a very high risk of death or great bodily harm with knowledge that death or great bodily harm was the probable result. However, the element distinguishing murder from manslaughter \u2014 malice\u2014is negated by the presence of provocation and heat of passion. See <em>Scott, supra </em>at 295. Thus, we conclude, the elements of voluntary manslaughter are included in murder, with murder possessing the single additional element of malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Regarding involuntary manslaughter, the lack of malice is evidenced by involuntary manslaughter\u2019s diminished mens rea, which is included in murder\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>greater mens rea. See <em>People v Datema, </em>448 Mich 585, 606; 533 NW2d 272 (1995), stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-4\">\u201c[Plains should be taken not to define [the mens rea required for involuntary manslaughter] in terms of a wanton <em>and </em>wilful disregard of a harmful consequence known to be likely to result, <em>because such a state of mind goes beyond negligence and comes under the head of malice</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">Unlike murder, involuntary manslaughter contemplates an unintended result and thus requires something less than an intent to do great bodily harm, an intent to kill, or the wanton and wilful disregard of its natural consequences. [Citations omitted; emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">See also <em>United States v </em>Browner, 889 F2d 549, 553 (CA 5, 1989), stating, \u201cIn contrast to the case of voluntary manslaughter . . . the absence of malice in involuntary manslaughter arises not because of provocation induced passion, but rather because the offender\u2019s mental state is not sufficiently culpable to reach the traditional malice requirements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Thus, we conclude that the elements of involuntary manslaughter are included in the offense of murder because involuntary manslaughter\u2019s mens rea is included in murder\u2019s greater mens rea.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Accordingly, we hold the elements of voluntary and involuntary manslaughter are included in the elements of murder. Thus, both forms of manslaughter are necessarily included lesser offenses of murder. Because voluntary and involuntary manslaughter are necessarily included lesser offenses, they are also \u201cinferior\u201d offenses within the scope of MCL 768.32. Consequently, when a defendant is charged with murder, an instruction for voluntary and involuntary manslaughter must be given if supported by a rational view of the evidence. <em>Cornell, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>4. TODAY\u2019S HOLDING IS CONSISTENT WITH EARLY MICHIGAN COMMON LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Today\u2019s holding is consistent with our courts\u2019 historical understanding of the law of murder. Michigan courts have historically concluded that a manslaughter instruction is appropriate on a murder charge if a manslaughter instruction is supported by a rational view of the evidence. See, e.g., <em>Hanna v People, </em>19 Mich 316, 321 (1869) (in consideration of MCL 768.32\u2019s similarly worded predecessor, \u201cwithout this provision, the common law rule would, under the statute, dividing murder into degrees, have authorized a conviction not only for murder in the second degree, but for manslaughter also, under an indictment for murder in the first degree, <em>all these being felonies included in the </em>charge\u201d) (emphasis added). See <em>People v Treichel, </em>229 Mich 303, 307-308; 200 NW 950 (1924), stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">This Court has repeatedly held, where the charge as laid includes murder in the first degree, and the proofs establish such degree, and no lesser degree, it is not error for the court to instruct the jury that, in order to convict, murder in the first degree must be found. But this court has not held, under a charge like here laid, the court <em>must </em>instruct the jury to find murder in the first degree or acquit. Whether such an instruction may be given or not depends upon the evidence. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">[In this case, the] information charged murder in the first and second degrees, and this was inclusive of manslaughter. The evidence left it open for the jury to find defendants guilty of manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">See also <em>People v Droste, </em>160 Mich 66, 78-79; 125 NW 87 (1910) (concluding that the trial court was \u201cclearly warranted\u201d in instructing the jury on manslaughter in</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>a murder case because a jury could have concluded there was sufficient intoxication or passion to \u201crob [defendant\u2019s] act of the necessary elements of murder\u201d); <em>People v Andrus, </em>331 Mich 535, 546-547; 50 NW2d 310 (1951) (remarking that it was proper for the court to submit the lesser included offenses of second-degree murder and manslaughter because the evidence was sufficient to support the offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">It was not until this Court overlooked MCL 768.32, and introduced \u201ccognate\u201d lesser included offenses, that the relationship between manslaughter and murder became muddled. In <em>People v Jones, </em>395 Mich 379; 236 NW2d 461 (1975), this Court, without consideration of MCL 768.32, recognized a new category of lesser included offenses called \u201ccognate\u201d offenses. Cognate offenses differed from necessarily included lesser offenses in that cognate offenses share with the higher offense several elements and are of the same class or category, but they contain elements not found in the higher offense. See <em>Cornell, supra </em>at 344-346. Faced with a category of lesser included offenses not previously recognized in Michigan, this Court, in <em>Van Wyck, supra </em>at 268, concluded that manslaughter was a cognate lesser included offense of murder:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">We hold that manslaughter is not a necessarily included offense within the crime of murder but that it may nonetheless be an included offense if the evidence adduced at trial would support a verdict of guilty for that crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">As we noted in <em>People v Ora Jones, </em>supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-8\">\u201cThe common-law definition of lesser included offenses is that the lesser must be such that it is impossible to commit the greater without first having committed the lesser.\u201d [Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\">[With regard to the murder/manslaughter relationship], [t]he absence of mitigating circumstances need not be established in order to convict one of first- or second-degree murder. Consequently, it cannot be said voluntary manslaughter is a necessarily included offense within the crime of murder; it is incorrect to state that it is impossible to commit first- or second-degree murder without having first committed manslaughter. <em>[Van Wyck, supra </em>at 268-269.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Notably, the <em>Van Wyck </em>Court failed to discuss earlier common-law decisions characterizing manslaughter as a lesser included offense of murder before cognate offenses were recognized. We also note that the <em>Van Wyck </em>Court did not give any consideration to the unique relationship between murder and manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">For the reasons discussed above, we conclude manslaughter is a <em>necessarily </em>included lesser offense of murder. We further conclude that <em>Van Wyck\u2019s </em>analysis is flawed inasmuch as it is premised on a body of law recognizing cognate lesser included offenses in contravention of MCL 768.32. Accordingly, to the extent that <em>Van Wyck </em>and its progeny are inconsistent with this opinion and our opinion in Cornell, they are expressly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">C. AN INVOLUNTARY-MANSLAUGHTER INSTRUCTION WAS NOT WARRANTED</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">Having concluded that manslaughter is an inferior offense of murder because it is a necessarily included lesser offense, we now consider whether the trial court erred in refusing to give an involuntary-manslaughter instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>An inferior-offense instruction is appropriate only when a rational view of the evidence supports a conviction for the lesser offense. Cornell, <em>supra </em>at 357. In this case, the Court of Appeals concluded there was sufficient evidence to support an involuntary-manslaughter instruction. In reaching this conclusion, the Court relied on defendant\u2019s statement to the police recounting what happened:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">I was at a gas station on Seven Mile near Hoover when Ivan pulled up in a gray newer model car and asked me did I want some bud. Ivan asked me did I have half on it. I said, yes. I then got into the car with'Ivan. Ivan stopped by one house, then he went to the bud house. When we got to the house, Ivan stayed in the car and I went to the house. When I got to the front door, there was a big guy coming out and motioned for me just to go on in. The guy that let me in continued talking to a big dark-skinned guy with a deep voice. Another guy, kind of frail [Chillers], sitting in a love seat asked me how many I needed. I responded by saying, just one back. That\u2019s when Ivan came to the door. Ivan started talking to the guy with the deep voice. The guy that let me in then left. I started to get my stuff from the frail guy. While I\u2019m getting my stuff, I heard some tussling. I look back and Ivan was tussling with the big guy with the deep voice. They were tussling over a handgun with a dark barrel. While they were tussling, I heard approximately two shots. They then fell into a comer over a chair. I then heard the frail guy holler. He had pulled out a shiny revolver and pointed it at Ivan and the guy he was tussling with. <em>I then tried to knock the gun away from [Chillers]. As I was attempting to knock the gun away from [Chillers], he pulled the trigger. </em>I then tried to ran but I tripped over Ivan .... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The Court of Appeals concluded that defendant\u2019s statement that Chillers pulled the trigger when defendant tried to knock the gun away from him was sufficient to support an involuntary-manslaughter convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>tion. The Court reasoned that defendant\u2019s statement could support a finding that the victim\u2019s killing was an unintended death, without malice, and not caused by any action of defendant naturally tending to cause death.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">We disagree and conclude that defendant\u2019s statement alone is insufficient to support an involuntary-manslaughter instruction. Defendant\u2019s statement does not indicate that the shot fired during the struggle struck or killed the victim. In fact, during his request for an involuntary-manslaughter instruction, defendant argued that the shot fired during the struggle was the nonfatal shot to the victim\u2019s leg.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Therefore, because there is no evidence that the shot fired during the struggle killed the victim, and in light of the substantial evidence that the shot was <em>not </em>the fatal shot, we conclude a rational view of the evidence does not support an involuntary-manslaughter instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">We further disagree with the conclusion of the Court of Appeals that an instruction for common-law involuntary manslaughter was premised on defendant\u2019s theory of the case. Defendant\u2019s theory throughout trial was that someone else was responsible for the victim\u2019s death. Consider defendant\u2019s opening statement, in which he sets forth his theoiy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>What really occurred in this situation that you\u2019ll see is sure, my client Mr. Mendoza and Mr. Tims went over to that location. They didn\u2019t go over there to harm anybody. They went over there to buy what Mr. Stockdale and what Mr. Chillers were in the business to sell, which is marijuana</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">You\u2019ll hear that, that Mr. Tims . . . and another person were tussling over a handgun. And while they\u2019re tussling, shots went off. And my client went over there to try to prevent that from happening. And that\u2019s when the tussle broke out. When my client\u2019s running out of that location, he gets shot by Mr. Chillers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">\n<em>So, it\u2019s not my client that\u2019s doing any shooting in there. It\u2019s Mr. Chillers loho\u2019s causing all these problems and doing shooting in there.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-9\">So, what happened here is after my client, after he\u2019s running away and Mr. Chillers shoots him and he\u2019s running to the car wounded, Mr. Tims on his own goes back up to that front door with that revolver in his hand and started shooting into the house. <em>And that\u2019s when Mr. Stockdale gets shot in the chest.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-11\">This is what I believe the evidence will show . . . That gun was never in the possession of Mr. Mendoza. That gun was the one identified as being in the hands of Mr. Tims when he went back on his own. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-12\">It is, therefore, clear that defendant\u2019s theoiy was that Tims was responsible for the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-13\">In sum, we conclude that a rational view of the evidence did not support an involuntary-manslaughter instruction. Therefore, it was not error for the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>court to deny the instruction. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Manslaughter, in both its forms, is an inferior offense of murder within the meaning of MCL 768.32. Therefore, an instruction is warranted when a rational view of the evidence would support it. <em>Van Wyck </em>and its progeny are overruled to the extent the <em>Van Wyck </em>analysis of the relationship between manslaughter and murder holds otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">In this case, we conclude a rational view of the evidence did not support an involuntary-manslaughter instruction. Therefore, the trial court did not err when it refused to give the instruction. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate defendant\u2019s second-degree murder conviction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b648-8\">Corrigan, C.J., and Weaver, Taylor, and Markman, JJ., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-11\"> Defendant did not cross-appeal to challenge the judgment of the Court of Appeals affirming the trial court\u2019s decision not to give instructions on voluntary manslaughter or careless use of a firearm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b632-9\"> The concurrence criticizes the construction of MCL 768.32 set forth in <em>Cornell, </em>arguing that the Court should apply the dictionary definition of \u201cinferior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">We are confident that we applied the appropriate canon of statutory construction in construing MCL 768.32 by giving \u201cinferior offense\u201d its common-law meaning when it was codified by the Legislature.

To that end, we expressly adopted Justice Coleman\u2019s dissent in <em>People v Jones, </em>395 Mich 379, 395-407; 236 NW2d 461 (1975), which would foreclose consideration of cognate lesser included offenses. <em>Cornell, supra </em>at 353.

See also MCL 8.3a (\u201cAll words and phrases shall be construed and understood according to the common and approved usage of the language . . . .\u201d). If unambiguous, the Legislature will be presumed to have intended the meaning expressed. <em>Lorencz v Ford Motor Co, </em>439 Mich 370, 376; 483 NW2d 844 (1992). We often refer to the dictionary to discern a statute\u2019s plain meaning. See <em>Wayne Co Prosecuting Attorney v Levenburg &amp; Richmond, </em>406 Mich 455, 465-466; 280 NW2d 810 (1979) (dictionaries provide plain meaning). The dispositive issue presented for review is the scope of the term \u201cinferior,\u201d which may be defined as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Inferior. 1. Lower in place. 2. Lower in station, age, or rank in life. 3. Lower in excellence or value; as a poem of inferior merit. 4. Subordinate; of less importance.

Instead, the majority adopts its obiter dictum from <em>Cornell </em>and relies on several prudential (i.e., policy-based) reasons to reject an interpretation of \u201cinferior\u201d that conforms with its everyday usage.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Foremost among the majority\u2019s rationale may be the alleged ease with which the necessarily included lesser offense framework may be applied. <em>Cornell, supra. </em>However, I cannot agree that the majority\u2019s framework can be applied more simply than a \u201clesser offense\u201d inquiry because each varies on the basis of the degree of specificity with which one reviews the elements of a crime. This Court, for example, has wavered on the precise issue presented here. In <em>People v Van Wyck, </em>402 Mich 266; 262 NW2d 638 (1978), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>this Court held that manslaughter was <em>not </em>a necessarily included lesser offense of murder:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\">The absence of mitigating circumstances need not be established in order to convict one of first- or second-degree murder. Consequently, it cannot be said that voluntary manslaughter is a necessarily included offense within the crime of murder; it is incorrect to state that it is impossible to commit first- or second-degree murder without having first committed manslaughter. <em>[Id. </em>at 269.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">As the majority correctly notes today, when viewed in general terms, \u201cthe only element distinguishing murder from manslaughter is malice.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 540. Hence, manslaughter is both an \u201cinferior\u201d and a necessarily included lesser offense of murder; the difference between <em>Van Wyck </em>and the Court\u2019s decision today results from the degree of precision employed by the Court in its analysis of the elements of murder and manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Instead of addressing such difficulties, the majority ignores this and similar inconsistencies. For example, although \u201cfelonious assault\u201d is not strictly a necessarily included lesser offense of \u201cassault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder\u201d because the former requires the use of a dangerous weapon, it is clearly an \u201cinferior\u201d charge as prescribed by any reasonable interpretation of the statute (i.e., \u201cinferior\u201d), yet the majority\u2019s approach provides no means by which to recognize this relationship. Similarly troubling, the crime of \u201cassault with intent to do great bodily harm\u201d is plainly included within the crime of \u201cassault with intent to murder,\u201d but our Courts have held that different degrees of malice (i.e., intent to do great harm versus intent to murder) constitute cognate-not necessarily included-offenses. See, e.g., <em>Peo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number><em>pie v Norwood, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued March 20, 2001 (Docket No. 218207). In sum, the majority\u2019s doctrine cannot logically provide the bright-line rule that it seeks, and its narrow construction is not supported by the text.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Although, I do not dispute that the meaning of MCL 768.32 has been subject to debate lately,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the majority has recently acknowledged that, as early as 1869, this Court permitted convictions on \u201cinferior\u201d offenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">[E]xtending to all cases in which the statute has substantially, or in effect, recognized and provided for the punishment of offenses of different grades, or degrees of enormity, wherever the charge for the higher grade includes a charge for the less. In this view only, can any effect be given to it, as declaratory of, or altering the common law. <em>[Hanna v People, </em>19 Mich 316, 322 (1869).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Before <em>Cornell, </em>this Court repeatedly affirmed this lesser offense approach,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in accord with the plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>meaning of the statute. In <em>People v Jones, </em>395 Mich 379, 387; 236 NW2d 461 (1975), for example, this Court confirmed a case-by-case approach to inferior offense instructions, acknowledging that the strict, common-law rule, which had permitted lesser offense instructions only when necessarily included in the crime charged, had been <em>replaced </em>by a statute that authorized a broader range of convictions \u201cinferior\u201d to the crime charged. Although, the majority attempts to claim its holding has a historical foundation, it, in fact, usurps this Court\u2019s longstanding interpretation, which accords with the statute\u2019s plain meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The majority may claim I have done nothing but pine for the \u201ccognate\u201d or related-offense approach, which it expressly rejected in <em>Cornell. </em>To the degree that a \u201ccognate\u201d offense is \u201cinferior\u201d to the crime charged, I cannot disagree. I remain committed to the \u201clesser included offense\u201d interpretation of \u201cinferior\u201d simply because it is best able to honor the statutory text, as noted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Further, it accords with the longstanding doctrine that requires courts to construe criminal statutes in favor of defendants. In <em>United States v Wiltberger, </em>18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>US (5 Wheat) 76, 95; 5 L Ed 31 (1820), Chief Justice Marshall noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">The rule that penal laws are to be construed strictly, is perhaps not much less old than construction itself. It is founded on the tenderness of the law for the rights of individuals; and on the plain principle that the power of punishment is vested in the legislative, not in the judicial department. It is the legislature, not the Court, which is to define a crime, and ordain its punishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">See also <em>People v Webb, </em>127 Mich 29, 32; 86 NW 406 (1901) (\u201cPenal statutes must be strictly construed, and words used are to be given their popular, rather than a technical, meaning.\u201d); Scalia, <em>A Matter of Interpretation </em>(Princeton, N.J.; Princeton University Press, 1997), p 29 (\u201cThe rule of lenity is almost as old as the common law itself, so I suppose that is validated by sheer antiquity.\u201d) Its application here would give an accused the opportunity to request an instruction in conformity with defense theories, when supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">As noted, this Court today unanimously affirms that a defendant facing a murder charge may request a manslaughter instruction if supported by the evidence. However, nothing in the record would support an involuntary-manslaughter conviction in this case, which requires a finding of death, caused by an act of defendant, with gross negligence. <em>People v Datema, </em>448 Mich 585, 610-613; 533 NW2d 272 (1995) (Cavanagh, J., dissenting). Defendant\u2019s statement to the police suggests only that he attempted to prevent the alleged gunman from shooting his friend. On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>facts presented, if the jury did not believe defendant was culpable of murder beyond a reasonable doubt, the only reasonable alternative was acquittal because defendant\u2019s statement to police indicated an attempt to save the life of another. <em>People v Heflin, </em>434 Mich 482, 554 n 10; 456 NW2d 10 (1990) (Levin, J., dissenting) (noting that the defense of another may <em>justify </em>homicide). To permit a manslaughter conviction on the evidence presented would result in a conviction against the great weight of the evidence. Therefore, I agree that the Court of Appeals opinion should be vacated and that defendant\u2019s conviction should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Because the majority has adopted an interpretation of MCL 768.32 contrary to its plain text and our long-settled rules of statutory construction, I cannot join its rationale.
