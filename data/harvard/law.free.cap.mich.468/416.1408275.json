The Court of Appeals reversed the order of the trial court and held that reba required plaintiff to be a licensed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>real estate broker because it had acted as a \u201cfinder.\u201d We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the trial court for a determination whether defendant\u2019s transaction here constituted a \u201creal estate\u201d transaction for purposes of reba.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Plaintiff is a registered investment advisor, but it is not a licensed real estate broker. Plaintiff introduced itself to defendant, a security-systems company, in order to discuss how it might assist defendant in acquiring other security-systems companies. According to plaintiff, the parties entered into an oral contract, which specified that plaintiff would receive a \u201csuccess fee\u201d for any company plaintiff contacted on defendant\u2019s behalf that defendant subsequently purchased.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiff eventually introduced defendant to a company, MetroCell, a subsidiary of Rao Corporation. Subsequently, defendant purchased the alarm contracts of MetroCell and its customers, and plaintiff sought the \u201csuccess fee.\u201d However, defendant refused to pay, claiming that reba precluded plaintiff from bringing suit because plaintiff had acted as an unlicensed real estate broker. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition, concluding that there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether plaintiff had acted as a \u201creal estate broker.\u201d The Court of Appeals, in a two-to-one decision, reversed. 247 Mich App 247; 635 NW2d 370 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>(2001). This Court granted plaintiff\u2019s application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">H. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Statutory interpretation is an issue of law that is reviewed de novo. <em>People v Morey, </em>461 Mich 325, 329; 603 NW2d 250 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">ffl. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">This Court must determine whether plaintiff\u2019s conduct fell within the scope of Michigan\u2019s real estate brokers licensing act. To determine whether plaintiff acted as a \u201creal estate broker,\u201d this Court must first determine: (a) whether the Legislature intended the definition of \u201creal estate broker\u201d to encompass the brokerage of non-\u201creal estate\u201d transactions; and, if so, (b) whether plaintiff conducted itself as a \u201creal estate broker,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 2501(d) of the Occupational Code. MCL 339.101 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">A. REBA LIMITED TO REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">MCL 339.2501(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-10\">\u201cReal estate broker\u201d means an individual ... [or entity] who with the intent to collect or receive a fee, compensation, or valuable consideration, sells or offers for sale, buys or offers to buy, provides or offers to provide market analysis, lists or offers or attempts to list, or negotiates the purchase or sale or exchange or mortgage of real estate, or negotiates for the construction of a building on real estate; who leases or offers or rents or offers for rent real estate or the improvements on the real estate for others, as a whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>or partial vocation; who engages in property management as a whole or partial vocation; <em>who sells or offers for sale, buys or offers to buy, leases or offers to lease, or negotiates the purchase or sale or exchange of a business, business opportunity, or the goodwill of an existing business for others; </em>or who, as owner or otherwise, engages in the sale of real estate as a principal vocation. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">When construing a statute, the Court\u2019s primaiy obligation is to ascertain the legislative intent that may be reasonably inferred from the words expressed in the statute. <em>Chandler v Co of </em>Muskegon, 467 Mich 315, 319; 652 NW2d 224 (2002). If the language of the statute is unambiguous, the Legislature is presumed to have intended the meaning expressed. <em>Tryc v Michigan Veterans' Facility, </em>451 Mich 129, 135; 545 NW2d 642 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Real estate brokering is not the only profession regulated by the Legislature under the Occupational Code. MCL 339.101 <em>et seq. </em>Rather, the Code regulates a number of other professions, including public accounting, barbering, hearing-aid dealing, and residential building. See MCL 339.720 <em>et seq.; </em>MCL 339.1101 <em>et seq.; </em>MCL 339.1301 <em>et seq.; </em>MCL 339.2401 <em>et seq. </em>A common theme prevails throughout each of these articles \u2014 namely, that each article deals with a single or discrete group of identified professions. For example, article 11 deals only with barbering and does not contain language that would suggest that it applies to any other professions, such as dog grooming.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The doctrine of <em>noscitur a sociis, </em>i.e., that \u201ca word or phrase is given meaning by its context or setting,\u201d affords us assistance in interpreting \u00a7 2501(d). See <em>Koontz v Ameritech Services Inc, </em>466 Mich 304, 318; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>645 NW2d 34 (2002). Thus, we utilize this doctrine, and apply this theme of a \u201csingle or discrete group of identified professions\u201d in the Occupational Code to REBA. Because there is no reason to believe that in drafting reba, the Legislature chose not to employ this \u201csingle or discrete group of identified professions\u201d theme, we find this to be the first indication that reba applies only to the brokering of real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">However, our inquiry does not stop there. Next, we apply <em>noscitur a sociis </em>to the individual phrases of \u00a7 2501(d), as well as to the other provisions of reba because the emphasized language does not stand alone, and thus it cannot be read in a vacuum. Instead, \u201c[i]t exists and must be read in context with the entire act, and the words and phrases used there must be assigned such meanings as are in harmony with the whole of the statute . . . .\u201d <em>Arrowhead Dev Co v Livingston Co Rd Comm, </em>413 Mich 505, 516; 322 NW2d 702 (1982). \u201c[W]ords in a statute should not be construed in the void, but should be read together to harmonize the meaning, giving effect to the act as a whole.\u201d <em>Gen Motors Corp v Erves (On </em>Rehearing), 399 Mich 241, 255; 249 NW2d 41 (1976) (opinion by Coleman, J.). Although a phrase or a statement may mean one thing when read in isolation, it may mean something substantially different when read in context. <em>McCarthy v Bronson, </em>500 US 136, 139; 111 S Ct 1737; 114 L Ed 2d 194 (1991); <em>Hagen v Dep\u2019t of Ed, </em>431 Mich 118, 130-131; 427 NW2d 879 (1988). \u201cIn seeking meaning, words and clauses will not be divorced from those which precede and those which follow.\u201d <em>People v Vasquez, </em>465 Mich 83, 89; 631 NW2d 711 (2001), quoting <em>Sanchick v State Bd of Optometry, </em>342 Mich 555, 559; 70 NW2d 757 (1955). \u201cIt is a famil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>iar principle of statutory construction that words grouped in a list should be given related meaning.\u201d <em>Third Nat\u2019l Bank in Nashville v Impac Ltd, Inc, </em>432 US 312, 322; 97 S Ct 2307; 53 L Ed 2d 368 (1977); see also <em>Beecham v United States, </em>511 US 368, 371; 114 S Ct 1669; 128 L Ed 2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The emphasized language of reba\u2019s definition of \u201creal estate broker,\u201d part iii(a) above, includes the phrase, one \u201cwho . . . negotiates the purchase or sale ... of a business, business opportunity, or the goodwill of an existing business for others . . . .\u201d MCL 339.2501(d). In interpreting this language, we examine its context and must give it a meaning that is not only logically related to the type of broker specifically defined in \u00a7 2501(d), but also a meaning logically related to the other five phrases used in \u00a7 2501(d) to define a \u201creal estate broker,\u201d and the other provisions of reba. <em>Vasquez, supra </em>at 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Section 2501(d) defines not merely a broker, but specifically a \u201creal estate\u201d broker, and thus provides the first indication that the Legislature intended that reba apply only to persons brokering real estate. Further, immediately following reba\u2019s definition of \u201creal estate\u201d broker, the Legislature defines \u201creal estate\u201d salesperson, in terms that expressly cross-reference the definition of \u201creal estate\u201d broker, i.e., a \u201creal estate salesperson\u201d is one who is employed by a \u201creal estate broker.\u201d The Legislature also defines five other terms in \u00a7 2501,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> all of which are defined by express reference to \u201creal estate\u201d or \u201creal property.\u201d The Legislature then employs six definitional phrases in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>\u00a7 2501(d) to give meaning to the term \u201creal estate broker,\u201d and each of those phrases, with the exception of the one at issue, either expressly uses or references the term \u201creal estate.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Legislature proceeds to employ these same definitional phrases in giving meaning to \u201creal estate salesperson.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Moreover, there are other textual indicators that reba applies only to \u201creal estate.\u201d First, the courses an applicant must complete in order to receive a license under this act, a license as a \u201creal estate\u201d broker, all not surprisingly concern real estate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Second, amid this focus on real estate, there is nothing within reba that suggests any legislative intent that it apply to non-\u201creal estate\u201d transactions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, application of the \u201csingle or discrete group of identified professions\u201d theme, along with an examination of the text of \u00a7 2501(d), as well as the text of reba\u2019s surrounding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>provisions, together suggest that reba\u2019s licensing requirement only applies to \u201cthe purchase or sale . . . of a business, business opportunity, or the goodwill of an existing business\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> when that purchase or sale involves a real estate transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">The purpose of REBA, which is to protect the integrity of real estate transactions by ensuring that they are brokered by persons expert in that realm, requires the interpretation that reba applies only to real estate transactions. The conclusion that the emphasized language of \u00a7 2501(d) applies only to real estate transactions affords reasonable meaning to this language within the context of the provisions that surround it, while maintaining the focus of reba on transactions involving the purchase or sale of business real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Alarm contracts are not real estate and, thus, at least on the basis of the present record, reba is not applicable to this transaction, which apparently involved only the purchase of such contracts. However, because our interpretation of \u00a7 2501(d) has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>been previously set forth, and because this case was resolved on summary disposition where the record may not have been fully developed in light of this interpretation, we remand this matter to the trial court for a determination of whether a real estate transaction was involved here.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\">B. \u201cREAL ESTATE BROKER\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">If, on remand, the trial court determines that defendant\u2019s purchase of MetroCell\u2019s contracts involved a real estate transaction, the trial court must then address a further issue: whether plaintiff is prohibited by MCL 339.2512a from seeking compensation for its services because plaintiff was not a licensed \u201creal estate broker.\u201d MCL 339.2501(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">As previously stated, \u00a7 2501(d) defines a \u201creal estate broker\u201d as an individual or entity that \u201csells . . . buys ... or negotiates the purchase or sale ... of a business, business opportunity, or the goodwill of an existing business for others. . . .\u201d MCL 339.2512a provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">A person engaged in the business of, or acting in the capacity of, a person required to be licensed under this article, shall not maintain an action in a court of this state for the collection of compensation for the performance of an act or contract for which a license is required by this article without alleging and proving that the person was licensed under this article at the time of the performance of the act or contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The Court of Appeals held that \u201cplaintiff\u2019s activities constituted \u2018negotiations [for] the purchase or sale or exchange of a business\u2019 as contemplated by the act and that, therefore, [plaintiff] was required to procure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>a real estate brokers license in order to collect fees for its service.\u201d 247 Mich App 252-253. In reaching this conclusion, the appellate court relied on <em>Cardillo v Canusa Extrusion Engineering </em>Inc, 145 Mich App 361; 377 NW2d 412 (1985), observing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-4\">Here, plaintiff found business assets for defendant to purchase, conduct which falls squarely within the definition of activities performed by a \u201creal estate broker\u201d under the act. . . . [I]t is clear that plaintiffs conduct in attempting to locate business assets for purchase by defendant constitutes action of a \u201creal estate broker\u201d as defined by the statute. [247 Mich App 256-257.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">In <em>Cardillo, </em>the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant orally agreed to pay a fee for successfully finding a buyer for the defendant\u2019s engineering firm. The defendant moved for summary disposition, contending that reba precluded the plaintiffs from bringing an action seeking compensation because the plaintiffs were unlicensed as real estate brokers. <em>Cardillo, supra </em>at 364-365. Although the plaintiffs claimed not to be brokers, the Court of Appeals opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">In interpreting this statute, the trial court concluded that a mere finder or middleman is not included in the definition of a broker. We do not agree. . . . Sometimes, performing one of the <em>usual functions, </em>such as finding a purchaser, will be enough to subject a person to the broker licensing requirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">Under this analysis [after reviewing reba], we would hold that in finding a purchaser for defendants\u2019 assets under a commission agreement, plaintiffs were subjected to [reba]. <em>[Id. </em>at 368, 371 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Thus, under <em>Cardillo, </em>one must be a licensed real estate broker when one merely performs one of the \u201cusual functions\u201d of a real estate broker, including among other things \u201cfinding\u201d a purchaser for real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">However, in our judgment, REBA does not require one to be a licensed real estate broker when one merely performs a \u201cusual function\u201d of a real estate broker, such as \u201cfinding\u201d a purchaser. Rather, REBA expressly requires that one be a licensed real estate broker only if, for a fee, one \u201csells or buys\u201d real estate or \u201cnegotiates\u201d a real estate transaction for another. MCL 339.2501(d). Accordingly, to the extent that <em>Cardillo </em>holds otherwise, we believe that it reads too much into \u00a7 2501(d), and, thus, we reject its interpretation of this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">In rejecting Cardillo\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 2501(d), we instead believe that <em>Turner Holdings, Inc v Howard Miller Clock Co, </em>657 F Supp 1370 (WD Mich, 1987), correctly interpreted this provision. In that case, the court held that one need not possess a real estate broker\u2019s license for merely \u201cidentifying and advising\u201d a client about a purchase of a business.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Likewise, unless plaintiff\u2019s actions here are covered by \u00a7 2501(d) \u2014 that is, unless plaintiff\u2019s activities can reasonably be characterized as \u201csell[ing], . . . buy[ing], . . . or negotiating]\u201d the purchase or sale of real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>estate for another for a fee, it is not required to possess a real estate license.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Although, in our judgment, Cardillo's interpretation of reba is incorrect, we agree with Judge White in her dissent in the instant case,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and would also remand to the trial court for consideration of whether plaintiff, in fact, \u201cnegotiated\u201d a real estate transaction with MetroCell (or its parent Rao Coiporation). There is a genuine issue of material fact relating to whether plaintiff participated in real estate negotiations. For example, defendant offered the following evidence of plaintiffs participation in real estate negotiations: (a) that plaintiffs lawyer sent defendant a letter, acknowledging that it \u201crepresented [defendant] in negotiations with Rao Coiporation for the purchase of MetroCell Security over a period of several weeks\u201d; (b) that plaintiffs business brochure stated that plaintiff often engaged in transactions requiring it to perform \u201cacquisition negotiations\u201d; and (c) that plaintiff had meetings with Rao Coiporation to engage in business \u201cdiscussions\u201d of some uncertain character. However, plaintiff presented the following evidence in response: (a) that plaintiff only introduced itself to defendant as an investment banker; (b) that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>alleged oral contract between plaintiff and defendant never mentioned negotiations; (c) that the purpose of plaintiffs initial meeting with Rao Corporation was merely to determine whether MetroCell was for sale; and (d) that the only evidence regarding negotiations are those that occurred between defendant and MetroCell, not between plaintiff and MetroCell. Therefore, if, on remand, the trial court determines that a real estate transaction occurred here, the trial court must then determine also whether plaintiff \u201cnegotiated\u201d such transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">IV. RESPONSE TO THE DISSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The dissent criticizes the majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 2501(d) by asserting that we \u201cignore[] the clear language of the reba\u201d and \u201csidestep [] the plain meaning of the words . . . .\u201d <em>Post </em>at 434, 437. We respectfully, but strongly, disagree. Although we may reach a different conclusion than the dissent, we do not \u201cignore\u201d the language of the statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Rather, our conclusion that the real estate brokers act is limited to transactions involving real estate is predicated on the following analysis: (1) that \u00a7 2501(d) defines a specific type of broker, a \u201creal estate\u201d broker; (2) that the Legislature defines other occupations in this provision, all of which expressly cross-reference \u201creal estate\u201d broker; (3) that the Legislature defines five other terms in \u00a7 2501, all of which are defined by express reference to \u201creal estate\u201d and \u201creal property;\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>(4) that five of the six definitional phrases used by the Legislature in \u00a7 2501(d) either expressly use or reference the term \u201creal estate\u201d; (5) that the Legislature then proceeds to employ these same definitional phrases in giving meaning to \u201creal estate salesperson\u201d; (6) that all the courses that a person is required by the statute to complete to become a \u201creal estate broker\u201d concern real estate; and (7) that other sections of reba <em>only </em>discuss \u201creal estate\u201d and \u201creal estate brokers.\u201d Thus, it is only on the basis of its language that we reach our conclusions concerning the meaning of reba.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Next, the dissent contends that the majority\u2019s interpretation that reba applies only to transactions involving real estate is in error because it \u201cignores the historical evolution of the statute,\u201d which evidences the legislative intent that reba \u201cencompasses the brokerage of business opportunities that do not involve real estate transactions.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 442, 446. However, because the meaning of \u00a7 2501(d) can be reasonably ascertained, in our judgment, by examining its language, including the context of this language, and therefore is not ambiguous, there is no need to resort to the legislative history of the act to assist in our interpretation. Nonetheless, to the extent that this history is examined, we believe that it is consistent with our interpretation of reba.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">In 1919, the Legislature enacted the brokers license act, 1919 PA 306, which was titled, \u201cAn act to define, regulate, and license real estate brokers, real estate salesmen and business chance brokers and to provide a penalty for a violation of the provisions hereof.\u201d Section 2 of that act defined \u201cbusiness chance broker\u201d as \u201cany person, firm, partnership association, copartnership or corporation, who for compensation or valuable consideration sells or offers for sale, buys or offers to buy, or negotiates the purchase or sale or exchange of a business, business opportunity, or the good will of an existing business for others as a whole or partial vocation.\u201d On the basis of this definition, this Court found in <em>Hague v Delong, </em>292 Mich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>262; 290 NW 403 (1940), that a person must be a licensed real estate broker even though a transaction does not involve real estate. Subsequently, in 1943, the Legislature eliminated this separate provision concerning \u201cbusiness chance brokers\u201d and expanded the definition of \u201creal estate broker\u201d to include the activities previously assigned to a business chance broker.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">While we agree with the dissent concerning the facts of this history, we do not agree about its significance. While the dissent views the 1943 amendments as evidencing the Legislature\u2019s intent that the broad definition of \u201cbusiness chance broker,\u201d as defined in <em>Hague, </em>be fully retained as part of reba\u2019s modified definition of \u201creal estate broker,\u201d we view this differently. Rather, the Legislature can just as easily be viewed as having transferred a phrase, originally defining a broad term (\u201cbusiness chance brokers\u201d) occurring within a broad act (encompassing both \u201creal estate\u201d and \u201cbusiness chance\u201d brokers), and reincorporated this phrase within the definition of a more narrow term (\u201creal estate broker\u201d) occurring within a more narrow act (encompassing only \u201creal estate\u201d brokers). Not only does the term itself that is being defined (here, \u201creal estate broker,\u201d rather than \u201cbusiness chance broker\u201d) afford some textual clue about its own definition, see discussion at 442, but the different statutory contexts within which the term is located (here, a statute confined to real estate brokers, rather than one encompassing both real estate and business chance brokers) affords some textual clue about its meaning. We do not believe that a given grouping of words \u2014 in this case \u201cbusiness, business opportunity or good will of an existing business\u201d\u2014 has an invariable meaning regardless of what it pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>ports to be defining, regardless of the words and phrases that surround it, regardless of the organization of the statute in which it is contained, and regardless of the overall purposes of this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">Moreover, we believe that it is necessary to ask why the Legislature in 1943 would have undertaken this apparently substantial rewrite of reba \u2014 modifying its title, and amending the statute in accordance with this title modification by eliminating coverage for \u201cbusiness chance brokers,\u201d and limiting the statute\u2019s coverage to \u201creal estate brokers\u201d-if it had intended that there be no change whatsoever in the scope of the act\u2019s coverage. By itself, the decision to <em>alter </em>the statute suggests some intent to effect a substantive change in the statute. Further, consider that this alteration of the statute occurred against the backdrop of a decision of this Court finding that the 1919 act was clear and encompassed transactions involving the sale of <em>all </em>businesses, real estate or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">For these reasons, we cannot join the dissent in concluding that the Legislature intended that \u201creal estate broker\u201d within reba be understood to mean \u201cbroker,\u201d or \u201ca broker of all things, real estate or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Reba applies only to real estate transactions. Further, under \u00a7 2501(d), one must only be a licensed real estate broker when, for a fee, one \u201csells or buys\u201d real estate or \u201cnegotiates\u201d a real estate transaction for another.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">For these reasons, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>court for a determination of whether a real estate transaction occurred here. If no such transaction occurred, the trial court must merely determine whether an oral contract existed between plaintiff and defendant and compensate plaintiff accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">However, if the trial court determines that a real estate transaction occurred, then, consistently with the language of \u00a7 2501(d) and this opinion, the trial court must also determine whether plaintiffs actions constituted those of a \u201creal estate broker\u201d and proceed accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b534-6\">Corrigan, C.J., and Cavanagh, Kelly, and Taylor, JJ., concurred with Markman, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b518-7\"> We deny plaintiff\u2019s motion to file a postargument supplemental brief regarding plaintiff\u2019s failure to submit at the time of oral argument a signed affidavit on defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition in the trial court.

In our judgment, because goodwill can be acquired merely through a business\u2019s premises, i.e., real estate, and because the surrounding text and provisions of reba relate only to real estate, we find that the \u201cgoodwill\u201d language of \u00a7 2501(d) applies only to situations in which the purchase or sale of an existing business\u2019s goodwill is made in conjunction with the purchase or sale of the premises in which that goodwill was acquired. We believe that such language was inserted in \u00a7 2501(d) to prohibit an unlicensed broker from contending: (1) that it can be compensated for that portion of a real estate transaction that involves non-\u201creal estate,\u201d including the purchase or sale of the existing business\u2019s goodwill, or (2) that it can be compensated for the entire transaction because the purchase or sale of the business\u2019s real estate was incidental to the purchase or sale of the existing business\u2019s goodwill.

We disagree, and we believe that the dissent\u2019s \u201cpig\u201d hypothetical example makes our point. Concerning this hypothetical example, <em>noscitur a sociis </em>can not only be \u201caccurately\u201d applied, but must necessarily be applied. Contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion, the term \u201cpig\u201d does not have a single, invariable meaning. Rather, it has several separate and distinct meanings, including: (1) a swine; (2) a person who is gluttonous, greedy, or slovenly; or (3) an oblong mass of metal that has been run into a mold of sand while still molten. <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(2d ed). Further, \u201cpig\u201d may also be defined as: (4) a segment of a citrus fruit or an apple; (5) a device that fits within an oil or gas pipeline to clean or inspect its insides; or (6) an earthenware pitcher, jar or other vessel. <em>New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary </em>(4th ed). That the first of these definitions would suggest itself to a \u201cnative speaker of English as the common, most likely meaning of the term,\u201d <em>post </em>at 440 n 5, is surely a correct, but an irrelevant, observation on the part of the dissent We do not accord words \u201cdefault\u201d definitions on the basis of their order of appearance in the dictionary. Rather, because the term \u201cpig\u201d has several different meanings, we initially apply <em>noscitur a sociis </em>(whether or not in an explicit fashion) to accord it one of these meanings-that which is contextually related to the language that surrounds \u201cpig.\u201d Such a meaning, we assume, is that which is most likely intended by the lawmaker. In the dissent\u2019s hypothetical example, after examining the immediately surrounding terms, all of which have in common that they relate to animals, we accord \u201cpig\u201d its only meaning possessed in common with these other terms, i.e., \u201ca swine.\u201d Moreover, our analysis would not necessarily stop there. Instead, depending on the matter in controversy, <em>noscitur a sociis </em>might have to be further applied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>determine an even narrower common characteristic between \u201ca swine\u201d and the other listed terms, for example, that each of these terms can be characterized as an animal that is a mammal. Similarly, we believe that the instant phrase is susceptible to different meanings, at least until <em>noscitur a sociis </em>refocuses our inteipretative gaze from the phrase itself to the words and phrases that surround it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b534-7\">Young, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AASV\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"AaT\">The majority ignores the clear language of the reba, MCL 339.2501 <em>et seq., </em>favoring instead an interpretation whose result the majority deems more palatable. The majority also ignores the historical evolution of the statute, which is not dispositive but is entirely consistent with the unambiguous language of the statute.

Because the majority concludes otherwise, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">Plaintiff maintains that transaction it allegedly contracted to perform, which did not involve real estate, is not covered by the reba and thus plaintiff was not required to be licensed under that act as a precondition of bringing suit for breach of the alleged agreement. The majority contends that the issue in this case is whether the Legislature \u201cintended\u201d the definition of real estate broker to encompass the brokerage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>of non-real estate transactions. <em>Ante </em>at 419. However, rather than seeking to divine a free floating legislative intent, I believe that the Court\u2019s task in this case is to determine whether the words <em>actually used </em>by the Legislature encompass the brokerage of business opportunities that do not involve real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">Our obligation of giving effect to the intent of the Legislature begins by examining the language of a statute. The words of a statute provide the most reliable evidence of legislative intent. <em>Coleman v Gurwin, </em>443 Mich 59, 65; 503 NW2d 435 (1993). If the language of the statute is clear, the Legislature must have intended the meaning expressed, and the statute is enforced as written. <em>Turner v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>448 Mich 22, 27; 528 NW2d 681 (1995). It is only in the face of an ambiguity that a court may properly look outside the words utilized in the statute to ascertain legislative intent. <em>Sun Valley Foods Co v Ward, </em>460 Mich 230, 236; 596 NW2d 119 (1999). Finally, in construing a statute, we must give the words used by the Legislature their common, ordinary meaning. MCL 8.3a.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Over the past several years, a majority of this Court has consistently adhered to the philosophy that the plain language of a statute should be applied without regard to the \u201clegislative wisdom\u201d of the outcome. This philosophy is grounded in the belief that separation of powers principles preclude the judiciary from engaging in judicial legislation or otherwise \u201csaving\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>the citizenry from the actions of its duly elected legislators.

I do not believe that the majority\u2019s opinion can be easily squared with the principles of statutory construction outlined in the previously cited cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">A. THE CLEAR LANGUAGE OF THE STATUTE IS NOT LIMITED TO REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The statute at issue is contained in the Occupational Code. MCL 339.2501(d) defines \u201creal estate broker\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>\u201cReal estate broker\u201d means an individual, sole proprietorship, partnership, association, corporation, common law trust, or a combination of those entities who with intent to collect or receive a fee, compensation, or valuable consideration, sells or offers for sale, buys or offers to buy, provides or offers to provide market analyses, lists or offers or attempts to list, or negotiates the purchase or sale or exchange or mortgage of real estate, or negotiates for the construction of a building on real estate; who leases or offers or rents or offers for rent real estate or the improvements on the real estate for others, as a whole or partial vocation; who engages in property management as a whole or partial vocation; <em>who sells or offers for sale, buys or offers to buy, leases or offers to lease, or negotiates the purchase or sale or exchange of a business, business opportunity, or the goodwill of an existing business for others-, </em>or who, as owner or otherwise, engages in the sale of real estate as a principal vocation. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">The plain language of the statute defines a real estate broker as, among other things, one who \u201cnegotiates the purchase ... of a business, business opportunity, or the goodwill of an existing business for others . . . .\u201d There is no textual indication in the statute that brokering a \u201cbusiness,\u201d \u201cbusiness opportunity,\u201d or the \u201cgoodwill of an existing business\u201d is limited to only those transactions involving real estate. To the contrary, the clear language of \u201cbusiness, business opportunity, or the goodwill of an existing business\u201d encompasses the brokerage of transactions without regard to real estate. The majority does not discuss the plain meaning of the statutory language; rather, the majority\u2019s analysis sidesteps the plain meaning of the words and proceeds directly to the use of a canon of statutoiy construction and other contextual tools to explain why the plain language <em>could not possibly </em>mean what it so obviously says.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>In fact, by its very definition, the term \u201cgoodwill\u201d refutes any notion that real estate is the factor common to all the actions assigned to real estate brokers by the Legislature. Goodwill is an intangible asset defined as \u201c[t]he favor which the management of a business wins from the public\u201d and \u201c[t]he fixed and favorable consideration of customers arising from established and well-conducted business.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th ed).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s assertions, goodwill has <em>nothing to do </em>with real estate; rather, it attaches <em>only </em>to an ongoing business concern.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The irreducible problem faced by the major<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>ity is that it cannot fit this round peg into its square hole. That is, the majority cannot declare the term \u201cgoodwill\u201d to mean \u201creal estate\u201d without completely emasculating the definition of \u201cgoodwill.\u201d The majority makes a conscientious effort to ignore the fact that the word \u201cgoodwill\u201d is a legal term of art that is distinct from real estate or any other physical asset.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">B. MISUSE OF STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION CANONS</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Of importance, I believe that the majority misuses canons of statutory construction to actually <em>deprive </em>the words of the statute their customary meaning.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This is contrary to the well-understood principle that statutory construction aids should not be utilized to <em>create </em>an ambiguity where one does not otherwise exist. See <em>In re Certified Question (Henes v Continental Biomass), supra. </em>Under the doctrine of <em>noscitur a sociis, </em>\u201cthe meaning of <em>questionable </em>words and phrases in a statute may be ascertained by reference to the meaning of words or phrases associated with it.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th ed) (emphasis added). United States Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia discussed the meaning of this rule by illustration: \u201cIf you tell me, T took the boat out on the bay,\u2019 I understand \u2018bay\u2019 to mean one thing; if you tell me, T <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>put the saddle on the bay,\u2019 I understand it to mean something else.\u201d Scalia, <em>A Matter of Interpretation, </em>(Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1997), p 26. Using Justice Scalia\u2019s example as a guide, it is clear that the common meaning of the terms \u201cbusiness, business opportunity, or the goodwill of an existing business\u201d are not contextually altered by the rest of the language in the reba.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">I offer the following as an example to illustrate the majority\u2019s abuse and misapplication of this canon of statutory construction. Suppose that a hypothetical statute were to preclude ownership of the following animals without a license:</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Duck, Goose, Bittern, Swan, Heron</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Presume that the word \u201cbittern\u201d had no commonly understood meaning that could be discerned by resort to a dictionary. In order to determine the meaning of the word, the doctrine of <em>noscitur a sociis </em>could be utilized to reasonably come to the conclusion that a bittern is a type of waterfowl. That is, where the meaning of the word is not apparent, the meaning could be ascertained by reference to the meaning of words associated with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Now suppose that the hypothetical example were altered slightly, and the statute listed these animals:</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">Duck, Goose, Pig, Swan, Heron</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">Unlike bittern, the word \u201cpig\u201d does have a fixed, commonly understood meaning, and it is <em>not </em>\u201cwaterfowl.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>However, under the majority\u2019s analysis, the doctrine of <em>noscitur a sociis </em>could properly be used to come to the conclusion that a pig is a waterfowl (despite the clear, unambiguous meaning of pig), because all the surrounding terms were waterfowls.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Similarly, despite the clear and unambiguous meaning of \u201cbusiness, business opportunity, or the goodwill of an existing business,\u201d the majority concludes that these words are limited to those involving \u201ca real estate transaction.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 424. By misuse of the rules of construction, I believe the majority is amending the statute in order to avoid giving meaning to the words the Legislature has employed because to do so would result in the enforcement of a <em>policy </em>the majority rejects as unsound. The doctrinal difference separating me from the majority is that I am satisfied with applying the plain meaning of the statutory words, whereas the majority is uncomfortable with a construction that results in licensed real estate bro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>kers being the only persons in Michigan authorized to buy and sell businesses for others for a fee. This is an admittedly odd result, but one of the Legislature\u2019s making. As my colleague Justice Taylor has observed elsewhere, I \u201ctake comfort in the fact that the Legislature is free to amend\u201d this statute if it now considers that the statute no longer reflects a sound policy choice. <em>People v Hermiz, supra </em>at 80 n 13. I fully agree with the proposition that \u201cthe Legislature should not have to suffer judicial interference with the choice made in its legislative product.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81. Thus, in my view, it remains the duty of the Legislature, not this Court, to change the state\u2019s licensing policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">C. THE HISTORICAL IMPORT OF THE STATUTORY PHRASE</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">In addition to ignoring the most obvious, common meaning of the disputed statutory provisions, which as the primary consideration, resolves the question before the Court, the majority ignores the historical evolution of the statute and the distinct meaning given to the \u201cbusiness chance broker\u201d provisions. While this history is by no means dispositive, reba\u2019s text being the most compelling basis for determining the intent of that statute, it does provide additional comfort that the construction I offer is sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">In 1919, the Legislature enacted the brokers license act, 1919 PA 306, which was titled \u201cAn act to define, regulate, and license real estate brokers, real estate salesmen and business chance brokers and to provide a penalty for a violation of the provisions [of the act].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Section 2 of the brokers license act defined \u201cbusiness chance broker,\u201d and provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-4\">A business chance broker within the meaning of this act is any person, firm, partnership association, copartnership or corporation, <em>who for a compensation or valuable consideration sells or offers for sale, buys or offers to buy, or negotiates the purchase or sale or exchange of a business, business opportunity, or the good will of an existing business for others as a whole or partial vocation. </em>[1919 PA 306 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">In 1943, the \u201cbusiness chance broker\u201d section was eliminated, and the provisions delineating the responsibilities of business chance brokers were transferred <em>verbatim </em>to the real estate broker licensing act. Thus, the statutory definition of real estate broker was expanded to include those activities previously assigned to business chance brokers. The formerly separate business chance broker provision incorporated into the real estate broker provision is highlighted below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">A real estate broker within the meaning of this act is any person, firm, partnership association, copartnership or corporation, who with intent to collect or receive a fee, compensation or valuable consideration, sells or offers for sale, buys or offers to buy, appraises or offers to appraise, lists or offers or attempts to list, or negotiates the purchase or sale or exchange or mortgage of real estate, or negotiates for the construction of buildings thereon, or who leases or offers to lease or rents or offers for rent any real estate or the improvements thereon for others, as a whole or partial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>vocation, <em>or who sells or offers for sale, buys or offers to buy, leases or offers to lease, or negotiates the purchase or sale or exchange of a business, business opportunity, or the good will of an existing business for others, </em>or who, as owner or otherwise, engages in the sale of real estate as a principal vocation. [1943 PA 57.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">From these legislative actions, I conclude that the Legislature made a deliberate and conscious decision not to eliminate activities formerly performed by business chance brokers, but to <em>reassign </em>to real estate brokers those activities previously performed by business chance brokers. Therefore, an evaluation of those activities historically performed by business chance brokers is particularly instructive on understanding the definition of these activities reassigned to real estate brokers that are at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Before its statutory introduction in 1919, the term \u201cbusiness chance broker\u201d did not exist in Michigan. The term and its function were entirely a creation of the Legislature.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While there are but a few cases addressing the \u201cbusiness chance broker,\u201d there is clear indication in our case law that the activities of a business chance broker were not limited to transactions involving real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\"><em>Hague v DeLong, </em>292 Mich 262; 290 NW 403 (1940), involved the stock sale of a company. There, this Court held that a brokerage firm was precluded from collecting a commission on the sale of all the capital stock of a company because plaintiff was not licensed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>as a business chance broker.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The issue dividing the evenly split Court in <em>Hague </em>was whether the agreement was for the mere sale of stock or for the \u201csale of a business\u201d within the meaning of the act. The prevailing side held that the agreement was for the sale of the business and that the sale of stock was merely incidental.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The dissent concluded that the agreement was merely for the sale of stock. The dissent acknowledged, however, that if the purpose of the stock transaction were the sale of the business, plaintiff would be precluded from recovery because he was not licensed as required by the act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Thus, in <em>Hague, </em>decided three years before the statutory transfer of the functions of business chance brokers, the activities of a business chance broker were unanimously determined to encompass efforts that did not involve real estate transactions \u2014 in that case, the sale of stock. The majority here not only ignores the plain meaning of the words, but also the historical meaning given to the business chance broker provisions. To the contrary, I believe that the clear language of the statute, in addition to the historical meaning given to \u201cbusiness chance brokers,\u201d mili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>tates against a conclusion that the Legislature in 1943 intended that the transferred business chance broker duties became limited to only those transactions involving real estate. Contrary to the majority\u2019s apparent belief that a transaction not involving real estate would not fall within the ambit of reba, the statutory text and historical construction of this language indicate that stockbrokers and investment bankers were <em>in fact </em>business chance brokers under idential statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">It is certainly within the Legislature\u2019s constitutional prerogative and authority to decide what activities require licensure. I tend to agree that the choices made by the Legislature in enacting legislation regulating business chance brokers, and subsequently real estate brokers, may make little sense in today\u2019s economy. However, I do not believe that this Court has the constitutional authority to \u201cfix\u201d the statute to better suit our modem economy according to our own policy assumptions. Rather, it is the responsibility of the Legislature to rescind or amend statutes that are no longer viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Under the clear language of the statute, supported by the historical interpretation and eventual transfer of the activities of the business chance broker into those assigned to real estate brokers, I believe that the statute encompasses the brokerage of business opportunities that do not involve real estate transactions. Therefore, the plaintiff was required to be a licensed real estate broker as a precondition to entering into the alleged contract and is now precluded by MCL 339.2512a from suing to enforce any such contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion and would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b547-4\">Weaver, J. I dissent from the majority for the reasons stated in parts a and c only of Justice Young\u2019s dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b535-6\"> Indeed, the statutory construction rules, MCL 8.3 <em>et seq., </em>provide a compelling justification, if any were needed, for hewing closely to the common meaning of the words employed in a statute: The Legislature is drafting its statutes in reliance that courts will follow the statutory canons of construction the Legislature has adopted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b538-5\"> See also <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(2002), which defines goodwill as \u201can intangible, salable asset arising from the reputation of a business and its relations with its customers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b538-6\"> The majority\u2019s quotation of Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, wherein the majority states that \u201c[p]urchase of <em>\u2018the premises </em>in which [the] business is conducted\u2019 is one way to acquire \u2018goodwill\u2019 \u201d is patently false and taken out of context. Ante at 424 n 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Read in its entirety, the passage states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-8\">The custom of patronage of any established trade or business; the benefit or advantage of having established a business and secured its patronage by the public. <em>And as property incident to business sold, </em>favor vendor has won from public, and probability that all customers will continue that patronage. It means every positive advantage that has been acquired by a proprietor in carrying on his business, whether connected with the premises in which the business is conducted, or with the name under which it is managed, or with any other matter carrying with it the benefit of the business. [Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Thus, when an ongoing business <em>and </em>its physical assets are purchased, goodwill comes with it. However, purchase of the premises <em>alone </em>does not convey goodwill. Similarly, the purchase of only the ongoing business without its physical assets will convey goodwill.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">The majority is compelled to ignore the fact that goodwill is never associated with anything other than the value of the <em>continued patronage of an ongoing business concern </em>in order to advance its argument that the reba concerns only real estate transactions. See <em>Pontiac Trust Co v Newell, </em>266 Mich 490, 501; 254 NW 178 (1934) (\u201c[G]oodwill cannot exist without a going concern . . . .\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b539-6\"> In addition to misconstruing canons of statutory construction, the majority also invents new ones. After noting that each article in the Occupational Code \u201cdeals with a single or discrete group of identified professions,\u201d the majority proceeds to utilize and quote the \u201c \u2018single or discrete group of identified professions\u2019 theme\u201d as a divining rod for legislative intent. <em>Ante </em>at 420 and 423. This method appears to be an application of a variant of the principle of <em>in pari materia, </em>not <em>noscitur a sociis, </em>which is properly used only where an ambiguity exists. <em>Tyler v Livonia Pub Schools, </em>459 Mich 382, 390-392; 590 NW2d 560 (1999). It appears obvious that the majority is willing to ignore distinctions between interpretive canons in order to arrive at its preferred construction of reba.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b540-11\"> We agree with the majority that \u201cpig\u201d does have many meanings beyond swine. <em>Ante </em>at 430-431 n 12. However, none of the alternatives cited in the majority opinion, such as an \u201coblong mass of metal,\u201d would suggest themselves to a native speaker of English as the common, most likely meaning of the term as used in our hypothetical statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b541-5\"> The majority uses <em>noscitur a sociis </em>to suggest, not that the correct definition of \u201cpig\u201d is a swine, but that the level of abstraction should move from \u201cwaterfowl and swine\u201d to animals or mammals. The majority must do so because it desires to give no meaning (at least not the meaning every other person familiar with these terms would give them) to the reba terms that originally constituted the business chance broker statute. Surely, the majority\u2019s approach is unlimited by any common sense. Thus, using the minority\u2019s method, we could abstract the meaning to the point that we could characterize the terms in our hypothetical statute as meaning \u201cEnglish words\u201d or \u201cnouns.\u201d The majority must make such an abstraction because giving the equivalents of \u201cpig\u201d in reba their obvious meaning results in a construction the majority does not like. The majority fails to explain why it is appropriate, given goodwill\u2019s definite meaning as a term of art (which is completely divorced from the term \u201creal estate\u201d), to \u201cabstract\u201d the term in the manner it does. The action taken by the majority is actually a redefinition, not an abstraction. Moreover, it is also unclear what principle, if any, the majority employs to discern the appropriate level of \u201cabstraction\u201d to be used in any given application of its new rule of construction. This is no longer a principle of statutory construction. It is a rule of deconstruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b543-7\"> In 1937, a provision was added to \u00a7 3 of the act, stating that \u201c[t]he commission of a single act prohibited under the Michigan statutes defining, regulating and licensing real estate brokers and salesmen shall constitute a violation thereof.\u201d 1937 PA 188.
