The Court of Appeals reversed defendant\u2019s convictions, holding that defendant was denied a fair trial when the prosecution elicited testimony from its \u201ckey witness\u201d that the witness had taken and passed a polygraph test. Although we agree with the Court of Appeals that introduction of this testimony was error, we hold that defendant\u2019s convictions should not be reversed because the unpreserved, nonconstitutional error did not affect defendant\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the matter to that Court to address an issue that was raised before that Court, but not decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">On August 11, 1998, at approximately 2:00 to 3:00 A.M., a Saginaw resident named Oliver R. Henderson was kicked and stomped to death<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by two men. The prosecution alleged the assailants to be Kim G. Martin and the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The evidence against the defendant included a dna match of the victim\u2019s blood on defendant\u2019s trousers,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which were seized from defendant\u2019s house, inculpatory statements that he made before and after the killing, testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s actions two hours after the assault, and testimony of an eyewitness.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Julie Pryor, who has a child fathered by defendant, testified that before the assault defendant had said that he was going to take revenge on the person that had taken his television.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-8\"><em>A. </em>[Pryor] said, I\u2019m going to get them, you know. I\u2019m going to hurt them. I\u2019m going to beat them up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-9\">* <em>* *</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-10\"><em>A. </em>[Pryor] I can\u2019t recall exactly, but I know he said, I am going to get that M-F-r. I\u2019m going to kick his A.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">Pryor testified that, after 5:00 AM. on August 11, defendant had come home, asked her if the police had been by, and changed his clothes. Pryor also testified that later she asked defendant if he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>attacked the victim, \u201cRodell,\u201d and that defendant admitted that he had done it.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\"><em>Q. </em>Did you have occasion to speak with the defendant, Jonathan Joe Jones, about what had happened to Rodell [the deceased]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\"><em>A. </em>Yeah, but it wasn\u2019t once or twice maybe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\"><em>Q. </em>Where was it that you spoke to him about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\"><em>A. </em>At Mike\u2019s house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\"><em>Q. </em>What did he say about what had happened to Rodell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\"><em>A. </em>I just asked him, you know, why he did it. And he said he took the TV and told him why. He wouldn\u2019t say nothing else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-11\"><em>Q. </em>Did he seem remorseful?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-12\"><em>A. </em>No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-13\"><em>Q. </em>Did he tell you any specific acts that he had done to Rodell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-14\"><em>A. </em>No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-15\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-16\"><em>Q. </em>So you asked him specifically if he had done this to RodeH?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-17\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-18\"><em>Q. </em>And he admitted to you that he had?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-19\"><em>A. </em>Yeah.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-20\">Pryor also testified that on another occasion, while defendant was talking about the victim, she overheard defendant say \u201che stomped his ass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-21\">On the first day of trial, while cross-examining a police officer, defense counsel sought to demonstrate that Ricky Jones,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> an eyewitness to the killing, had told multiple stories during the course of the investigation. Counsel asked the officer, \u201cIn fact, you gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Mr. Jones a polygraph on two different occasions, is that correct?\u201d The circuit court sustained the assistant prosecutor\u2019s immediate objection, and the question was never answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">At the next recess, the assistant prosecutor moved for a mistrial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">I\u2019m moving for a mistrial based upon [defense counsel's] referral to the fact that Ricky Jones was given a polygraph test. Clearly if the People brought this out about defendant it would be grounds for a mistrial, and I believe it\u2019s just as inappropriate for defense to attack a prosecution witness through the use of inadmissible evidence as it would be for the People to do the same thing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The court denied the motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\">Well, I believe it could be handled by a curative instruction. I don\u2019t think it manifests necessity and jeopardy has attached. I will deny the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">No curative instruction was given, nor was one requested by either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">The following day, Ricky testified. Ricky stated that Kim Martin was kicking the victim in the head. After a time, Martin asked defendant, \u201cDid you want a piece of this?\u201d Defendant then joined in. Defendant jumped and landed with both feet on the victim\u2019s head four or five times. Ricky acknowledged that he drank three to five forty-ounce beers over a twelve to fourteen hour period on the day of the attack, and had ingested $30 to $40 worth of crack cocaine several hours before witnessing the attack. Near the end of his testimony on direct examination by the assistant prosecutor, the following exchange occurred.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-11\"><em>Q. </em>Did you take a polygraph in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-4\"><em>Q. </em>Did you pass that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-5\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\"><em>[.Defense </em>Counsel]: I\u2019m going to object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\"><em>The Court: </em>Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\"><em>[Assistant Prosecuting </em>Attorney]: Judge, that was brought up yesterday over my objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-9\"><em>The Court: </em>Sustained. Sustained. Move on. Move on.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">No curative instruction was offered or requested, nor did defendant move to strike the witness\u2019s answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">At the conclusion of the jury trial, defendant was found guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. He was sentenced to two concurrent terms of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">Defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals, which reversed defendant\u2019s convictions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals focused on the assistant prosecutor\u2019s question to Ricky about the polygraph examination that he had taken and passed. The Court of Appeals held that the assistant prosecutor\u2019s question violated the bright-line rule that testimony concerning the result of a polygraph examination is not admissible at trial. <em>People v Barbara, </em>400 Mich 352, 377; 255 NW2d 171 (1977). The Court of Appeals reversed defendant\u2019s convictions, holding that the error was prejudicial to defendant and seriously affected the fairness of the judicial proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">We granted the prosecutor\u2019s motion for leave to appeal limited to the issue whether defendant\u2019s conviction should be reversed because the assistant pros<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>ecutor asked a key witness whether he had taken and passed a polygraph examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">In our grant of leave to appeal, we asked the parties to address the doctrine of invited error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, our review of this case has convinced us that invited error is not the relevant doctrine. Rather, it would be more accurate to characterize the applicable doctrine as \u201cinvited response.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>The doctrine of invited response is used as an aid in determining whether a prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks require the reversal of a defendant\u2019s conviction. It is used not to excuse improper comments, but to determine their effect on the trial as a whole. <em>Darden v Wainwright, </em>477 US 168, 182; 106 S Ct 2464; 91 L Ed 2d 144 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The United States Supreme Court has recognized that the doctrine of invited response has an appropriate place in determining whether the prosecutor\u2019s closing remarks affected the fairness of a trial. <em>United States v Young, </em>470 US 1, 12-13; 105 S Ct 1038; 84 L Ed 2d 1 (1985). Under the doctrine of invited response, the proportionality of the response, as well as the invitation, must be considered to determine whether the error, which might otherwise require reversal, is shielded from appellate relief. <em>Young, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">We now apply this doctrine as an aid to determine whether the prosecutor\u2019s improper introduction of evidence at trial affected the fairness of the trial. In determining the effect of the prosecutor\u2019s improper introduction of the polygraph, we must analyze the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>circumstances surrounding that error, including the defense counsel\u2019s conduct. Whether Ricky had taken a polygraph examination (and, inevitably, whether Ricky had passed the examination) was introduced by defense counsel. By its very nature, especially in the context of the defense\u2019s attack on the credibility of Ricky, this question tended strongly to imply that Ricky had \u201cfailed\u201d the polygraph examination. Nevertheless, we specifically disapprove of the prosecutor\u2019s knowing inappropriate behavior in introducing the evidence of the polygraph examination. The prosecution objected to defense counsel's improper question, and the court sustained that objection. Further, the court offered to provide a curative instruction, although ultimately one was not requested by either party. It was the assistant prosecutor who then decided on his own to offer the inadmissible evidence in rebuttal to the defense attorney\u2019s question about the polygraph. As the Court emphasized in <em>Young, </em>the idea of invited response is not to be read as suggesting judicial approval of response-in-kind. <em>Id. </em>at 10. In this case, the trial court had offered the remedy of a curative instruction. The prosecution was not entitled to take the matter of balancing the equities into its own hands. A prosecutor has the responsibility of a minister of justice, not simply that of an advocate.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The issue is whether the assistant prosecutor\u2019s question to Ricky about the polygraph test is error requiring reversal of defendant\u2019s convictions. We review this under the standards for unpreserved, non-constitutional error. Defense counsel objected to the prosecutor\u2019s questions, but only after they had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>already been answered, and did not request that the answers be stricken. We agree with the rule that to be timely, an objection should be interposed between the question and the answer. See <em>In re Weiss, </em>224 Mich App 37, 39; 568 NW2d 336 (1997). The purpose of requiring objections to be timely, see MRE 103(a)(1), is to give the trial court an opportunity to correct the error. <em>People v Grant, </em>445 Mich 535, 551; 520 NW2d 123 (1994). Accordingly, we review defendant\u2019s claim of error under the standard for unpreserved, nonconstitutional error set out in <em>People v Grant, supra, </em>and <em>People v Carines, </em>460 Mich 750; 597 NW2d 130 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">To avoid forfeiture of an unpreserved, nonconstitutional plain error, the defendant bears the burden of establishing that: (1) error occurred, (2) the error was plain, i.e., clear or obvious, and (3) the plain error affected substantial rights. <em>Grant, supra </em>at 548-549, and <em>Carines, supra </em>at 763. Once the defendant establishes these three elements, the appellate court must still exercise its discretion in deciding whether to reverse. Reversal is warranted only when the plain, unpreserved error resulted in the conviction of an actually innocent defendant or when an error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings independent of the defendant\u2019s innocence. <em>Carines, supra </em>at 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">We agree with the Court of Appeals that the first two criteria were met. As the parties concede, testimony concerning the result of a polygraph examination is not admissible at trial, <em>Barbara, supra. </em>The bright-line rule that evidence relating to a polygraph examination is inadmissible is well established. See <em>Barbara, supra, </em>and <em>People v Brocato, </em>17 Mich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>App 277, 290-294; 169 NW2d 483 (1969). Further, the assistant prosecutor had earlier objected to defense counsel\u2019s attempt to inject a reference to the polygraph examination. Thus, there is no question that this was plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">The question is whether this plain error affected defendant\u2019s substantial rights. To establish that a plain error affected substantial rights, there must be a showing of prejudice, i.e., that the error affected the outcome of the lower-court proceedings. <em>Grant, supra. </em>The defendant bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice. <em>Carines, supra </em>at 763. The Court of Appeals held that the error required reversal because Ricky was the prosecution\u2019s key witness\u2014 the only eyewitness to the attack. We disagree, and hold that defendant has failed to meet his burden of persuasion regarding prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">As we outlined above, there was substantial evidence corroborating Ricky\u2019s testimony. Bloodstains matching the victim\u2019s blood were found on Kim Martin\u2019s shoes and defendant\u2019s pants. There was testimony that two hours after the attack, the defendant returned home, asked Julie Pryor if the police had been there, and changed his clothes. Further, Julie Pryor testified that she had heard defendant admit committing the attack on the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">We also consider, as a factor in determining whether the error affected defendant\u2019s substantial rights, that this was an invited response. Although the testimony that Ricky had passed the polygraph examination did tend to improperly bolster his credibility, it clearly was in rebuttal to the defense counsel\u2019s earlier, inaccurate suggestion that Ricky had failed a polygraph examination. The prosecutor elicited the testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>mony that the witness had actually passed the polygraph to rebut this false implication. However, there would have been no need to rebut such a false implication if defense counsel had not previously attacked Ricky\u2019s credibility with the use of inadmissible evidence. We find that this reduces any potential harm resulting from the improper polygraph evidence introduced by the prosecutor.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion, we do not hold that the invited-response doctrine excuses the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cwillful and deliberate side-stepping of the trial court\u2019s ruling . . . .\u201d <em>Post </em>at 362. Rather, as we have explained, n 6, the prosecutor\u2019s conduct did <em>not </em>constitute a \u201cfair response\u201d; the prosecutor improperly took matters into his own hands by eliciting the inadmissible evidence regarding the polygraph test. Nevertheless, much as the United States Supreme Court did in <em>Young, supra, </em>we have examined the prosecutor\u2019s conduct in context and have determined that although error occurred, reversal under the plain-error doctrine is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">In <em>Young, </em>the defendant was on trial for mail fraud and other crimes arising out of a transaction with Apeo Oil Corporation. During summation, defense counsel intimated that the prosecution deliberately withheld exculpatory evidence and attempted to cast a false light on the defendant\u2019s activities. Defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>counsel pointed at the prosecutor\u2019s table and stated: \u201cI submit to you that there\u2019s not a person in this courtroom including those sitting at this table who think that [the defendant] intended to defraud Apeo.\u201d <em>Young, supra </em>at 4-5 (citation omitted). The prosecutor did not object to defense counsel\u2019s summation, but responded to this statement during rebuttal argument by commenting: \u201c T think [defense counsel] said that not anyone sitting at this table thinks that Mr. Young intended to defraud Apeo. Well, I was sitting there and I think he was. ... If we are allowed to give our personal impressions <em>since it was asked of me.'\" Id. </em>at 5 (citation omitted). Defense counsel did not object and did not request any curative instructions. On appeal, however, defendant argued that he was unfairly prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s remarks during rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The Court held that the issue was not whether the prosecutor\u2019s response was appropriate, but whether it was \u201cplain error\u201d that a reviewing court could act on absent a timely objection. The Court noted that both defense counsel and the prosecutor played fast and loose with the rules of professional conduct; the Court cautioned that \u201c[t]he kind of advocacy shown by this record has no place in the administration of justice and should neither be permitted nor rewarded; a trial judge should deal promptly with any breach by either counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9. However, the Court held that \u201cthe issue is not the prosecutor\u2019s license to make otherwise improper arguments, but <em>whether the prosecutor\u2019s \u2018invited response, \u2019 taken in context, unfairly prejudiced the defendant.\" Id. </em>Thus, the reviewing court must \u201cnot only weigh the impact of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, but must also take into account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>defense counsel\u2019s opening salvo.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12 (emphasis supplied.) The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">[T]he prosecutor\u2019s statement of Ms belief that the evidence showed Apeo had been defrauded should not have been made; it was an improper expression of personal opinion and was not necessary to answer defense counsel\u2019s improper assertion that no one on the prosecution team believed respondent intended to defraud Apeo. <em>Nevertheless, we conclude that any potential harm from this remark was mitigated by the jury\u2019s understanding that the prosecutor was countering defense counsel\u2019s repeated attacks on the prosecution\u2019s integrity and defense counsel\u2019s argument that the evidence established no such crime. [Id. </em>at 17-18 (emphasis supplied).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">We find the <em>Young </em>Court\u2019s plain error analysis to be persuasive. The facts of this case are directly analogous to those present in <em>Young-. </em>The prosecutor and defendant each played fast and loose with the rules of professional conduct when they, in turn, attempted to place inadmissible polygraph evidence before the jury. However, as in <em>Young, </em>any potential prejudice to defendant resulting from the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was mitigated by the fact that he was acting in response to defense counsel\u2019s own improper attempt to create a false inference that Ricky had failed a polygraph examination. Moreover, in light of the substantial evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt, the error cannot be said to have been outcome-determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Given the substantial evidence corroborating Ricky\u2019s testimony and establishing defendant\u2019s guilt and defense counsel\u2019s prior, improper attempt to create a false inference that Ricky had failed a polygraph examination, the additional improper bolstering created by the testimony that Ricky had taken and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>passed a polygraph test was not outcome-determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Because defendant has not met his burden of establishing that the error complained of affected the outcome of the lower-court proceedings, defendant did not establish the three elements necessary to avoid forfeiture. Accordingly, defendant forfeited the claim of error by not timely objecting to the assistant prosecutor\u2019s question to Ricky about the polygraph test.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">For these reasons, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the judgment of the circuit court. MCR 7.302(G)(1). The Court of Appeals did not address defendant\u2019s argument that his convictions should be reversed because the circuit court admitted gruesome photographs. We remand the case to the Court of Appeals to address that issue. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b460-7\">Corrigan, C.J., and Taylor, Young, and Markman, JJ., concurred with Weaver, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b460-8\">Cavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayk\">I must respectfully dissent. I agree with the majority only to the extent that introduction of the polygraph evidence constitutes an unpreserved error. To avoid forfeiture of an unpreserved error, whether constitutional or nonconstitutional, a defendant must prove three things: (1) the error occurred, (2) the error was plain, and (3) the plain error affected defendant\u2019s substantial rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>People v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number><em>Grant, </em>445 Mich 535, 548-549; 520 NW2d 123 (1994); <em>People v Carines, </em>460 Mich 750, 763; 597 NW2d 130 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">I agree with the majority that defendant has met the first two prongs. However, I must respectfully dissent from the remainder of the opinion because I disagree with the majority\u2019s assertion that defendant has not met his burden of persuasion with respect to the effect the error had on his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">An error \u201caffecting substantial rights\u201d is an error that is \u201cprejudicial.\u201d In <em>Grant, supra </em>at 553, this Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">a plain, <em>unpreserved </em>error may not be considered by an appellate court for the first time on appeal unless the error could have been decisive of the outcome or unless it falls under the category of cases, yet to be clearly defined, where prejudice is presumed or reversal is automatic. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">While, admittedly, there is other evidence against defendant in this case, bolstering the credibility of the (otherwise incredible) sole eyewitness with the admission of polygraph-examination results is clearly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Polygraph-examination evidence is excluded from trial because it \u201cha[s] not received the degree of standardization or acceptance among scientists which would warrant admissibility.\u201d <em>People v Barbara, </em>400 Mich 352, 364; 255 NW2d 171 (1977). One of the earliest cases in which this Court examined the admissi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>bility of polygraph examinations was <em>People v Davis, </em>343 Mich 348; 72 NW2d 269 (1955). In that case, this Court recognized \u201c[t]he tremendous weight which such tests would necessarily carry in the minds of [jurors].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 372. Although the majority notes the bright-line rule against introducing polygraph-examination evidence, the majority minimizes the effect of that violation on defendant\u2019s substantial rights by calling it an \u201cinvited response.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The majority\u2019s use of the doctrine of \u201cinvited response\u201d \u201cas an aid to determine whether the prosecutor\u2019s improper introduction of evidence at trial affected the fairness of the trial\u201d <em>ante </em>at 353, is flawed in two major respects. First, the \u201cinvited response\u201d rule does not allow a party to introduce evidence in response to an improper action. Both cases on which the majority relies, <em>Darden v Wainwright, </em>477 US 168; 106 S Ct 2464; 91 L Ed 2d 144 (1986), and <em>United States v Young, </em>470 US 1; 105 S Ct 1038; 84 L Ed 2d 1 (1985), involved \u201cresponses\u201d made in the prosecutor\u2019s closing remarks, not \u201cresponses\u201d in the form of clearly inadmissible evidence. The prosecutor\u2019s willful and deliberate sidestepping of the trial court\u2019s ruling on his objection is not the type of \u201cresponse\u201d contemplated by the \u201cinvited response\u201d doctrine. The doctrine of \u201cinvited response,\u201d as adopted by the United States Supreme Court, does not allow a prosecutor to introduce evidence in derogation of the trial court\u2019s ruling that such evidence is improper simply because it is a \u201cresponse\u201d to defense counsel\u2019s actions. The majority claims that \u201c[t]he facts of this case are directly analogous to those present in <em>Young-. </em>The prosecutor and defendant each played fast and loose with the rules of professional conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>. . . <em>Ante </em>at 359. What the majority fails to recognize in its \u201canalogy\u201d is that the attorneys in <em>Young </em>\u201cplayed fast and loose with the rules of professional conduct\u201d in making their closing remarks (which are not to be considered as evidence by the jury), while the attorneys in this case played fast and loose with introduction of evidence itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">The second problem with the majority\u2019s application of the \u201cinvited response\u201d doctrine is the failure to recognize that the doctrine applies where there was no objection to the initial impropriety.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here, the prosecutor timely objected to the improper question regarding the polygraph examination. The objection was sustained, and the question remained unanswered. Yet, apparently because the prosecutor was unsatisfied with the trial judge\u2019s refusal to grant a mistrial, he felt compelled to ignore the judge\u2019s ruling and elicit information regarding the polygraph examination on cross-examination. The \u201cinvited response\u201d doctrine should not be expanded so it can be used as a vehicle for circumventing the rulings of trial judges on the admissibility of evidence, nor should it be applied so as to implicitly condone the conduct of the prosecutor in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>The proper procedure when a party attempts to introduce inadmissible evidence is an objection. In this case, a proper objection was made to defense counsel\u2019s improper question; the trial judge correctly sustained the objection. Instead of requesting the curative instruction proposed by the judge, the prosecutor chose to ignore the trial court\u2019s ruling and attempted to right the wrong on his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The majority\u2019s expansion of the \u201cinvited response\u201d doctrine to allow total disregard for the rulings of the trial judge, as well as the evidentiary rules, could have catastrophic results. Allowing introduction of polygraph-examination evidence through the back door eviscerates the protections guaranteed by the Michigan Rules of Evidence and encourages attorneys to retaliate against the introduction or attempted introduction of improper evidence in any manner they see fit. The prosecutor in this case intentionally ignored the trial court\u2019s ruling and declined the proper method of addressing defendant\u2019s improper question. It is exactly this type of misconduct that the Michigan Rules of Evidence are intended to protect against.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The \u201crules are intended to secure fairness in administration ... to the end that the truth may be ascertained and proceedings justly determined.\u201d MRE 102. The rules of evidence are meaningless if evidence that is not admissible under the rules becomes admissible because of egregious behavior on the part of the prosecutor in response to an attempt to introduce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>improper evidence. This degrades the authority of the trial judge and encourages prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">If one takes away the majority\u2019s erroneous application of the \u201cinvited response\u201d doctrine, it is clear that defendant\u2019s substantial rights were affected by the introduction of the improper polygraph-examination evidence. The evidence was prejudicial to defendant because it could have affected the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Once a defendant has shown that an unpreserved error was a plain error that affected substantial rights, the appellate court may, in its discretion, reverse defendant\u2019s conviction. \u201cReversal is warranted only when the plain, unpreserved error result[s] in the conviction of an actually innocent defendant or when an error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings independent of the defendant\u2019s innocence.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 355, citing <em>Carines, supra </em>at 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The prosecutor\u2019s deliberate introduction of polygraph-examination evidence, in derogation of the trial court\u2019s ruling, clearly affects the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of judicial proceedings. Polygraph-examination evidence is excluded from trial because it does not meet the standard for admissibility of scientific evidence and because of the potential effect on jurors. See <em>Barbara, supra </em>at 364; see also <em>Davis, supra </em>at 372. The prosecutor\u2019s flagrant disregard for the trial judge\u2019s ruling that the evidence was not admissible clearly affects the integrity and public reputation of judicial proceedings. As the majority correctly notes, \u201c[a] prosecutor has the responsibility of a minister of justice, not simply that of an advocate.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>To allow prosecutors (or defense attorneys) to introduce polygraph-examination evidence in response to an improper attempt to reduce or bolster a witness\u2019s credibility undermines the integrity and public reputation of judicial proceedings. In this case, the trial judge sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objection when defense counsel questioned a witness about a polygraph examination. The judge also stated that the error could be cured with an instruction. In spite of the judge\u2019s ruling, the prosecutor took matters into his own hands and asked the witness about the polygraph examination. This makes a mockery of the longstanding prohibition on introduction of polygraph-examination evidence, the prosecutor\u2019s responsibility to act as a minister of justice, and the trial judge\u2019s ability to enforce rulings on the admissibility of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Although the majority does not expressly permit violation of the bright-line rule against introduction of polygraph-examination evidence, the evidence can be admitted through the back door if the prosecutor chooses to disregard the trial court\u2019s ruling. In extending the \u201cinvited response\u201d doctrine to the admission of polygraph-examination evidence despite a sustained objection, the majority dims the brightness of this rule and opens the door to abuse by both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">The introduction of the polygraph-examination evidence constitutes plain error that affected defendant\u2019s substantial rights. Because the prosecutorial misconduct also seriously affected the integrity and public reputation of the proceedings, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b466-8\">Kelly, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-12\"> Mr. Henderson died in January 1999, after five months in a coma</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b448-13\"> At trial, a scientist from the Michigan State Police DNA lab testified that there were bloodstains matching the victim\u2019s blood found on Kim Martin\u2019s shoes, as well as on pants belonging to defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b449-22\"> Ricky Jones is not a relative of the defendant.

The parties are to address specifically whether any error that occurred was \u2018invited\u2019 by the defense. See <em>United States v Young, </em>470 US 1 (1985); <em>Vannoy v City of Warren, </em>386 Mich 686 (1972); <em>People v Finley, </em>431 Mich 506, 543 n 11 (1988) (Cavanagh, J.). The parties are to further discuss whether and, if so, how, the \u2018invited error\u2019 doctrine fits into this Court\u2019s jurisprudence regarding forfeiture and waiver of error. See <em>People v Carines, </em>460 Mich 750 (1999); <em>People v Carter, </em>462 Mich 206 (2000).\u201d 465 Mich 974 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b452-13\"> \u201cInvited error\u201d is typically said to occur when a party\u2019s own affirmative conduct directly causes the error. For example, in <em>Vannoy v City of Warren, </em>386 Mich 686, 690; 194 NW2d 304 (1972), this Court explained that a party cannot seek appellate review of an instruction that he himself requested, saying, \u201cAssuming error as claimed, that error comes within the purview of what of tradition and common sense is known as \u2018invited error.\u2019 \u201d Appellate review is precluded because when a party invites the error, he waives his right to seek appellate review, and any error is extinguished. <em>People v Carter, </em>462 Mich 206, 214-215; 612 NW2d 144 (2000). To the contrary, in this case the alleged error was not directly attributable to the affirmative conduct of defendant and defendant cannot be said to have waived the alleged error \u2014 the prosecutor\u2019s overreaching \u2014 for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-14\">A doctrine that is related to the \u201cinvited response\u201d doctrine, but not applicable in this case, is the doctrine of <em>\u2018fair </em>response.\u201d Under the doctrine of fair response, there is no error because a party is entitled to fairly respond to issues raised by the other party. We adopted the doctrine of \u201cfair response\u201d in <em>People v Fields, </em>450 Mich 94; 538 NW2d 356 (1995). Regarding what is fair response, this Court in <em>Fields </em>stated, \u201c[t]he nature and type of comment allowed is dictated by the defense asserted, and the defendant\u2019s decision regarding whether to testily. When a defense makes an issue legally relevant, the prosecutor is not prohibited from comment<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>ing on the improbability of the defendant\u2019s theory or evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 116. See also <em>United States v Robinson, </em>485 US 25, 31; 108 S Ct 864; 99 L Ed 2d 23 (1988) (holding that when the prosecutor\u2019s statement that the defendant could have explained his story to the jury was made in response to the comments made by defense counsel, the prosecutor\u2019s statements did not infringe the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights). In contrast, although the prosecutor\u2019s conduct in this case was \u201cinvited\u201d in the sense that defense counsel \u201copened the door\u201d to the admission of the polygraph examination evidence, it cannot be characterized as \u201cfair.\u201d The response is not \u201cfair\u201d because evidence of a polygraph test is clearly inadmissible, the prosecutor demonstrably knew that the evidence was not admissible, and the prosecutor did not avail himself of the curative instruction offered by the court to remedy defendant\u2019s improper questioning, choosing instead to resort to a self-help remedy entailing inadmissible evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b457-7\"> We do not \u201cdim[] the brightness\u201d of the rule prohibiting the admission of polygraph-examination evidence, despite the dissent\u2019s assertion to the contrary, <em>post </em>at 366. The bright-line rule in <em>People v Barbara, supra, </em>that testimony concerning the result of a polygraph examination is not admissible at trial remains intact. We reverse the holding of the Court of Appeals that defendant was denied a fair trial because we conclude that this unpreserved, nonconstitutional error did not affect defendant\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b460-9\"> Whether the error is constitutional or nonconstitutional has no effect on the test to be employed in determining whether an unpreserved error ultimately warrants reversal. However, I think it is important to note that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>improper introduction of polygraph-examination evidence is arguably a violation of a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial, as guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. <em>People v Barbara, </em>400 Mich 352; 255 NW2d 171 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b463-5\"> See <em>Darden, supra </em>(improper comments by prosecutor were made in closing remarks, in response to comments made by defense in opening summation); <em>Young, supra </em>at 13 (\u201cthe prosecutor at the close of defense summation should have objected to the defense counsel\u2019s improper statements with a request that the court give a timely warning and curative instruction to the jury.\u201d); <em>Lawn v United States, </em>355 US 339, 359; 78 S Ct 311; 2 L Ed 2d 321 (1958) (defense counsel made improper statements in closing argument, the prosecutor did not object, but rather responded in his summation).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b463-6\"> I thank the majority for pointing out that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was improper. <em>Ante </em>at 357.
