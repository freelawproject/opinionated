An order requiring a prisoner to receive his pension benefits at his current address is not an assignment or alienation of those benefits. Moreover, once the funds are in the inmate\u2019s account, the warden may distribute them under the scfra. The federal ban on alienation or assignment of pension funds does not extend to benefits that the pensioner has already received. We thus reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL POSTURE</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The State Treasurer filed a complaint under the scfra seeking to recover the costs of confining defendant Thomas K. Abbott,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a prisoner under the jurisdiction of the Michigan Department of Corrections. Plaintiff submitted documentation of the costs it has incurred and expects to incur in caring for defendant during his incarceration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiff argued that defendant\u2019s monthly pension payments should be sent to his prison address, deposited in his prison account, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>and appropriated by the warden. The trial court ordered defendant to show cause why the funds should not be appropriated. Defendant filed a responsive pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">After reviewing the pleadings, the trial court ordered defendant to direct his monthly pension proceeds to his prison address. The court further ordered the warden to provide $20 of each payment to defendant, with the remainder divided between defendant\u2019s wife (sixty-seven percent) and the state (thirty-three percent). In addition, the court ordered the pension plan to send the benefit payments to defendant\u2019s \u201cnew address of record\u201d in prison in the event that defendant failed to direct the plan to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Defendant subsequently filed a pleading entitled a \u201cwrit of mandamus.\u201d The trial court treated the \u201cwrit of mandamus\u201d as a motion for reconsideration and denied it. Defendant filed a delayed application for leave to appeal, which the Court of Appeals denied for lack of merit in the grounds presented.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant then applied for leave to appeal to this Court. In lieu of granting leave to appeal, we remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for consideration as on leave granted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In a published opinion, the Court of Appeals held that ERISA barred the deposit of funds into defendant\u2019s prison account.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Plaintiff filed an application for leave to appeal to this Court, which we granted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>II. THE COURT OF APPEALS OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">In concluding that the trial court\u2019s order violates erisa\u2019s antialienation provision, the Court of Appeals relied on <em>State Treasurer v Baugh, </em>986 F Supp 1074 (ED Mich, 1997). In <em>Baugh, </em>the State Treasurer sought an order under the SCFRA directing a pension plan to deposit benefits into an inmate-beneficiary\u2019s prison account. The federal district court held that erisa preempted such an order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">The Court agrees that once pension benefits are placed in a personal account, erisa no longer operates to protect those funds. However, in the instant case, defendant Chrysler Corp. would not be voluntarily depositing the pension funds into [the inmate\u2019s] personal prisoner account but would be doing so only by court order. Such an involuntary transfer clearly constitutes an assignment. <em>[Id. </em>at 1077 (citation deleted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The Court of Appeals followed <em>Baugh:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">There is no dispute that directly garnishing defendant\u2019s pension benefits to reimburse the state would violate the erisa\u2019s antialienation provision. <em>Baugh, supra. </em>Plaintiff attempts to distinguish <em>Baugh </em>by asserting that plaintiff did not make a claim against the pension plan in this case and did not seek an order compelling the plan to do anything. Plaintiff argues that ordering defendant to direct his pension to be sent to his prison address is consistent with <em>Baugh </em>and does not violate the erisa. This argument fails for two reasons. First, defendant did not voluntarily change his pension address to his prison address and did not voluntarily have the pension funds deposited into his personal prisoner account, but rather was ordered by the court to do so. The court\u2019s order effectively required the pension fund to make the pension payment to defendant\u2019s prison account against defendant\u2019s will. Such an involuntary transfer clearly constitutes an assignment and conflicts with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>erisa\u2019s antialienation provision. Second, if defendant refuses to direct the pension fund to pay the benefits to his prison account, the only method of ensuring that the benefits reach the prison account is by reliance on the order directing the fund to send the money to the prison, just as in <em>Baugh. </em>[249 Mich App 107, 113; 640 NW2d 888 (2001).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Whether the trial court\u2019s order effectuates an alienation or assignment of pension funds under 29 USC 1056(d)(1) is a question of law. We review questions of law de novo. <em>Cardinal Mooney High School v Michigan High School Athletic Ass\u2019n, </em>437 Mich 75, 80; 467 NW2d 21 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">IV. PRINCIPLES OF INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">This case requires us to interpret a federal statutory provision. Where a federal statute clearly addresses the issue at hand, we apply the statute as written. If, however, the text is silent or ambiguous regarding the issue before the Court, we must defer to a federal agency\u2019s interpretation if it is based on a permissible construction of the statute. <em>Chevron USA Inc v Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc, </em>467 US 837; 104 S Ct 2778; 81 L Ed 2d 694 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">V. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">The trial court\u2019s order requires that (1) defendant receive his monthly pension payments at his prison address and (2) the warden distribute the funds after their deposit in defendant\u2019s prison account. We conclude that this arrangement does not alienate or assign the pension proceeds in violation of ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>We note initially that the SCFRA permits the trial court to provide reimbursement to the state from \u201cassets\u201d owned by a prisoner for expenses incurred in caring for the prisoner. MCL 800.404(3). The statute defines \u201cassets\u201d to include \u201cincome or payments to such prisoner from . . . pension benefits . . . .\u201d MCL 800.401a.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">It is not disputed that the trial court\u2019s order was proper under the scfra. The question presented is whether erisa\u2019s prohibition on assignment and alienation of pension benefits supersedes the scfra in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">A. RECEIPT OF THE FUNDS AT DEFENDANT\u2019S PRISON ADDRESS</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Erisa\u2019s antialienation provision states: \u201cEach plan shall provide that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.\u201d 29 USC 1056(d)(1).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To determine whether the order requiring defendant to receive pension benefits at his prison address alienates or assigns those benefits, we must discern the meanings of the statutory terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Erisa does not define the terms \u201calienate\u201d and \u201cassign.\u201d Because the federal statute is silent on the question presented, we defer to a federal agency\u2019s definition. <em>Chevron, supra. </em>The Treasury Department has defined the term \u201cassignment\u201d as \u201c[a]ny direct or indirect arrangement (whether revocable or irrevocable) whereby a party acquires from a participant or beneficiary a right or interest enforceable against the plan in, or to, all or any part of a plan benefit payment which is, or may become, payable to the partici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>pant or beneficiary.\u201d 26 CFR 1.401(a)-13(c)(l). This definition plainly contemplates a transfer of the interest to <em>another person, i.e., a person other than the beneficiary himself </em>Sending a pension payment to a beneficiary <em>at his own address, </em>and <em>depositing it in his own account, </em>does not assign that payment. Neither the warden nor any other third person acquires a right or interest enforceable against the plan when the pension proceeds are sent to defendant at his current address.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>A property interest is assigned or alienated when it has been transferred <em>to another person. </em>The trial court here did not order defendant to have his pension proceeds sent to <em>another person\u2019s </em>address. On the contrary, the court ordered defendant to receive the benefits <em>at his own address. </em>Moreover, the deposit of the funds into defendant\u2019s prison account did not transfer any legal title to, or interest in, the funds to another person. The warden\u2019s access to defendant\u2019s account does not alter the fact that the account is in defendant\u2019s name. Legal title was not conveyed to the warden or to any other person when the funds were deposited in defendant\u2019s account.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">We respectfully decline to follow the federal district court\u2019s opinion in <em>Baugh. </em>The <em>Baugh </em>court held that \u201can order by this Court forcing [a pension plan] to deposit pension funds into an [inmate\u2019s prison] account from which [the state] may withdraw monies clearly operates as an assignment.\u201d <em>Baugh, supra </em>at 1077. The <em>Baugh </em>court characterized the transfer of the funds to the inmate\u2019s prison account as an assignment because it was \u201cinvoluntary.\u201d The involuntary nature of a deposit does not establish an assignment unless a person other than the beneficiary acquires a right or interest enforceable against the plan. An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>assignment does not occur where the pension proceeds are sent to the pensioner\u2019s current address and deposited into his own account.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The dissent argues that an assignment or alienation occurred because the pension fund itself was directed to send the benefit payments to defendant\u2019s prison address in the event that defendant did not ask the fund to do so. The dissent\u2019s argument ignores the Treasury Department\u2019s definition of the term \u201cassignment.\u201d The federal statute would be violated if the court had ordered the fund to send the payments <em>to another person, i.e., to a person other than defendant, </em>and thereby granted a right or interest enforceable against the plan to that third person. Thus, if the court had ordered the pension fund to distribute the payments directly to the state of Michigan, an assignment or alienation would result. Here, however, the court ordered the funds to be sent <em>to defendant himself at his current address and deposited in his own account. </em>Because defendant thus receives the funds, no assignment or alienation occurs.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>B. APPROPRIATION OF THE FUNDS AFTER DEPOSIT IN DEFENDANT\u2019S ACCOUNT</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">We next consider whether the distribution of pension funds <em>after they are deposited in defendant\u2019s account </em>contravenes ERISA. The prevailing view is that erisa does not protect pension funds after the beneficiary receives them. We adopt this view and hold that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>erisa does not preclude distribution pursuant to the SCFRA after the funds are deposited in an inmate\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The leading case on this subject is <em>Guidry v Sheet Metal Workers, </em>10 F3d 700 (CA 10, 1993) <em>(Guidry II), </em>mod on reh 39 F3d 1078 (CA 10, 1994) <em>(Guidry III).</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In these <em>Guidry </em>cases, a former union official pleaded guilty of embezzling funds from his union. The union asserted an interest in the embezzler\u2019s pension benefits. The federal district court granted the union a constructive trust against the pension plan, thus preventing the beneficiary from receiving the funds. On its review, the United States Supreme Court held that this remedy violated erisa\u2019s prohibition of alienation and assignment. <em>Guidry v Sheet Metal Workers, </em>493 US 365; 110 S Ct 680; 107 L Ed 2d 782 (1990) <em>(Guidry I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">On remand, the district court granted a different remedy: garnishment of the pension benefits <em>after their deposit in the beneficiary\u2019s account. </em>The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the garnishment order and held that it did not violate ERISA. <em>Guidry II, supra </em>at 716. The court determined that the text of subsection 206(d)(1), now subsection 1056(d)(1), (\u201c[e]ach pension plan shall provide that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated\u201d) was unclear. The statute was ambiguous regarding whether the term \u201cbenefits\u201d refers to \u201cthe right to future payment or the actual money paid under the plan and received by the beneficiary.\u201d <em>Guidry II, supra </em>at 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>In light of this ambiguity, the <em>Guidry II </em>court deferred to the Department of Treasury\u2019s reasonable interpretation of the statute. The department\u2019s ERISA regulations define \u201cassignment\u201d and \u201calienation\u201d as \u201c \u2018any direct or indirect arrangement (whether revocable or irrevocable) whereby a party acquires from a participant or beneficiary a right or interest <em>enforceable against the plan </em>in, or to, all or any part of a plan benefit payment which is, or may become, <em>payable </em>to the participant or beneficiary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Guidry II, supra </em>at 708, quoting 26 CFR 1.401(a)-13(c)(l)(ii) (emphasis added). The regulations .refer to a right or interest enforceable <em>against the plan.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-4\">[The union] seeks only to enforce a judgment against Mr. Guidry by garnishing his bank account containing pension benefits paid and received; [the union] does not seek to enforce an interest or right against the plan. Because garnishment of Mr. Guidry\u2019s received retirement income is not an action against the plan, we conclude it is not prohibited by erisa 206(d)(1) as implemented by the ERISA Regulations. <em>[Guidry II, supra </em>at 710.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The <em>Guidry II </em>court opined that the Treasury Departm\u00e9nt\u2019s interpretation was reasonable. The court rioted that other statutes expressly protect benefits <em>after </em>they are received. For example, the Social Security Act, 42 USC 407(a), provides that \u201cnone of the moneys <em>paid or payable </em>or rights existing under this subchapter shall be subject to execution,' levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process, or to the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Also, the Veterans\u2019 Benefits Act, 38 USC 5301(a), expressly precludes attachment or seizure of benefits \u201ceither <em>before or after receipt by the </em>beneficiary.\u201d The <em>Guidry II </em>court concluded;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Because Congress did not include similar explicit language protecting benefits in the related context in erisa, we infer Congress made a deliberate decision [that] retirement income paid and received was not thereafter protected from garnishment. A similar argument was made by then Judge Kennedy writing for the Ninth Circuit in denying application of the anti-garnishment provision of the Consumer Credit Protection Act to wages that had been paid. <em>Usery [v First Nat\u2019l Bank of Arizona, </em>586 F2d 107, 111 (CA 9, 1978)]. Although not conclusive, the absence of explicit language extending to paid benefits supports the erisa Regulations. <em>[Guidry II, supra </em>at 712.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Several courts have followed the <em>Guidry II </em>decision. See, e.g., <em>Trucking Employees of North Jersey Welfare Fund, Inc v Colville, </em>16 F3d 52, 56 (CA 3, 1994) (agreeing with <em>Guidry II </em>that the Treasury Department regulation reasonably \u201cconstrues the statute to forbid alienation of rights to future payments, rather than alienation of the actual money paid out\u201d), and <em>State v Pulasty, </em>136 NJ 356; 642 A2d 1392 (1994) (holding that ERISA did not preempt a state restitution order because received pension benefits are subject to judgment). But see <em>United States v Smith, </em>47 F3d 681 (CA 4, 1995) (declining to follow <em>Guidry II </em>and holding that pension benefits that had been received were not subject to restitution).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Of particular interest is the decision in <em>Wright v Riveland, </em>219 F3d 905 (CA 9, 2000). In <em>Wright, </em>a class of inmates sued the state of Washington\u2019s department of corrections, challenging the deduction of pension funds from the inmates\u2019 accounts to pay for the costs of incarceration under a state statute. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that ERISA\u2019s antialienation provision did not prohibit the deductions. The court found that subsection 206(d)(1) was unclear regarding whether it prohibits the alienation or assignment of funds after they are distributed to the beneficiary. The court then discussed the Treasury Department regulation and <em>Guidry II, Colville, </em>and <em>Smith, </em>and found <em>Guidry II </em>and <em>Colville </em>more persuasive than <em>Smith.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-5\">Accordingly, we follow the lead of the Third and Tenth Circuits. We conclude that [the Treasury regulation\u2019s] interpretation of [subsection] 206(d)(1) is not arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute and hold, based on the regulation\u2019s interpretation of [subsection] 206(d)(1), that this section does not preclude the Department from deducting funds pursuant to the [state of Washington] Statute from benefits received from ERISA-qualified pension plans. [ Wright, <em>supra </em>at 921.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">We also prefer the approach adopted by the overwhelming majority of federal courts. Once pension funds are deposited in an inmate\u2019s account, erisa does not protect them. We agree with the <em>Guidry II </em>court that the text of subsection 206(d)(1) does not address whether benefits that the pensioner has already received are protected. The statute\u2019s silence on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>issue requires deference to the reasonable interpretation set forth in the Treasury Department regulation. <em>Guidry II, supra; Chevron, supra. </em>That regulation clarifies that the statute protects against the alienation or assignment of rights <em>against the plan itself. </em>Other statutory schemes, including the Social Security Act, clearly protect benefits after their receipt. Congress did not include such expansive language in ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision in <em>Wright </em>directly supports our decision. It expressly rejected an erisa challenge to a state statute that permitted deduction of pension funds from an inmate\u2019s account to pay for the costs of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">While courts may not create exceptions to ERISA\u2019s prohibition on assignment and alienation, <em>Guidry II </em>and its progeny do not create exceptions. They hold merely that the statutory prohibition does not apply after the funds have been received. The dissent asserts without any apparent basis that we have created an exception. In truth, we merely follow the prevailing federal authorities and hold that the appropriation of funds that have been received does not alienate or assign those funds. Where no alienation or assignment has occurred, the statutory prohibition does not apply. We have no occasion or need to \u201ccarve out exceptions\u201d to a statutory prohibition that does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Defendant received the pension funds when they were sent to his current address and deposited in his prison account. At that point, erisa did not protect the funds, and the state was free to seize and distribute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>the funds in accordance with the procedures set forth in the SCFRA and the trial court\u2019s order in this case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The SCFRA sets forth procedures to reimburse Michigan taxpayers for the costs of caring for prison inmates under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections. An inmate\u2019s pension benefits in his account are \u201cassets\u201d that are subject to the SCFRA. The federal prohibition on alienation and assignment of pension benefits is not violated where an inmate is directed to receive pension benefits at his own address. Further, prevailing federal authorities estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>lish that erisa does not protect pension proceeds that an inmate has already received. The state may distribute the funds after they are deposited in the inmate\u2019s account to the extent permitted under the scfra.

A receiver\u2019s right, being purely for the purposes of the suit, cannot outlast the suit or be used for any purpose not justified thereby.

Guidry I, </em>however, involved a constructive trust imposed on the pension fund itself. <em>Guid'ry II </em>and its progeny make clear that funds that are appropriated <em>after the beneficiary receives them </em>are no longer protected by erisa\u2019s antialienation clause. In this case, the pension fund itself is not garnished, nor is a constructive trust imposed on the fund. Rather, the fund is merely required to send the pension funds <em>to defendant himself </em>at his current address, where the funds are then deposited directly <em>in defendant\u2019s own account. </em>At that point, defendant has received the funds, and, as the overwhelming majority of federal courts have held, the funds are no longer protected by erisa.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">The United States Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Guidry I </em>supports the distinction drawn by federal courts between garnishments from plans and appropriation of funds that the beneficiary has already received. The <em>Guidry I </em>Court noted that the policy underlying the antialienation clause is \u201cto safeguard a stream of income for pensioners . . . .\u201d <em>Guidry I, supra </em>at 376. Once the benefits <em>are </em>received, the stream of income has safely reached the pensioner. In light of this language, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Guidry II </em>determined that the law of the case did not preclude the garnishment of funds deposited in the beneficiary\u2019s bank account: \u201cAs <em>[Guidry I\\ </em>refers only to a \u2018stream of income\u2019 that must be received, and not to the disposition of the income after it was received, we fail to see how the \u2018law of the case\u2019 bars garnishment of received income. The payments do not lose their character as income because they are used to satisfy debts.\u201d <em>Guidry II, supra </em>at 706.

FEDERAL INTERPRETATION OF ERISA\u2019S ANTIALIENATION PROVISION</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">Erisa subsection 206(d)(1), 29 USC 1056(d)(1), requires that \u201c[e]ach pension plan shall provide that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.\u201d The Secretary of the Treasury has defined \u201cassignment\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-10\">(ii) Any direct or <em>indirect </em>arrangement (whether revocable or irrevocable) whereby a party acquires from a participant or beneficiary a right or interest enforceable against the plan in, or to, all or any part of a plan benefit payment which is, or may become, payable to the participant or beneficiary. [26 CFR 1.401(a)-13(c)(l).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">The United States Supreme Court has held that garnishment of benefits from a covered plan constitutes an assignment for the purpose of subsection 206(d)(1)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Guidry v Sheet Metal Workers Fund, </em>493 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>US 365, 371-372; 110 S Ct 680; 107 L Ed 2d 782 (1990) <em>(Guidry I), </em>citing <em>Mackey v Lanier Collection Agency &amp; Service, Inc, </em>486 US 825, 836-837; 108 S Ct 2182; 100 L Ed 2d 836 (1988); see also <em>United Metal Products Corp v Nat\u2019l Bank of Detroit, </em>811 F2d 297 (CA 6, 1987). Thus, in order to avoid the prohibition on assignments in subsection 206(d)(1), any court ordered remedy that relates to an erisa plan must be meaningfully distinct from a court ordered garnishment. <em>Guidry I, </em>493 US 372. In <em>Baugh, </em>a federal district court in Michigan found no meaningful distinction between the restitutive scheme used by the plaintiff in this case and the garnishment plans invalidated in <em>Guidry I </em>and <em>United Metal Products. </em>986 F Supp 1076-1078.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">2. THE MAJORITY\u2019S INTERPRETATION OF ERISA\u2019S ANTIALIENATION PROVISION</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The majority recognizes that this Court must defer to a federal agency\u2019s interpretation of a federal statute. <em>Ante </em>at 148. Nonetheless, it fails to properly apply the definition of \u201cassignment\u201d expounded by the United States Treasury Department. Instead, it concludes that there is no meaningful distinction between the definition of \u201cassignment\u201d in the treasury regulation and other accepted legal meanings of the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">After reviewing some legal definitions,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the majority concludes that the treasury regulation \u201cplainly contemplates a transfer of the interest to <em>another person, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number><em>i.e., a person other than the beneficiary himself\u201d Ante </em>at 150 (emphasis in original). Thus, it reasons, \u201c[a] property interest is assigned or alienated when it has been transferred <em>to another person.\u201d Ante </em>at 151. Applying this understanding, the majority concludes that plaintiffs restitutive scheme does not effect an assignment because the warden never obtains title to or an interest in defendant\u2019s pension benefits. <em>Ante </em>at 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The majority asserts that there are two bases for its conclusion that the trial court orders do not constitute an assignment or alienation: (1) the court ordered defendant to receive benefits at the prison, which is his current address, and (2) title to the benefits does not pass under the orders until after defendant receives them in his prison account. However, as I will show, these conclusions rest on a misunderstanding of the treasury regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">B. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">1. GARNISHMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">The majority claims that <em>Guidry II</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Wright v Riveland</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>support its conclusions that plaintiff\u2019s restitutive scheme does not violate ERISA\u2019s antialienation provision. In <em>Guidry II, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held that subsection 206(d)(1) does not apply to benefits once a beneficiary receives them. <em>Guidry II, </em>10 F3d 710. Accordingly, it found that the defendant\u2019s creditors could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>garnish the defendant\u2019s pension benefits that he had voluntarily deposited into his personal bank account. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\"><em>Wright </em>concerned a prison inmate in the state of Washington. A Washington statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">When an inmate . . . <em>receives </em>any funds in addition to his or her wages or gratuities, the additional funds shall be subject to the deductions in ROW 72.09.111(l)(a). . . . [Wash Rev Code 72.09.480(2).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The Washington Department of Corrections took thirty-five percent of the defendant\u2019s pension payments pursuant to Wash Rev Code 72.09.111. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found no violation of ERISA because the department had obtained control over the prisoner\u2019s benefits only after the prisoner had received them. <em>Wright, </em>219 F3d 921.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">These cases are inapplicable here. The restitutive programs at issue in <em>Wright </em>and <em>Guidry II </em>lack two fundamental components of plaintiff\u2019s scheme. First, no one was made a receiver of the defendants\u2019 benefits before they were deposited into the defendants\u2019 accounts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Second, the courts did not order the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>dants\u2019 benefit plans to deliver the defendants\u2019 funds into specified accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The majority reads the trial court orders in this case as requiring that: \u201c(1) defendant receive his monthly pension payments at his prison address and (2) the warden distribute the funds after their deposit in defendant\u2019s prison account.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 148. However, the majority fails to acknowledge that one of the orders does much more. It requires General Motors to disburse defendant\u2019s pension benefits to his prison address in the event defendant refuses to request it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In fact, without awaiting defendant\u2019s compliance, on the same day the primary order was entered, the trial court entered a second order directing:</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>1. General Motors shall send all pension proceeds payable to Thomas K. Abbott ... to Thomas K. Abbott\u2019s new address of record ....</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">These orders implicate a factor overlooked by the majority: subsection 206(d)(1) prohibits any indirect, as well as direct, assignment of benefits. The orders\u2019 provisions making the warden receiver for defendant of his pension benefits and directing General Motors to send defendant\u2019s pension checks to the warden make them an indirect assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, the fact that the warden is made receiver of defendant\u2019s benefits is dispositive. According to the majority\u2019s own analysis, \u201c . . property in the possession of a receiver is in the</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">custody of the law, and the receiver\u2019s possession is the possession of the court for the benefit of those ultimately entitled.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 153 n 10, quoting 19 Michigan Law and Practice, Receivers, \u00a7 41, p 382. The majority claims that this definition of a receivership takes this case out of the reach of erisa\u2019s prohibition on assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">At a minimum, plaintiff\u2019s restitutive scheme must be meaningfully distinct from an order of garnishment. <em>Guidry I, supra. </em>A constructive trust is not meaningfully distinct from an order of garnishment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">We have held that \u201c \u2018 \u201c[t]rusts,\u201d in the broadest sense of the definition, embrace, not only technical trusts, but also obligations arising from numerous fiduciary relationships, such as agents, partners, bailees, et cetera.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fox v Greene, </em>289 Mich 179, 183; 286 NW 203 (1939), quoting <em>Rothschild v Dickinson, </em>169 Mich 200; 134 NW 1035 (1912). Thus, a trustee is \u201c \u2018a person in whom some estate, interest, <em>or power </em>in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>or affecting property of any description is vested for the benefit of another.\u2019 \u201d <em>Equitable Trust Co v Milton Realty Co, </em>263 Mich 673, 676; 249 NW 30 (1933), quoting <em>Jones v Byrne, </em>149 F 457, 463 (CC WD Ark, 1906) (emphasis supplied). We have also held that possession and control are fundamental incidents of ownership. <em>Orel v Uni-Rak Sales Co, Inc, </em>454 Mich 564, 568; 563 NW2d 241 (1997); <em>Merritt v Nickelson, </em>407 Mich 544, 552; 287 NW2d 178 (1980); <em>Rassner v Fed Collateral Society, Inc, </em>299 Mich 206, 213; 300 NW 45 (1941); <em>James S Holden Co v Connor, </em>257 Mich 580, 592-594; 241 NW 915 (1932) (and cases cited therein); <em>Brown v Fifield, 4 </em>Mich 322, 327, 328 (1856).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Under the trial court\u2019s orders, defendant is never allowed to exercise control over his pension benefits.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The majority finds this fact irrelevant, but it is the determining factor that renders the trial court orders a violation of subsection 206(d)(1). Transferring possession and control of defendant\u2019s pension benefits to the warden before the benefits are deposited in defendant\u2019s prison account strips defendant of the ability to exercise the interests he has in his benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s restitutive scheme is no less onerous than the constructive trust arrangement or garnishment struck down in <em>Guidry I </em>and <em>United Metal Products.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The practical effect of the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>orders is that the warden is able to control defendant\u2019s benefits before defendant receives them. The circuit court, on behalf of the Department of Corrections, obtained control of the benefits while they were still in the possession of defendant\u2019s employer, a third party. This is a garnishment and is prohibited by erisa\u2019s antialienation provision.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">2. ASSIGNMENT OF A RIGHT ENFORCEABLE AGAINST THE PLAN</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Although I find that plaintiff\u2019s restitutive scheme is not meaningfully distinct from an order of garnishment, the finding is not necessary to my ultimate conclusion that the scheme violates erisa. Erisa\u2019s prohibition on alienation is not limited to payments. Erisa also prohibits alienation of any right, separate from the right to payment, that is enforceable against the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Under the Uniform Commercial Code, defendant never becomes a holder of the instruments used to deliver his benefits. MCL 440.1201(20). Rather, the warden acquires a right enforceable against the plan when he takes control of defendant\u2019s pension check. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>This is because the court orders give the warden the authority to enforce the withdrawal of funds from the plan. MCL 440.3301(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">This transfer of authority constitutes an \u201cassignment\u201d under the United States Department of Treasury\u2019s definition of the term. It is irrelevant that, afterward, the warden deposits the funds into defendant\u2019s prison account. Before the funds reach the account, rights that defendant is entitled to enforce against the plan are assigned to the warden in contravention of erisa. See, generally, <em>Shinehouse v Guerin, </em>20 E B C 1302 (ED Pa, 1996), aff'd 107 F3d 8 (CA 3, 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s restitutive scheme accomplishes by indirection what it cannot do by direction. It is an indirect assignment of pension benefits that is prohibited by erisa. In <em>Guidry I, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that a restitutive scheme could not overcome Congress\u2019s express intent to protect employee retirement benefits. This was true even where the employee\u2019s embezzlement had caused harm to the plan\u2019s beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">In <em>United Metal Products, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that there was no exception to ERISA\u2019s antialienation provision for fraud or criminal conduct. In <em>Baugh, </em>the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, relying on <em>Guidry I </em>and <em>United Metal Products, </em>concluded that plaintiff\u2019s restitutive scheme constituted an assignment under subsection 206(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">In each case, the court flatly refuted the contention that courts may carve out exceptions to erisa\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>antialienation provision when it would serve public policy. Yet the majority carves out an exception by this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">The trial court\u2019s orders transfer a portion of defendant\u2019s pension benefits from the pension plan to the state. The orders accomplish this by acting on defendant\u2019s benefits before he receives them. That the orders run the pension benefits through defendant\u2019s prison account is of no legal significance. Defendant at no time has possession or receipt of the benefits. They might as well be run through the warden\u2019s account. As receiver for the benefits, the warden controls them until he distributes them according to the orders. The provision requiring the funds to be placed in defendant\u2019s prison account is a thinly veiled device to defeat the provisions of ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Neither plaintiff nor the majority has provided a meaningful distinction between the plaintiff\u2019s restitutive scheme and an order of garnishment. Moreover, the scheme goes too far because, rather than constraining itself to acting on defendant\u2019s benefits themselves, it usurps a right only defendant is entitled to enforce against the plan. Consequently, the scheme is prohibited by ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b271-7\">Cavanagh and Markman, JJ., concurred with Kelly, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-8\"> 29 USC 1001 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b262-12\"> A garnishment is a legal device that allows a person to obtain control over the property of another while it is in the hands of a third party.

I disagree with this characterization of the warden\u2019s role in this scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary (2000) states that \u201cmanage\u201d means: \u201cto take charge of; supervise.\u201d To \u201ccontrol\u201d is \u201cto exercise restraint or direction over.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The trial court orders charge the warden with the responsibility of supervising and directing the deposit of defendant\u2019s pension benefits. Thus, it is evident that the warden retains these characteristics of a receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">Moreover, the warden also fulfills the ultimate function of a receiver. In his capacity as receiver, he collects defendant\u2019s pension benefits to ensure that they remain available to satisfy the diverse claims on them created by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>this litigation. If tins assurance were not the purpose of the scheme, I see no reason why plaintiff would not simply attach the funds after they were deposited into defendant\u2019s credit union account. Although we are not bound by the trial court\u2019s characterization of the warden\u2019s function, we should not abandon the dictates of common sense in evaluating that function.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b266-7\"> A March 10, 1997 order states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">3.

As I have noted, and the majority recognizes, constructive trusts are prohibited by erisa\u2019s antialienation provision. <em>Guidry I, supra. </em>However, title does not pass in a constructive trust.
