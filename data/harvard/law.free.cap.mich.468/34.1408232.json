MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>418.305 provides, \u201cIf the employee is injured by reason of his intentional and wilful misconduct, he shall not receive compensation under the provisions of this act.\u201d We hold that MCL 418.305 precludes benefits in this case and, therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission\u2019s (wcac\u2019s) order denying plaintiff benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Plaintiff worked as a probation officer with defendant Department of Corrections beginning in 1984. His employment required him to attend probation violation hearings held in circuit court several times a month to interact with defense attorneys representing probationers.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">In February 1995, a female defense attorney filed a complaint with plaintiff\u2019s immediate supervisor alleging that plaintiff sexually harassed her in August 1994 and February 1995. The attorney testified that it was plaintiff\u2019s failure to take her rejection of his advances seriously that prompted her to file her complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The attorney\u2019s complaint was soon followed by allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>tions of sexual harassment by plaintiff from three other female defense attorneys.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s supervisor initiated an investigation into the complaints. Over the following months, she interviewed the attorneys and other witnesses. When questioned, plaintiff denied all the allegations. At the close of her investigation, plaintiff\u2019s supervisor recommended that a disciplinary conference be held regarding five separate counts of sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">A disciplinary conference was held on June 20, 1995. Plaintiff continued to deny the allegations. On the advice of his union representative, however, plaintiff offered nothing in his own defense. The plaintiff was informed that the possible discipline ranged from a written reprimand to dismissal. At the conclusion of the conference, the presiding official found \u201ca strong basis\u201d on which to conclude that plaintiff violated Michigan Department of Corrections work rules as described in all five counts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ultimately, plaintiff was disciplined for the two counts of sexual harassment arising from the August 1994 and February 1995 incidents. He was suspended for ten days without pay.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>After his return to work in August 1995, plaintiff testified that he felt harassed by both his immediate supervisor and the defense attorneys who had accused him of sexual harassment. He felt \u201cout of control,\u201d and, on January 27, 1996, began being treated by psychologist Daniel DeWitt. Dr. DeWitt diagnosed plaintiff as suffering from depression caused by the disciplinary investigation and proceedings as well as the subsequent stresses at work. As a result, plaintiff began a leave of absence in February 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">In March 1996, Dr. DeWitt felt that plaintiff could work again, but at a different job for a different supervisor. Plaintiff submitted a request for reasonable accommodation in the form of a transfer to another part of the Department of Corrections. His request was rejected by the department\u2019s Americans with Disabilities Act Coordinator because plaintiff\u2019s disability was deemed temporary and not substantially limiting in nature. In June 1996, plaintiff filed a claim for worker\u2019s compensation benefits premised on a mental disability arising from the disciplinary proceedings. During the time leading to the trial, plaintiff saw three other doctors at the state\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">After four days of trial between March and September of 1998, the magistrate concluded that the \u201cdiscipline, and post-discipline employment events up to February 2, 1996, contributed in a significant manner to [plaintiff\u2019s] development of a disabling condition of depression, anxiety, and uncontrolled anger.\u201d The magistrate did not address MCL 418.305 or make specific findings regarding whether plaintiff\u2019s conduct was intentional and wilful or otherwise not compensable under that section. Rather, the magistrate\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>elusion that plaintiff was entitled to benefits was based on the finding that plaintiffs injury arose out of his employment pursuant to <em>Gardner v Van Buren Pub Schools, </em>445 Mich 23; 517 NW2d 1 (1994), overruled in part by <em>Robertson v DaimlerChrysler Corp, </em>465 Mich 732; 641 NW2d 567 (2002). However, the magistrate commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-4\">It is clear to me that Plaintiff\u2019s problems started with his discipline for the improprieties of which he was accused. It is difficult to have much sympathy for this claimant, since he brought these troubles on himself by his own misconduct. But compensation, like the rain, falls on the just and the unjust alike.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The magistrate awarded plaintiff a closed award of worker\u2019s compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Defendant appealed, raising MCL 418.305 as an affirmative defense. The wcac agreed with the essence of the magistrate\u2019s finding that the plaintiff\u2019s injury was self-inflicted, but concluded that MCL 418.305, \u201cputs up an umbrella to prevent compensation from falling on this particular \u2018unjust\u2019 claimant.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The wcac found that plaintiff was on notice of the rules that prohibited the conduct for which he was ultimately accused and disciplined, but had done \u201cit anyway, in a consistent and repeated pattern over a long period of time.\u201d The wcac concluded that plaintiff\u2019s injury arose from his own intentional and wilful misconduct and, therefore, that MCL 418.305 precluded an award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Plaintiff appealed and, as will be discussed below, the Court of Appeals reversed the wcac decision in a two-to-one decision. The Court of Appeals majority concluded that plaintiffs acts did not rise to the level of intentional and wilful misconduct contemplated by MCL 418.305. 248 Mich App 95 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">In dissent, Judge O\u2019Connell noted that \u201cwhether an individual engaged in wilful and intentional misconduct is a factual determination\u201d and \u201cthat the Legislature, through MCL 418.861a(14), has provided the wcac with the authority to make factual findings.\u201d 248 Mich App 109-110. Moreover, Judge O\u2019Connell noted, the wcac\u2019s finding in this case that plaintiff engaged in wilful and intentional misconduct was conclusive and binding in the absence of fraud. <em>Id. </em>at 110, citing <em>Mudel, supra </em>at 701, 711, 712. Judge O\u2019Connell opined \u201cthat the wcac\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff engaged in wilful and intentional misconduct was well-grounded,\u201d 248 Mich App 110, in the record and that, therefore, the Court of Appeals was required to affirm its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">We granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal. 466 Mich 889 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">We review de novo questions of law. <em>DiBenedetto v West Shore Hosp, </em>461 Mich 394, 401; 605 NW2d 300 (2000). Whether plaintiff\u2019s injury arose by reason of intentional and wilful misconduct as contemplated by MCL 418.305 is a question of fact. <em>McMinn v C Kern Brewing Co, </em>202 Mich 414, 429; 168 NW 542 (1918); <em>Day v Gold Star Dairy, </em>307 Mich 383, 390; 12 NW2d 5 (1943). On judicial review, \u201c[t]he findings of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>made by the commission acting within its powers, in the absence of fraud, shall be conclusive. ...\u201d MCL 418.861a(14).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The focus of our inquiry is solely on the proper application of MCL 418.305.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As quoted above, MCL 418.305 provides, \u201cIf the employee is injured by reason of his intentional and wilful misconduct, he shall not receive compensation under the provisions of this act.\u201d This provision has remained essentially unchanged since it was first adopted by the Legislature in 1912 as part of the original worker\u2019s compensation legislation. See 1912 (1st Ex Sess) PA 10, part 2, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">The Court of Appeals majority below divided its analysis of MCL 418.305 into two parts. It focused first on whether plaintiff\u2019s mental injury arose \u201cby reason of\u201d his misconduct, and, second, on whether plaintiff\u2019s misconduct was \u201cintentional and wilful.\u201d We address and reject the panel majority\u2019s analysis of each of these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>a</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">\u201cBY REASON OF\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The panel majority first focused on what it termed the question of causation, i.e., whether plaintiff was injured \u201cby reason of\u201d his intentional and wilful misconduct. The majority rejected the wcac\u2019s finding that plaintiffs injury was \u201cthe direct result of his intentional and wilful misconduct,\u201d by concluding that the question of \u201cwho started it?\u201d was \u201cinapposite to the intention of the wdca.\u201d 248 Mich App 103. The majority concluded that plaintiffs injury was \u201ctoo attenuated for [it] to have occurred \u2018by reason of his acts,\u201d <em>id., </em>p 102, and that plaintiff \u201cwas not injured at the time of his act,\u201d but was \u201cinjured solely because of his status as an employee . . . <em>.\u2019\u2019Id., </em>p 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">To support its conclusion, the majority analogized to two cases in which fighting or horseplay between employees escalated and resulted in physical injuries. See, e.g., <em>Crilly v Ballou, </em>353 Mich 303; 91 NW2d 493 (1958), and <em>Andrews v Gen Motors Corp, </em>98 Mich App 556; 296 NW2d 309 (1980).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Our review of those cases reveals that they do not support the panel majority\u2019s causation analysis. Indeed, neither case, nor any other we have found, addressed whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>injuries were \u201cby reason of\u201d misconduct pursuant to MCL 418.305. Rather, the causation inquiry in those cases, and our case law, pertains to the question whether such misconduct can be said to have <em>arisen out of the course of the employment </em>as required by MCL 418.301. See <em>Crilly, supra, </em>pp 324-327, and <em>Andrews, supra, </em>pp 558-559.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">Significantly, defendant no longer disputes, and the magistrate, the wcac, and the Court of Appeals agreed, that plaintiffs mental disability arose out of and in the course of his employment pursuant to MCL 418.301(1). Thus, the majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Crilly </em>and <em>Andrews </em>was misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Moreover, we decline to impose a more direct causation requirement than that plainly expressed by the statute. \u201cBy reason of\u201d is defined as \u201c[b]y means, acts, or instrumentality of.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed). As noted by the Court of Appeals dissenter, the phrase does not require that an injury arise contemporaneously with the misconduct. Rather, as stated by Judge O\u2019Connell:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">[I]t cannot be disputed that [plaintiffs] misconduct was the starting point for the resultant disciplinary proceedings that ultimately caused his injury. Had plaintiff not engaged in sexual harassment, he would not have been subjected to the disciplinary proceedings, and he would not have been suspended from his job. . . . [T]he disciplinary proceedings, from which plaintiffs mental disability arose, flowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>directly and predictably from plaintiff\u2019s misconduct as surely as night follows day. [248 Mich App 115-116.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">We agree with Judge O\u2019Connell and conclude that the record amply supports the wcac\u2019s finding that plaintiff was injured \u201cby reason of\u201d his intentional and wilful misconduct. Because the magistrate failed to address the applicability of \u00a7 305 to plaintiff\u2019s claim, the wcac acted within its authority in engaging in supplemental fact-finding and in concluding that plaintiff\u2019s injury \u2014 although it may well have arisen out of employment events \u2014 was nevertheless barred because it occurred by reason of his intentional and wilful misconduct.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Therefore, as constrained by our limited judicial appellate review, we abide by the findings of fact by the wcac. <em>Mudel, supra, </em>p 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">\u201cINTENTIONAL AND WILFUL\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The Court of Appeals majority next concluded that plaintiff\u2019s acts did not amount to \u201cintentional and wilful misconduct\u201d under MCL 418.305. The majority reasoned that plaintiff\u2019s conduct, though \u201cvoluntary, crude, and unprofessional,\u201d did not rise to \u201cintentional and wilful misconduct\u201d as it has been interpreted in this state. 248 Mich App 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">Our case law has consistently distinguished \u201cintentional and wilful misconduct\u201d from acts of negligence and gross negligence. Benefits are awarded despite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>MCL 418.305 where an employee is injured by his own negligence. See, e.g., <em>Gignac v Studebaker Corp, </em>186 Mich 574; 152 NW 1037 (1915); <em>Day, supra. </em>However, this Court has held that benefits are precluded under the statute where an employee was injured by conduct of a quasi-criminal nature. <em>Fortin v Beaver Coal Co, </em>217 Mich 508, 510; 187 NW 352 (1922). <em>Fortin </em>described \u201cquasicriminal\u201d conduct as \u201cinvolving the intentional doing of something with knowledge that it is dangerous and with wanton disregard of consequences . ...\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Although plaintiff denies that he made the comments of which he is accused, his denials were not believed at any level reflected in the record. At the disciplinary conference, \u201ca strong basis\u201d was found to support the allegations. The magistrate found that plaintiff had \u201cbrought these troubles on himself by his own misconduct.\u201d The WCAC found that \u201c[pjlaintiff knew what he was doing was wrong\u201d and yet he persisted. Even the Court of Appeals majority called the plaintiffs behavior \u201cvoluntary, crude, and unprofessional.\u201d 248 Mich App 104. Nevertheless, the majority decided that plaintiffs behavior did not rise to a level of moral turpitude that could be called \u201cintentional and wilful.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">In our view, the wcac\u2019s conclusion that plaintiffs misconduct was voluntary is amply supported by the record. His repeated acts of sexual harassment were well beyond the realm of mere negligence or gross negligence. That said, it has long been understood that the question whether misconduct is \u201cintentional and wilful\u201d is one of fact. <em>McMinn, supra, </em>p 429, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number><em>Day, supra, </em>p 390.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On judicial review, \u201c[t]he findings of fact made by the commission acting within its powers, in the absence of fraud, shall be conclusive.\u201d <em>Mudel, supra, </em>p 700. Thus, the Court of Appeals panel majority\u2019s rejection of the wcac\u2019s findings regarding whether plaintiff\u2019s misconduct was \u201cintentional and wilful\u201d and its substitution of its own fact-finding on the issue does not comport with its limited judicial appellate review. We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">We note one final disagreement with the panel majority\u2019s reasoning. Regarding whether the plaintiff knew his conduct was prohibited, the panel majority found persuasive the fact that, although plaintiff\u2019s comments were alleged to have been made over several years, he \u201csuffered no adverse consequences from his behavior\u201d until 1995. 248 Mich App 103. It reasoned that \u201c[pjlaintiff\u2019s history of conduct in this case indicates that the rule was not strictly enforced and there are no facts in the record indicating otherwise.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 105. While this Court has concluded that MCL 418.305 does not operate to preclude benefits where an employee was injured while violating a work rale that had not been enforced by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>employer, see, e.g., <em>Rayner v Sligh Furniture, Co, </em>180 Mich 168; 146 NW 665 (1914), the record in this case reflects that plaintiffs immediate supervisor had conducted several investigations into other alleged violations of work rules by other employees during her supervisory tenure. More critically, that plaintiffs accusers did not file formal complaints triggering the enforcement process is not demonstrative of the defendant\u2019s enforcement, or lack thereof, of workplace rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">For the reasons stated, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the wcac order denying benefits to this plaintiff.</p>\n<judges id=\"b147-6\">Corrigan, C.J., and Taylor, Young, and Markman, JJ., concurred with Weaver, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b147-7\">Cavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2P\">I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff is precluded from receiving worker\u2019s compensation benefits for his mental injury. The majority relies on the intentional and wilful misconduct exclusion in MCL 418.305 to hold that, though plaintiff\u2019s depression was a result of defendant\u2019s disciplinary proceedings, such disciplinary proceedings were necessitated by plaintiff\u2019s intentional and wilful misconduct, i.e., plaintiff\u2019s sexual harassment of female attorneys. I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals and award benefits to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">I agree with the Court of Appeals majority that the connection between plaintiff\u2019s acts and his injury is too attenuated for the injury to have occurred \u201cby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>reason of\u201d his acts. The majority rejects this position, fearing it would impose a requirement that the injury arise contemporaneously with the employee\u2019s misconduct. However, saying that plaintiff\u2019s acts of sexual harassment and his injury are \u201ctoo attenuated,\u201d does not necessarily impose a requirement that the injury arise contemporaneously with the misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">In this case, plaintiff\u2019s injury followed not only plaintiff\u2019s own conduct, but also action taken by defendant. One must consider not only the amount of time that elapsed between the employee\u2019s conduct and the injury, but also the events that occurred during that time. The disciplinary proceedings conducted by defendant in this case occurred after plaintiff\u2019s misconduct, but before his mental injury. Therefore, one could conclude, as the magistrate did, that the discipline was the cause of plaintiff\u2019s mental injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Additionally, the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission improperly substituted its own findings for those of the magistrate. The magistrate found that \u201c[plaintiffs problems started with his discipline,\u201d and that \u201cplaintiff\u2019s discipline and post-discipline employment events up to February 2, 1996, contributed in a significant manner to\u201d plaintiff\u2019s mental injury. Findings of fact by the magistrate are to be considered conclusive by the wcac if supported by \u201ccompetent, material, and substantial evidence on the whole record.\u201d MCL 418.861a(3); <em>Holden v Ford Motor Co, </em>439 Mich 257, 261; 484 NW2d 227 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">The WCAC majority found that the record supported the magistrate\u2019s finding that defendant\u2019s discipline of plaintiff, which followed the sexual harassment, was the direct cause of plaintiff\u2019s injury. Its review should have ended there, but the wcac improperly replaced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>the magistrate\u2019s finding that plaintiff\u2019s injury was caused by defendant\u2019s disciplinary proceedings with its own finding that plaintiff\u2019s injury was caused by his intentional and wilful conduct. The wcac exceeded the scope of its review; therefore, the magistrate\u2019s finding that plaintiff\u2019s injury was the result of the disciplinary proceedings should be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Because I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate plaintiff\u2019s benefits, I, respectfully, dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b149-5\">Kelly, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b136-8\"> The attorney alleged that in August 1994 plaintiff obscenely propositioned her.

Then, in the middle of a probation hearing that day, he showed her a note stating that she would have to lose ten pounds first. The attorney testified that she and her boss successfully arranged her schedule to avoid further contact with plaintiff. However, in February 1995, she was again scheduled with plaintiff. The attorney testified that plaintiff doggedly pursued his previous proposition.

In <em>Calovecchi, </em>an employee\u2019s alleged misconduct off the job was investigated, but the allegations were ultimately dismissed. <em>Calovecchi </em>held that mental injuries caused by acts of discipline may be compensable under MCL 418.301(1), because \u201cacts of employer-imposed discipline are a predictable part of the working environment.\u201d <em>Calovecchi, supra, </em>p 625. The majority and dissent speculated whether <em>Calovecchi </em>would somehow encourage employers to find employees guilty of alleged misconduct. In response, we note that MCL 418.305 was not raised by the parties or addressed at any level in <em>Calovecchi </em>and that such policy considerations are properly left to the Legislature, not the courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b141-10\"> The only change has been to the word \u201cemployee,\u201d which was originally spelled \u201cemploye.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b142-8\"> <em>Crilly </em>involved an injury caused by employees throwing shingles and nails at one another.

The Court of Appeals affirmed the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board\u2019s award of benefits, concluding that the conduct did not involve \u201csuch a degree of \u2018moral turpitude\u2019 ... so as to preclude\u201d benefits. <em>Andrews, supra, </em>p 561.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b143-7\"> Whether misconduct that causes an injury arose out of and in the course of employment under MCL 418.301(1) is a <em>preliminary </em>question that must be answered affirmatively before the issue whether that misconduct was \u201cintentional and wilful\u201d in light of MCL 418.305 is reached. See <em>Bischoff v American Car &amp; Foundry Co, </em>190 Mich 229, 231; 157 NW 34 (1916); <em>Clem v Chalmers Motor Co, </em>178 Mich 340, 344-345; 144 NW 848 (1914).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b144-10\"> Indeed, the wcac\u2019s fact-finding in this regard is <em>consistent </em>with the magistrate\u2019s finding that plaintiff \u201cbrought these troubles on himself by his own misconduct.\u201d Therefore, we cannot agree with Justice Cavanagh, who opines in dissent that the wcac improperly substituted its own findings for those of the magistrate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b146-7\"> In <em>Crilly, supra, </em>p 327, we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">[T]his exclusion of acts of a degree of moral turpitude, it will be observed, is by the legislature itself, not a judicial retrogression to principles of tort. <em>Further than this in definition we do not attempt to go. </em>The precise future line of demarcation will be marked out, in the traditional manner, <em>by the case-to-case decision. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
