Code, ch. 104. \u00a7 29. p. 382 ? Or, whether she was entitled only to such provision as the law made for her, considering the property such as it was at the testator\u2019s death, real estate and slaves ? that is, to dower of the real estate, and a moiety of the slaves for life, and if sold, to the same interest in the proceeds of sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-6\">The circuit superior court, held, that the widow was entitled to have her portion of the estate according to its character at the testator\u2019s death <em>; </em>and decreed, that dower of the real estate should be assigned to her, and one half of the slave property to be held by her for life, and half of the other personal estate in absolute property.

That a conversion of the property into money, at all events, was intended, he said, was plain from several considerations : in directing the sale, he blended real estate, slaves, and other personalty, together: he gave pecuniary legacies, to be paid out of the proceeds, to foreigners; and when he came to divide the residuum <em>between Mary and Matthew Maben, he </em>directed that <em>Matthew's </em>moiety should be vested in bank stock. And having converted the whole into money, out and out, for all the purposes of his will, one of which was the provision for his wife, when he gave his wife specific legacies \u201c in addition to what the law allowed her,\u201d he meant in addition to what the law would allow her of the estate so converted into money. He said, that in all cases of conversion into money directed by will, it should be confirmed and carried out, at least for all the purposes of the will contemplated by the testator; and in all questions between claimants under the will, the property should be considered as money; though it was otherwise, where there was a claim independent of the will. The widow was not to be put off with an equivalent: she was to take under the <em>law, </em>or under the <em>will; </em>if she took under the <em>law, </em>she took her legal share of the property in kind, unaffected by the will; if under the will, she took her share of the property, such as the will made it; and the will making it money, she was entitled to take her share of it as money.

He said, that the testator directed a sale of his real estate and slaves as well as his household furniture, for the specific purpose of raising a fund, in aid of his outstanding debts, for the payment of his debts : if it was not necessary for that purpose, no sale was required. And when he gave his wife specific legacies, \u201c in addition to what the <em>law </em>allowed her,\u201d having given her by his <em>will </em>nothing but the specific legacies, he referred to the <em>law </em>alone to ascertain what should be allowed her. Now, the <em>law </em>allowed her dower of the real estate, and, subject to debts, a moiety of the slaves for life, and of the other personalty in absolute property.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b637-6\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"ACe\">I am of opinion, that the court below 'rightly rejected the construction of the testator\u2019s will contended for by the appellants; the widow being entitled to have her portion of the estate estimated according to its character at the testator\u2019s death, and not otherwise. He never designed, that her share should be estimated as if the whole estate were personalty; thereby enlarging her rights from one <em>third </em>of the real estate for <em>life </em>to one <em>half </em>of its value in <em>absolute </em>property. His intention was, that she should have what the law allowed as her dower in lands, and if with her assent the whole estate should be sold out and out, he intended she should have one third of the proceeds of sale for life. And so of the slaves. Had he designed one half of the proceeds of sale for her, he would have said so in so many words, instead of using expressions, the natural import of which would give her only what the law allowed of his estate, in its existing condition at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"AoBq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Such seems to me the obvious intention of the testator as declared in this will. And however closely we scan his expressions, the result will be the same. Thus, he gives to the wife certain specific legacies, \u201cin <em>addition </em>to what the <em>law </em>allows her.\u201d He does not pro- \u25a0 fess to give her what the <em>law </em>gives, but only something in addition. She does not take her portion then under the <em>will, </em>but under the <em>law. </em>Now the <em>law </em>cannot give it to her in the landed estate as if it were personalty. If it <em>is to be </em>considered as personalty, it is <em>by virtue of the will, </em>and she would take it, not by gift of the <em>law, </em>but by force of the <em>will. </em>Instead of holding paramount to the will by <em>law, </em>she would hold under the will by <em>bequest; </em>whereas, as has been already said, she clearly holds by law and not by the bequest. And the difference might be very material; since if she'took under the will, she would take subject to the debts. In her present condition, too, if she takes money, her husband pockets the whole, but if she takes land, it is at her own disposal. Or, if it be admitted that she had a right to take either land or money, her husband cannot elect to take money to her prejudice; whereas if her rights <em>are </em>only <em>to </em>money, they belong absolutely <em>to </em>him. <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Taliaferro, 3 </em>Leigh 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">It has been attempted to maintain the right of the wife to one half the estate, by an argument rested on two propositions; 1. that the whole estate real and personal, including the dower interest, was by the will converted into personalty; and 2. that by the words, \u201c in addition to what the law allows my wife of my estate,\u201d the testator had reference to the conversion of it into personalty, and meant to give her of the proceeds of sale as much as the law would allow her if his whole estate were personal. To say nothing of the gratuitous character of this supposition, and of the inadmissible liberty thus taken with the testator\u2019s words, it is enough to say, that the first proposition, on which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>the whole argument rests, is utterly untenable. There was no conversion by the will, either legal or equitable, of so much of the realty as constituted the wife\u2019s third. The whole equitable doctrine of the absolute conversion of land into money, rests upon the <em>jus disponendi. Gujus est dare, ejus est disponere. </em>But where there is no <em>jus disponendi, </em>there can be no equitable conversion by will. Now, here, the husband had no <em>jus disponendi </em>of the dower of his wife. There was, then, no conversion of <em>that portion </em>of his estate. If, indeed, after his death, she had assented to a sale out and out, there might have been a conversion ; yet not by <em>his mil, </em>but by <em>her contract; </em>and she would only have had title to the value of her third for life, out of the proceeds of sale. There is, therefore, no foundation for the supposed construction, resting upon the postulate that there was an equitable conversion, out and out, of the whole land into personal estate. In every view of the case, I am satisfied that the construction contended for by the appellants is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">It was suggested in the argument, that the slave <em>Edmund Williams, </em>who was emancipated, was not embraced in the decretal order, directing the estate to be divided, and the widow\u2019s portion laid <em>off. </em>I think this is a mistake. The commissioners are directed to divide the slaves <em>of which the testator died possessed: </em>the slave <em>Edmund Williams </em>was one of these, and, of course, is embraced in the order. If the commissioners, in making the division, should not take him into account, or should assign him to the widow, it will be in her power to except to their report.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Upon the whole, I think there is no error in the decree, and that it should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">The other judges concurring, decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
