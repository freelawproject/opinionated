It recites, that on the 27th of May, 1796, the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>tiffs, in behalf of the ship <em>Argo, </em>and the defendant, entered into a charter party of affreightment, which is recited at large, and by which the plaintiffs stipulate to have the said ship fitted for sea, and supplied with all things needful, for a voyage to Cape Nichola Mole, to which place she is to proceed, with a cargo of horses, to be put on board by the defendant, who is to pay a stipulated freight, and in case of capture and condemnation of the said ship, he is to pay the plaintiffs 13,000 dollars, within the tune usually required to recover insurances. There are other covenants not material in this case, and the parties bind themselves for performance, in the penalty of 10,000 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-8\">The declaration avers performance on the part of the plaintiffs, and that the ship in the course of the voyage was captured and condemned in the court of the commission appointed by the French government for the leeward islands, that the time usually required to recover insurances had expired; and that the defendant became liable to pay the 13;000 dollars, but had refused, &amp;tc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-9\">The defendant demurs specially:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-10\">1st.

Because the defendant has no right to plead \"and demur to the same declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-11\">To the 2d plea the 3d and 4th causes of demurrer to the 1st plea are again assigned as causes of demurrer; and the 3d cause is, that it does not appear that it was needful to supply the said ship with a sea letter, or passport.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-12\">To the 3d plea, the 3d and 4th causes of demurrer to the 1st plea are again assigned, and the 3d cause of demurrer to the 2d plea is also assigned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-13\">A 4th cause of demurrer is, that the plaintiffs have not by their charter party warranted the ship to be American property; and,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-14\">5th. That the defendant is estopped from saying, that she is American property, he having covenanted to pay 13,000 dollars, on her capture and condemnation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-15\">Judgment was given for the defendant on his demurrer; and the plaintiff appealed to the court of appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b89-16\"><em>Hay, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADu\">The action is properly conceived, as debt lies for any thing certain. 1 <em>Esp. </em>172. 3 <em>Black. Com. </em>154. 2 <em>Bac. </em>20. 3 <em>Bac. </em>523. 2 <em>Stra. </em>1089. 4 <em>Vin. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number><em>Ab. </em>376. This is not affected by tbe doctrine in 4 <em>Burr. </em>2228; because there is an express stipulation for a given sum ; and that constitutes debt. The breaches are assigned with sufficient certainty; for they may be assigned in the words of the covenant. The defendant could not <em>plead, </em>and <em>demur, </em>to the same declaration. 5 <em>Bac. </em>119. The plea of mutual covenants ought not to avail the defendant, as he might have brought his cross action.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b90-10\">\n<em>Call, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATj\">The uniting of the demurrer with the pleas does not prejudice the defence. For either the demurrer is not a plea, or it is. If the <em>first, </em>then the plea overrules the demurrer; because a demurrer is an excuse for not pleading, 5 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>458: and, after having pleaded, it would be absurd to object to pleading. 1 <em>How. Exch. </em>754. 16 <em>Vin. Ab. </em>376. Hence it is, that a demurrer cannot be received after a plea and issue, <em>Barnes, </em>84; because it would be trifling to say, that he ought not to plead, after he had actually pleaded. If the <em>second, </em>then it was allowable under the act of assembly. <em>Pleas. Edi. </em>80. For that permits the defendant to plead \u201c <em>as many several matters, whether of law or fact, as he shall think </em>necessary.\u201d Which necessarily allows him to mingle them as he pleases. Besides a demurrer is an issue in law, 3 <em>Black. Com. </em>314; and there is no other manner of pleading a matter of law, than by demurrer; for, according to lord <em>Coke, </em>the demur-rant <em>abides upon the law, </em>and says that the matter shewn is not sufficient in law, <em>Co. Litt. </em>71; which is, in fact, to say, that the law is against the opposite party ; and, therefore, in some books the demurrer is called a plea. 1 <em>Ld. Raym. </em>22. That this is conformable to the will of the legislature, is proved by the difference between the present act, and that of 1748; for that restricted the plea and demurrer to separate parts; but this leaves them indefinite. There is a wide difference between the English statute, and our act of assembly; for there the additional plea cannot be put in without leave of the court, which gives them discretion with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>regard to it; but here it is matter of right, and the court can exercise no control. The reason why double pleading was originally refused was, that the jury might not be perplexed with multifarious matter : But that inconvenience is avoided, when the demurrer and the pleas are kept separate and distinct for different tribunals. The declaration ought to have shewn the cause for which the vessel was captured; and that she was condemned by a court of competent jurisdiction ; for that is necessarily implied in the contract; and, without an averment to that effect, the plaintiff cannot recover. 1 <em>T. Rep. </em>674, 676. 5 <em>Com. Dig. </em>356.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b91-6\"><em>Wickham, </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWf\">The declaration is insufficient for want of the proper averments. If there be a covenant for quiet enjoyment, it is not sufficient for the plaintiff to say, that he did not quietly enjoy. 4 <em>T. Rp.p. </em>617\u00bb The defendant is an underwriter of the vessel against capture, and is not chargeable under the generality of this declaration. 2 <em>Marsh. Ins. </em>587, 588. The time of the capture ought to have been stated, and the omission is fatal on demurrer; especially as it might be important that the defendant should be apprized of it. The declaration ought, also, to have stated by whom the vessel was captured; for she might have been captured by one nation, and drifted into another, as a <em>droit d'admiraltie. </em>The place where the court of condemnation sat, ought likewise to have been stated, that its authority might have been ascertained. The <em>Leeward Islands </em>is an equivocal expression, as it might have meant Dutch, English, or French; and it has been held that a condemnation by a French court, sitting out of the territories of France, is not binding. If, however, the court should be of opinion, that the declaration contains a good cause of action, then the suit should have been sent back to the district court in order to have the pleas disposed of. But the defendant has a right to plead and demur together; for the act of assembly allows it, as the demurrer is a plea; and, therefore, not only may the defendant demur after a rule to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>plead, but it is the constant practice to allow a demurrer to be filed, instead of a plea, upon setting aside an office judgment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b92-8\"><em>Randolph, </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1j\">Covenant, and not debt, was the proper action. But if the plaintiff chose to bring debt, he ought, at least, to have sued for the penalty, and not for the $ 13,000. <em>2 Burr. 2228. </em>The declaration ought to have stated the time, the place, the manner and the persons by whom the capture was made. 5 <em>Com. </em>Dig. 354. It cannot be presumed that the vessel was captured by the French; because we are at peace with that nation. The pleas and demurrer might be joined; for the act of assembly extends the former right of pleading and demurring to the separate parts, to the right of pleading and demurring to the whole declaration.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b92-9\"><em>Hay, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASq\">It was not in the power of the plaintiff to state the court where the condemnation was made, with more precision : nor was it necessary; for, to every reasonable purpose, it was certain enough already: and the jurisdiction is fairly inferrable from what is said. The plaintiff was not bound to sue for the penalty, but might maintain an action of debt for the <em>$ </em>13,000; because it was a specific sum, and debt lies for any specific sum due from one man to another.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b92-10\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b92-11\">Lyons, President,</author>\n<p id=\"Atz\">delivered the resolution of the court, that the judgment was to be affirmed for the third reason mentioned in the defendant\u2019s demurrer to the declaration, that is to say, That it did not set forth when or by whom the ship was captured ; or when, or where, she was condemned.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
