That the matter to which the plaintiff deposed was untrue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-11\">At the trial, the plaintiff, after proving that the words in the declaration mentioned were spoken by the defendant within twelve months prior to the institution of this suit, introduced a witness to prove the speaking by the defendant of the same and like words more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>twelve months before the institution of this suit, and, on some occasions, several years prior thereto. This evidence, though offered merely for the purpose of shewing the defendant\u2019s malice towards the plaintiff, was objected to by the defendant\u2019s counsel; but the court overruled the objection, and permitted the evidence to go to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-4\">Afterwards the plaintiff\u2019s counsel introduced a witness to prove the general character of the plaintiff. He asked the witness what was the plaintiff\u2019s general character, when on oath and when not on oath, as a man of truth ? and the witness answered the question favourably to the plaintiff. The defendant\u2019s counsel then, in crossexamining the witness, asked him what was the plaintiff\u2019s general moral character ?

That the opinion first mentioned was wrong. The effect of it was to deprive the defendant of the benefit of his plea of the statute of limitations. Besides, the evidence objected to was of words actionable in themselves, and such words cannot be proved in order to aggravate the damages by shewing malice; they constituting a distinct injury, for which the plaintiff had his remedy by action. The circumstance that he chose to waive that remedy until it was barred by the statute, furnishes no reason for reviving it indirectly in a collateral action, especially as the words already proved were in no wise equivocal or ambiguous. In no point of view can words spoken previously to the grievance complained of and proved, be permitted to aid the plaintiff or prejudice the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-6\">2. That the other opinion given at the trial was wrong. In relation to the veracity of a plaintiff, no distinct opinion may have been formed by the public, and a defendant may fail in proving a plaintiff\u2019s character bad in that particular, while he may, by the most satisfactory evidence, prove that the plaintiff\u2019s general cbarac- . ter is infamous. Such a plaintiff cannot be entitled to the same measure of damages as one whose character is unblemished. A notorious rogue, perhaps just from the penitentiary, ought not to recover as heavy damages for defamatory words in relation to his veracity,, as a man free from all exception. Besides, in this .case, the subject of the plaintiff\u2019s general character was introduced by the plaintiff himself, and he had no right to exclude part of it, though be was at liberty to enquire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>into the grounds upon which the public belief was founded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-4\">3. It appears .that the verdict, as found by the jury, responded only to the issue upon the plea of not guilty, and the court has undertaken, on a subsequent day, to correct the verdict and make it respond to other issues. In so doing, the court has exceeded its authority.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b365-10\">Upon these points, the cause was argued in this court by <em>Baldwin </em>for the plaintiff in error, and <em>Michie </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-11\">The counsel for the defendant in error insisted, 1. That the court below properly decided to admit evidence of the speaking of the same words in the declaration mentioned, and like words, more than twelve months before the bringing of the suit, in order to shew malice. Starkie on Slander 398, 9. and note on p. 591. <em>2 </em>Starkie on Evid. 870. On principle, he said, there - could be no objection to such evidence. The court would instruct the jury not to give damages for the words so proven out of the declaration, but to receive them merely in proof of the <em>quo animo. </em>Exclude such evidence, and it would, in most cases, be out of the plaintiff\u2019s power to shew the extent of the defendant\u2019s malice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-12\"><em>2. </em>He insisted that the court did right in excluding all evidence offered by the defendant to prove the plaintiff\u2019s general moral character, except as touching the charge stated in the declaration. A contrary practice, he said, would be attended with much mischief. \u201cGeneral moral character\u201d is a very vague and indefinite phrase, differently understood by every witness, according to his own peculiar moral principles. An abolitionist, for instance, would say that a man\u2019s general moral character was bad, if he held slaves; a religionist, if he lacked chastity; his neighbours generally, if he were quarrelsome or litigious. The case of <em>M'Nutt </em>v. <em>Young, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>8 Leigh 542. does not justify the reception, in mitigation of damages, of evidence of moral character, except on the subject of the particular slander charged. The inconvenience suggested in the petition can never result from thus restricting the defendant, since a notorious rogue, or one just from the penitentiary, could hardly sustain a good general character for truth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-4\">3. He referred to 1 Rob. Prac. 355, 6. to shew the manner in which verdicts are usually found, and after-wards extended by the clerk ; and he said, that was to be presumed to have been the manner here, particularly as there was no exception to the subsequent entry made by the court. It was not to be supposed that the court had made an entry unauthorized by the actual verdict.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b366-5\">Parker, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Aq0x\">I refer to the president\u2019s opinion, for the reasons which induce me to think that the court below committed no error in receiving evidence of f t^tion^t the surf for the purpose of proving malice ; <em>/ </em>and'hoite ir$fA\u00ab?Sfying the entry which had been pre<em>k </em>vjevj^l^m^jjie^ofjthe verdict and judgment. The re:-^asal of the cnirft to permit the witness to prove the <em>general./a\u00dc9!8.cter </em>of the plaintiff, stands, as I think, on a different footing. It may be, that in actions for slanders charging professional negligence or incompetence, or for words imputing no moral delinquency, and in other similar cases, the evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s general bad character might be properly rejected, as irrelevant to the issue, and as having no bearing upon the question of the amount of damages. About this, I wish to be understood as expressing no opinion. The defamatory words for which <em>this </em>action is brought, import a direct attack upon moral character; and in such case, surely the man of unblemished reputation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>is entitled to greater damages than one whose character is already so bad 'as to receive little or no detriment from the imputed slander. This question was much considered in the case of <em>M'Nutt </em>v. <em>Young, </em>8 Leigh 542. The point there decided was, that evidence of the general character of the plaintiff <em>in relation to the charge stated in the declaration, </em>ought to have been admitted in mitigation of the damages. That was the precise point presented by the bill of exceptions, and the court of course confined itself to <em>that; </em>but the reasoning of the judges for coming to that conclusion, fully justifies the reception of evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s bad character at large. Indeed it has been seriously doubted, by those who agreed that general character may form the subject of examination, whether to confine the enquiry to the particular character of the party in the capacity in which he has been libelled, would not be infringing the rule that the truth of the words cannot be given in evidence under the general issue. See justice <em>Thompson's </em>opinion in the case of <em>Fa </em>Johns. Rep. 46. In the opinion of^u^fripBrsonsi enquiry ought to be <em>confined </em>to genera as this court, by a decision of all the tied that question, we cannot, I thinlk h|sjt|^ ig jpjr judgment upon the case at bar. .</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">It cannot be denied that in an action tor fllf'ii^Try to reputation, the character of the prosecutor is of some importance in estimating damages. The defendant cannot <em>plead </em>the blemished character of the plaintiff, and for that very reason he ought to be allowed to give it in evidence in mitigation of damages ; for it is a settled rule, as was shewn in the case of <em>M'Nutt </em>v. <em>Young, </em>that where a party cannot take advantage of special matter bearing upon the measure of damages, <em>by pleading, </em>he may give it in evidence under the general issue. Otherwise there is no mode by which he can avail himself of a fact which, it must be conceded, ought to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>a material influence upon the quantum of damages. That some inconveniences may result from this practice, and even danger occur of occasional injustice,1 may readily be <em>admitted; </em>but upon the whole, it is required by the general principle which admits in evidence matters relevant to the cause, and is necessary in a great majority of cases to guide the discretion of the jury, who, without such evidence, will take general character into their estimate, grounded upon their <em>own knowledge, </em>or upon vague and delusive rumours.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">There is no great hardship in holding that a plaintiff suing for his character should come prepared to defend it from <em>general </em>attacks. If a witness impugns it, he has a right to call on him to specify the grounds of his opinion ; and if, on that crossexamination, it should appear that the opinion was founded on his anti-abolitionism, or his want of chastity, or his intemperate use of spirits, or his fondness for cards, or his addiction to any other vice which a jury might consider venial, they would know how to estimate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">All the authorities on this subject were cited and commented on in the case of <em>M'Nutt </em>v. <em>Young, </em>and it is unnecessary to examine them farther. That case, in my opinion, substantially decides this, and convicts the court below of error in rejecting the testimony of general character offered by the defendant. <em>A fortiori, </em>I think the court erred in refusing it upon the crossexamination. The plaintiff himself had introduced the witness to prove his own general character, and had asked him what was his the plaintiff\u2019s character, when on oath and when not on oath, as a man of truth? The witness answered favourably to him, and then the defendant desired to.crossexamine him on the subject of general character. This crossexamination ought, in my opinion, to have been allowed, for the purpose (if for no other) of enabling the jury to eslimate what credit was due to the witness\u2019s opinion of good character <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>in one particular, by comparing it with his character in general. Had the witness answered that his general character was infamous, surely the jury would not have attached much weight to the favourable report he made of his character as a man of truth. \u2022 But it is unnecessary to enlarge on this ground.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b369-4\">Stanard and Cabell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Arij\">concurred in the opinion that the judgment should be reversed for the error commented on by <em>Parlcer, </em>J.</p>\n<author id=\"b369-5\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Aqei\">Upon the question presented first in the bill of exceptions, I was inclined to differ with the court below, believing that the effect of the decision was to give the plaintiff damages indirectly for a slander which was barred by the statute of limitations. I am persuaded upon reflection, that my first impression was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">However questionable the practice may seem, to permit the introduction of evidence of words spoken at a different time, in order to prove malice in speaking those charged in the declaration, it seems now too firmly established to be shaken. Though there is some contrariety of opinion as to the admissibility of distinct slanderous matter <em>subsequent </em>to that charged in the declaration, yet I think the weight of authority, as well as the universal practice of the courts, recognizes the right of the plaintiff, after proving the words laid, to go on to prove the speaking of the same or the like words at any time antecedent. I have met with no case in which that right is denied. The admissibility of the proof of the repetition of the same slander at various times, seems to be conceded in all the cases, as the stress of the argument in them has always.turned upon the fact that the words were subsequently spoken. <em>Rustell </em>v. <em>Macquister, </em>1 Camp. 49. note. <em>Macleod </em>v. <em>Wakley, </em>3 Carr. &amp; Payne 311. 14 Eng. C. L. Rep. 322. <em>Tate </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number><em>Humphrey, 2 </em>Camp. 73. note, and <em>Bodwell </em>v. <em>Swan et </em>ux<em>\u2019 </em>3 Pick. 376. are cases in which subsequent sianders were admitted for the purpose of shewing malice. The case of <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Daubigny, </em>Peake\u2019s Cas. 125. decided by lord <em>Kenyon, </em>is <em>contra: </em>but lord <em>Kenyon </em>himself decided differently in <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Huson, </em>Peake\u2019s Cas. 166. In <em>Finnerty </em>v. <em>Tipper, 2 </em>Camp. 72. chief justice <em>Mansfield </em>seemed inclined to modify the rule, though it would appear that he approved the decisions. But his opinion also refers to subsequent words, and therefore does not touch the question of the antecedent speaking of the same words. I take it, then, that such proof is clearly admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">But it is said, that where the speaking of the words attempted to be given in evidence was more than a year anterior to the trial, an action for them is barred by the statute, and that as the proof of them would tend to inflame the minds of the jury and to increase the damages, the plaintiff will indirectly recover damages for a wrong, for which the action is gone forever. This argument is very plausible, but I think it unsound. The evidence is introduced solely to prove the deep-seated malice with which the last words were spoken, and is permitted to go to the jury with that qualification ; <em>Rustell </em>v. <em>Macquister, </em>1 Camp. 49. note. With that qualification, there can be no objection to admitting proof of the antecedent' speaking of the same words, although the action for them is barred. For I apprehend, even if the plaintiff had sued for them and recovered damages for them, the proof of that fact would <em>be good </em>evidence in an action for repetition of the same slander. Is it not obviously a gross aggravation of a subsequent slander\u2014is it not strong evidence of the most deeprooted malignity, that even the conviction and the punishment of the slanderer has worked no reformation in his conduct, and has been unavailing to arrrest the foul current of his abuse ? Is it not a reason for increasing the penalty of this new transgres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>sion, repeated after he has had an opportunity of justifying his accusations, and has shrunk from or has failed in the attempt? I cannot doubt it. Yet who ever thought of rejecting the proof of the fact, because the plaintiff had already recovered damages for the first slander, and cannot refer to it to increase the damages for the second ? So in this case, though no action has been brought for the first slander, is it not an aggravation of the last, that it is repeated ? .When the plaintiff, in a spirit of forbearance, has waived his right of action for the first slander, either perhaps because it was uttered in a moment of heat, or that he felt an innate consciousness that he would live down the calumny by the correctness of his life, is it no aggravation of a repetition of the slander, that the defendant, regardless of his forbearance, will not let him live in peace,? Admit that no damages whatever are allowed for the first slander, is not here ample ground for increasing the damages for the second ? I think there is, and am therefore of opinion that the testimony was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">On the second question, I was inclined to think that the enquiry as to general character should be confined to the particular matter which is the subject of the' charge. But my brethren think differently, and I willingly defer to their opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">As to the third point, there being no exception, I must presume every thing right. I have no doubt, enough matter appeared to the judge of the court below to authorize his newmodelling the entry, and I must take it for granted that it did so appear, as the contrary is not shewn by an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">There being, however, in the opinion of a majority of the court, error in the refusal to permit an enquiry as to the plaintiff\u2019s general character, the judgment must for that cause be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
