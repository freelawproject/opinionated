The debtor dying, a bill of revivor and supplement is filed against his administrator, to obtain payment of the decree out of the assets in his hands. And the administrator, by his answer, relies upon the 17th, and also upon the 5th section of the statute of limitations, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 128. Held, the decree in this case is not a final decree, and if it were, is not such a one as the statutes can apply to.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-8\">On the 9th of February 1801, <em>James Primm </em>entered Into a bond with <em>Patrick Home, Leonard Hill, Nathaniel Fox </em>and <em>Charles Ralls </em>his sureties, which, after reciting that he had been appointed sheriff of the county of <em>Stafford </em>by a commission from the governor, under the seal of the commonwealth, dated the 20th day of November 1800, was conditioned that <em>Primm </em>should truly and faithfully collect, account for and pay the taxes imposed by law in his said county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-9\"><em>Primm </em>having broken the condition of the bond, and <em>Leonard Hill, </em>one of the sureties, having been compelled to pay money on account thereof, suit was brought by him, in the superior court of chancery holden in <em>Richmond, </em>to recover so much of what he had paid as he was entitled to. The bill alleged that <em>Primm </em>wras insolvent; that <em>Home </em>had died insolvent and intestate, and no person had administered on his estate; that <em>Ralls </em>had removed from <em>Virginia, </em>had died insolvent, and ho person had administered on his estate ; and that <em>Fox </em>had conveyed his property in trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>an(J by mortgage to <em>Robert Dunbar </em>and <em>Zachariah J </em>0 \u00b0 <em>Vowles\u2022</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ao_g\">The cause, after being revived in the names of <em>Thomas Hill </em>and <em>William Hill </em>as executors of <em>Leonard Hill, </em>was remove(l to the superior court of chancery at <em>Fredericksburg. </em>That court, on the 30lh of September 1819, decreed that the plaintiffs <em>recover </em>of the defendant <em>Nathaniel Fox </em>558 dollars 70 cents, with interest on 255 dollars 57 cents, part thereof, from the 21st of January 1807, and on 303 dollars 13 cents, other part thereof, from the 25th of October 1810, until paid, and the costs expended by the plaintiffs and their intestate in the prosecution of this suit; \u201c and if no property of the said defendant can be found, out of which this decree can be satisfied, or not sufficient for that purpose, other than that conveyed by the deed of trust and mortgage in the proceedings mentioned, that then the said <em>Fox </em>do deliver the property in the said deed of trust <em>and </em>mortgage mentioned, or so much thereof as may be necessary for the purpose of paying this decree and the sums herein aftermentioned, to the marshal of this court, to be by him sold, after advertising the time and plaee of sale, in some newspaper printed in the town of <em>Fredericksburg, </em>for three weeks successively, to the highest bidder for cash; and that he, out of the proceeds of such sale, shall, after defraying the costs of sale, first deposit in the bank of <em>Virginia </em>at <em>Fredericksburg, </em>subject to the future order of the court in this cause, the following sums of money, <em>viz. \u00a3205. </em>4. 4|. with interest thereon at the rate of six per centum per annum from the 1st day of October 1801, until so deposited, and \u00bf\u00a3250. O. 2J. with the like interest thereon from the 17th day of May 1803 until so deposited, and then, out of the residue of the proceeds of sale, pay to the plaintiffs the principal, interest and costs aforesaid decreed to them; and that the said marshal report his proceedings herein to the court.\u201d And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>the bill of the plaintiffs, as to the defendants <em>Robert Dunbar </em>and <em>Zachariah Vowles, </em>was dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-4\">At July rules 1820, a <em>scire facias </em>was awarded to revive the suit against <em>Nathaniel W. D. Fox </em>administrator of <em>Nathaniel Fox; </em>and at October rules 1820, the <em>scire facias </em>being returned executed, and the said <em>Nathaniel W. D. Fox </em>failing to appear and shew cause against the revival thereby sought, it was ordered that the suit stand and be revived against the said <em>Nathaniel W. D. Fox </em>administrator as aforesaid, and be in all things in the same plight and condition as it was at the time of the death of the said <em>Nathaniel Fox </em>deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-5\">The suit being continued upon the docket of the superior court of chancery holden at <em>Fredericlcsburg, </em>until that court was abolished, and afterwards continued upon the docket of the circuit court of <em>Spotsylvania, </em>on the 27th of May 1836 an amended bill was filed, by leave of the latter court, in the name of <em>Thomas Hill </em>surviving executor of <em>Leonard Hill, </em>setting forth, that the administration of the said <em>Nathaniel W. D. Fox </em>has been revoked, and the estate of the said <em>Nathaniel Fox </em>committed to <em>Benjamin Tolson </em>late sheriff of the county of <em>Stafford, </em>for administration ; that <em>John Moncure, </em>the deputy of <em>Tolson, </em>took charge of the estate, and in the course of his administration collected considerable sums of money due the estate; and the complainant is advised that the same should properly be applied to the discharge of the decree, which remains unsatisfied and in full force.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-6\"><em>Tolson </em>and <em>Moncure </em>answered this amended bill, submitting whether the plaintiff is now entitled to revive his decree against either of them. They file a copy of the order of the county court of <em>Stafford, </em>shewing that on the 10th of November 1823, the letters of administration previously granted to <em>Nathaniel W. D. Fox </em>were revoked, and the estate of <em>Nathaniel Fox </em>committed to <em>Tolson </em>as sheriff of <em>Stafford, </em>for administration; they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>rely upon the fact that more than five years elapsed after the date of that order, before the amended bill was filed; and they pray the benefit of the statute of limitations. They also rely upon the fact that the decree was revived by <em>scire facias </em>against <em>Nathaniel W. D. Fox </em>as administrator of <em>Nathaniel Fox, </em>before proceedings were commenced against them, and though various executions were taken out against the said <em>Nathaniel W. D. Fox </em>on the said revived decree, yet no return was made on any such execution. And they pray the benefit also of the statute of limitations applicable to this state of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-4\">It appeared by a certificate of the clerk of the court of chancery, that on the 29th of October 1819, an execution was issued on the decree, on which a return was made, stating that the defendant was dead before the execution came to hand, and therefore it was not acted on ; that on the 30th of November <em>1821, </em>a new execution issued against <em>Nathaniel W. D. Fox </em>administrator of <em>Nathaniel Fox; </em>that <em>Thomas Hill, </em>one of the plaintiffs, returned it the 30th of October 1822, and obtained another, which he returned on the 2Sth of October 1823; that he then obtained another, which he returned the 22d of October 1824; that another was then issued, which was never returned; and that afterwards, on the 3d of June 1826, another issued, which was never returned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-5\">The circuit court of <em>Spotsylvania </em>decreed that the amended bill be dismissed, and that the plaintiff, out of the goods of his testator, pay to the defendants their costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-6\">On the petition of <em>Hill\u2019s </em>executor, an appeal was allowed from the decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b614-7\"><em>Harrison </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b614-8\"><em>Daniel </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b615-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AP1\">I do not think it necessary, in this case, to decide whether a final decree in a court of equity is a <em>judgment, </em>within the meaning of the two clauses of the statute of limitations relied upon by the defendants, or within the equity of that statute. I am satisfied that this decree is not to be taken to be a final deree, and even if it were, it is not such an one as the statute could apply to. It is a decree, indeed, against <em>Nathaniel Fox </em>for a sum of money; but it farther provides that if no property of his can be found, then he shall deliver up certain trust and mortgage property to the marshal, to be sold to satisfy the plaintiff's demand, if the debt was not made by execution, this part of the decree came into operation; and as it could only be enforced by attachment if obedience to it were refused, so it seems to me obviously to be without the provisions of either of the clauses of the statute. Had the creditor found it necessary to proceed to enforce this provision of the decree, it could only be done by attachment against <em>Fox </em>in his lifetime, or by bill demanding from his representatives, or others in possession of the property, a compliance with the decree, and enforcing it against them by attachment. It is true, this course has not been taken, the creditor still insisting that there are assets. But the provision itself gives the character to the decree; for the cause never could be out of the possession of the court, so long as its direct action might be called for to compel the delivery of the property. And even now it is competent to the party, upon failure to make his debt out of the assets of <em>Fox, </em>to amend his bill, setting forth that fact, and asking the enforcement of the alternative branch of the decree. I am of opinion, therefore, to reverse the decree and send the cause back for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">Decree reversed, and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
