The slaves were delivered to <em>Frayser </em>on the same day, or not long afterwards, and they remained for some time, though not long, in his possession, and then he hired them to <em>Ransone </em>from time to time. The hire agreed on for the year 1828 was 20 dollars; and in May 1828, <em>Ransone </em>gave <em>Frayser </em>his bond for that sum payable on the 25th December following, with a covenant to return the slaves well clothed on that day. <em>Frayser </em>died in July 1828, and by his will bequeathed these slaves to one of his daughters. At the end of the year, <em>Ransone, </em>being desirous to hire the slaves for another year, made application to the legatee to hire them to him; which she refused to <em>do; </em>and then he refused to deliver the slaves to <em>Frayser's </em>executors; upon which one of the executors went to <em>Ransone's </em>house, and took possession of the slaves, and delivered them to the legatee. Thus far, the facts of the case were not controverted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>In August 1833, <em>Ransone </em>exhibited a bill in chaneery, in the circuit superior court of <em>Cumberland, </em>against the executors of <em>Frayser; </em>alleging, that though his bill of sale of the slaves to <em>Frayser, </em>of August 1826, was absolute upon its face, the transaction was in fact a pawn or mortgage of the slaves to <em>Frayser </em>to secure the payment of 800 dollars lent by <em>Frayser </em>to him, upon an agreement, that <em>Ransone </em>might hold the property, and redeem it upon repayment of the money at any time; and praying, that he might be now allowed to redeem ; and to that end, that the slaves might be sold, and the proceeds applied to the payment of the balance which should remain of the debt and interest after deducting the profits which had accrued since the defendants had got possession of them (of which an account was asked), and the surplus decreed to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-3\"><em>Frayser\u2019s </em>executors answered, that the transaction was, what it purported to be by the bill of sale of August 1826, an absolute sale of the slaves to their testator, for a full price paid down.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-4\">On the part of <em>Ransone, </em>one witness deposed, that he was present when the original agreement between <em>Ransone </em>and <em>Frayser </em>was made, and that the contract was, that the slaves in question were to be put into <em>Frayser\u2019s </em>hands as a pawn for 800 dollars lent by him to <em>Ransone, </em>and that the latter was to be at liberty to redeem them whenever he should return the purchase money. And three other witnesses deposed, that <em>Frayser </em>told them, at several times, that <em>Ransone </em>had a right to redeem the property, at any time, by returning the money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-5\">On the other hand, three witnesses deposed, that <em>Ransone </em>told them, at several times, that he had sold the slaves to <em>Frayser </em>for 800 dollars, representing the transaction as an absolute sale, without any apparent motive so to represent it, if it was not the truth. There was proof that <em>Frayser </em>intended to lay out his money in a purchase of slaves, and regarded the slaves con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>veyed by <em>Ransone's </em>bill of sale as bis absolute properly. \u2022 A witness, who drew the bill of sale, deposed, that he understood the contract to be an absolute sale, nothing being said by either party to intimate that a pawn or mortgage Was intended. Nor was there any reason shewn, or even suggested, to account for the omission in the written contract of any mention of the right of redemption, if a pawn or loan was intended under the form of an absolute sale. A physician who attended the family of slaves at <em>Ransone's </em>house in 1828, was told by him to charge his bill for medical services to <em>Frayser. </em>It was proved, that 800 dollars was a full and fair price for the property at the time of the contract. <em>Ransone </em>adduced no proof, nor did he even pretend, that any time was appointed for the repayment of the money, or for the payment of interest. Nor did he account, or attempt to account, for the fact of his having given a bond for 20 dollars for the hire of the slaves for the year 1828 ; a sum less than half the annual interest of the money he said was lent him by <em>Frayser.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-5\">The circuit superior court dismissed the bill. And on the petition of the plaintiff to this court, an appeal was allowed him.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b618-6\"><em>Robertson, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b618-7\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b618-8\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"ARzW\">I think the weight of the parol evidence in this case decidedly with the appellees. I take occasion to remark how dangerous is the admission of the testimony of witnesses, to change and modify the agreement of the parties by setting up a secret trust or right of redemption. It is not denied, that such testimony is admissible; but whether it was wise to have established the rule, except in cases of fraud, or oppression, or mistake of the scrivener, may well be doubted. Here are four witnesses, who swear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>to facts which, standing uncontradicted, might have . - 5 a established this transaction as a mortgage: yet the facts and circumstances are conclusive of the contrary. In the first place, here is an absolute bill of sale, for which there seems to have been no assignable motive on the part of <em>Ransone. </em>He was not in the power of <em>Frayser. </em>He does not pretend, that the instrument was intended to be otherwise written, and that it was fraudulently imposed upon him in its present form. It was drawn not by <em>Frayser, </em>but by a third person, and that person (the only one present) heard nothing-of a right of redemption. It is not pretended, that <em>Frayser </em>had insisted as a condition of the loan, that <em>Ransone </em>should not disclose the real character of the transaction. What, then, could have been <em>Rcmsone\u2019s </em>motive for suffering the instrument to be drawn as a bill of sale with a warranty, if he was to have the right to redeem ? He must have known the difference. And what was his motive for the various gratuitous falsehoods to numerous witnesses, to whom he repeatedly acknowledged he had <em>sold </em>the slaves to <em>Frayser </em>? for the dishonest act of refusing to pay the physician for his services to his own slaves ? for giving his bond for the hire of his own property? Was it that he did not know he could establish his rights ? His witnesses were his near connexions, and always at hand. Was it that he was in <em>Frayser11 s </em>power? According to his version'of the transaction, <em>Frayser </em>was in his power. For he had lent him 800 dollars for an indefinite period; he had taken a mortgage for his security with an indefinite power of redemption at any -time during life; and he had neither bond, note nor covenant for repayment. In the mean time, <em>Ransone </em>held the slaves; and, according to the ordinary course of things, had a right to the possession of them until default made in payment, which could not be while he lived. Moreover, there was nothing to bind him to an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>nual payments of interest, so that <em>Frayser </em>could neither recover from him principal nor interest during his life; while, according to <em>Ransone's </em>pretensions, he had a right to retain the property as his own during the sarne time. This state of things negatives, beyond question, the notion of his being in <em>Frayser's </em>power, and acting and speaking under duress of circumstances. But it likewise negatives, decisively, the pretension that this was a mortgage. It is not conceivable, that the parties, situated as they were, ever should have entered into such a contract: that <em>Frayser </em>ever could have lent his money, without any definite period of repayment, and without bond, note or covenant for its return; depending only upon a mortgage of a female slave and her children, and such a mortgage as never could be foreclosed as long as the borrower lived. This circumstance, then, and the absolute form of the bill of sale are, in my opinion, sufficient to give the stamp of falsehood to the appellant\u2019s pretensions, and to shew the extreme danger of permitting the written evidences of contract to be disarmed of all their obligation, by parol evidence of secret trusts and pretended equities of redemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
