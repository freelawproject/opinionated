Before the decree, there had been a contract to rent the land, and pursuant to that contract, a lease was made for a year, commencing the 25th of December 1834 and ending the 25th of December 1835. During this year, to wit, on the 10th of January 1835, sale was made under the decree. That sale being confirmed and a conveyance executed to the purchaser, Held, the purchaser must be considered complete owner from the date of the sale, and entitled to the rent which became due after-wards.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b341-11\">In such case, if the rent has been paid to the representative of the former owner, the purchaser may recover it from him by an action of <em>assumpsit </em>for money had and received.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-12\"><em>Assumpsit </em>in the circuit court of <em>Montgomery </em>county, by <em>Jacoi Cooper </em>against <em>John M\u2019C.

The defendant pleaded the general issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-13\">At the trial, the jury returned a special verdict, which found the following facts: 1. A decree made the 30th of October 1834, for the sale, on a credit of six, twelve and eighteen months, of a tract of land whereon <em>Peter Dyerle </em>resided at the time of his death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AbEX\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>2. That on the 10th of January 1835, sale was made <em>J </em>under the decree, and <em>Cooper, </em>the plaintiff, purchased the land for 3270 dollars, and gave bonds with sureties for the purchase money, the whole of which purchase money has since been paid. 3. That at the time of the sale, the land was in the possession of one <em>John G. Burgess, </em>to whom it had been rented by the defendant <em>Taylor </em>(to whom, as sheriff of <em>Montgomery, </em>the estate of <em>Dyerle </em>had been committed) for a year 'commencing the 25th of December 1834 and ending the 25th of December 1835. 4. That although the lease commenced after the decree for the sale, yet the contract was made with <em>Burgess </em>before the decree. 5. That the rent of <em>Burgess </em>was 210 dollars, and it has been paid by him to <em>Taylor </em>as administrator of <em>Dyerle, </em>although <em>Cooper </em>claimed it and gave notice to <em>Burgess </em>not to pay it. 6. That the sale was confirmed by a subsequent decree, and an order made directing a conveyance to <em>Cooper, </em>which was executed accordingly, and <em>Cooper </em>took possession of the land at the end of the year for which <em>Burgess </em>rented.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-8\">The circuit court being <em>of </em>opinion, upon the facts found, that the law was for the plaintiff, and the jury having, in that event, assessed the damages at 210 dollars with interest from the 25th of December 1835, judgment was entered accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-9\">To this judgment a <em>supersedeas </em>was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b342-10\">The <em>attorney general </em>and <em>Preston </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b342-11\"><em>Edward Johnston </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b342-12\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AbzF\">I have had not the slightest doubt of the right of <em>Cooper </em>the purchaser to the rent in question. The principles of the court, according to the english practice, I take to be clearly these: \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b342-13\">1. Where there is a sale by the master, and the property appreciates by the accidental falling in of lives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>or <em>by </em>other means, the court will only confirm the sale upon the terms of the purchaser\u2019s making compensation. <em>Davy </em>v. <em>Barber, 2 </em>Atk. 490. <em>Blount </em>v. <em>Blount, </em>3 Atk. 638. And in doing this, it but acts within the scope of its rights and powers; for the sale is not conclusive until confirmed, and justice to the owner of the estate demands that where there has been a material appreciation before confirmation, a resale should be directed unless the purchaser will make compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><em>2. </em>Where, after the sale and before confirmation, (as in the cases of <em>Ex parte Minor, </em>11 Ves. 559. and <em>Heywood </em>v. <em>Covington's heirs, </em>4 Leigh 373.) the property is destroyed or materially injured by flood or fire, the loss must fall on the vendor; for as, in the case of appreciation, the vendee will be charged with compensation, so, in the case of depreciation by destruction of part of the estate, he has.a fair claim to a deduction. Until the sale is confirmed, he is considered in <em>England </em>as having no fixed interest in the subject of purchase. 11 Ves. 559. Before it is confirmed, he is always liable there to have the biddings opened, and therefore <em>non constat </em>that he is a purchaser. <em>Anonymous, 2 </em>Ves. jun. 336. In case of loss he is therefore allowed a deduction. The practice with us has gradually departed from that of the english courts in some respects which it is not necessary here to\u2019set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">3. But, thirdly, where the sale is confirmed, that is, where both contracting parties (the purchaser and' the court) concur in ratifying the inchoate purchase, the confirmation relates back to the sale, and the purchaser is entitled to every thing he would have been entitled to if the confirmation and conveyance of title had been contemporaneous with the sale. <em>Anson </em>v. <em>Towgood, </em>1 Jac. &amp; Walk. 617. In this manner I think the several authorities are easily reconciled; and if this be so in <em>England, </em>I think it may be safely affirmed to be yet more unquestionable under our practice.</p>\n<p id=\"AsR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Taking these principles as fixed, the present case will be found to come within the last. In this case <em>Cooper </em>purchased under a decree giving a credit of six, twelve and eighteen months. His bonds are given payable in six, twelve and eighteen months <em>from the day of sale. </em>If he does not receive this rent, he will have no enjoyment of the estate until nearly twelve months \u2022 after the sale, so that he will have to pay his first bond several months in advance of his perception of the profits, and his twelve months bond wrill be a cash payment. This is neither just nor equal. The report having been confirmed, he must be considered complete owner from the date of the sale, and of course entitled to the rent becoming due after it.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">I have had much doubt, however, whether the remedy of <em>Cooper </em>was in the court of chancery, or at law. But upon much reflection, I think the action at law is maintainable. Before confirmation of the report, indeed, and while the cause is yet pending in the court of chancery, I am of opinion that to that tribunal alone can the purchaser resort for the adjustment of his rights and the \u00e9nforcement of his claim. Such was the case of <em>Crews </em>v. <em>Pendleton &amp;c. 1 </em>Leigh 297. and <em>Heywood </em>v. <em>Covington's heirs, </em>4 Leigh 373. But where the chancery cause is ended, or where at least, by the confirmation of the report and the execution of the deed to him, the transactions with the purchaser in that court are closed and at an end, I apprehend it is competent to him to assert in this equitable action his title to the rent paid over wrongfully to the defendant. I am therefore of opinion to affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The other judges concurring, judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
