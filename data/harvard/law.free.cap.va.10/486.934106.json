On the 20th of November, a motion is made to the county court for a continuance, on the ground that the defendant had been confined to his bed by sickness for some time previous, and was still so confined, so that he could not attend to the case in person and prepare himself for trial; and it is admitted by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel that such had been and still is the situation of the defendant. But a trial being nevertheless urged, the court is divided on the motion for a continuance, and the same being overruled, a verdict and judgment are rendered against the defen- - dant. Held, the county court erred in so ruling the defendant to trial, at the term next after the cause had been transferred to that court, and at which it was docketed in that court for the first time.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b510-10\">Parties may, by consent, make up the pleadings and issue in a case, and have it docketed in any court having jurisdiction to try such a case; and on the parties appearing before the court in which a case may be so docketed, and making no objection to the regularity of the docketing of it, that court may exercise jurisdiction over the case; and an objection to the jurisdiction of the court, made for the first time after the trial of the case and judgment therein, cannot he sustained. <em>Per Stanard, </em>J.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-11\">On the 21st of July 1834, <em>Samuel M\u2019Alexander </em>sued out of the office of the circuit court of <em>Floyd </em>county a writ of <em>capias ad respondendum </em>against <em>Samuel Hairston senior; </em>and at August rules 1834, the plaintiff filed his declaration. It was an action for slander. The general issue was pleaded in court on the 27th of September 1834, and after the entry thereof, the record proceeds as follows: \u201c But the judge being delicately situated in his relationship to the parlies, by consent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>the parties the trial of the issue is sent to the county court of <em>Floyd.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-4\">In the county court, on the 20th of November 1834, a motion was made for a continuance, on the ground that the defendant, who resided in the county of <em>Franlclin </em>at a distance of 20 miles from the courthouse of <em>Floyd, </em>had been confined to his bed by sickness for some time previous, and was still so confined, so that he could not attend to the case in person and prepare himself for trial. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel admitted that such had been and still was the situation of the defendant, but urged a trial. The court being divided on the motion, the same was overruled; and the defendant excepted to the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-5\">Whereupon the cause being tried, a verdict was found for the plaintiff for 250 dollars damages, and judgment rendered for the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-6\">Soon after the judgment, <em>Hairston </em>died, and <em>Joab Early </em>qualified as his executor. <em>Early, </em>in his character of executor, petitioned the judge of the circuit court of <em>Floyd </em>for a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment; and it was allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-7\">In the circuit court of <em>Floyd, </em>at April term 1835, the following entry was made: <em>il </em>The service of the writ of <em>supersedeas </em>being confessed, and the judge of this court being delicately situated by reason of his relationship to one of the parties, by consent of the parties by their attorneys, this cause is removed to the circuit superior court of law and chancery for the county of Montgomery.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-8\">On the 27th of May 1835, the circuit court of <em>Montgomery </em>reversed with costs the judgment of the county court of <em>Floyd, </em>and ordered that the cause be remanded to that court, to be dismissed, upon the ground that the said county court had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-9\">To this judgment, on <em>M\u2019Alexander's </em>petition, a <em>supersedeas </em>was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b512-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number><em>Preston </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b512-3\"><em>Taliaferro </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b512-4\">Stanard, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ASk\">Without deciding or even considering question whether the order of the superior court, made by consent of parties, remitting this case to the county court for trial, would <em>proprio vigore </em>place the case, in its then condition, in the county court for trial, notwithstanding an objection of one of the parties to the docketing of the case in the county court and to the jurisdiction of that court over it, I am of opinion that parties may, by consent, make up the pleadings and issue in a case, and have it docketed in any court having jurisdiction for the trial of such a case; that over a case so docketed, on the parties appearing before the court in which it may be so docketed, and making no objection to the regularity of the docketing of it, that court may exercise <em>jurisdiction; </em>and that the objection to the jurisdiction of the court, coming for the first time after the trial and judgment in the case, cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">I am further of opinion that it was too rigorous, under the facts disclosed by the exception, shewing the disability of the defendant, from the visitation of God, to attend to the defence of the case, to rule him in the court below to trial in the absence of his witnesses, at the first term of that court after the order remitting the case had been made; especially as it does not appear, that -under the order remitting the case to the county court, it had been docketed in that court at any time previous to the term at which it was tried, so as to enable the defendant, even if severe illness had not prevented him from making preparations for trial, to take out process to summon his \"witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">My opinion therefore is, that the judgment of the county court, and that of the circuit superior court reversing it and remanding the case to the county court to be dismissed for want of jurisdiction, are both of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>them erroneous, and ought to be reversed, with costs to the plaintiff in error in prosecuting his suit in this court. I am further of opinion that the superior court ought to have reversed the judgment of the county court; and as the original action did not survive, and the defendant therein was dead at the time the judgment was rendered in the superior court, and the action could not, on the remanding of the case to the county court, be revived, the reversing judgment of the superior court should have remanded the case to the county court with directions to enter an abatement by reason of the death of the original defendant <em>Hairston.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">The judgment of the court of appeals was entered in the following terms :</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The court (without deciding the question of jurisdiction arising in this case) is of opinion that the county court of <em>Floyd </em>erred in ruling the defendant to trial, at the term next after the cause had been transferred by the said circuit superior court to the said county court, and at which it was docketed for the first time; especially when it was proved and admitted that the defendant had been confined to his bed by sickness for some time previous, and was still so confined, so that he could not attend said court and prepare himself for trial. Therefore it is considered by the court, that the judgment of the circuit superior court of Montgomery, reversing the said judgment of the county court of <em>Floyd, </em>be affirmed, and that the defendant recover against the plaintiff his costs by him about his defence in this behalf expended. And the said <em>Samuel Hairston senior </em>having departed this life, and the court being of opinion that the action does not survive against his executor or administrator, it is ordered that this suit be abated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
