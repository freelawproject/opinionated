Upon an <em>insimul computasset, </em>with the testator. The defendants plead <em>non assumpsit, </em>and the act of limitations. Issue. Upon the trial of the cause, the defendants filed a bill of exceptions, stating, that they offered in evidence,'an account, which they proved to be in part, but not altogether in the hand-writing of one <em>Bower; </em>(who was once a clerk of the plaintiffs, afterwards a clerk of <em>Field, </em>the testator; and after his death, again clerk to .the plaintiffs): .And that the last charges in the said account, in the hand-writing of the said <em>Bower, </em>are dated after the death of <em>Field, </em>the testator. That the court rejected the evidence, \u201c Because the said account was headed and endorsed, <em>Freeland, Lenox Co. in account with Field &amp;f Murray, </em>from which it appeared to the court to be an account, drawn by the defendants against the plaintiffs, and not an account, furnished by the plaintiffs, or their clerk, to the defendants.\u201d The jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs in these words, \u201c <em>We of the jury find for the plaintiffs, and do assess their damages to one hundred and eighty-six pounds eight shillings and ten pence.\u201d </em>But the clerk in drawing up the orders, entered it thus, \u201c upon their oaths do say, that the defendants did assume upon themselves, in manner and form as the plaintiffs against them have declared, within five years next before the time of suing out the writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>of <em>capias </em>in this suit, and they do assess the damages of the plaintiffs, by occasion of the defendants\u2019 non-performance of those assumptions, to one hundred and eighty-six pounds eight shillings and ten pence.\u201d After which follows a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs, to be levied of the goods and chattels of the testator, in the hands of the defendants, to be administered. And thereupon the defendants appealed to the court of appeals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-4\">Since the appeal, an application was made to the district court to amend the entry in the order book, by the <em>true verdict </em>found by the jury: Which being granted, and the amendment ordered to be certified to the court of appeals, the same is now brought up thither by a writ of <em>certiorari.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b29-5\"><em>Wickham,, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeQ\"><em>Bower </em>was clerk to the plaintiffs when the last articles were added to the account; and therefore it ought to have been received as the account of the plaintiffs. The district court could not amend at a subsequent term. For it differs from a county court, as the judge signs the orders, when drawn up, as a proof of their verity; and no alteration can be made in them after the term has passed, <em>Co. Litt. </em>260; but much less after an appeal has been taken, and the cause has come to the appellate court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b29-6\">\n<em>Call, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ah\">The district court very properly rejected the account: for the clerk had no authority to give it out, and the plaintiffs have not signed it: But, at any rale, the clerk ought to have been produced in court, and examined as to the facts. The order book ought to have pursued the issue in framing the entry, 1 <em>Crompt. Prac. </em>270 : and this court may award a <em>duces tecum </em>to enable them to inspect the original verdict, and correct the misprision. For wherever there is any thing to refer to, the court has power to amend at common law, <em>Gilb. Hist. Com. Pl. </em>107. 3 <em>Black. Com. </em>301. 1 <em>Hal. Pl.

For they were all adopted by the act of 1753, <em>Old Firg.

No amendment of a misprision of the clerk could be allowed at common law, after the term in which it was committed, 2 <em>Vin.

That the error could not be corrected at a subsequent term of the court; and consequently, that the order made by the district court for amending the record, at another term, was not authorized by law. That therefore the judgment was to be reversed, and a new trial awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>The entry was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag\">\u201c The court is of opinion, that the district court did not err in refusing to permit the account stated, in the bill of exceptions filed in this cause, to have been offered by the appellees as evidence for them, to go to the jury; but that, as the jury did not try or find the fact put in issue by the parties in this cause, (which was the <em>assumpsit </em>of <em>John S. Field, </em>the testator of the appellants themselves, as found by the jury), there is error in the judgment of the district court, in not setting aside the verdict, and awarding a new trial of the issue: And this court is further of opinion, that the order made for amending the record, and altering the judgment entered on the said verdict, at another and subsequent term after the verdict was given, and judgment entered thereon fully drawn up, read and signed by the judge in open court, is erroneous, the said amendment, after the term, not being authorized by law. Therefore it is considered, that the said judgment be reversed and annulled, and that the said surviving appellant recover against the appellees the costs expended in the prosecution of the appeal aforesaid here. And it is ordered, that the said verdict, and the order for amending the record, be set aside, and that a new trial be had in the cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
