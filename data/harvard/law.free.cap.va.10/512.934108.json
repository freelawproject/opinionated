Such was the general rule, and this case formed no exception. There was nothing in the pleadings to shew that there was indeed any difference between the law of <em>Virginia </em>and that of the district of <em>Columbia; </em>and the court could not judicially take notice what the law of the district was, unless pleaded, or proved at the trial below. Assuming the law of <em>Virginia </em>as that which governed the case, there could be no doubt that the demurrer to the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>count was improperly sustained. The statute 3 and 4 Anne, putting promissory notes on the footing of bills of exchange, was never in force in <em>Virginia: </em>and our own statutes placed no other notes on that footing, than such as were payable and negotiable at one or other of our state banks. The promissory note in this ease was therefore a common law paper, not governed by the law merchant. On such a paper an action might be maintained without averring or proving a demand at the time or place, however particularly designated in the body of the instrument. For this he referred the court to the cases cited and commented upon by <em>Richardson, </em>J. in delivering his opinion in <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Young, </em>2 Bligh 426-9. These cases, and the authority of 1 Wms. Saund. 33a. and note 2. proved, he said, that in actions on such papers at common law, no special demand was required to be averred or proved, where there was an antecedent debt or duty; the <em>licet scepius requisitus, </em>and the institution of the suit, being a sufficient averment and demand, unless in cases where there was a collateral undertaking, or where the demand or request was specially required as a precedent condition. The case of <em>Sanderson </em>v. <em>Bowes, </em>14 East 500. was itself an authority on these points. In all such cases at common law, the objection, if it could be taken at all, was matter of defence by plea, and that plea must aver that the defendant was ready at the place &amp;c. and still is ready &amp;c. But admitting the law of the district of <em>Columbia </em>to govern the case, and that law to place the note on the footing of bills of exchange, still no special demand need be averred or proved. The case of <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Young </em>is supposed to decide otherwise. The manifest injustice of that decision, the character of the tribunal which made it, and the decided reprobation of the ablest judges both in <em>England </em>and the <em>United States, </em>as well as that of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>whole commercial world, are sufficient to overturn its authority. The house of lords could not be considered <em>here </em>as a body likely to be well versed in intricate questions of law. The weight of authority was manifggtiy against them in that particular case. They had referred the question to the twelve judges, and the result was that eight out of the twelve, possessing the most decided superiority in point of judicial ability, gave their opinions that as against the acceptor of a bill of exchange, on an acceptance payable at a particular place, there was no necessity to aver or prove a demand prior to the action. The acceptor was regarded <em>prima facie </em>as the debtor: it was upon this ground they proceeded: and it applies <em>a fortiori </em>to cases where the payee sues the maker,\u2014in other words, where the creditor sues his debtor. Conceding, for the sake of argument, that the note was brought within the influence of the decision in <em>Rowe </em>v. Young, yet the action, he insisted, was maintainable on the money counts. The note itself was <em>prima facie </em>evidence of money lent or advanced, and a recovery might on that ground be had on the count for money had and received. This doctrine was familiar to the court. <em>Meredith </em>v. <em>Chute, 2 </em>Ld. Raym. 760. <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Vaughan, </em>3 Burr. 1516. <em>Tatlock </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>3 T. R. 174. <em>Vere </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>Id. 182. <em>Minet </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>Id. 481. But the court below instructed the jury that such recovery could not be had on that count, or on the count for money lent. The plaintiff was moreover entitled to recover on the <em>insimul computassent </em>count, on evidence proving the note to have been given on a valuable consideration. It is true, there was only a single item of account, but it had been settled that an accounting or settlement between parties, though relating to but one item, might be given in evidence on the <em>insimul computassent </em>count. <em>Knowles and others </em>v. <em>Michel &amp;c. </em>13 East 249. 1 Chit.

He said that by the act of congress of February 1801 in relation to the district of <em>Columbia, </em>that part of the district ceded to the federal government by <em>Virginia </em>was put under the laws of <em>Virginia </em>as they then existed, and that part ceded by <em>Maryland </em>was put under the then laws of <em>Maryland. </em>3 Story\u2019s Laws U. S. 2089. The enquiry then is, what were the laws of <em>Maryland </em>upon this subject ? In <em>Lindo </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>1 Cranch 343, 4. (decided in February 1803) it is distinctly stated that the statute of 3 and 4 Anne, ch. 9. is in <em>Maryland </em>the law of the land, \u201cand that the courts of <em>Maryland, </em>in the construction of that statute, have always respected the adjudications of the english courts.\u201d It being ascertained that this instrument would be held in the district to be negotiable, this court, in passing upon it here, will also treat it as negotiable; and it being ascertained that'the courts of <em>Maryland </em>would apply to this paper the decisions of the english courts under the statute of Anne, this court will be governed by the same decisions, even if they were opposed (which they are not) by any decisions in <em>Virginia. </em>What then are the english decisions under the statute of Anne, applicable to the question here ? They will be found stated in a note of the reporter to <em>Head &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Sewell, </em>1 Holt 363. 3 Eng. Com. Law Rep. 130, 31. It is true that in <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Young, </em>2 Bligh 391. some of the english <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>judges doubted whether the. rule of that case should be applied to acceptors of bills of a particular kind. But there was very little if any doubt as to makers of notes payable, in the body of them, at a particular piace. Opinion of lord <em>Eldon, </em>p. 400. and of <em>Dallas, </em>J. p. 501. Certain it <em>is, that since </em>the decision of the house of lords, it is considered as settled in <em>England, </em>that where a promissory note is made payable, or bill .of exchange is accepted payable, at a particular place, it is necessary, in an action against the maker or acceptor, to aver and prove a presentment at the place. So it is stated by judge <em>Carr, </em>in <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Wills, </em>4 Leigh 116. If, then, there were any decisions the other way in <em>Virginia, </em>the court should nevertheless, in this case, follow the decision of the house of lords in <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Young. </em>But there are no such decisions in <em>Virginia. </em>In <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Wills </em>the point is merely adverted to, without any opinion being given upon it. And in <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Crouch &amp; Co. 5 </em>Leigh 522. though -some of the judges gave opinions upon the question, it was very properly left open. All then that the court \u2022has to do here, is to decide according to the law of the district of <em>Columbia; </em>the law of <em>Virginia </em>not having been settled otherwise. If, he said, the note was not sufficient by itself to sustain the first count, it was equally insufficient to sustain any other count. The instruction that the note, being given for prospective rent, was not sufficient under the <em>insimul computassent </em>count, was clearly right. For as that count can only be sustained upon a settlement of mutual accounts, and an acknowledgment on such settlement of a subsisting balance, the balance must be due at the time of the' settlement, which could not be if the rent was prospective.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b542-5\"><em>Harrison, </em>on the same side, strenuously insisted that \u00e9ven though the court should not consider the law of the district of <em>Columbia </em>as governing the case, still it \u25a0 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>should follow the decision of the house of lords in <em>Ro</em>we v. <em>Young, </em>sustained as it was by the two lord chancellors, and by the opinions of other able judges.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIrm\"><em>Robertson, </em>in reply, argued very fully the question whether the law of <em>Virginia, </em>or that of the district, should govern the case. He insisted that the law of <em>Virginia </em>should govern, but regarded the question as not important, unless it appeared that the law of the district differed from that of <em>Virginia, </em>which he said had not been shewn. The case of <em>Lindo </em>v. <em>Gardner, 1 </em>Cranch 343. he considered too vague to authorize the conclusion which it was cited to sustain. He went into a full examination of the case of <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Young, </em>the reasons on which it was founded, and the comparative weight of conflicting authority. It was the usage, he said, both here and in <em>England, </em>to institute such comparisons. Information is looked for from men in proportion to their capacity to give it. <em>Cuilibet in arte sua credendum est. </em>Viewed in this aspect, the opinions of the lords on questions of law were absolutely entitled to no consideration. They themselves, sensible of this, had usually acknowledged their ignorance by appealing to the judges learned in the laws. They had done so in this case, and afterwards rashly overruled the opinions of the great majority of the ablest of those judges\u2014 eight out of the twelve\u2014the minority being almost exclusively judges of the common pleas, of inferior ability. It was said, much weight was to be attached to the opinions of the two chancellors, <em>Eldon </em>and <em>Redesdale. </em>This would perhaps be true if it were a question of equity. But on a question at common law, we habitually resort to the king\u2019s bench as the ablest expounder of its principles. Chancellors are often more rigorous in their exposition of all laws than common law judges. If an interpretation be wanted according to the equity of the case, apply to a common law judge; if <em>stricti juris, </em>to a chancellor. The counsel for the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>pellees, founding themselves on lord <em>Eldon\u2019s </em>observations, had endeavoured to discriminate between bills of exchange and promissory notes, holding it as a settled rule that whatever might be thought of <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Young, </em>relating as it did to an action against the acceptor of a bill of exchange, demand &amp;c. must be proved in an action on a promissory note payable at a particular place. In answer to this, he referred to the remarks of <em>Richardson, </em>J. in <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Young, 2 </em>Bligh 429. and still -more particularly to the masterly judgment pronounced by <em>Bayley, </em>J. (p. 472.) whose authority on questions of mercantile law he considered superior to that of all the judges of the common pleas and all the lords put together. There was no distinction in <em>England, </em>he said, between bills of exchange and promissory notes, as regarded this question. But he especially asked the attention of the court to the cases themselves in which <em>the </em>doctrine relative to promissory notes is thought to be <em>settled\u2014Sanderson </em>v. <em>Bowes, </em>14 East 500. <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Bowes, </em>16 East 110. <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Bowes, </em>Id. 112. and the cases in the common pleas. They were all on a banker\u2019s cash notes payable <em>on demand </em>at his banking house. The demand, therefore, was essential to fix responsibility or give action. They were cases where the demand was expressly made a precedent condition : and lord <em>Ellenborough, </em>in <em>Sanderson </em>v. <em>Bowes, </em>distinguishes such cases from cases where the note was payable at a certain time, and he and <em>Bayley </em>and the other judges put their judgments expressly on that ground. So that these cases are by no means similar to that at bar; and the principle is one that no court will ever be disposed to extend to a new class of cases. <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Bowes </em>was decided without argument, and followed by <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Bowes, </em>in which the rigorous doctrine was qualified by holding demand excused where the plaintiff averred that the door of the banking house was closed. This question had undergone a full examination in our own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>country, and the principle established by the case of Rowe <em>v. Young </em>had been discountenanced by our courts. In <em>New York, </em>the most commercial state in the union, it had been repeatedly overruled. <em>Wolcott </em>v. <em>Van Santvoord, 17 </em>Johns. 248. <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>8 Cow. 271. These were decisions on promissory notes. They established that no demand was necessary prior to action. The same doctrine was held in <em>Massachusetts. </em>And in <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Crouch &amp; Co. </em>in this court, the president and judge <em>Cabell </em>expressed decided disapprobation of the judgment in <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Young.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b545-6\">The day after the argument, <em>Robertson </em>mentioned, that he had been informed the court of appeals of <em>Maryland </em>had disapproved the decision in <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Young, </em>and decided in the manner now contended for by him.

This opinion is sustained by eight of the twelve common law judges of <em>England, </em>in the case of <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Young, 2 </em>Brod. &amp; Bing. 165. 6 Eng. Com. Law Rep. 53.\u2014by the decision of the supreme courts of all the states in which it has been (as far as I am informed) adjudicated, as is shewn by the cases of <em>Foden &amp; Slater </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>8 Johns. 183. <em>Wolcott </em>v. <em>Van Santvoord, </em>17 Johns. 248. <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>8 Cowen 271. <em>Weed </em>v. <em>Houten, </em>4 Halst. 189. <em>Bowie </em>v. <em>Duvall, 1 </em>Gill &amp; Johns. 175. <em>Ruggles </em>v. <em>Patten, </em>8 Mass.

The cases furnish a firm foundation of authority for the opinion I have expressed.;, and the arguments of the judges in some of them furnish a full exposition of the principles of law, reason and justice by which it is sustained. It is perhaps a needless caution to say that this opinion does not em- \u25a0 brace the case of a note or acceptance payable, in terms, <em>on demand </em>at a particular place, without specification of time, or payable, in terms, on demand at a particular place, after the lapse of a specified time. In such cases it would probably be held that there is no default of the maker or acceptor until such demand be made: and consequently that no action would accrue to the payee until such demand should be made.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b547-5\">Brooke, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AmXn\">I was surprised, not at the ability (for of that we have had other examples) but by the earnestness with which this case was argued by the counsel of the appellees. Relying on the decision in the house of lords in the case of <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Young, </em>2 Brod. &amp; Bing. 165. they overlooked the cases decided in this country. In the case in the supreme court of <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>M\u2019 Connell, </em>13 Peters 136. they would have seen in the opinion of justice <em>Thompson, </em>who delivered the judgment of the court, the whole doctrine on the point before that court thoroughly examined, and all the eases in <em>England </em>and this country cited. The difference between the king\u2019s bench and common pleas on this point is very remarkable; the first holding that it was unnecessary to aver presentment of a bill of exchange at the time and place specified in the acceptance of the bill, to sustain the action by the holder; and the other, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>that without such averment and proof, the plaintiff not maintain the action. So also on a note in which the time and place are specified on its face. In the case before cited of <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>M\u2019 </em>Connell, a very pr0per notice is taken of the able discussion by the president of this court in the case of <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Crouch &amp; Co. 5 </em>Leigh 540. Though I differed with the court in that case, it was not on the question now before us, or the principle which ought to govern its decision. I differed with the president in thinking that the question as regarded the indorser (for there was no question as to the drawer of the note) was not the question of indemnity by the deed of trust, but a question of notice to the indorser that the note would be dishonoured when due, and that he would be looked to for payment. I thought (as will be seen by reference to my opinion) that the circumstances therein enumerated were full proof of notice, nor could I see that full indemnity by the deed of trust was material. I could not see that to the indorser, having full notice that the note would not be paid, the presentment of it at the time and place specified in it was of the smallest importance. I thought it of no more importance to him than the drawer, and that substance was sacrificed to technicality in holding a different opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\">I concur entirely in the opinion delivered by judge <em>Stanard </em>in this case, and in the entry agreed upon.</p>\n<author id=\"b548-4\">Tuckek, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AlFM\">The principal question which has been discussed in this case is, whether it is necessary, in a declaration on a promissory note against the maker, to aver a presentment and demand at the time and place specified on the face of the note for its payment ? This question was so fully examined by me in the case of <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Crouch &amp; Co. </em>5 Leigh 522. that I have only found it necessary to look again very narrowly into the grounds of the opinion there given, and to weigh the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>additional considerations which have been presented to the court in the able argument of this case. I have done so, and still adhere to my former opinion, that in an action against the maker of a promissory note, the plaintiff is under no obligation to aver in his declaration a presentment and demand at the place and on the day specified in the note for payment. The only consequence of his neglect to present is that the maker, if he was ready at the time and place to make the payment, may plead that matter in bar of damages and costs; but he must at the same time bring the money into court, which the plaintiff will be entitled to receive. A further consequence indeed might follow, if any loss had been sustained by occasion of his failure to present; but this must be set up as matter of defence. These principles are so ably sustained by a majority of the judges in the case of <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Young, 2 </em>Brod. &amp; Bingham 165. as to render unnecessary any farther attempt to fortify and support them. That case was indeed against the acceptor of a bill of exchange; but the decision as to him was founded upon the theory of bills of exchange, that he is the real debtor: which is undeniably the case with the maker of the note. In that case too, as in this, the declaration omitted the averment of demand at the time and place, and upon a demurrer for that cause, a majority of the judges were of opinion that the declaration was good.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">Much argument was used to prove that by the law of <em>Maryland </em>this note would stand upon the footing of bills of exchange, and that, as it was payable in that part of the district which is governed by the laws of <em>Maryland, </em>it must be so considered here. Besides, however, the defect in the case in not finding what the law of <em>Maryland </em>is (which we apprehend to be necessary if this cause is to be decided under it), it turns out upon examination, unpropitiously for the argument, that the court of appeals have solemnly decided the question in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>that state against the necessity of averring a presentment of the note at the time and place appointed for the payment, although it is conceded that promissory notes are there considered as standing upon the footing 0f 0f exchange. <em>Bowie </em>v. <em>Duvall, </em>1 Gill &amp; Johns. 175. If then the law of the place of payment governs the case, it must be decided against the defendant; and if the <em>lex loci contractus </em>prevails, the note is not commercial paper, and must be governed by those common law rules which regard the presentment at the time and place of payment not as a condition precedent to be performed by the creditor, but as a mere matter of arrangement, which, if not complied with by him, will enable the defendant to save the damages and costs, if he is punctual to the engagement on his part: but \u25a0he must bring the money into court; for that is necessary in the yet stronger case of a tender of the money by the debtor, and a refusal to receive it by the creditor. 6 Bae. Abr. 464. 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">According to my view of this case, then, the instruction given was erroneous; the demurrer to the second count should have been overruled, and judgment entered for the plaintiff on that count. I should therefore be of opinion to reverse the judgment, set aside the verdict, and (entering such judgment as the court below ought to have rendered) to overrule the demurrer, and enter judgment for the plaintiff on the second count, with an award of a writ of enquiry of damages, granting leave to the defendants to plead any other plea to the said count if they please. The cause should then go back for a new trial upon the other issues' and the writ of enquiry on the second count. My brethren, however, prefer .a somewhat different entry, which will accordingly be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The entry in the court of appeals was in the following terms r</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>\u201c The court is of opinion that the superior court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the second count of the declaration, and also in its instruction to the jury, that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover on the first count, because he had not proved presentment and demand of the note, at its maturity, at the office of discount and deposit of the bank of the <em>United States </em>in <em>Washington; </em>and that the said judgment is erroneous:\u201d Therefore judgment reversed, demurrer to second count overruled, verdict on the issue to the country set aside, and cause remanded to circuit court for a new trial of the issue to be had in conformity with the foregoing judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
