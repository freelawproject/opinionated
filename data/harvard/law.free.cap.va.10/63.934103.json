Cabell </em>was taken and filed in the cause. He stated, that he was employed (being then at the bar) to draw the tw7o deeds of the 21st August 1798. That <em>Gillespie's </em>conveyance of the land to <em>Philip Ryan </em>was the consideration, and the only consideration, for <em>Philip Ryan's </em>trust deed in favour of <em>Kippen SfCo. </em>it being understood and intended by all the parties that the payment of the debt due to <em>Kippen Sf Co. </em>should be a discharge of so much of the purchase money which <em>Philip Ryan </em>had con- . traded to pay. That affiant wras afterwards employed by <em>James Lyle senior, </em>a partner of the firm of <em>Kippen Sf Co. </em>to collect the debt for which <em>Philip Ryan </em>had thus-become bound; but that, entertaining strong doubts whether <em>Ryan </em>had derived any title to the land by the conveyance from <em>Gillespie </em>alone, after the death of <em>Bibb, </em>under the power of attorney executed to them both jointly, and, consequently, whether he was liable in equity for the debt secured by his trust deed, this affiant took no steps to collect the money from him, and even returned to him an <em>assumpsit </em>of third persons for the sum of <em>\u00a3 50. </em>w'hich he had delivered to this affiant, and which, when received, was to have been applied in part discharge of the claim of <em>Kippen Sf </em>Co.\u2014and advised him to bring a friendly suit in chancery, for the purpose of ascertaining whether he had acquired a good title to his land : but this suit was never brought, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>so far as affiant knew: and thus the matter rested until he left the bar in 1805. <em>Ryan </em>never questioned the justice of the demand against his father\u2019s estate, nor entertained the least doubt of his own obligation, at law or in equity, to pay the amount secured by his deed of trust, until this affiant communicated the doubt to him. Nor did he ever pretend that he had paid the debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-4\">The cause was heard on the 24th day of May 1823 ; when the court, being of opinion that the trust deed of the 21st of August 1798 gave priority to the demand of the plaintiff over that of the defendant <em>Higginbotham, </em>and that a resale of the land would probably be beneficial to those interested in the proceeds, decreed that the bond of <em>Marr </em>the purchaser at the former sale should be delivered up to him to be cancelled, and that unless the defendants should, within'six months, pay the plaintiff <em>\u00a3 </em>113. 1. 1. with interest from the 21st of January 1800 till payment, and his costs of suit, the marshal should proceed to sell the land for cash, and out of the proceeds pay to the plaintiff his debt, interest and costs aforesaid ; the surplus, if any, after defraying the expenses of sale, to be paid over to the defendant <em>Higginbotham. </em>The marshal was directed to report his proceedings to the court, in order to a final decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-5\">He accordingly reported that he had sold the land, on the 10th of January 1824, to <em>Roben Mitchell </em>the highest bidder for the same, at the price of 901 dollars; of which, after deducting the expenses of sale, there remained the sum of 874 dollars 62J cents, to be applied towards the satisfaction of the plaintiff\u2019s demand.

He alleged that he had discovered, and he accordingly charged, that the defendant <em>Philip Ryan, </em>the alleged debtor and mortgagor of <em>Lyle's </em>testator, did, previous to the year 1810,- by the hands of a certain <em>H. Rose, </em>fully discharge, pay and satisfy the mortgage debt in the proceedings mentioned, and that <em>Lyle\u2019s </em>testator did, by written documents, explicitly acknowledge such payment, and at the same time direct the dismission of a suit previously instituted against the said <em>Ryan </em>to foreclose the said mortgage. That these documents, consisting of letters written and statements furnished by <em>Lyle's </em>testator in his lifetime to a certain <em>Thomas S. M'Cleland </em>his counsel, were in the possession of <em>M'Cleland, </em>and complainant hoped to have the benefit of them upon the hearing, by a <em>subpoena duces team </em>directed to <em>M'Cleland, </em>unless they should be voluntarily furnished. The bill further charged, that the decree in favour of <em>Lyle </em>was pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>cured by fraud and collusion between <em>Lyle, </em>or his agent, and <em>Philip Ryan. </em>Wherefore this complainant prayed that the decrees in the former suits might be reviewed and reversed, and correct decrees entered according to the right and justice of the case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>ing terms: \u201cFee v. <em>Phil.

The letter of the 28th April contained <em>{inter alia) </em>the following passage: \u201cI observe the list of suits under your care; but what I want most is the situation they now stand in, the ability of the debtors, and the prospect of recovering, and when. To save you trouble, you have a list taken from your letter, with a blank side, that you may, opposite to each, mention the situation and circumstances of each, as far as you can get information ; and when you have annexed your notes, you will please return it to me, or send me a copy of it, with your observations.\u201d In the letter of June 29. 1810, the testator said : \u201c Our suits, <em>George Kippen 8f Co. </em>against <em>Philip Ryan, John Brown, </em>and <em>Henry Tennison, </em>were all ordered to be dismissed three years ago by mr. <em>Ogg. </em>It is strange they should have been continued on the docket. Mr. <em>Ogg </em>declares he positively ordered the dismission of those suits up- v wards of three years ago. It must have proceeded from neglect of the clerk that they were continued.

He relied upon the affidavit of judge <em>Ca-bell, </em>and the answer of <em>Philip Ryan </em>to the lastmentioned bill, as proving that so late as September 1821, the balance of the debt remained unpaid. He suggested that the letters of his testator, and the admission of payment, either did not relate to a suit for the mortgage debt now in dispute, but to some other suit against <em>Philip Ryan; </em>or else that the memorandum on the list of suits furnished to respondent\u2019s testator by <em>M\u2019Cleland </em>his counsel, which is now relied upon as evidence of payment, was placed opposite to the name of <em>Philip Ryan </em>by the mistake of <em>J. B. Ogg, </em>who was then the clerk of the testator, and so led the testator himself into the error which appears on the face of his letter of June 29. 1810. The statement in that letter and the list, he urged, must have been understood at the time as not applying to the suit of <em>George Kippen f Co. </em>against <em>Ryan </em>for the mortgage debt, or the error committed in that respect must have been afterwards explained to <em>M\u2019Cleland, </em>otherwise he would not have lent himself to the injustice of prosecuting that suit for the great length of time he was engaged in it before the final decree was obtained, especially as he had been so regardful of the pretended rights of <em>Ryan </em>and the complainant, as to disregard professional confidence; \u201c of which\u201d (it was .added) \u201c this respondent does not mean to be un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>derstood as complaining, for if it can be shewn that this debt was paid before, this respondent will refund the money he has received, with as much pleasure as the complainant will in that event receive it.\u201d The answer concluded with denying all fraud.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-4\">The letters and list before described were produced by <em>M\u2019Cleland </em>on the 23d of October 1830, in compliance with a <em>subpoena duces tecum </em>executed upon him. He submitted to deliver up the papers, if the court should be of opinion that he ought to do so, upon considering the statement made by him in relation thereto; which was, in substance, as follows\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-5\">In 1810, <em>M\u2019Cleland </em>received the two letters and the list of cases aforesaid, from <em>James Lyle </em>senior, for whom he was at that time counsel; and in compliance with the instructions of <em>Lyle </em>in his letter of the 29th of Ju\u00f1e, he did, as he verily believes, direct the clerk to dismiss the suits therein ordered to be dismissed. The suit against <em>Ryan, </em>bowmver, was not dismissed; probably (as the clerk had informed him) because, being on the chancery reference docket, it could not be dismissed without an order of the court. The letters and statement of cases, being supposed by <em>M\u2019Cleland </em>to be of ho further use, were thrown by him into an old trunk. <em>Lyle </em>died in 1S11; and from that time until 1821, there w'as no agent of the firm of <em>George Kippen f Co. </em>so far as <em>M\u2019Cleland </em>knew. During this period, the letters and statement aforesaid passed entirely out of his recollection. In 1821, a certain <em>Tarlton Saunders, </em>as the agent of <em>Lyle\u2019s </em>administrator, employed <em>M\u2019Cleland </em>to prosecute the claim of <em>George Kippen Sf Co. </em>against <em>Philip Ryan, </em>upon his mortgage; and <em>M\u2019Cleland, </em>having entirely forgotten the contents of the letters and list, did, as counsel for <em>Lyle\u2019s </em>administrator, institute the suit against <em>Higginbotham, Ryan </em>and others, and obtain the decree under which the mortgaged land was sold in satisfaction of that claim. Shortly after that sale, <em>Saun</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number><em>ders </em>requested <em>M\u2019Cleland </em>to make out a statement of his account against the elder <em>Ryle </em>for professional services ; to which he consented, though he regarded that account as long before settled and closed. ' In preparing this statement, he had occasion to refer to the contents of the old trunk; and among other old papers, he there discovered, much to his surprise, the two letters and the list of cases before mentioned. He took the earliest opportunity of shewing these papers to <em>Saunders, </em>and requested him to examine into the matter, and to do justice to <em>Ryan, </em>if it should be found that he had been injured by the decree and sale. About a year afterwards, <em>M\u2019Cleland </em>and <em>Saunders </em>met at the house of <em>A. Austin, </em>whom they had chosen to settle the account of professional services, about which they had disagreed ; and <em>there M\u2019Cleland </em>again exhibited these papers to <em>Saunders, </em>and assured him, that if he or <em>Lyle </em>should not, within a reasonable time thereafter, explain <em>the </em>matter and rectify any mistake that had taken place in the proceedings against <em>Ryan, </em>he would advise <em>Ryan </em>of the existence and contents of the papers in question, and leave him to avail himself thereof in such manner as he might choose : to which <em>Saunders </em>made no reply. The letters, being vouchers for <em>M\u2019Cleland, </em>were used as such at the settlement, and their contents might thus have become known to the persons present, and communicated by some one of them to <em>Higginbotham </em>or his counsel. No such communication was made by <em>M\u2019Cleland </em>himself, or with his knowledge or consent; though some time afterwards, on being asked by the counsel for <em>Higginbotham </em>whether he had not such letters in his possession, he acknowledged that he had, and at the request of the said counsel, permitted him to take copies of them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-10\">The chancellor expressing the opinion that the conduct of <em>M\u2019Cleland, </em>as shewn by his statement, was entirely free from objection, and that the letters might pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>perly be filed in the suit, they were filed accordingly. \u201cAnd thereupon\u201d (the record proceeds) \u201cthe said <em>M'Cleland </em>in open court made oath to his said statement; and he and the counsel of the <em>plaintiff </em>agreed that the said letters, as well as the statement by the said <em>M'Cleland, </em>might be made use of upon the trial of this cause, in like manner as the deposition of the said <em>M'Cleland </em>with the letters annexed might be, if duly taken under a commission for that purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-4\"><em>Lyle </em>on the next day (October 24. 1830) objected to the admission of <em>M'Cleland's </em>statement as evidence, upon the ground that if the matter thereof could properly be evidence at all, the testimony of <em>M'Cleland </em>should have been regularly taken in the usual mode, upon notice to the adverse party; whereas here the examination was in open court, and without notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-5\">The cause was finally heard on the 1st of November 1830; when the chancellor, declaring that upon every principle of the court he must take <em>M'Cleland's </em>statement, and the letters therein referred to, so far as they might apply in favour of the plaintiff, as evidence,\u2014 decreed that <em>Lyle, </em>out of his testator\u2019s estate, if so much thereof he had, but if not, then out of his own estate, should pay to <em>Higginbotham </em>the whole amount of his judgments against <em>Ryan, </em>with his costs both in that court and in the county court of <em>Nelson; </em>and should pay into one of the banks at <em>Lynchburg, </em>subject to the future order of the court in the cause, whatever balance might remain of the amount he had received from the proceeds of the mortgaged land, including interest thereon from the 14th day of May 1824, when those proceeds were paid to him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b97-6\">From this decree <em>Lyle </em>appealed to this court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b97-7\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b97-8\"><em>Stanard, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b87-10\">He bad formerly been counsel for <em>James Lyle </em>senior, the testator of the appellant, and was afterwards examined as a witness in the controversy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AlyQ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Parker, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AjD\">I am of opinion that the chancellor , ought not to have decreed that the appellant should refund the sum of money received by him under the decree of May 1823, without further enquiry as to the paymem 0f the debt from <em>Ryan </em>to <em>George Eippen Sf Co. </em>by directing an issue, or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"AUV\">There are several circumstances in the case, even independent of the admissions of <em>Ryan, </em>which render it highly probable that the debt might not have been paid. If it was doubtful how far his answer was evidence against the appellee (who, in his bill of review, charges collusion and calls upon him to answer) he might, upon the trial of an issue, be examined as a wdt- \\ ness ; and on the same trial the books and papers of the firm of <em>George Kippen Sf Co. </em>might be produced, if required by the appellee, and would no doubt afford persuasive evidence the one way or the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">The letters referred to in the bill seem to me not to be sufficiently authenticated, for I regard <em>M\u2019 Cleland\u2019s </em>statement as no part of the case, and do not think that the answer of <em>Lyle </em>can be fairly considered as an ad- . mission of their genuineness. I am moreover doubtful how far* if genuine, they ought to be received in evidence. The disclosure of these letters by the attorney seems to me to have been without the consent of the client, and to some extent, at least, they were matters of professional confidence. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>4 .Munf. 273. If the order to dismiss a suit is not to be so regarded, the statement to an attorney that the debt has been paid is as much under the seal of professional confidence as any other communication. Nor does it appear that it was ever divulged before, unless wre receive <em>M'Cleland's </em>statement of what took place between <em>Saunders </em>and himself concerning the settlement before an arbitrator; and I think it clear that his evidence, taken at the bar of the court, without notice, and <em>at large </em>upon the hearing, ought not to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>received. <em>2 </em>Mad.

This may be admitted, and is perhaps consistent with the cases of <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>6 Ves. 280. and <em>Stratford </em>v. <em>Hagan, </em>2 Ball &amp; Beatt. 164. But there appears to me to be a striking difference between the production of such deeds, and the communication of any fact disclosed in professional confidence. The client himself could not be compelled to discover such communications, for if he could, the reason of the rule which is meant to allow unrestrained intercourse between client and attorney, would be violated, and its object frustrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">I therefore think that this decree ought to be reversed, and the case sent back with directions to order an issue to be tried before a jury, to ascertain the fact of the payment of the debt by <em>Ryan, </em>in the trial of which issue the circumstance that the suit was directed to be dismissed may, if not admitted, be proved; leaving to the judge the questions which may arise on the admissibility of other testimony.</p>\n<author id=\"b99-7\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AVr\">The first and most important question in this case is whether the letters from <em>Lyle to M\u2019Cleland </em>are evidence in the cause. The first objection to them is based upon the rule that an attorney at law will not be permitted to violate professional confidence. But several things must concur to bring a case within the rule. The matter must have been one of <em>professional confidence: </em>it must have been at the time a secret, for if known to all the world there is no reason for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>farther concealment: the disclosure must be <em>in invitwn, </em>as ^ respects the client: and lastly, if it might be forced from the client by the rules of the court, pari <em>ratione </em>it may be drawn from the attorney. In this case&gt; every one of these ingredients is wanting. First, the direction by letter to dismiss the suit was not a matter of professional confidence, though it might have been made so, if, before compliance, it had been countermanded. For an order to dismiss a suit requires an act to be done which in itself implies, and in its execution operates, a disclosure of the order itself, since the attorney could not properly dismiss without authority. It was not, then, a'matter of professional confidence. Secondly, if it had been, it had long before been divulged at the settlement between <em>M'Cldand </em>and <em>Samiders </em>before an arbitrator. Thirdly, it is not <em>in invitum; </em>for the defendant, in his answer, expressly disavows any complaint of disregard of professional confidence. \u201cFor,\u201d says he, \u201cif it can be shewn that this debt was paid before, this respondent will refund the money he has received, with as much pleasure &amp;c.\u201d The obvious meaning of which is, that he will feel pleasure in repaying what justice demands, if it can be shewn he had improperly received it, even though the fact should be ascertained by a breach of professional confidence. Lastly, if the plaintiff would have had a right to demand the production of these letters had they been in the possession of the defendant, (about which there can be no reasonable doubt) it would seem perfectly clear that the attorney might with propriety produce them, and indeed be compelled to do so. The case of <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>before lord <em>Eldon </em>in 1801, 6 Ves. 282. seems indeed to hold a different doctrine. But the case is unsatisfactorily reported; and in 1816, in the case of <em>Fenwick </em>v. <em>Reade, 1 </em>Merivale 114. the same able judge decided, that an attorney submitting to produce title deeds of his client in his pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>session as the court should direct, might be called upon to produce them, if the principal could himself have been called upoif to do so. This seems to me good sense and sound reason. I am therefore of opinion, that in reading these letters, there is no violation of that professional confidence which it was the object of the rule to respect and maintain.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">Another objection has been made at the bar, to the sufficiency of the proof that these letters were written by <em>Lyle. </em>If <em>M\u2019 Cleland\u2019s </em>affidavit be read, there can be no doubt of it. It is objected to, however, for want of notice &amp;c. and this objection may be sound, unless we take it that the <em>defendant </em>(not the <em>plaintiff, </em>as the record has it, which would be wholly unmeaning) had agreed to read it as if regularly taken. This I doubt whether we can do, however strongly we may suspect that there is a mistake in the record. But <em>M\u2019 Cleland's </em>testimony seems to me unnecessary, as the defendant does not contest or call for proof of the letters, but endeavours to explain away the supposed mistake in them. In this ' state of the case I shall take them as proved, and the rather, as, in case of their rejection, the cause would necessarily go back for further proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Taking the letters as evidence, the result must be the affirmance of the decree. The presumption of payment from length of time is complete, and is sustained by plenary proof. The commencement of a suit to foreclose, the failure for nearly 20 years to file a bill, the order to dismiss the suit, the memorandum of the debt having been paid by <em>H. Rose, </em>leave the court no alternative but to presume the payment. The answer of <em>Ryan, </em>being no evidence, between the contending incumbrancers, cannot affect this conclusion. And the testimony of judge <em>Cabell, </em>so far from shewing that the debt was due, furnishes perhaps a clue to the order of dismission. Strongly impressed with the injustice of the demand against <em>Philip Ryan, </em>who had never got a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>good title for the land, he may have communicated his v\u2019ews to Lyle, who may have acquiesced in them,* and sought and obtained payment in some way from' the heir of the original debtor. So it is, we have <em>Lyle's </em>segment nearly thirty years ago, that the debt was paid; and it is now too late to ascertain the mode and circumstances of the payment. The decree must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b102-3\">Brooke, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ADn\">concurred ; and further held, that the statement of <em>M'Cleland </em>was competent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
