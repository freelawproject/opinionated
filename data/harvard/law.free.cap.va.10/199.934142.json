The complainant, disclaiming any intention of seeking to recover the slaves for the purpose of holding them in bondage, insisted on having them surrendered to him, that he might, as soon as practicable, send them to <em>Liberia, </em>whither he believed they were intended by the testator to be sent.

This witness mentioned farther, that it was known generally in the neighbourhood that <em>John M\u2019Phail </em>of <em>Norfolk </em>was the agent of the american colonization society, and the testator told him that he had talked to <em>M\u2019Phail </em>upon the subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Al2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number><em>Thomas G.

Its admission would transcend the principle laid down by chancellor <em>Kent </em>in <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Mann\u2019s ex\u2019ors, </em>1 Johns. Ch. Rep. 234. For here it is not attempted to prove that <em>M\u2019Phail </em>is agent of the new colonization society in <em>Africa: </em>but the object of the evidence is to shew that the society itself is erroneously described; that a society was intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>which is known by another name; and that <em>M'Phail </em>is the agent of that other society. He referred, for the general doctrines on this subject, to 1 Roper on Legacies 131, 3. 140, 42. 146, 7. and Powell on Devises 476, 7. 477, 8. 490. 497. and to <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>6 T. R. 671. to shew, that evidence of the testator\u2019s declarations is inadmissible. As to the testimony of <em>Broughton </em>that <em>M'Phail </em>advertised as agent, that, he said, was only evidence of <em>M'Phail's </em>own acts. If <em>M'Phail </em>was the agent described and intended, the fact might have been proved by other and better evidence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AT\"><em>Robinson, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aad\">This court has decided that a bequest of slaves to a particular person by name, in trust to send them to <em>Africa, to </em>the colony at <em>Liberia, </em>is a valid bequest. <em>Elder </em>v. <em>Elder's ex'or, </em>4 Leigh 252. Here, however, the object only appears in the description of the person to whom the bequest is made. The bequest of the slaves is to the legatee, to do as he pleases with them. And the only question is whether parol evidence may be received to ascertain what particular individual fills the description. The position that parol evidence is not to be let in except in cases where there is a latent ambiguity, though often laid down, is unsound: such evidence is admitted in other cases, in which there is an ambiguity which cannot otherwise be removed, and which may, by these means, be clearly and satisfactorily explained. \u201c When\u201d (says sir <em>Thomas Plumer) \u201c </em>the person, or the thing, is designated on the face of the instrument by terms imperfect and equivocal, admitting either of no meaning at all by themselves, or of a variety of different meanings, referring tacitly or expressly, for the ascertainment and completion of the meaning, to extrinsic circumstances, it has never been considered an objection to the reception of the evidence of those circumstances, that the ambiguity was patent, manifested on the face of the instrument.\u201d <em>Colpoys </em>v. <em>Colpoys, </em>Jacob 451. 4 Cond. Eng. Ch. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Rep. 216. Evidence will be received to fill up the description of the legatee and shew who was the person intended. 3 Starkie on Evid. title <em>Parol Evidence, </em>p. 1021. and title <em>Will, </em>p. 1695. <em>Starhie </em>lays it down as a general rule that difficulties arising in the application of the terms of a will, from imperfection in the terms of description either of the party to whom the estate is given or of the estate, may be removed by the aid of extrinsic evidence, even although no part of the description be perfectly correct; p. 1021. One of the strongest cases cited by him to this effect is <em>Beaumont </em>v. <em>Fell, </em>2 P. Wms. 141. where there was a mistake in both .the Christian and sirname. In <em>Price </em>v. <em>Page, </em>4 Ves. 680. the legacy was to <em>\u201c-Price, </em>the son <em>of-Price.\u201d </em>The claimant was the son of a niece of the testator, and the name of his father and of his grandfather was <em>Price. </em>The question was as to the validity of the bequest, and, if valid, whether the claimant or his father was intended. By the evidence it appeared that the testator contributed to the maintenance of the claimant, placed him with an attorney, and said that he would provide for him, and that he had left him something by his will. Upon this evidence the claimant was declared entitled to the legacy. So here, there is evidence that <em>Maund </em>said he wished the slaves sent away by the new colonization society, by <em>John M\u2019Ph&amp;il </em>taking charge of them; that he had so directed in his will; that he had talked to <em>M\u2019Phail </em>upon the subject: and there is, besides, evidence that <em>M\u2019Phail </em>was knowm generally in the neighbourhood as the agent of the american colonization society. The following additional cases were cited and .commented upon: <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Coney, </em>6 Ves. 42. <em>Careless </em>v. <em>Careless, </em>1 Meriv. 383. 19 Ves. 601. <em>Still </em>v. <em>Hosle &amp;c. </em>6 Madd. Ch. Rep. 192. <em>Eade </em>v. <em>Eade &amp;c. </em>5 Madd. Ch. Rep. 118. <em>Beachcroft &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Beachcroft &amp;c. </em>1 Madd. Ch. Rep. 430. <em>Lord Woodhouselee </em>v. <em>Dalrymple, </em>2 Meriv. 419. Upon these autho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>rities (it was argued) the case is plain upon the will, in connexion with the evidence of <em>Richard Kain. </em>But even if that evidence were out of the case, and if this were a devise instead of a legacy, the description would be sufficiently accurate. There is the american colonization society for colonizing persons in <em>Africa, </em>and <em>M\u2019Pfiail </em>is the agent of it. There does not appear to be any other colonization society of any similar description. It would be too much to infer that the testator meant the agent of a society which does not exist. It must rather be intended that he meant the agent of the american colonization society, though there be some little inaccuracy in the description. <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Mayor of Rye, </em>7 Taunt. 546. 2 Eng. Com. Law Rep. 213. 1 Powell on Devises 338. <em>Caine </em>v. <em>Roche, </em>7 Bingh. 226. 20 Eng. Com. Law Rep. 111. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Danvers, 7 </em>East 299. It thus appears that even in a devise, where a person is clearly made out to be the individual meant, and there is no other to whom it may be applied, that person will take. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-7\"><em>Harrison, </em>in reply. The ground taken on behalf of the appellee is in striking contrast with the evidence in the cause. It is contended that under the will the appellee is to take the slaves as bis absolute property, and to support his claim, he adduces evidence which shews that the testator never intended he should take as owner. After the appellee has himself adduced this evidence, a court of equity should not permit him to recover these slaves for his own use. The evidence shews an intent to emancipate, and in a proper case it may be determined whether or no the emancipation has been made in a way which is valid under the statute.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b229-8\">Per curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AoS\">The decree is to be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
