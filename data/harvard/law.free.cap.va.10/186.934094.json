This execution was levied by the marshal upon a part of the slaves mentioned in the deed, and the sale thereof being forbidden, the plaintiff gave an indemnifying bond : whereupon the sale was made in January 1830, and the defendant, through her agent, purchased some of the slaves and obtained possession of the same. The slaves mentioned in the declaration are the slaves of which the defendant so obtained possession, or the increase of the females thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>The circuit court instructed the jury that if they should find, from the evidence in the cause, that the said <em>Jesse Withers, </em>after executing the deed of the 23d of October 1821, continued to hold possession of the said slaves, from the date of the said deed until they were seized and sold by the marshal, by no other title except such as may be inferred from the terms of the said deed, the statute of limitations is a bar to the recovery sought to be had in this action, and therefore they should find a verdict for the defendant, although this suit was instituted within five years after the said sale. To this opinion the plaintiffs excepted, and their bill of exceptions set forth the evidence as above stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-4\">A verdict being found for the defendant, judgment was rendered upon the same; and thereupon a <em>supersedeas </em>was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b213-5\">The cause was argued in this court by <em>William Green </em>and <em>Robert E. Scott </em>for the plaintiffs in error, and <em>Leigh </em>and <em>Patton </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-6\">The counsel for the plaintiffs said, that if the proposition laid down by the judge of the circuit court be true, it must be either because the lapse of five years would enable the mortgagor himself to defeat the mortgagee\u2019s action of detinue, under the statute 1 Rev. Code, ch. 128. ^ 4. p. 488. or because his creditors would thereby obtain a right to satisfaction out of the property, under the statute Id. ch. 101. \u00a7 2. p. 372.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-8\">I. The provision of the statute of limitations in relation to detinue is analogous to the provision relating to a right of entry, or, in other words, to the action of ejectment. This analogy is so strong, that as the defendant in ejectment need not plead the statute, Blansh. on Lim. 170. 171. <em>Clay </em>v. <em>Ransome, </em>1 Munf. 454. and as his possession gives him a title on which, as plaintiff, he might recover, <em>Stokes </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>2 Salk. 421. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Cooke, </em>7 Bingh. 346. so in detinue the defendant need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>not plead the statute, <em>Elam </em>v. <em>Bass\u2019s ex\u2019ors, </em>4 Munf. 301. and his possession gives him a title on which, as plaintiff, he might recover; <em>Newby\u2019s adm\u2019rs </em>v. <em>Blakey, </em>3 Hen. &amp; Munf. 57. Now in <em>England </em>it is settled, and seems never t0 have been seriously doubted, that as between a mortgagor of real estate in possession and his mortgagee, the statute of limitations does not run, not' even in regard to a term for years or chattel interest; <em>Hatcher </em>v. <em>Fineaux, </em>1 Ld. Raym. 740. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>5 Barn. &amp; Aid. 687. 1 How. &amp; Ry. 340.\u2014because, under such circumstances, the mortgagor is sometimes tenant for years, and sometimes most strongly tenant <em>at will, </em>to the mortgagee. <em>Smartle </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>1 Salk. 245. <em>Keech </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>1 Dougl. 22. <em>Patridge </em>v. <em>Bere, </em>5 Barn. &amp; Aid. 604. and a note at the end. Indeed the same point has been already decided, on the same reasoning, by the court of appeals in <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>2 Rand. 93. The reasoning is equally applicable to mortgages of personalty. The mortgagor of personalty, in possession of the subject, holds by the mortgagee\u2019s consent, and not adversely to him, and may be considered in the light of a loanee, between whom and the lender the act of limitations never runs. <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Stainback, </em>5 Munf. 305. The argument from analogy is aided by the decision of the court of appeals in <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Norvell, </em>1 Wash. 14. where the principles of the law of mortgages in relation to realty were applied to the redemption of mortgaged slaves held by the mortgagee after five years had elapsed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AU-\">II. There is in the english lav/ nothing similar to the proviso contained in 1 Rev. Code, ch. 101. \u00a7 2. p. 372. This enactment was intended to apply to the case of persons who set up a claim to property apparently belonging to the person in possession, under pretence of having lent that which before belonged to them to the person so in possession, or of having given it with certain reservations, and not to deeds of trust or mortgages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>of personalty, where the party in possession is the person to whom the property originally belonged, and to whom it still belongs in equity, subject to the lien ereated by the mortgage or deed of trust. But if these are to be considered cases within the act, on the ground that the party holding the <em>legal </em>title suffers the party who has the <em>equitable </em>title to remain in possession, then what the act requires is sufficiently evidenced by the recording/of the mortgage, which shews that the possession of the mortgagor is by virtue of the equitable. title remaining in him. Unless this construction be adopted, mortgages and deeds of trust <em>upon slaves </em>to secure the payment of money will be inadequate securities after five years from the time of their being recorded ; contrary to the universal understanding of the country. And this idea receives confirmation from the act requiring all deeds of trust and mortgages whatsoever to be recorded. It may be said that the loan act does not apply to deeds of trust and mortgages for the payment of money, but only to a deed containing such provisions as the mortgage in this case. But it seems to defy the utmost ingenuity to fake a mortgage or deed of trust for the payment of the most clearly liquidated sum, on demand, out of the statute, if it be held to apply to any mortgage or deed of trust at all, though its object be to save the mortgagee from the most complicated liability, which will require the longest time to settle. The question is not as to the simplicity of the transaction, but whether the transaction is a loan within the act; and there must necessarily be the same determination in both cases, as it is a loan in both or in neither. But, in truth, the debt secured by the mortgage or deed of trust may be payable by instalments, some of which may not be due in 20 years; and yet, in the absence of fraud, such a deed would be good.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-4\">For the defendant in error it was said, that this mortgage contains no provision for the mortgagor\u2019s remain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>ing in possession. The right of possession of the mortgagees, as well as their legal title, was as complete immediately as at any time afterwards, and they might have brought their action of detinue against the mortgagor the day after the execution of the mortgage, as well as 13 years afterwards. <em>Faulkner\u2019s adm\u2019x </em>v. <em>Brockenbrough, </em>4 Rand. 245. The right of action having existed so soon as the mortgage was made, the time began then to run, and possession from that time for five years operated to give a legal title. <em>Newby\u2019s adm\u2019rs </em>v. <em>Blakey, </em>3 Hen. &amp; Munf. 57. <em>Elam </em>v. <em>Bass\u2019s ex\u2019ors, </em>4 Munf. 301. These cases establish that a possession of five years during which the owner had right of action, without any oth'er evidence that the possession is adverse, will operate to give title, unless the other party shall prove that there was some agreement as to the possession, consistent with his title, which deprived him of the right to sue. In short, the possession of personal property is always presumed to be under claim of title, and adversary to all the world. This principle is affirmed by lord <em>Eldon </em>in <em>Lady Arundel </em>v. <em>Phipps, </em>10 Ves. 444. The supposed analogy between the limitation of the action of detinue and of a right of entry does not exist. The nature of the subjects is essentially different. Personal chattels pass by delivery j real estate by deed only, and in this country the deed must be recorded. Possession is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of title to personal estate; not so as to real. A very large portion of the personal property in the country, including slaves, is held by its owners with no other evidence of ownership than the possession of it. From the nature of the subject, then, the tenant or occupier of real estate mortgaged by himself may well be presumed to hold by permission of the mortgagee, because it would be a violent presumption to suppose that he ousted his mortgagee; whereas, in the case of personal chattels, there is nothing in the policy of the law to require such an inference. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>even in respect to mortgages of real estate, the authorities do not sustain the proposition in the broad terms in which it is contended for on the other side. Generally the cases have been between the mortgagee and lessees of the mortgagor, without any question arising upon the lapse of time. There is, however, one case cited <em>(Hatcher </em>v. <em>Fineaux, </em>1 Ld. Raym. 740.) in which it seems to be admitted by lord <em>Holt </em>that a possession of 20 years, unattended by any act recognizing the mortgagee\u2019s continued title, would, under the statute of limitations, bar the mortgagee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-3\">II. If the mortgagor be a tenant at will or at sufferance, it is in effect the case of a loan, and then the question arises under the clause in the statute of frauds concerning loans.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-4\">The general policy of this statute undoubtedly is to prevent any person in possession by permission of the real owner from holding out false colours to the world, so as to deceive creditors ; and no matter what is the form of the arrangement by which the legal owner reserves to himself the right to resume possession, and to the possessor the privilege of holding subject to that right, unless the agreement be plainly spread upon the record so as to give notice to every body, the continued possession of five years is, by the statute, conclusive proof of fraud as to creditors. In this case, the mortgage might have contained such a declaration of loan, or permission of possession ; but there is nothing of the sort. It does not contain the provision, so common in deeds of trust and mortgages, that the grantor may remain in possession until default of payment or nonperformance of condition. And nothing less than such a clause will answer either the terms or the policy of the statute. The cases of <em>Gay </em>v. <em>Moseley, </em>2 Munf. 543. and <em>Garth's ex'ors </em>v. <em>Barksdale, </em>5 Munf. 101. shew how strongly and strictly this statute has been enforced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Apd\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>HI. The counsel for the defendant in error called the attention of the court to what they said was a clear misjoinder of parties. The plaintiffs had introduced a deed conveying a joint legal interest to <em>Mary S. H. j\u00a3ose </em>administratrix of <em>Robert Rose, Daniel Withers, Samuel Porter </em>and <em>Martin Porter. </em>Of these grantees, <em>Withers </em>died before the action was brought, and the action is not by the surviving grantees alone, but by the survivors and the representative of the decedent. Moreover, upon the death of the plaintiff <em>Martin Porter </em>pending the action, instead of its being abated as to him and proceeded in at the suit of the surviving plaintiffs, there was a revival in the name of <em>Martin Porter\u2019s </em>executor.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b218-5\">Stanard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARW\">I concur in the opinion that will be delivered by the president. Upon the questions presented by the exception to the instruction given by the court below, his reasoning, I think, fully sustains his conclusions, and any thing from me would be superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">I will, however, notice an objection, not taken in the court below, but urged in this, to the supposed misjoinder of the parties plaintiffs. It is presented thus. The exception taken to the opinion of the court touching the effect of the statute of limitations on the title to the property in question, shews that the plaintiffs offered in evidence a deed of mortgage, by W'hich the slaves sued for were conveyed to three of the plaintiffs and <em>Daniel Withers </em>the intestate of the other plaintiff <em>James S. Piclcett; </em>and the defendant in error here insists that it is hence manifest the plaintiff <em>Piclcett </em>does not claim <em>suo jure </em>and cannot join with the other plaintiffs, and that the court below should have entered judgment of nonsuit. This objection is not tenable. 1st, The deed of mortgage is before this court for the purpose only of presenting the question on which the court be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>low was called on to instruct the jury, and the matter in evidence from which that question arose. It cannot be looked to for the purpose of bringing in judgment other questions which might have been raised on it but were not, especially one incompatible with the instruction sought for by the party in whose behalf the objection is now made in this court; <em>Newsum </em>v. <em>Newsum, </em>1 Leigh 86. <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Wills, </em>4 Leigh 114. 2ndly, If there was a misjoinder of parties, it was not the duty of the court <em>ex officio </em>to notice it. The nonsuit could not be entered but at the instance of the defendant, and he cannot object here that that was not done in the court below, which was not asked for by him, and which could not have been done but at his instance. Srdly, Though this court should take cognizance of the objection, and could properly look to the deed of mortgage as the foundation of it, it ought not to sustain it. It does not appear when <em>Daniel Withers </em>died. If he died while the slaves were in the possession of <em>Jesse Withers </em>and consequently in that of the mortgagees, his representative became a tenant in common of the slaves wilh the surviving mortgagees, and was tenant in possession, as the possession of one joint tenant or tenant in common is the possession of all. Tenants in common may join in personalactions, and must join in a suit to recover an indivisible personal chattel. Litt. ^ 321. Co. Litt. 196b. 197a. 19Sa. So in replevin, tenants in common must join. Buller\u2019s N. P. 53. _ Co. Litt. 145. An executor possessed of a personal chattel, and losing possession thereof, may sue to recover it without stating his representative character. He may sue to recover it <em>suo jure; </em>and if he describes himself as executor, it may be treated as <em>descriptio persones. </em>There seems no stronger objection to the union of such an executor with surviving tenants in common, to recover their possession of a personal chattel, than there would be if he had become a tenant in common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>by any other title. If, because one tenant in common of an indivisible chattel is an executor, he is disabled from joining in the action, then, as the other cannot she alone for the entire thing, both would be deprived of remedy to recover the specific property.</p>\n<author id=\"b220-9\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"A7X_\">Upon the first question made in this case, there can be no reasonable doubt. It is contended that the demand of the plaintiff is barred by the statute of limitations; and as the suit was commenced within five years after the seizure and sale of the slaves, the position can only be maintained on the hypothesis that the possession of <em>Withers </em>the mortgagor was adverse to the mortgagees. But this hypothesis is contrary to every notion of a mortgage, and of the relations of mortgagor and mortgagee. Whether the mortgage be of real or of personal property, the retaining possession by th\u00e9 mortgagor is never looked upon as adversary to the mortgagee. If the subject be real, he is looked upon as a tenant at sufferance, whose possession is never held adversary to his landlord: if it is personal, he retains the possession from the implied character of the transaction. It is, in its nature, but a charge\u2014a lien or incumbrance upon the property, for the security of the payment of money, or the performance of conditions (as in this case) at a future day. Until that time, it is implied, and sometimes it is so expressed, that possession shall remain with the mortgagor. Were it otherwise, it would' be the case of a <em>pledge, </em>not of a mortgage. Were it otherwise, the transaction might be void for failure to deliver possession, under the doctrine of <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Harden, 2 </em>T. R. 587. But whatever doubts might exist in <em>England </em>as to this matter (see <em>Ryall </em>v. <em>Rolle, </em>1 Atk. 165.) they no longer exist here. In <em>Clayborn </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>1 Wash. 177. this court held that a mortgage of personalty, if duly recorded, was valid although the mortgagor retained possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>of the property. This decision is again recognized in <em>Glasscock </em>v. <em>Batton, </em>6 Rand. 78. And in the case of <em>U. States </em>v. <em>Hooe, </em>3 Cranch 73. 88. chief justice <em>Marshall, </em>delivering the opinion of the court, asserts the same principles. After referring to the case of <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Russel, </em>1 Cranch 310. as to absolute bills of sale, he says : \u201c But the difference is a marked one between a conveyance which purports to be absolute, and one which, from its terms, is to leave the possession in the vendor. If in the latter case the retaining of possession was evidence of fraud, no mortgage could be valid. The possession universally remains with the grantor, until the creditor becomes entitled to his money, and either chooses or is compelled to exert his right.\u201d In <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Russel, </em>1 Cranch 310. 316. he also says, \u201c The recording acts do not comprehend absolute bills of sale among those where the title may be separated from the possession, and yet the conveyance be valid if recorded implying thereby, that a recorded mortgage of personalty would be valid though the mortgagor retained possession. All this can only be upon the supposition that the retaining of possession is consistent with the true character of the deed, and with the universal understanding that the mortgagor is to hold the possession by the permission of the creditor, until he makes default. The holding possession at the will of the creditor is then not adversary but permissive, and no protection under the statute of limitations can ever be acquired from such holding, until, by lapse of time, payment is presumed ; and when that is done, the possession is taken to be adversary from the supposed date of payment, or a release is presumed to have been executed by the mortgagee, by reason of the discharge of the demand or the fulfilment of the stipulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">But though, by the character of the transaction, the mortgagor is permitted to retain possession at the will of the mortgagee, he does not stand upon the footing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>a loanee under the statute of frauds. He holds not by loan, but, by the character of the stipulation between the parties, his original possession remains undisturbed. No creditor or purchaser is deceived or defrauded. It *g \u00bfjuty 0f the party who would trust the mortgagor on the credit of the property thus left in his possession, to look to the record; and there he would see, not indeed a recorded loan, but a recorded mortgage of the property itself. I am of opinion, therefore, thaf the second point made in the cause is unsustained, and that the defendant is not more protected by the statute of frauds than by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Lastly, it is objected that in this case there is a misjoinder of persons claiming in their representative character, with others claiming <em>suo jure. </em>Whether the fact be so or not is matter of doubt, as the words indicating the representative character have been possibly used merely as <em>descriptio persona. </em>If we could refer to the mortgage upon this point (which I doubt) we should find indeed that the executor of one of the mortgagees is plaintiff. But still, as the point was not made in the court below, and as the objection may be more properly made upon the subsequent trial, if the exhibition of the title shall sustain it, I do not think we can notice it here. It would conflict with the principle settled in <em>Newsum </em>v. <em>Newsum, </em>1 Leigh 86. and <em>Barrett </em>v. Wills, 4 Leigh 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">There is however, I think, one error in the proceedings, which this court should correct. It is the revival of the proceedings in the name of <em>Lewis Porter. </em>The law on this subject I take to be, that if the parties were joint tenants, the remedy survived, though under our statute the right did not (see Gow on Partn. 172. 173. 174.); and so the cause ought to proceed in the name of the survivors. And as to tenants in common, they may and must join in an action for the recovery of an indivisible subject, 3 Bac. Abr. 705. but if one dies, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>remedy survives; Co. Litt. 189a. And this from ne&lt;-1 \u201e , , - . . cessity; for the executor of the decedent cannot join with the survivors, since the plaintiffs would then claim by several rights and titles, and if they failed, the judgment against them would be several. Moreover, the subject of the action being one and indivisible, the wrong is of course a joint wrong, and the remedy is therefore joint and consequently survives. The <em>scire facias </em>then was improvidently awarded, and should be set aside, together with the proceedings thereupon.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">Judgment reversed with costs, verdict set aside, and cause remanded for a new trial, <em>\u201c </em>on which the instruction given on the former trial is not to be repeated.\u201d And order awarding <em>scire facias, </em>and all the proceedings thereon, set aside, and <em>scire facias </em>quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
