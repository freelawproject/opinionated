She remained a widow about a twelvemonth, and then married <em>William Morris. </em>She lived his wife till 1833, and then died. During all this time, no demand of the debt due by the bonds was ever made. But <em>Morris </em>having taken administration of his deceased wife\u2019s estate, and being unable to maintain an action at law on the bonds by reason of the obligor being one of the executors of the obligee, exhibited a bill in chancery, in the circuit superior court of <em>FredericJc, </em>against <em>John BaJcer, </em>the obligor, to enforce payment of the debt due on the bonds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-5\">The bill was exhibited in 1835. After setting forth the facts above stated, and alleging that the debt due upon the bonds had never been paid, and that the defendant, during the year of his sister\u2019s widowhood, had requested her to get them from the executor of her first husband <em>Stover, </em>saying that he might be pressed for the money, and could pay it more conveniently to her,\u2014 the bill stated various reasons to account for the long delay to demand payment of the debt, and to repel the presumption of payment arising from lapse of <em>time; </em>namely, that mrs. <em>Morris, </em>before her first marriage, was unwilling to enforce payment of the debt from her brother by harsh measures; that after her marriage with <em>Stover, </em>he forbore to demand the debt, because he was wealthy and did not want the money, and because the defendant <em>BaJcer, </em>soon after his father\u2019s death, brought a suit in chancery against his coexecutor and all his co-legatees, <em>Stover </em>and wife among the rest, to recover a large sum of money which he claimed as due to him from his father\u2019s estate, for services rendered by him to his father in his lifetime, which suit was pending till November 1818, when the bill was dismissed, shortly before <em>Stover's </em>death; that <em>Stover </em>left his widow so well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>provided for, that she did not want the money during her widowhood <em>; </em>and that the plaintiff, after he married her, was unwilling to go to law with his brother in law, especially as it would have been very unpleasant to bis wife\u00a1 whose mind was somewhat affected, even before she became insane, and for the last five years before her death, she was actually of unsound mind. And the bill called upon the defendant to answer and say, whether or no he had paid the debt? and if he had, when, how and to whom ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-4\">The defendant, in his answer, repelled the circumstances alleged in the bill, to account for the delay in making and prosecuting the demand of the debt due on the bonds, and to rebut the presumption of satisfaction arising from the lapse of <em>time; he </em>insisted, that near thirty years having elapsed since the bonds came into the hands of his sister, then a <em>feme sole, </em>and no demand having ever been made upon them, they ought to be presumed in law to be paid ; and he relied on this legal presumption as a full and sufficient defence to the plaintiff\u2019s claim ; but he made no answer to the interrogatory, whether he had in fact paid the debt or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-5\"><em>Exception being </em>taken by the plaintiff to the sufficiency of the answer in that particular, the court sustained the exception, and ordered the defendant to put in a full answer to the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-6\">Whereupon, he filed an amended answer, in which he admitted, that he had never paid the money for which the bonds were given by him to his father. But he said, that he had been in possession of the property for the purchase money of which they were given, paying his father rent for the same, some two or three years before his purchase, and his father, having-occasion for money, proposed to convey the property to him, upon the following terms\u2014that, fixing the price of it at <em>\u00a3 </em>400. he should pay his father <em>\u00a3 100. </em>in cash, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>and should pay him interest on the balance of <em>\u00a3 </em>300. during his life; a proposal which the defendant, and all the family who were privy to the transaction, understood as nothing more than an anticipation of what his father intended at his death, namely, to give him, as well as his two other sons, the parts of the lot No. 5. of which they were respectively in possession, he paying interest on \u00bf\u00a3,300. instead of rent which his brothers paid for the parts of the lot held by them ; and when the arrangement was carried into execution by the conveyance of the property to him, his bonds for the <em>\u00a3 </em>300. were taken and given, only to secure payment of the interest thereof to his father during his lifetime ; he declaring, in the presence of the subscribing witnesses to the bonds and the conveyance, and of his son <em>Joseph </em>who drew the instruments, that he was only to draw interest upon the bonds during his life, and at his death they were to be returned to the defendant; which facts could have been proved by those persons while they were living, but they were all dead long before this suit was brought. That, accordingly, his father, by his will, devised to his sons <em>Henry </em>and <em>Isaac </em>the parts of the lot No. 5. of which they had been in possession paying him rent during his life; and devised to him the part that had been conveyed to him ; a devise of property already conveyed, for which the testator could have had no inducement, but to fulfil the contract on his part, on which the purchase had been made by the defendant. That when the father\u2019s will came to be examined, all the family, including the daughter (the plaintiff\u2019s intestate), being well acquainted with the father\u2019s intention in the transaction upon which the bonds were executed, understood the devise to the defendant of the same property for the price of which the bonds were given, and which had been before conveyed to him, as intended by the testator to operate as a surrender of the bonds; and the acquies<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>cence of the daughter and of both her husbands in . . \u00b0 this construction of the will, appeared by the fact, that neither she nor they, during twenty-six years from the testator\u2019s death in 1807 till her death in 1833, ever demanded the debt or the interest upon it; in which, the defendant had no doubt, both the husbands were controlled by their wife\u2019s knowledge that the bonds were not in truth her property. That the bonds were not specially mentioned and bequeathed by the testator\u2019s will to his daughter: she claimed them under the general bequest of \u201c debts due to the testator from his sons, by bonds, notes, or other writings, signed by them ;\u201d and besides these bonds, there were bonds of the testator\u2019s sons <em>Isaac </em>and Joseph, on which the bequest could operate, which bonds were delivered to the daughter and were collected by her. That the defendant\u2019s bonds were not delivered by the executors to her: she had access to the testator\u2019s papers, and took possession of the bonds in question, without their knowledge at the time; but she afterwards, at different times, admitted to some of her brothers, that these bonds were not hers, and said they should be restored to the defendant; and though three of the brothers were dead, he expected to prove by one who yet survived, that she made a declaration to that effect during her widowhood. And adverting to the inventory of the testator\u2019s estate returned to court, and signed by both executors, wherein these bonds are mentioned, as <em>bequeathed and delivered up to </em>her,\u2014the defendant said, that the inventory was prepared by his coexecutor <em>Henry Baler </em>under advice of counsel, by whom that part of the inventory was written; and, without pretending to remember the incident, he had no doubt, that his brother having shewn him the inventory as a paper prepared according to advice of counsel, and \u2022told him his signature was necessary, he signed it without' any examination of it; for from the death of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>father, be had uniformly contended, that the bonds ought, rightfully, to be given up to him. And upon the whole he insisted, that under the circumstances,\u2014 after such long delay, acquiescence and abandonment, \u2014equity ought not to enforce the claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-4\">The parol evidence on the part of the plaintiff consisted in the depositions\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-5\">1.

The witness also said, that she was for many years affected, periodically, by pain in the head, which for a time disordered her mind; the affliction grew more and more severe as she grew older; and about two years after her marriage to her second husband <em>Morris, </em>she became insane, so that it was necessary to confine her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-6\">2. <em>D.

He produced the <em>memorandum, </em>which was in'these words: \u201c 1806.

The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>witness further deposed, that his sister, mrs. <em>Morris, </em>after the death of her first husband <em>Stover, </em>and during-her widowhood, made a visit to <em>Winchester; </em>and during her stay there, she told him, that she had three bonds of <em>John Baher </em>in her possession, which she wished to deliver up to him, if he would go up and get them, meaning if he would go up home with her. That the part of the lot No. 5. conveyed by his father to <em>John Baher, </em>for the balance of the purchase money of which the bonds were given, had been held by his father at <em>\u00a3 </em>800. but he sold it to <em>John </em>for <em>\u00a3 </em>400. That the credits on the bonds for interest to the 17th March 1807, were indorsed by <em>Isaac Baher, </em>after his father\u2019s death : there was an account between his father and <em>John Ba-her </em>kept by his father, upon the settlement of which account, <em>John </em>was credited upon his bonds for the interest ; the witness was told by his father that that was the way .he received the interest on the bonds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-4\">4-. <em>J.

Some three or four years after her marriage with <em>Morris, </em>she mentioned the subject again, and seemed to regret that she had not given the bonds to her brother <em>John </em>at the time first mentioned; she said, they had been now taken out of her possession, but if ever she could lay her hands on them again, he should have them. At the time of this last conversation, her mind was sound.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-4\">6. <em>John Hoff; </em>who deposed, that the defendant <em>John Balcer, </em>talking of the bonds in question shortly after his father\u2019s death, and frequently afterwards, always said he wmuld never pay them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-5\">It appeared, that the defendant <em>John Baker </em>brought a suit in chancery against his coexecutor <em>Henry Baker </em>and his colegatees, to recover a debt which he claimed of his father\u2019s estate for services rendered his father in his lifetime; which suit was brought in 1808, and the bill was dismissed in November 1818. And the plaintiff exhibited the answers of <em>Joseph, Jacob </em>and <em>Henry Baker, </em>and of <em>Stover and wife, </em>in that <em>suit; </em>shewing that all those defendants mentioned the bonds in question in their answers, and represented them as evidences of debt actually due from their brother <em>John </em>to their father, and that <em>Stover and wife </em>then held and claimed the bonds as their property. He exhibited also a deposition, taken in that cause, of the same deponent <em>G. Reed </em>above mentioned, for the purpose of discrediting his evidence in this cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-6\">The circuit superior court, upon the hearing, decreed, that the defendant should pay the plaintiff 999 dollars 99 cents (the amount of debt due upon the three bonds), with interest from the 17th March 1807 till paid, and costs. From which decree, this court, on the petition of the defendant, allowed him an appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ACI\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATz\">contended, 1. That the defendant was well entitled to rely on the presumption of satisfaction of the debt arising from the length of time during which no demand of it had been made, without answering the interrogatory in the bill whether the debt had been paid or not, and he ought not to have been required to help the plaintiff\u2019s case by making a discovery on that point. The bill sought to recover a debt due on old bonds, demanded now for the first time; and the only ground of equitable jurisdiction was, that the obligor being one of the executors of the obligee, actions could not be brought on the bonds at law. Equity, doubtless, might for that reason entertain the bill; yet the claim was in its nature purely legal, and ought to be prosecuted in equity in exact analogy to an action at law: the case should be viewed in equity in the same light as if actions had been brought on the bonds at law, and this were a bill brought in equity for a discovery of matter to rebut the legal presumption of satisfaction. If the practice adopted by the court of chancery in this case should be approved, every action on a stale bond hereafter brought, would be accompanied by a bill in equity for a discovery to rebut the presumption of satisfaction, or by interrogatories addressed to the defendant\u2019s conscience under the provision of the circuit superior court law, Supp. to Rev. Code, ch. 109. \u00a7 68. p. 161. Nay more, the statute of limitations, which was intended to put an end to litigation, would, in effect, give rise to yet more troublesome litigation in equity, for the discovery of matters which might avoid the statute. He said, the general inconvenience to which the practice would lead, should make the court cautious against the toleration of it in order to give relief in the particular case. And he contended for this proposition\u2014that where <em>laches </em>appeared on the face of the plaintiff\u2019s bill, the defendant should not be held to answer to matters which might entitle the plaintiff to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>relief notwithstanding the <em>laches, </em>when -without such discovery relief would be denied. He cited <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Prevost, </em>4 Johns. Ch. Rep. 205. <em>Lansing </em>v. <em>Starr, </em>2 Johns. Ch. Rep. 150. <em>Jermy </em>v. <em>Best, </em>1 Sim. 373. <em>MacGregor </em>v. <em>East India Co. </em>2 Sim. 452. 2 Cond. Eng. Ch.

The bonds came to the hands of mrs. <em>Morris, </em>then a <em>feme sole, </em>in 1807: there was nothing to prevent her from bringing suit on the claim immediately; but, whether from doubts in her own mind as to the real justice of it, or from whatever cause, she did not prosecute it. Her first husband never prosecuted it; she did not prosecute it during her widowhood, when she was again <em>sui juris; </em>and her second husband never asserted it during her life. There was at all times a person having full capacity to assert, and an interest to assert, the claim. It was never even demanded. It must be admitted, that the precise ground of defence stated in the defendant\u2019s answer was not made out by the evidence; namely, that the bonds were given by him and taken by his father, only to secure payment of the interest during the father\u2019s life, with an understanding that they were to be given up at his death. But enough appears to shew, that it might probably have been proved, if this suit had been brought while the two subscribing witnesses to the transaction, and while <em>Joseph Balcer </em>who drew the instruments, were living, and while mrs. <em>Morris </em>was living, from whom a discovery might have been had by a cross bill; and if such a state of the case had been proved, it would have been hard to resist the equity of the defendant to be relieved from the bonds. The delay to assert the claim deprived the defendant of his defence, even if it were founded in truth, because the death of the persons most likely to be conusant of the truth, deprived him of the evidence. And during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>the whole time, the parties entitled to assert the claim, knew that the defendant denied the justice of it, while they never gave him any reason to believe that they insisted on it. The first husband <em>Stover </em>would not have su^g bj-Qug^t on the bonds, for fear of producing \u201c a split in the familyhis wife told mrs. <em>Sticldey, </em>that her brother ought to pay her the bonds, but \u201cthat he said he would not pay her, because he did not consider them just j\u201d and <em>Morris </em>after his marriage with her, as he says in his bill, was unwilling to go to law with his brother in law, especially as it would have been very unpleasant to his wrife. All the parties, then, knew, from the first, that the claim would be contested; and, with this knowledge, abstained from bringing suit, and never made even a demand of the debt, for twenty-eight years. In other words, they acquiesced, during that whole time, in the defendant\u2019s claim to exemption from the obligation of these bonds. But not only was there a wilful delay to assert the claim, and an acquiescence in the defendant\u2019s pretensions that it was not just, but mrs. <em>Morris </em>was conscious, that those pretensions were not unfounded. .For, though she sometimes asserted her right to the money, and complained that it was withheld from her, yet at other times, and especially during her widowhood, when she was <em>sui juris, </em>she declared, that the bonds belonged to her brother, and that she would surrender them to him: she told her nephew <em>William Baker, </em>as early as 1809, that the bonds belohged to her brother <em>John, </em>and that she intended to give them to him: and during her widowhood, she told mrs. <em>Price </em>that the bonds were not hers and she wished her brother <em>John </em>to have them, and her brother <em>Henry </em>that she had the three bonds of her brother <em>John </em>in her possession, which she wished to deliver up to him, if he would go home with her and get them. Here, then, he said, was a stale demand founded on a right that accrued twenty-eight years before it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>was asserted; all the parties, successively entitled, had, during all that time, slept upon their <em>rights; </em>knowing that the claim was contested, they had acquiesced, during all that time, in the defendant\u2019s refusal to pay the debt, and in his denial of its justice; and the party whose title the plaintiff was now asserting, had abandoned it some sixteen years before the plaintiff\u2019s suit was brought. Though the defendant admitted that the debt claimed on the bonds had not been paid, so that the lapse of time could not raise a presumption of payment, it might yet afford a presumption against the justice of the debt. <em>Christophers </em>v. <em>Sparke, </em>2 Jac. &amp; Walk. 222. At any rate, he said, this was a case in which a court of equity should not be active to give relief. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Clay, 3 </em>Bro. C.

He submitted, that if it was right under the circumstances of the case to give any relief at all, the court should have decreed only the <em>principal </em>of the debt, and should, on account of the <em>laches, </em>have refused to allow any <em>interest; </em>on the principle on which the account of profits was denied in <em>Acherley </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>5 Ves. 565.

The cases in which interest had been allowed upon <em>judgments </em>on bonds, beyond the penalties of the bonds on which they were recovered, stood on a different reason; <em>M\u2019Clure </em>v. <em>Dunkin, </em>1 East 437. <em>Roane\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Drummond, </em>6 Rand. 182. <em>Clark\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Day, 2 </em>Leigh 172. <em>Godfrey </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>3 Atk. 81. There was an instance of a bond in the penalty of \u00bf\u00a3120. with condition to pay \u00bf\u00a3120. where interest was allowed beyond the nominal penalty, which was in truth not a penalty; <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>Ry. &amp; Mood. 105. 21 Eng. C. L. R. 391. In the cases where interest beyond the penalty of a bond had been allowed in equity, it would be found, that the creditor\u2019s claim was not founded on the bond alone, but on some other contract besides, as a mortgage or special agreement, <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Ed. Abingdon, </em>17 Ves. 106. <em>Jeudwine </em>v. <em>Agate, </em>3 Sim. 129. 5 Condens. Eng. Ch.

The case of <em>Tennant\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>5 Munf. 494. stood alone: there, while the court held that the plaintiff could not recover interest beyond the penalty, as part of the debt due on the bond, it seemed to sanction the recovery of the surplus interest in the form of damages.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b324-5\"><em>Patton, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ar5\">maintained, on the 1st point, that the defendant was bound to answer the interrogatory in the bill, whether he had paid the debt or not. He said, a plaintiff in chancery had a right to obtain from the defendant\u2019s own acknowledgment, evidence of facts material to his case; and whether the bill were a bill for discovery merely, or a bill for discovery and relief, the plaintiff was equally entitled to the discovery he asked. This was the general rule: there were ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>ceptions to it, but the present case was not within the reason of any of them. Here, the bill was for discovery and relief: the defendant was bound to answer all the allegations of the. bill shewing the plaintiff\u2019s right to relief; as much bound to answer the allegation that he had not paid the debt, as any other. Lapse of time was only presumptive evidence of payment; and if in a suit to recover a bond debt, either at law or in equity, the defendant would rely on that presumptive evidence of payment, he must <em>plead payment; </em>else, there could be no issue between the parties to which the evidence could apply. The defendant\u2019s difficulty in this case was, that if he alleged payment, either by plea or in his answer, he would have been bound to swear to it; which he could not do without forswearing himself; and therefore, he wished to rely on the lapse of time as evidence of payment, without pleading payment. But a party admitting the original obligation to pay (as the defendant did in his first answer), could never rely on lapse of time as presumptive evidence of payment. <em>Livingston </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>4 Johns. C. R. 287. He said, the defence founded on lapse of time as proof of payment, ought not to be confounded with the bar of the statute of limitations : where the statute applied, it was immaterial whether in fact the debt had been paid or not: in the other case, the time being merely presumptive evidence of the fact of payment, the presumption might be rebutted by a variety of circumstances, much more by an admission of the debtor that the debt was still due. <em>Oswald </em>v. <em>Leigh, </em>1 T. R. 271. Stark. Ev. part 4. p. 1090. <em>Christophers </em>v. <em>Sparke, </em>2 Jac. &amp; Walk. 228-234. But even in the case of a bill filed for discovery to support a suit or defence at law, it was settled, that a party should be compelled to answer and admit facts which might defeat his claim or repel his defence at law; and in the strong case of the defence of the statute of limitations, the defendant might be compelled, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>In equity, to admit a new promise which would avoid the bar of the statute. The principle was stated in <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Bloodgood, </em>7 Johns. C. R. 134. <em>Anon. </em>3 Atk. 70. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Pengree, </em>6 Ves. 580. <em>Baillie </em>v. <em>Sibbald, </em>15 Ves. <em>Cork </em>v. <em>Wilcock, </em>5 Madd. Rep. 328. <em>Goodrich </em>v. <em>Pendleton, </em>3 Johns. C. R. 384. In the case of <em>Lansing </em>v. <em>Starr, </em>cited for the appellant, it was impossible that chancellor <em>Kent, </em>who decided <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Bloodgood </em>and <em>Goodrich </em>v. <em>Pendleton, </em>could have intended to <em>go </em>the length the appellant\u2019s counsel supposed : and, indeed, in that case, the new promises and payments alleged by the bill to have been made within six years, were expressly denied by plea and answer; and the only point of discovery called for by the bill to which no answer was given, was the origin and consideration of the note on which the action at law was founded, which could constitute no support for the plaintiff\u2019s action, or answer to the statute of limitations. If, then, a party might be compelled to discover a fact, which would avoid the bar of the statute of limitations, otherwise a complete defence at law, much more should he be compelled to discover that he had not paid a debt which he sought to defeat by the mere presumption of payment arising from lapse of time. And upon the general principles of equity pleadings, he said it was plain, that the defendant was bound to answer all the allegations of the bill, and among the rest, the allegation that the debt had not been paid. In <em>Cookson </em>v. <em>Eliason, </em>2 Bro. C. C. 252. lord <em>Thurlow </em>laid down the rule, that a party submitting to answer, must answer fully. The rule had been modified by subsequent cases, so as to admit of some exceptions, while it was still recognized as the general rule; and in the more recent cases, it seemed to be the opinion of the court of chancery of <em>England, </em>that it ought never to have been relaxed. <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Godfrey, </em>2 Bro.

In the case of <em>The Methodist Church </em>v. <em>Jaques, </em>1 Johns. C. R. 74. chancellor <em>Kent, </em>after reviewing the cases, stated, as the result of them all, that the rule of lord <em>Thurlow </em>in <em>Cookson </em>v. <em>Eliason </em>was still the recognized rule in <em>England, </em>subject to particular exceptions; as, for instance, where the bill prayed an account of partnership, and the defendant denied the partnership; or where the defendant was a fair purchaser without notice for a valuable consideration; or where the defendant denied some allegation of the bill, which not being true, the plaintiff was left without any title to relief, even though the matters of discovery were fully answered. And to this last class of exceptions belonged the case of <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Prevost, </em>cited by the appellant\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-5\">As to the 2nd objection to the decree, that the <em>laches </em>of the plaintiff, and of all the parties who had had a right successively to assert the demand, their acquiescence in the defendant\u2019s refusal to pay the money, and the abandonment of the claim by mrs. <em>Morris </em>during her widowhood, ought to close the door of equity against the relief now sought; he said, that, considering this as a suit in equity to enforce a legal demand, the obligation of which still continued, though the legal remedy could not be resorted to by reason of the relation of the parties, the case was to be determined upon the principles of a court of law; and, surely, not one of these points of defence would have been available at law, when it was once proved that the debt had never been paid. The general principles stated in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Clay, Hercy </em>v. <em>Dinwoody </em>and <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>were incontrovertible ; but it was admitted, in those cases, and in all cases of the same class, that every case of the kind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>must depend on its own peculiar circumstances; and without desiring to mitigate the strong language of lord <em>Camden </em>in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Clay, </em>except as he had himself explained it, and applying the reasoning of that case to tjjg case kefore the court, considered as a suit to enforce a legal right on a legal obligation, he was willing that every presumption, in favour of every fact which would have been a valid defence at law, should be regarded as true, if it was not rebutted by facts and circumstances' proved in <em>the cause. </em>There was no arbitrary discretion in a court of equity to refuse relief on the mere ground of delay: a delay of twenty or of a hundred years would not close the door of a court of equity against the claim, if the delay had been occasioned by the defendant\u2019s own act, or if it could be accounted for by the plaintiff\u2019s disability, or if it had in no degree impaired any defence which the defendant originally had. In <em>Burwell's ex\u2019ors </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>3 Leigh 348. <em>Pickering </em>v. <em>Ld. Stamford, 2 </em>Ves. jun. 272. 581. <em>Arden\u2019s ex\u2019ors </em>v. <em>Arden\u2019s ex\u2019ors, </em>1 Johns. C. R. 312. and many other cases, relief had been given even against decedents\u2019 estates, and for the settlement of executors\u2019 accounts, \u25a0 after as great and greater lapse of time than had occurred in this case. He then entered into an examination . of the evidence, for the purpose of shewing, that the defendant had no ground for his pretensions that these bonds were given by him, and taken by his father, only to secure payment of the interest on the money during the father\u2019s life, and that the father, by his will, intended to bequeath the bonds to him, and not to his <em>daughter; </em>that he never set up such pretensions till he filed his amended answer; that the parties had never acquiesced in those pretensions, and, for aught that appeared, never heard of them; that mrs. <em>Morris </em>never abandoned her claim to the money; and that the defendant had not been deprived; by the delay in asserting the claim, of any testimony which could have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>of any avail to his defence. He remarked, that the defendant in his first answer relied on grounds of defence inconsistent with those detailed in his amended answer; which alone should suffice to condemn his new pretensions. And as to the delay of the parties to assert the claim, that was accounted for, by the fact that the defendant had, in 1808, brought a suit against his coexecutor and his colegatees to recover a debt claimed by him of his father\u2019s estate for services rendered to his father in his lifetime, and if he had succeeded in that suit, the debt due on these bonds might have been extinguished ; and this suit was depending till 1818. Add to which, mrs. <em>Morris </em>was under the disability of coverture, from 1808 till 1819; and again from 1820 till her death in 1833; and during this disability, her rights could not be affected by delay, nor was she capable of destroying them by any acts of acquiescence or abandonment, even if such acts had been proved. <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>16 Johns.

If the court was right in decreeing the principal, it was right in decreeing interest too. In <em>Jones ex'or </em>v. <em>Williams, 2 </em>Call 103. 106. <em>Pendleton, </em>P. said, \u201c it was natural justice that he who has the use of another\u2019s money should pay interest.\u201d In <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Turberville, 2 </em>Ves. jun. 14. lord commissioner <em>Ashhurst </em>said, that one of the objections to entertaining stale demands, was, that \u201cif a man was liable after such a length of time, he was liable for interest also.\u201d In <em>Burwell\u2019s ex'ors </em>v. <em>Anderson,</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-7\">3 Leigh 348. this court, while it had some difficulty in entertaining the bill at all, and refused to interfere with the general frame of the executor\u2019s account, because of the staleness of the demand, yet charged the executor with interest which had been omitted in the audited account. And in <em>Arden's ex'ors </em>v. <em>Arden's ex'ors, </em>before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>cited, chancellor <em>Kent </em>decreeing a legacy after a great lapse of time, because of the disability of the legatee, decreed interest also, and recognized the right to interest wherever the principal was due.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmX\">4, jje admitted, that according to the course of decisions in <em>England, </em>in equity as well as at law, interest could not, in general, be carried beyond the penalty of the bond; but the courts, in modern cases, had been astute to lay hold of any circumstance which would enable them to do full justice, without regard to the technical rule that limited the recovery to the penalty. In 1 Wms. Saund. 58. n. 1. serjeant <em>Williams, </em>speaking of this rule, said\u2014\u201c If by any contrivance of the debtor, he does in fact withhold payment, upon what principle of law or honesty are a jury not to give the obligee interest by way of damages for the detention of the debt, in this case as well as in the case of bills of exchange or promissory notes, or the like, where interest has always been given when payment has been refused ? In all actions of debt, the judgment is to recover the debt and nominal damages for the detention of the debt; but if the circumstances of the case be such as to prove to <em>the </em>satisfaction of the jury that the plaintiff has sustained a real damage by the detention of the debt, there seems to be no reason or authority against the jury giving such damage in addition to the penalty of the bond.\u201d In <em>Tennant\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>Gray, 5 </em>Munf. 494. this court (as the appellant\u2019s counsel admitted) sanctioned the giving of the surplus interest beyond the penalty, in the form of damages. That c\u00e1se, he believed, had been followed in practice ever since. And he said, the supreme court of <em>New Yorlc </em>had held, in general terms, that interest beyond the penalty was recoverable, in <em>Smedes </em>v. <em>Hooghtaling, </em>3 Caines\u2019s Rep. 48.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-4\">The case has been argued, as if the legal obligation of the bonds in question.was in full force, and the object of the suit was to enforce that obligation. But the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>obligee appointed the obligor his executor, and thereby extinguished the legal remedy on the bonds, though, by the statute 1 Rev. Code, ch. 104. \u00a7 57. p. 389. the debt was not extinguished. It was a debt of the defendant to his testator\u2019s estate; it was assets in his hands, which he ought to have applied according to the directions of the will; and the will bequeathed the debt specifically to the testator\u2019s daughter. The delivery of the bonds to her, was an assent to the legacy; and the executor who himself owed the debt, could not allege want of assets to pay it, unless the money was wanted to pay debts of his testator, which is not pretended. As soon as the defendant qualified as executor of his father, he became bound, not only as obligor in the bonds, but in his executorial character, to pay the money he owed his father\u2019s estate to his sister. This suit, therefore, was not merely a suit in equity upon the bonds, but it was a bill in equity for a specific legacy, against the executor who was chargeable for it. This view of the case, he said, while it nowise weakened the argument for the appellee on the other points, removed all difficulty in regard to the question whether interest should be given beyond the penalty of the bonds.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b308-13\"> He decided the cause in the circuit superior court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b331-5\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A6m\">The first objection made to the proceedings in this case, is, that the defendant was erroneously compelled to answer whether he had paid off the bonds or not. I am of opinion that this objection cannot be sustained. There seems to have been at one time a doubt, whether a mere bill of discovery would lie, for the purpose of compelling the defendant in an action at law, who had pleaded the statute of limitations, to answer whether he had not made a new promise within five years, in order to avoid the bar. In my early practice, judge <em>Carr </em>dismissed a bill which I filed for that purpose. It seems, however, that the practice has been recognized, and sustained by various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>cases. <em>Cork </em>v. <em>Wilcock, 5 </em>Madd. R. 338. <em>Baillie </em>v. <em>Sibbald, 15 </em>Ves. 185. <em>Hindman </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>2 Bro. C. C. 7. And it is in perfect conformity with the general principie, that where the party cannot establish his case at law by other means than an appeal to the conscience of the defendant, he is entitled to make that appeal. Mitf. Plead. 130.148. Madd. Ch. Prac. 161.167. Although, therefore, the defendant pleads at law the bar of the statute, yet if the plaintiff avoids the bar by replying a new promise within five years, he may by bill of discovery compel the defendant to answer whether he has made such a promise or not. The case of <em>MacGregor </em>v. <em>The East India Company, </em>2 Sim. 452. so far from impugning this doctrine, seems to me to confirm it; for it admits, by strong implication, that if the bill had alleged a new promise, and that the defendants had documents in their possession, which would prove it, the defendants <em>must </em>have answered. But if the discovery is compelled in aid of a trial at law in such case, much more should it be enforced, where the bill is filed for relief, and the plaintiff, apprehending the bar of the statute, charges a particular special promise to avoid its operation. The defendant must in such case deny the promise charged, not only by averment in the plea, but <em>by </em>answer also.in support of the plea. Mitf. Plead. 212. 213. 3 Atk. 70. 2 Atk. 51. <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>6 Ves. 5S6. 596. Beames\u2019s Pleas in Eq. 169. <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Bloodgood, </em>7 Johns. Ch. Rep. 90. 134. If this, then, was a bill upon an open account instead of a bond, and the plaintiff had charged a new promise to avoid the bar of the statute, the defendant must have answered to\"it. It is not perceived, that in the weaker case of presumption, which is but matter of evidence, and offers no peremptory bar, he should be absolved from answering whether, in truth and in fact, he had paid the debt, in order to avoid the effect of lapse of time in barring the plaintiff\u2019s demand. The presumption may be repelled by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>any thing which goes to shew' nonpayment. By what can it be more effectually repelled, than by the defendant\u2019s own confession ? Of what can he complain, when the fact of his having made payment is to be determined by his o'wn oath ? Whatever the length of time, there is no bar, if he acknowledges that the debt <em>has never been </em>discharged. Such an acknowledgment to a third person, would be good evidence, and would repel the presumption : then, why shall he not be compelled to answer to the fact upon the requisition of the plaintiff? Under which of the exceptions to the duty to answer can he bring himself ? It subjects him neither to a penalty nor forfeiture, but merely to the payment of a just debt.- It compels him not to disclose his own turpitude, nor does it expose him to the danger of a criminal prosecution. It disburthens his conscience by compelling him to do justice. It absolves him from the demand if he swears that it has been paid, and only charges him upon his own confession that it is unpaid. I am therefore clearly of opinion, that the answer was properly enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">On the merits of the case, an examination of the record has left no doubts on my mind. The presumption of payment from length of time, on which the defendant first rested his case, has been repelled by the extorted confession in the answer. The defence, that by the original transaction it was designed to bind him only to pay the interest during his father\u2019s life, is not only in conflict with the principle which forbids the contradiction of written contracts by extrinsic evidence, unless there has been fraud, accident or surprise, but it is at variance with the facts and with the defendant\u2019s own conduct. Before it be admitted, he should explain why his deed recites a purchase for the full sum of <em>\u00a3 </em>400 ?\u2014why bonds are taken, instead of asimple written engagement to pay his father sixty dollars <em>per annum during his </em>life?\u2014why <em>three </em>bonds were taken in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>stead of one?\u2014why, in the eagerness of the defendant , , . \u00b0 \u201e , . to clutch at any testimony in support ot his pretensions (evinced by requesting <em>Reed </em>to reduce to writing his gossip with the old man) he did not at that time, or beforej procure from his father himself, the evidence of his rights, if rights he had ? and, lastly, why he never thought of this defence until he was compelled to own that the debt was yet unpaid ? Moreover, having but an equity, why has it remained so long unasserted ? The presumption from length of time, bears with at least as much force against his pretensions, as against the clear documentary evidences of debt on the part of the plaintiff. I am of opinion, therefore, that, in this case, we ought not to presume that the defendant ever had a good equitable defence against these bonds; a conclusion fortified by his having signed an inventory, in which they were inserted as part of the estate to which his sister was entitled, and by the other evidence in the cause, going to shew very clearly, that his father was not bound to give them up, but that at most he had made him some promise to do so at his death, which promise, being altogether voluntary and unexecuted, cannot be insisted on or enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-26\">As to the supposed abandonment of her rights by mrs. <em>Morris, </em>I must content myself with saying, that the facts do not sustain it, nor can it be inferred from the delay. <em>SticJcley\u2019s </em>testimony proves beyond question, that she still held the bonds after her marriage with <em>Morris, </em>which must, of course, have been within twenty years before suit brought. She said, \u201c some of her friends wished her to forgive them, but that she refused to do so, and intended making her brother pay the bonds, as the money might be of use to her on a rainy day.\u201d Mrs. <em>SiicJdey\u2019s </em>testimony is to the same effect. Independently, therefore, of the principle that legal rights are never lost by abandonment, though equitable rights may be, here is neither proof of abandonment, nor sufficient length of time from which to infer it.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>These pretensions on the part of the defendant are the more extraordinary, considering the position he occupied in relation to the debts and the legatee. Constituted by his father one of his executors, the instant he qualified, the amount of those bonds was assets in his hands, subject to debts in default of other personal estate, but otherwise payable to his sister the legatee. It was his duty to pay over the money to her, as soon as the estate was wound up, and it was ascertained that the legacy bequeathed to her would not be impaired by any demands against the estate. Indeed, as he gave up the bonds, or as they were given up to her without \u25a0 opposition on his part, we must take the assent of the executors to have been given to her legacy, and it was the duty of this executor, who owed the debt which had thus become assets in his hands, to pay it to his sister. It is with an ill grace, that he complains of her forbearing to press her claims for her small patrimony. Placed in affluent circumstances, and in no need of the money, she did forbear, leaving to the defendant to make the payment when it suited his pleasure or his convenience. These considerations, together with her coverture for twenty odd years, and her unsettled state of mind, abundantly account for that delay to sue the defendant, on which he now rests his defence against the payment of his sister\u2019s portion of her father\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Upon weighing the whole matter, I am well content to affirm the decree in all things ; being satisfied to follow the decision of <em>Tennant's ex'or </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>and well convinced, that if interest ought, in any case, to be given beyond the penalty, it was most proper in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"AzO\">Cabell, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b335-8\">Stanard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZ3\">I think the court below was right in enforcing an answer from the defendant, to the interrogatory of the bill respecting the nonpayment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>debt in question: a proceeding, which has been treated, <em>. </em>m the argument, as the compelling of a discovery m respect to that matter. But it was no more a discovery coerced, than the requiring of an answer to any other allegation of the bill would have been. The bill was no more a bill\u2019 of discovery than any other bill in equity. It was brought for a claim that was recoverable only in equity. To all the allegations of such a bill material to the plaintiff\u2019s case, the defendant ought, and may be compelled, to answer. Every bill in equity is, in that sense, a bill of discovery. To every material allegation, the defendant must answer on <em>oath, </em>unless he be protected from the obligation to do so, by the consideration, that his answer would violate professional confidence, or that it would subject him to a penalty &amp;c. The answer of the defendant in equity makes up the issue between the parties : and according to the course of the court of equity, the issue is, in all cases, made on the <em>oath </em>of the defendant; it is not so at law, except in particular cases, under statutory provisions, \u201cEvery plaintiff (in equity) is entitled to have a discovery from the defendant, as to two heads; to enable him to obtain a decree, and to ascertain facts material to the merits of his case, that either he cannot prove, or in aid of proof;\u201d <em>Finch </em>v. <em>Finch, 2 </em>Ves. sen. 592. Lord <em>Eldon, </em>in <em>Cooth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>6 Ves. 37, 8. states the rule thus: \u201c If the party has a right to relief in this court, he has a right to an answer from the defendant to every allegation of his bill, the admission of the truth of which, or the proof of the truth of which, is necessary to entitle him to that relief,\u201d If a suit at law had been brought on the bonds of the defendant, he could no otherwise have relied on the presumption of payment from the lapse of time, but by putting the fact of payment in issue by plea, and then using the lapse of time as evidence to'sustain the plea; and so in equity, unless the pleadings had made that issue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>this evidence could not have been resorted to as proof. The argument on the point turned mainly on the power of the court to enforce discovery on a bill, technically called a bill of discovery, by which the aid of the court is asked to discover matter to be used as evidence before another forum, or where the necessity of seeking a discovery is the ground of the plaintiff\u2019s claim to ask relief from the court of equity, and sustains its jurisdiction in cases in which it would otherwise want jurisdiction. But the case before us belongs to neither of those classes; and, therefore, though the court might refuse to compel the discovery, if its aid were asked as merely ancillary to a court of law, for the purpose of avoiding the bar of the statute of limitations or of repelling the presumption of payment from lapse of time, it would not follow that the court would, in a regular suit for relief which could be had in equity only, dispense with an answer to any of the material allegations of the bill. Even where the discovery is sought, only for the purpose of repelling the defence of the statute of limitations at law* the discovery will be enforced. It is so distinctly decided in the case of <em>Cork </em>v. <em>Wilcock, </em>cited at the bar: and the case of <em>MacGregor </em>v. <em>The East India Company </em>is to the same <em>effect; </em>for it was there decided, that the plea to such a bill must distinctly deny, that any <em>assumpsit </em>was made within the term of limitation ; and according to the practice of the court of chancery, such a plea must be sustained by the oath of the party; Wyat\u2019s Reg. 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">As to the effect of the lapse of time on the title of the appellee to relief in this court, I have the misfortune to differ from my brethren. The statute of <em>Virginia </em>prevented the extinguishment of the debt (if one was due) from <em>John Baker </em>to his father, in consequence of his appointment and qualification as executor of his father; but after his appointment and qualification, the legatee of that debt had no remedy but in equity only. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>The delivery of the bonds by the executor to the legatee, was an assent to the legacy, and vested in her a right to the debt, if one was due from the defendant to the testator, and was equivalent to the delivery of a Speciftc chattel to the legatee thereof; and it withdrew these bonds from the assets of the testator\u2019s estate, in like manner as they would have been withdrawn from them if the obligor had not been the executor. After this assent to the legacy, and delivery of the bonds to the legatee, the executors, and <em>John Balcer </em>as one of them, ceased to be responsible to the legatee as executors : the relation of creditor and debtor, to the extent that <em>John Balcer </em>was indebted, was established between the legatee and him, with this peculiarity, that the creditor had remedy in equity only for her claim. Such being the relation of the parties in 1807, the suit to charge the defendant with this debt was not brought till 1835, and was then brought by the surviving husband of the creditor as her administrator, she having lived in the vicinity of the party now charged as her debtor, till 1833. In this interval, it does not appear that the defendant ever acknowledged the debt, or that it was ever demanded of him. It appears that he contested his liability for it at an early period; and that his sister and her first husband during her first coverture, she during her widowhood, and she and her second husband, were all fully aware that it was so contested: that of the facts on which he relied to resist the payment of the bonds, he had one witness, at least, who was no longer living when this suit was brought; that his sister and her husbands, apprized of his denial of the justice of the claim, forbore to bring suit for twenty-eight years; and that she, at some times, asserted her right to the bonds, and the defendant\u2019s obligation to pay them, and, on other occasions, expressed her acquiescence in his objections to the payment of the bonds, and her willingness to forego any claim on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>them : but none of these assertions of riarht, or dec\u00eda- <em>. \u2019 . </em>j \u2022 \u2022 rations or acquiescence, were made in any commumcation between the parties. While the conflict between the purposes and views of the alleged creditor at different times, leaves the matter in some doubt as to what she might finally have done, the fact of actual forbearance is incontestable; nor is there any evidence even of a demand. The parties were in antagonist positions for more than twenty years before this suit was brought, while one denied his obligation to pay, and the other forbore to assert her right to receive. There has been (if I may use the expression) an adversary possession of the money in controversy for more than twenty years; and there has been a forbearance to bring suit for a right, recoverable in equity only, for that length of time, with full knowledge to the parlies entitled and able to sue, that the right was denied : and the only question is, whether a court of equity will, after such delay, entertain the suit? My impression is, that in such a case, according to the principles of numerous decisions, the activity of a court of equity ought not to be.called forth. The inference which length of time <em>per se </em>might warrant, that the party intended to relinquish the claim, is in some degree strengthened by the evidence of avowals of that purpose at different times; and time has deprived the defendant of the protection of such a purpose to relinquish the claim, by the death of the party to whom it is presumptively or by direct proof imputed. But I rest mainly on the proposition, that,'after the lapse of more than twenty years, during which liability for the claim (for which there was no remedy but in equity) was, to the knowledge of the claimant, denied, and during which there was no impediment to a suit by the party entitled to sue for and recover the claim if it was just, and yet no suit was brought, the lapse of time, relied on as a defence, is effectual to repel the claim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>and to protect the defendant from the active agency of a court of equity to subject him to it. Among many cases that might be cited, I refer to <em>Marquis Cholmondeley </em>v. <em>Ld. Clinton, 2 </em>Jac. &amp; Walk. 1. 184-192. <em>Hoveden </em>v. <em>Ld. Annesley, 2 </em>Scho. &amp; Lef. 607. 630. <em>Elmendorf </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>10 Wheat. 152. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>M\u2019Intyre, </em>6 Peters 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
