Tayloe and others, the heirs of John Tayloe, against Smith. On the trial of the cause the plaintiffs offered in evidence the deposition of Archibald Freeland taken <em>de bene esse; </em>and to account for the absence of the witness who lived in the county of Chesterfield some miles from the courthouse, they offered his affidavit taken before a justice of the peace, in which he stated that he was in the ninetieth year of his age, extremely enfeebled from the effects of continued disease and great age; that he was unable to take any other than the most moderate exercise without serious risk; and that he did not believe that he could without probable danger to his life, attend Chesterfield court to give his testimony in this case; nor had he reason to hope he would be in a better condition at any future time. This affidavit was made eight days before the deposition was offered in evidence. The defendants objected to the introduction of the deposition as evidence, and the court sustained the objection; and the plaintiffs excepted. There was a verdict and judgment for the defendant: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>And William H. Tayloe then applied to this court for a <em>supersedeas, </em>which was allowed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>1854.
