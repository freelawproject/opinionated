Before this claim is collected, suit is brought upon the bond, and the sureties contribute ratably to its payment. One of the sureties obtains a decree against the principal for what he pays, and upon this decree sues out a <em>ca. sa. </em>which being executed on the principal, he enters into a bounds bond with sureties, and afterwards breaks the condition, whereby the sureties in that bond become liable. The claim assigned to the trustee being afterwards collected by him, the court of chancery allows the sureties in the bounds bond to participate in this trust fund, in the event of their having made payment. Held by the court of appeals, that this is <em>erroneous; </em>that the surety who obtained the security of the bounds bond, was bound to proceed thereon against the sureties in the same, and could only come upon the trust fund for any deficiency in his recovery from them; and that the sureties in the bounds bond could have no right to resort to the trust fund for their reimbursement, except to the extent of any surplus that might remain after the full indemnification of the original sureties.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-8\">On the 8th of February 1823, <em>Erasmus Stribling, Alexander R. Givens, James Turk, David Golloday, A. Anderson </em>and <em>Alexander Nelson </em>executed an obligation to pay do <em>Samuel Blackburn, on </em>demand, 3775 dollars, for the payment of which they bound themselves and their heirs, jointly and severally, in the penal sum of 7550 dollars. Upon the obligation there was an indorsement of the same date, under the hand and seal of <em>Stribling, </em>stating it to be the understanding between <em>Blackburn </em>and himself, that the money was to be paid <em>Blackburn </em>at any time when he might need it, on 20 days notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>The sum of 471 dollars 87J cents was paid for the interest to the 8th of March 1825, and the obligation credited therewith.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-4\">At the time of commencing an action upon the obligation, <em>Golloday </em>and <em>Anderson </em>were dead. The action was therefore brought against, the surviving obligors, and against them <em>Blaclcburn </em>obtained a judgment on the 31st of August 1827.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-5\">The writ of <em>fieri facias </em>issued upon this judgment being levied upon property of <em>Nelson, </em>a bond was given by <em>Stribling, Givens </em>and <em>Nelson </em>for the forthcoming thereof, in which bond <em>George C. Robertson </em>and <em>Hugh Hamilton </em>joined as sureties, at the request of <em>Nelson </em>and <em>Givens, </em>by whom they were indemnified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-6\">The forthcoming bond being forfeited, and it being expected that judgment would soon be rendered thereon, <em>Nelson </em>and <em>Givens, </em>on the 19th of January 1828, filed their; bill in the superior court of chancery holden at <em>Staunton, </em>setting forth, that <em>Stribling </em>borrowed the money of <em>Blaclcburn, </em>and the co-obligors, were his sureties; that <em>Stribling </em>has become much embarrassed, and-the complainants believe is entirely insolvent; and that their efforts to obtain indemnity from him on account of their suretyship have proved entirely abortive, except that <em>Stribling </em>has transferred for their benefit a claim which they believe will turn out to be altogether unproductive. Under these circumstances, in order that the cosureties may bear an equal proportion of the burthen to which the complainants are subjected, they the complainants seek the equitable interposition of the court. The bill states that the complainants intend to avail themselves of the remedy by motion, as far as practicable, but that that remedy will not afford adequate relief. The administrator of <em>Golloday </em>alleges that he has fully administered the personal assets, and the complainants believe that the same have proved insufficient to pay his debts; but <em>Golloday </em>left conside<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>rabie real estate, which is liable for his proportion of the debt, both by force of the obligation and by the provisions of his will. Part of the real estate has been sold to <em>Lewis Kellar, </em>who has in his hands about S00 dollars of the purchase money. Another part has been sold to <em>Isaac Sellars; </em>but what amount of purchase money remains in his hands, the complainants are not informed. One of the devisees of <em>Golloday </em>has removed out of the commonwealth, and another is in precarious circumstances. <em>Stribling </em>the principal debtor; <em>Golloday's </em>administrator, widow, heirs and devisees; the purchasers from those devisees; <em>James Turlc; </em>and. <em>Robert Anderson </em>the executor and devisee of <em>Andrew Anderson, </em>are made defendants. The prayer of the bill is, that <em>Kellar </em>and <em>Sellars, </em>the purchasers from <em>Golloday's </em>devisees, be restrained from paying over to their vendors; that contribution may be enforced against the estate of <em>Golloday; </em>and that the complainants may have such other relief as may be equitable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-4\">An injunction was awarded accordingly. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-5\">The claim mentioned in the bill as transferred by <em>Stribling, </em>was a claim under an obligation of <em>Daniel Sheffey, </em>bearing date the 25th of September 1826, whereby <em>Sheffey </em>acknowledged that he had received from <em>Erasmus Stribling </em>an assignment of a contract entered into between him and <em>Tagart </em>of the county.of <em>Baltimore </em>in <em>Maryland, </em>dated the 22d of August 1826, and which was ratified on the 12th of September 1826 by <em>Mary Tagart, Elizabeth L. Tagart, </em>another <em>Mary Tagart, William Tagart, John Tagart jr. </em>and <em>Samuel Tagart, </em>by which, for certain services to be rendered by the said <em>Stribling, </em>the contracting parties agreed to pay him 5000 dollars, if the debt claimed by them should be wholly recovered from <em>James Caldwell; </em>if not, in proportion to the sum recovered. The undertaking of <em>Sheffey </em>was to account with <em>Stribling </em>for four fifths of whatever amount he might obtain under the agreement assigned to him as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>By an assignment made the 27th of October 1827, <em>Stribling </em>transferred <em>Sheffey\u2019s </em>obligation to <em>Nicholas C.

In conformity with this opinion, the court decreed against <em>Kellar </em>and <em>Sellars. </em>And then the court, declaring <em>Strilling </em>liable for reimbursement to the plaintiffs of their contributive proportions of the debt, interest and costs secured by <em>the forthcoming </em>bond, decreed that he pay to the plaintiff <em>Nelson </em>896 dollars 64f cents, with interest on 895 dollars <em>22 j </em>cents, part thereof, from the 18th of October 1827, and that he pay as much principal and interest to the plaintiff <em>Givens.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-4\"><em>Givens </em>having sued out a <em>fieri facias </em>upon his decree against <em>Stribling, </em>property was taken under it, and sold on the 20th of October 1830. The net proceeds of sale amounted to 474 dollars 74 cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-5\"><em>Nelson </em>sued out upon his decree a writ of <em>capias ad satisfaciendum, </em>under which <em>Stribling </em>was taken and committed to jail the 30th of October 1830. <em>Stribling </em>on the same day gave bond to the sheriff, with <em>Nicholas C. Kinney, Robert Hemphill, David W. Patteson, Jacob K. Stribling, John C. Bowyer, James Crawford, Benjamin Crawford </em>and <em>William S. Eslcridge </em>his sureties, with a condition reciting that the execution under which he was taken, with the legal costs attending the same, amounted to 985 dollars 29 cents after deducting a credit directed by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, and that <em>Strib</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number><em>ling </em>had taken the benefit of the prison rules assigned and laid out by the county of <em>Augusta, </em>\u2018for one year. The condition was, that if <em>Stribling </em>should not depart from nor go out of the rules or bounds of the said prison, and should render his body to prison in satisfaction of said execution at or before the expiration of one year from the date, then the obligation was to be void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-4\">This condition was broken, and the bond being thereby forfeited, the sheriff assigned it to <em>Nelson.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-5\"><em>Nicholas C. Kinney, </em>to whom the assignment of the 27th of October 1827 was made, succeeded in collecting the fund thereby assigned to him, the net amount of which was 4713 dollars 40 cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-6\">Whereupon <em>Turk, Givens </em>and others contended that the bounds bond enured to the benefit of all <em>Stribling\u2019s </em>sureties, and that <em>Nelson </em>should be turned over to his indemnity on said bond, in exoneration of the trust fund. They also contended that the sum of 474 dollars 74 cents, received by <em>Givens </em>on his execution against <em>Stribling, </em>enured to the benefit of all <em>Stribling's </em>sureties, and should be so taken, in exoneration of the trust fund.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-7\">On the 21st of June 1837, the court pronounced its opinion that the fund of 4713 dollars 40 cents, together with the amount made by <em>Givens </em>on his execution, with interest on both to the time of division, should be divided into five equal parts, one of which parts should be paid to the plaintiff <em>Givens, </em>another to the executor of <em>Nelson </em>(in whose name the cause had been revived), another to the representatives of <em>Golloday, </em>another to <em>Anderson, </em>and the other fifth to <em>Turk; </em>unless the sureties in the bounds bond had paid the amount due thereon to <em>Nelson's </em>executor, in which case they were to be subrogated to the rights of <em>Nelson's </em>executor, and the part assigned to <em>Nelson's </em>executor was to be paid over to them, according as they might have contributed to the payment of said bounds bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aou\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>By an indorsement on the bounds bond, it appeared that the sureties therein had paid 500 dollars in part of the amount thereof, and that 750 dollars, other part thereof, had been paid by <em>Nicholas C. Kinney </em>out of the trust i\"un(i in his hands. These payments were credited as of the 2d of January 1837.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-3\">A decree being entered on the 21st of June 1837 in conformity with the opinion pronounced by the court, an appeal was allowed therefrom on the petition of <em>Givens </em>and <em>TurJc, </em>who insisted that the decree ought to be reversed for the following reasons :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-4\">1. Because, while it adds to the trust fund the amount made out of the property of <em>Stribling </em>by <em>Givens, </em>it fails to.apply the same rule to the sum made out of the sureties in the bounds bond and indorsed as a credit thereon, together with the part of the trust fund credited thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-5\">2. Because the executor of <em>Nelson, </em>who has an ample security for his debt in the bounds bond (a security furnished by <em>Stribling </em>the principal debtor) is admitted by the decree into an equal participation in the trust fund with his cosureties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-6\">3. Because the sureties in the bounds bond, for as much as they pay thereon, are subrogated to the rights of <em>Nelson </em>in the fund. These sureties are not entitled to subrogation. <em>Stribling </em>was the principal debtor, and bound to pay his debt and protect his sureties; and the sureties of <em>Stribling </em>in the bounds bond can occupy no better ground than he does.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b412-7\"><em>Peyton </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b412-8\"><em>Michie </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b412-9\">Stanard, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ala\">The decree of the court below affirms two'propositions: 1st. That it was proper to make <em>Givens </em>account for the amount he had made from <em>Stribling's </em>property, and limit his share of the indemnity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>furnished by the assignment of <em>Tagart\u2019s </em>claim, to a sum equal to the excess of an equal aliquot part of the aggregate of the amount so made and the indemnity fund, above the amount so made. 2ndly. That the sureties in the prison bounds bond were entitled to substitution to the original rights of <em>Nelson, </em>so as to enable them to share with <em>Nelson\u2019s </em>cosureties the said indemnity fund, in like manner and to like extent as <em>Nelson </em>could, if satisfaction of his claim on <em>Stribling, </em>and consequently on the indemnity fund, had not been obtained from the sureties in the prison bounds bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-3\">Though, under my present impressions, I should dissent from the first proposition, (strongly inclining to the opinion that the proper rule is to make the amount that <em>Givens </em>recovered in the pursuit of his separate remedy against <em>Stribling, </em>available to the other original sureties so far only as the recovery of that sum lessened the amount required from <em>Givens\u2019s </em>equal share of the indemnity fund, to complete his indemnity,) I forbear to enter into an investigation of the question, or to give a definitive opinion on it, because the decree in this respect conforms to the principle that <em>Givens </em>in the court below assented to, and even contended for, and he only is interested in applying the different rule that I incline to think is the correct one.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">I dissent from the second proposition, and think this dissent is justified by authority and reason. The proposition is opposed to the direct adjudications, or to principles avowed in or deducible from the cases, of <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Briddock, </em>2 Vern. 608. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Morley, </em>11 Ves. 22. <em>Hull </em>v. <em>Pitfield, 1 </em>Wils. 46. <em>Douglass </em>v. <em>Fagg, 8 </em>Leigh 588. Sound reason equally condemns it.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The fund, to a participation in which the decree admits the sureties in the prison bounds bond in equal degree with the original sureties of <em>Stribling, </em>substituting them to the supposed right of <em>Nelson </em>one of the original sureties, is the produce of an assignment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number><em>Stribling. </em>To the indemnity of those sureties, including <em>Nelson </em>as one of them, the assignment had dedicated that fund. When the sureties had paid their respective parts of the debt for which they were sureties, they were severally entitled to demand of <em>Stribling </em>reimbursement of the sums so paid, and they had equal right to resort to this fund as a security for that reimbursement. The right to resort to the fund depended on the continuance of the necessity of that resort, to obtain reimbursement; and the termination of that necessity, by the discharge of any one of the claims of the several sureties on <em>Stribling, </em>liberated the fund from the claim so discharged, and left it liable for those that remained undischarged. The primitive and overruling right of the sureties, as between themselves, was to have it applied to the indemnity of all and each, and it could not be applied to any other object until that was attained. None of the sureties could claim participation in it but for the purpose of indemnity, and the whole fund remained chargeable by each for that purpose until the indemnity was complete or the fund exhausted. Each, then, as a consequence of the nature and quality of their primitive rights, had an interest in the diminution or discharge of the claims of each, as such diminution or discharge lessened or might lessen the charge on the fund. Each, too, was at liberty to seek reimbursement from any other source, and the success of such pursuit by any one of them was incidentally the success of all, so lar as it diminished the occasion of that one to draw equally with the others on <em>the </em>indemnity fund to complete his reimbursement. If a new security were acquired by any of them, he held two securities for his reimbursement, while the other sureties held but one; and in such case, under a familiar and clear rule of equity, if, before he made the new security available, he had been reimbursed in whole or in part from the indemnity fund, the other sureties-(the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>incumbrancers of that fund) would be entitled to be. substituted in his place, and claim under the new security, at least out of the surplus thereof that might be left after he had been fully satisfied, a sum equivalent to that he had received from the indemnity fund. This principle of equity is stated in, and illustrated by, adjudications too numerous and familiar for citation. If the new security be an incumbrance on property.of the debtor, no one would question the soundness of this principle, or resist its application. The decree therefore must have proceeded on the supposition, that where the new security is not a lien or charge on the property of the debtor, but the personal responsibility of another, though that responsibility came in the place of some lien on or remedy against the property or person of the debtor, obtained by the pursuit of the creditor, then the principle, does not apply. In such a case, according to the principles of the decree, the new security is wholly unavailing to improve the condition of the other original incumbrancers: if it is not enforced by the party who may have obtained it, the other incumbrancers are not entitled to a cession of it, and the enforcement of it is of no benefit to those incumbrancers, as the parly against whom it is enforced takes the place of the creditor he has satisfied, and the original charge on the fund in respect to the debt satisfied is undiminished. Examples illustrating the operation of the principles which conduct to such a consequence, are perhaps the aptest means of testing their soundness. Thus, one or more incumbrancers, who have a security in common with others on a particular fund, in pursuit of additional security or satisfaction from the debtor, obtain judgment against him, sue out execution, and levy it on property sufficient to satisfy the claim. If the property be sold and the claim satisfied, the common fund for the security of all is liberated <em>pro tanto, </em>and remains a security for the others. But in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>stead of a sale under the execution, the property is restored to the debtor on the interposition of a friend as a surety in a forthcoming bond, and his responsibility stands in place of the satisfaction thus intercepted ^.7 tbs intromission; and on this responsibility he is eventually charged and compelled to pay. It seems but reasonable that this payment should produce the same effect on the rights of the incumbrancers, as if satisfaction had been had from the sale of the property levied on. Yet according to the principles of the decree, all this is fruitless of benefit to the incumbrancers, and their rights are the same as if the debt had not been discharged: and this result is produced by the active interposition of a court of equity, in favour of the party whose voluntary intromission has frustrated a satisfaction of the claim, that would have removed it from the incumbered property. This, I think, instead of being sanctioned, is forbidden by the principles of equity. It is not perceived that the sureties in a prison bounds bond would have a better title to substitution than those in a forthcoming bond. The body in execution, though it be not a satisfaction, yet tends to satisfaction, and the sureties in the bond, by becoming bound as such, withdraw the debtor from prison, and enable him, by escape from the bounds, to deprive the creditor of his lien on the body. Their obligation holds the place of that lien, and its value is tested by the amount realized from that obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">The proposition on which the decree rests, raises the right of the sureties in the prison bounds bond to participate in the indemnity fund, to an equality with that of the original sureties. The primitive rights of the original sureties to participate in that fund for the purpose of indemnity, were equal, and continued so in each and all, while the fund was required for that purpose. It was the inherent and essential quality of such a right, to terminate in respect to any one of the sure<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>ties when he should be indemnified, in favour of others . . not indemnified. When any one obtained indemnity under his separate remedy against the principal for his separate claim on the principal, his right was extinct in favour of the other sureties, from the law and equity applicable to their relations to and interest in the fund, and no remedy or right remained in him, to which to subrogate the sureties in the prison bounds bond; and it was not the proper function of a court of equity to revive this extinguished right, in favour of sureties that had taken the place of the debtor, and come in the stead of one of the remedies against him, for the purpose of diminishing the legal or equitable rights of those to whose benefit the successful enforcement of that remedy enured. Authority and reason concur in pronouncing a dissent from the second proposition on which the decree is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The following decree was concurred in by all the judges:</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">\u2022 \u201c The court is of opinion that there is error in the said decree, in so far as it provides that the sureties in the prison bounds bond should participate in the trust fund for the indemnity of the original sureties in the debt to <em>Bluckburn, </em>in the event of their having made payment to <em>Nelson. </em>On the contrary, the other sureties for that debt had a right to demand that their co-surety <em>Nelson </em>should prosecute the demand to a recovery against the said sureties in the bounds bond, and should be only entitled to come upon the common fund for any deficiency in his recovery from them; and the sureties in the bounds bond could have no right to resort to the trust fund for their reimbursement, except to the extent of any surplus that might remain after the full indemnification of the original sureties; or if <em>Nelson </em>received any thing from the common fund before a recovery on the prison bounds bond, the other sureties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>were entitled to have the prison bounds bond enforced for their benefit, to the extent of the sum so received by <em>Nelson </em>from the common fund, until those sureties were fully reimbursed the principal and interest of the sums they had respectively paid as original sureties of <em>Stribling.\u201d </em>Therefore decree reversed, so far as it is above declared to be erroneous, and cause sent back for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
