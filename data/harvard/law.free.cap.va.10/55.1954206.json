That the plaintiff gave, in evidence, a deed from <em>Andrew Edwards </em>to his daughters <em>Mary </em>and <em>Peggy; </em>which in-consideration of love and affection for his daughters, <em>[Mary, </em>wife of <em>Alvin Mountjoy, </em>and <em>Peggy Edwards,) </em>gives to <em>Mary </em>and her husband <em>\u00a3 </em>500, and to <em>Peggy \u00a3 </em>500, subjecting his estate to payment thereof. The deed which is set forth in <em>hcee verba </em>is dated 10th of August, 1778, and recorded in the same month : On it is an endorsement that <em>Thomas Mountjoy </em>shall receive <em>Peggy\u2019s \u00a3 </em>500 in trust for her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-10\">2.

The parol evidence of <em>Nathaniel Fox, </em>who proved the negroes named in the declaration were delivered to <em>Lowry </em>by <em>Edwards, </em>in his lifetime, in consideration of the deed of gift for <em>\u00a3 </em>500 : That they were received for the use of <em>Lowry </em>and wife, during her life; and then to the use of her children; but not to be subject to any execution or other demand against <em>Lowry: </em>That there was, at the time, some other instrument, besides the note and receipt above mentioned, written upon the same subject, in a book, and left in the possession of <em>Edwards; </em>but he does not recollect what it contained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-21\">7.

The evidence of <em>Grigsby, </em>who .proved that he purchased three negroes, to wit, <em>Esther, Fanny </em>and <em>Lucy, </em>of the defendant, as part of <em>Edwards\u2019s </em>estate; but returned them, on finding that they had been mortgaged by <em>Edwards </em>to <em>Ozwald, Deneston &amp;f Co., </em>after which <em>they were </em>exposed to sale, but <em>Lowry </em>forbid it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>9. The evidence of <em>Mason, </em>a deputy sheriff, who proved that <em>Will </em>was shewn him by the defendant, as the property of <em>Edwards; </em>and that he took him in execution, and sold him; but that the sale was forbid by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-4\">10.

The testimony of a witness, who proved, that <em>Alvin Mountjoy </em>received the <em>\u00a3 </em>500 mentioned in the deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-6\">12. The evidence of <em>Collins, </em>who proved, that the defendant sold <em>Esther </em>for <em>\u00a3 </em>95 ; and that the plaintiff and defendant live about seven miles from each other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-7\">13. That the defendant offered in evidence the mortgage to <em>Ozwald, Deneston fy Co., </em>dated the 26th June, 1774; and recorded in September following; which it recites <em>in hcec verba.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-8\">The district court gave judgment for the defendant; and the plaintiff appealed to the court of appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b73-9\"><em>Call, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtJ\">The plaintiff was a purchaser of the slaves from <em>Edwards : </em>for his will proves that it was contemplated; and the note of settlement and receipt in the next year, added to the testimony of <em>Fox </em>and <em>Payne, </em>completely establish it. But <em>Lowry </em>had possession more than five years; and that gave him a complete title: For it is like twenty years possession in ejectment; which so completely vests the right of possession, that the plaintiff may recover against the rightful owner of the lands. <em>Bull. N. Pr. </em>103. 3 <em>Call, </em>85. The mortgage does not prevent the recovery, 1. Because the plaintiff had, at least, a qualified property, which will support trover, as the jury might have assessed damages to the value of the life estate only. 2. Because the length of time which has elapsed creates a presumption of payment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b73-10\"><em>Botts </em>and <em>Randolph, contra.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXOI\">Parol testimony cannot be received to contradict a writing attested by the witness him<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>self, as <em>Fox </em>was called to do in the present case. There is a difference between being plaintiff or defendant, as to the operation of the act of limitations; for the defendant may plead it, as the statute gives him a right to do so; but the plaintiff can derive no manner of advantage from it: Besides, as the plaintiff was a trustee, he was not entitled to any benefit from the lapse of time. The slaves were included in the mortgage : which is not barred, as the mortgagees were out of the <em>country; </em>and therefore the executor would not have been justifiable, if he had given them up to the plaintiff. The action should have been detinue, and not trover, as the plaintiff must recover the whole value, or nothing. The wife should have joined in the action, as the property is claimed in her right. The slaves are not proved to be the same, with those named in the receipt: Nor is the conversion shewn; and therefore the plaintiff has not made out any cause of action.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b74-4\"><em>Call, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4o\">The rule that a witness shall not be received to contradict a writing, attested by himself, applies merely to the attestation; for, as to any thing else, he is as admissible as another. The difference between being plaintiff and defendant, as to the operation of the act of limitations, is not so universal as the other side contend ; for the plaintiff may reply the statute to a discount offered by the defendant. The identity of the slaves cannot be questioned now <em>\u2022, </em>for the demurrer admits it. The executor was not justifiable in retaining the slaves, because the five years had vested the title in the plaintiff even against the mortgagees. <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Harrison, 1 Call, 419. </em>There was no necessity to join the wife in the action; for the plaintiff was a purchaser of the slaves, and the wife had no interest. But if she had, there was no occasion to' unite her in the suit. 2. <em>Lev. </em>107. The conversion of several of the slaves is proved; and the demurrer admits it as to the rest, because the jury might have found it from the evidence.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b75-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Tucker, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AWi\">The bond created a lien which could only be shaken by <em>bom fide </em>creditors; and the money contained in it was agreed to be given for the slaves, at the death of <em>Edwards. </em>This was conformable to the devise, which was not revoked by that transaction; and, as <em>Lowry </em>had possession during the testator\u2019s life, the assent of the executor was not necessary : Or, if necessary, it might, under the circumstances, have been presumed. The conversion may be inferred from the evidence; because the court may make every conclusion which the jury might have made. It was not necessary to join the wife in the suit. <em>Nelthrop </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>1 Salk. 114. And the plaintiff was entitled to an action for the life estate in the property. I think, therefore, that the judgment of the district court ought to be reversed, and judgment entered for the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Fleming, Judge, Carrington, Judge, and Lyons, President, all concurred that the judgment of the district court should be reversed, and judgment entered for the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
