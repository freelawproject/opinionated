Fretwell, </em>administrator of <em>Alexander Fretwell </em>deceased, sued out of the superior court of law for <em>Bucldngham </em>county a writ of <em>capias ad respondendum </em>against <em>Anderson Sf Wood-son </em>and <em>John Couch. </em>The return of the sheriff was as follows: \u201c Executed on <em>Geo. Woodson </em>and <em>John Couch, </em>and <em>Curtis C. Nunnally </em>their bail. <em>Anderson </em>is not an inhabitant of this county.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-10\">At the rule day to which the writ was returnable, the suit was abated as to <em>Anderson, </em>and the plaintiff having filed his declaration, a conditional judgment was entered against <em>Woodson </em>and <em>Couch, </em>which was confirmed at the succeeding rule day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-11\">At the next term, the judgment obtained in the office against the defendants <em>Woodson </em>and <em>Couch </em>was set aside, upon their filing a plea in writing to the following effect: \u201c that the said <em>George Woodson, </em>in the declaration mentioned, had no lawful power and authority to seal and deliver the alleged bond in the declaration mentioned, as the act and deed of the said <em>Edmund Anderson, </em>and the said writing is not the act and deed of the said <em>Anderson; </em>and so the defendants say that the said alleged writing in the declaration is not the act and deed of the defendants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>During the same term, leave was given the plaintiff to amend his declaration, and the cause was remanded <em>to </em>the rules.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-6\">At June rules 1829, the plaintiff filed his amended declaration. It was in the name of <em>James B. Fretwell </em>(sometimes called administrator of <em>Alexander Fretwell </em>deceased) against <em>George B. Woodson </em>(who sometimes styles himself <em>Anderson fy Woodson) </em>and <em>John Couch, </em>and set forth, that the said <em>George B. Woodson </em>and <em>John Couch, </em>on the 19th March 1827, by their certain writing obligatory, sealed with the seal of the said <em>John Couch </em>and the seal of the said <em>George B. Woodson, </em>(which said seal or scroll of the said <em>George B. Woodson </em>is affixed to the name of <em>Anderson 6f Woodson, </em>but in truth and in fact is the signature and seal of the said <em>George B. Woodson,) </em>promised to pay said plaintiff, on or before the first of January next after the date of the said writing obligatory, the sum of 90 dollars, for the payment of which they bound themselves in the penal sum of 180 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-7\">No rule was given the defendants to plead, nor any other proceeding had at the rules, after this amended declaration was filed. But final judgment was entered as of the succeeding term: the entry stating that \u201c the defendants not appearing and pleading to the amended declaration, on the motion of the plaintiff by his attorney, it is considered\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-8\">A <em>supersedeas </em>was awarded on the petition of Couch, assigning as error, that the writ is against <em>Anderson fy Woodson </em>and <em>John Couch, </em>and the declaration against <em>George B. Woodson </em>and <em>John Couch.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b603-9\"><em>Robertson </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b603-10\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AUh\">The judgment in this case is altogether irregular. The cause having been remanded to the rules, to enable the plaintiff to amend his declara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>tion, ought to have been there regularly proceeded in, upon the filing of the declaration, by rule to plead &amp;c. to an office judgment or an issue. Parties indeed may amend their pleadings in court, where they are willing and consent to make up an issue <em>there; </em>but there can be no judgment by default for want of a plea, except at the rules. This judgment is not then a judgment by default, but it is altogether an irregular judgment, taken against the defendants as if they were really in default, when they were not so. It must therefore be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">The entry in the court of appeals was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">\u201c The court is of opinion that the judgment is erro-&gt; neous in this, that after the cause had been remanded to the rules, it ought to have been regularly proceeded in there, to an issue or office judgment, unless by consent an issue had been made up in court; and it was altogether irregular to enter up the judgment in court without such previous proceeding.\u201d Therefore, judgment reversed with costs. \u201c And this court, not deciding upon the sufficiency of the declaration, as that question does not properly arise in the present state of the case, doth order that the cause be remanded to the circuit superior court, to be sent back to the rules for further proceedings to be had therein.\u201d</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
