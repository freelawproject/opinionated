Scott </em>had had ten days notice that a motion would be made by <em>Mildred Skinker </em>as administratrix of <em>John Skinker, </em>against the said <em>Francis W. Scott </em>as administrator of <em>John Scott, </em>for a fine because of the failure of <em>Reuben Tankersley, </em>deputy for the said <em>John Scott </em>as sheriff of <em>Caroline, </em>to return an execution which issued from the clerk\u2019s office of the said court of chancery on the first day of November 1815, in favour of the plaintiff against <em>Elizabeth Turner </em>executrix <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>of <em>Reuben Turner </em>deceased; and the defendant not ap- . . . . . <em>r </em>, . , pearing, the court, on consideration ot the motion, decreed that the defendant, out of the estate of his testator, pay to the plaintiff the sum of \u00a376. 6. 7. with interest at the rate of six per centum per annum on <em>\u00a3 </em>45. ii. part thereof, from the 19th day of May 1827 till paid, (being a sum less than five per cent, per month on the amount of the execution,) and also pay to the plaintiff the costs of the motion. And the plaintiff thereupon, in open court, released the estates of <em>Reuben Tankersley </em>and <em>John Scott </em>from any and all claims for failing to pay the amount received under the execution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-6\">On the 19th of May 1830, <em>Francis W. Scott, </em>as administrator of <em>John Scott, </em>paid <em>John Dickinson, </em>as the agent and attorney of mrs. <em>Skinker, </em>323 dollars 44 \u25a0cents in full of the decree, and took a receipt for the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-7\">Thereupon <em>Francis W. Scott, </em>as administrator of <em>John Scott, </em>gave notice to <em>Byrd George, </em>as executor of <em>Reuben Tankersley, </em>that he should, on the second day of the June term of <em>Caroline </em>county court in 1830, move for a judgment against him for the sum of 323 dollars 44 cents which he had so paid in discharge of the decree, with interest thereon from the 19th of May 1830.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-8\">The motion was continued until the 15th of March 1833, when the parties appeared and the case was heard. The plaintiff offered in evidence a copy of the decree, with the receipt indorsed thereon, and the testimony of <em>John Dickinson; </em>who testified, that he wTas some years <em>ago </em>employed by mrs. <em>Mildred Skinker, </em>administratrix of <em>John Skinker, </em>to collect her claim under an execution which had issued from the chancery court of <em>Fredericksburg </em>against the <em>estate of Reuben Turner; </em>and finding that the execution had gone into the hands of <em>Reuben Tankersley, </em>he applied to <em>Byrd George, </em>the executor of <em>Tankersley, </em>for the amount, sta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>ting that he should have to proceed against the sheriff\u2019s representative unless it were paid. <em>George </em>refusing to pay, he <em>Dickinson </em>gave notice to <em>Francis W. Scott </em>administrator of <em>John Scott, </em>who said that he knew nothing about the matter and should rely on <em>George </em>to make the defence, and desired him <em>Dickinson, </em>if he met with <em>George </em>before the trial of the notice, to apprize him of it; stating at the same time, that he <em>Scott </em>would also deliver him the notice which had been served on himself. After this, and before the hearing of the notice, <em>Dickinson </em>met George, who told him he should attend to the case, though he was afraid he should not be able to defend it, as he could find no receipt or evidence of payment amongst <em>Tankersleifs </em>papers. After getting the judgment, <em>Dickinson </em>mentioned to <em>George </em>that the court had given a judgment for the amount of the execution, and expressed a hope that he would settle it and relieve <em>Scott\u2019s </em>estate. <em>George </em>said he had been advised by mr. <em>Robert G. Scott, </em>that he could not safely pay it without judgment. <em>Dickinson </em>told him that <em>Scott </em>could not get a judgment without first paying the decree, which would be very inconvenient, as he had distributed the estate. Nevertheless <em>George </em>adhered <em>to </em>the opinion that he could not pay before a judgment, without making himself liable; saying, however, that mr. <em>Scott </em>might settle the decree, and proceed at once to have his judgment. <em>Dickinson </em>informed <em>Scott </em>of <em>George\u2019s </em>refusal to pay, and of what he <em>said; </em>and to enable <em>Scott to </em>obtain a judgment, the decree was settled and a receipt given therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-4\">It was farther proved that the papers in the case of <em>Skinker\u2019s </em>administratrix against <em>Scott\u2019s </em>administrator, on which the decree was rendered, had been since lost or mislaid, so that they could not now be produced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-5\">And a witness on behalf of the defendant testified, that soon after the commencement of this motion, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>-was retained by the defendant to defend the motion, , \u201e , . <em>r . </em>and that purpose made an examination ot the papers in the case of <em>Skinker\u2019s </em>administratrix against <em>Scott\u2019s </em>administrator, which were then in the clerk\u2019s \u00b0ffice \u00b0f the court of chancery ; and from those papers it appeared that the execution against <em>Turner's </em>executrix was issued on the first of November 1815, returnable to the first day of the April term 1816, and that .the motion on which the decree against <em>Scott's </em>administrator was rendered, was made upon a notice given to <em>Scott\u2019s </em>administrator in October 1826.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-6\">Upon the whole evidence, <em>the </em>county court gave judgment against <em>Tankersley's </em>executor for the sum of 323 dollars 44 cents paid by <em>Scott\u2019s </em>administrator, with interest from the 19th of May 1830 till paid, and the costs of the motion. To which judgment <em>Tankersley\u2019s </em>executor excepted, and the bill of exceptions contained the evidence before stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-7\">On a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment of the county court, the circuit court reversed the same with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-8\">Whereupon, on the petition of <em>Scott's </em>administrator, a <em>supersedeas </em>was awarded to. the judgment of the circuit court. <em>Scott's </em>administrator, by his petition, insisted, that as it appeared that <em>Tankerley's </em>executor had <em>notice </em>of <em>the motion of Skinker's </em>administratrix against <em>Scott\u2019s </em>administrator, and undertook to defend that motion, the decree of the court of chancery on that motion was conclusive evidence on the motion of <em>Scott's </em>administrator against <em>Tankersley\u2019s </em>executor, and therefore the judgment of the county court was right, and that of the circuit court wrong.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b608-9\"><em>Leigh </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b608-10\"><em>Scott </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b608-11\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"AIy\">There is in the cause no exception to the admissibility of any of the evidence: its sufficiency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>is all that is in question. It is competent testimony, and moreover it is unco'ntradicted testimony. Whether parol evidence of the existence of the execution, and that it came to the hands of <em>Tanlcersley, </em>could have been admitted if objected to, is not now to be brought into question. It has not been objected to, but has been admitted as proper testimony. That it establishes the fact, is beyond question : and that is the main fact in the case; for if, as is proved, the execution came to <em>Tanlcersley's </em>hands, he has been guilty of the default, unless he can prove the return of it, or payment of the money, or some other matter of excuse; and if he cannot, the fine was properly imposed. To this, however, the defendant in error does not pretend. No countervailing evidence is offered by him; so that the case stands thus\u2014The witness proves that <em>Tanlcersley </em>had the execution; the defendant in error offers no proof that it was returned; and the record of the decree shews that the high sheriff was fined for the failure. The case is thus completely made out.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">It was much argued at the bar, that the record of the proceeding against the sheriff was evidence of nothing but the fact that there was a judgment, and furnished no proof that the execution came to <em>Tanlcersley's </em>hands. The argument was unnecessary, as the fact in question is proved by the witness, without the necessity of resorting to the record for proof of it. So that if there be nothing to countervail the facts above stated, there can be no doubt of the justice of the plaintiff\u2019s demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">It is contended, however, that the statute of limitations would have protected the plaintiff\u2019 in error, if he had properly defended himself, instead of suffering judgment to go by default. <em>Non constat </em>that this is so. If it were, it should have been relied on by the defendant in error on the <em>trial; </em>and peradventure the supposed bar might have been avoided. But if, upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>motion against him, he bad established the bar of the statute; if he had proved that he never had the execution; if he had shewn that it had never issued, or that it was duly returned, or that the money was paid,\u2014all would not have availed on <em>Scott's </em>motion against him, since it was his dutyto prove those facts on the creditor\u2019s motion against <em>Scott. </em>For that was in fact <em>his </em>suit; it was for the default of bis testator, and he had notice <em>from </em>the sheriff to defend it, and promised <em>that he </em>would attend to it. What farther duty devolved on. Scott? What obligation rested on him to attend farther to a case of which he knew nothing, which was in fact the cause of the deputy sheriff, and which that deputy\u2019s executor undertook to attend to ? Lulled into security by the defendant in error, can he be fairly charged with suffering judgment by default ? It was indeed by default; but it was the default of the defendant in error, who was bound <em>to defend it </em>and had promised to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">With these views, I think the judgment of the circuit court must be reversed. I regret that we cannot affirm that of the county court; but it is for too much, and is therefore also erroneous.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b610-5\">Stanard and Cabell, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AGu\">concurred with the president in the judgment entered in the court of appeals. After reversing the judgment of the circuit court with costs, and declaring that of the county court to be also erroneous, it was \u201c considered that the same be reversed and annulled, and that the plaintiff recover against the defendant 76 pounds 6 shillings and 7 pence, with interest on 45 pounds 11 shillings from the 19th of May 1827 till paid, and 22 dollars, and his costs about the motion in the said county court expended,\u201d to be levied &amp;c.
