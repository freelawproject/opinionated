The jury impannelled under this writ laid off an acre of land for the purpose of the abutment, which they appraised to 7 dollars 50 cents. They were farther of opinion, that if a dam of nine feet high were built, it would overflow a part of the lands of <em>John Irons junior, </em>an infant, and <em>William Hume's, </em>and they assessed the damage to 46 cents. Upon the return of the writ and in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>quisition, an order was made directing <em>Byars, </em>as guardian of <em>John Irons junior, </em>and <em>William Humes </em>to be summoned. On the 24th of November 1832, <em>Shugart, Byars </em>and <em>Humes </em>being fully heard, the petition of <em>Shugart </em>was dismissed : whereupon he appealed to the circuit court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-4\">The circuit court reversed the order of the county court dismissing the petition, and, proceeding to give such judgment as the county court ought to have given, ordered that the inquisition and all the proceedings thereon be set aside and annulled ; that a guardian <em>ad litem </em>be appointed for the infant <em>John Irons junior, </em>and that, after making such appointment, a new writ of <em>ad quod damnum </em>should be awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-5\">A copy of the decision of the circuit court being produced to the county court on the 24th of October 1833, it was accordingly ordered that <em>William Byars </em>be appointed guardian <em>ad litem </em>of the said <em>John Irons junior. </em>And thereupon a writ of <em>ad quod damnum </em>was awarded, to be executed on the 18th of November 1833. The inquisition was taken on the 18th and 19th of that month. The jury laid off an acre of land for the abutment, and appraised that acre, \u201c and what is overflowed of <em>John Irons </em>junior,\u201d to 13 dollars 8 cents. They were of opinion that if a dam of 8 feet 9 inches high were built, it would overflow a part of the land of said <em>John Irons junior </em>and <em>William Humes, </em>and they assessed the damage to <em>Humes </em>to 8 dollars. Upon the return of this inquisition, <em>Byars, </em>as guardian <em>ad litem </em>of <em>John Irons junior, </em>and <em>William Humes </em>were ordered to be summoned. On the 22d of March 1834, divers witnesses being sworn and examined, the petitioner, <em>Byars </em>and <em>Humes </em>fully heard, and all the circumstances weighed, the county court ordered that <em>Shugart </em>have leave to build the mill and dam, and that he become seized in fee simple of the acre of land located, upon his paying, to the respective persons entitled thereto, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>the valuation of the said acre, and the damages which the jury assessed for overflowing the lands of the said <em>John Irons junior </em>and <em>William, Humes. </em>Whereupon <em>By-</em>are, as guardian <em>ad </em>litem, and <em>Humes </em>appealed to the circuit court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-4\">In the circuit court, the appellants gave in evidence a transcript of the record of an order of the county court, made the 25th of October 1833, granting leave to <em>John </em>and <em>William Humes </em>to build a dam. Their application had only been made the 24th of that month. But they were stated to be the owners of the land on both sides, as well as the bed of the stream. And the writ awarded on the 24th was directed to be executed on the 25th. The inquisition was taken accordingly. The jury found that the land on both sides of the river belonged to the said <em>John </em>and <em>William Humes, </em>and were of opinion that if a dam ten feet high were' built, it would not overflow the lands of any other person.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-5\">The river was surveyed by <em>Charles F. Taylor, </em>who made a map which was exhibited in court, and the correctness of it being deposed to by him, it was made part of the record. The point designated on the map as No. 1. was admitted to be the place to which the proceedings of the county court on <em>Shugarfs </em>petition applied. The point to which the order in favour of <em>Humes </em>applied w7as No. 2. From No. 1. to No. 2. the distance was only 68 poles, and the fall 3 feet 9 inches/ <em>Humes </em>had, however, an equally good or b\u00e9tter seat at No. 6. which would be unaffected by <em>Shugart's </em>dam; the fall from No. 1. to No. 6. being 13 feet 1 inch.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-6\">The evidence of the witnesses examined in the circuit court was spread upon the record. One of them, <em>William H. </em>&gt; <em>Holt, </em>a builder of mills, well acquainted with the various millseats on the river belonging to the parties, deposed that <em>Shugarfs </em>dam of 8\u00a3 feet would wholly destroy the millseat at No. 2. worth, in his opinion, 1000 dollars. <em>Thomas Ochiltree, </em>another mill<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>wright, deposed that six or eight months previously, he had offered <em>Humes, </em>for the seat at No. 2.100 dollars per foot for an eight feet dam at that place, with sufficient land adjacent for a millhouse, and timber sufficient to construct a mill; which offer was refused. <em>Holt, </em>being reexamined, deposed that the two seats at No. <em>2. </em>and No. 6. would each be unaffected by a dam at the other\u2014that valuable mills or other machinery might be erected at both, and operate without injury to each other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-4\">It is not deemed material to state the evidence of the other witnesses. The statement concluded as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-5\">\u201c All errors existing in the record subsequent to the judgment of the circuit superior court of law and chancery of <em>Smyth </em>county, reversing the judgment of the county court of <em>Smyth, </em>and sending the cause back to that court for further proceedings, are waived in open court by the appellant and his counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-6\">\u201c It was stated by the witnesses <em>Holt </em>and <em>Ochiltree, </em>that if the appellee <em>Shugart </em>should be confined to a dam of a height, that would only throw back the water as far as his land extended up the river, his seat, in that event, would in their opinion be worth nothing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-7\">\u201cIt is agreed by the parties that <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>map referred to by the witnesses, with the indorsements thereon, is evidence in this cause.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-8\">The circuit court was of opinion that there was no error in the judgment of the county court, and affirmed the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-9\">On the petition of <em>Humes, </em>a <em>supersedeas </em>was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b359-10\"><em>M\u2019 Comas </em>and <em>Sheffey </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b359-11\"><em>Johnson </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b359-12\">Parker, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AKC\">The appellant <em>'Humes </em>having first obtained leave to build a mill at the point No. 2. in the map annexed to the record, (the parties admitting that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>to be the place to which the proceedings of the county court on the appellant\u2019s petition apply) and it being manifest, upon the proof, that a mill erected at No. 1. with a dam 8 feet 9 inches high, would destroy the privilege to build at No. 2. I think that the court ought, after granting leave to <em>Humes, </em>to have refused leave to <em>Shugart, </em>in the exercise of a sound discretion. The first order in favour of <em>Shugart </em>had been reversed and annulled by the superior court, and the case remanded to the county court for further proceedings. It was therefore as if it never existed, except that it might have been a reason with the county court for delaying a decision upon <em>Humes\u2019s </em>application, until a final decision upon <em>Shugart\u2019s. </em>But the court made the order giving leave to <em>Humes </em>on the 25th of October 1833, and that order was in full force, unreversed and not appealed from, when the order in favour of <em>Shugart </em>was made on the 22d of May 1834, from which the appeal was taken to the superior court, where the order was affirmed. In my opinion, the court ought to have reversed that order, not only on account of its interference with the privilege previously granted to <em>Humes, </em>the owner of the land on both sides the stream, but because the destruction of a valuable millsite owned by <em>Humes </em>at No. 2. proved to be worth from 800 to 1000 dollars, ought to have been taken into the estimate of the jury in awarding damages to <em>Humes, </em>notwithstanding he was the proprietor of another seat for water machinery higher up the stream at No. 6. as good or better than the one at No. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The only difficulty in the case is, that the appellant is stated to have waived \u201c all errors existing in <em>the record, </em>subsequent to the judgment of the circuit court reversing the first judgment of the county court and sending the cause back for further proceedings.\u201d The object could not have been to waive the error of the superior court in affirming against the evidence which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>it was then hearing. The waiver was probably made before the witnesses were examined, and was intended to apply to the proceedings as they appeared on the record of the county court. After this entry, some evidence appears to have been taken, and some admisr sions were made for the purpose of bringing the case fully and fairly before this court; and it would be absurd to suppose that the appellant or his counsel intended to waive <em>all </em>errors in a proceeding he was about to appeal from. This entry, therefore, ought not to stand in the way of deciding the cause upon its merits; and upon those merits, I am of opinion that the order of the county court in favour of <em>Shugart </em>ought to have been reversed, and his petition dismissed with costs, and consequently that the judgment of the superior court affirming that order ought to be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\">But this judgment is not intended to prevent any new proceeding on the part of <em>Shugart, </em>to erect a dam which will only throw back the water in such manner as to leave the privilege granted to <em>Humes </em>unimpaired and unaffected.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Stanard and Cabell, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b361-5\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ao1T\">I concur entirely in that part of the opinion of my brother <em>Parker </em>which respects the merits of the controversy. I have some doubts yet remaining as to the effect of the waiver of error, since it would seem to waive all errors in the county court, and of course the error of that court in giving leave to <em>Shugart </em>to build his mill. I have no doubt it was an inadvertence, and therefore the more readily surrender the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Judgments of both courts reversed, and petition of appellee dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
