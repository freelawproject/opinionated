Code, ch. 75. \u00a7 5. an <em>indictment </em>for employing or harbouring a free negro or mulatto, contrary to the statute Id. ch. 111. \u00a7 75. is a regular proceeding.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AJD\">What is a sufficient indictment for such offence.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b697-23\">In the circuit superior court of <em>Mason, </em>at April term 1838, the grand jury found an indictment against <em>Henry J. Fisher </em>for a misdemeanour. The indictment contained two counts. The <em>first </em>charged that <em>Henry J. Fisher, </em>on &amp;c. at the county aforesaid, \u201c did unlawfully em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>ploy and harbour <em>John, </em>a free negro man, who has been emancipated within the commonwealth of <em>Virginia </em>since the first day of May 1806, and has unlawfully remained in the county of <em>Mason </em>and commonwealth aforesaid, from the time of his emancipation until &amp;c. being a period of more than twelve months after his title to freedom accrued, and after he had attained the age of twenty-one years, without having obtained leave so to do according to law, and without having his certificate registered in the said county of <em>Mason, </em>contrary to the form of the statute &amp;c.\u201d The <em>second </em>count charged that the said <em>Henry J. Fisher, </em>on &amp;c. at the county aforesaid <em>&amp;c. \u201c </em>did unlawfully employ and harbour <em>John, </em>a free negro man, going at large and hiring himself out to labour in the said county, without having his certificate of freedom registered in the said county of <em>Mason, </em>and without having in his possession a certified copy of the said certificate, contrary to the form of the statute &amp;c.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b698-3\">A summons having been awarded against the defendant, he appeared, and put in a general demurrer to the indictment, in which the attorney for the commonwealth joined. After argument, the court overruled the demurrer, and proceeded to render judgment against the defendant for a fine of five dollars and the costs of prosecution. To this judgment the general court, on the petition of <em>Fisher, </em>awarded a writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b698-4\">The cause was argued in writing, by the <em>plaintiff in error.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Adv\"><em>1. </em>He maintained, that it was a familiar principle of law, that where a statute creates an offence, and inflicts a penalty, which it directs to be recovered in a particular manner or before a particular forum, the penalty cannot be recovered in any other manner or before any other forum. Now, by the statute under which this prosecution is instituted, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 111. ^ 75. p. 441. the penalty is made recoverable by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>warrant before a justice of the peace. And though, by the statute 1 Rev. Code, ch. 75. \u00a7 5. p. 265. a grand jury for a superior court is empowered to present all offences made penal by the laws of the commonwealth, although the recovery of the fines for such offences be otherwise directed, except where the penalty is less than five dollars, yet that statute, in terms, authorizes a proceeding by <em>presentment </em>only; and the statute 1 Rev. Code, ch. 169. \u00a7 65. p. 614. which prescribes the mode of proceeding in the superior courts for offences where the penalties exceed not 20 dollars, enacts that in a <em>presentment </em>to the court for such offence, no <em>information </em>thereupon shall be filed; manifesting the intent and understanding of the legislature, that the presentments authorized by the 5th section of the 75th chapter must be such, whereupon, but for the prohibitory enactment in the 169th chapter, an information might regularly and properly be filed; presentments in the strict sense of the term, as distinguished from <em>indictments, </em>in respect to which the prohibition was unnecessary and nugatory. As to the distinction between presentments and indictments, he referred to 1 Chitt. Crim. Law, american edi. of 1832, p. 163. Terms de la Ley, 265. Jacob\u2019s Law Diet, title <em>Presentment, </em>and as to the necessity of proceeding in the particular mode pointed out by the statute, to the cases of <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>2 Leigh 721. <em>White </em>v. <em>King &amp;c. </em>5 Leigh 726. <em>Sims </em>v. <em>Alderson, </em>8 Leigh 479. <em>Ex parte Fisher, </em>6 Leigh 619.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b699-6\">2. He contended, that the first count is defective, because it does not allege, otherwise than by implication, that the negro remained in the commonwealth more than twelve months after his right to freedom accrued; citing <em>Jacobs et al. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>2 Leigh 709.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b699-7\">3. He submitted, that the first count ought to have charged that the employing and harbouring was with knowledge on the part of the defendant that the negro <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>was remaining in the commonwealth contrary to law. On this point he cited <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Burridge, </em>3 P. Wms. 439.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b700-5\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahr\">Judgment affirmed with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"By\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b700-6\"> the 61st section of the act concerning slaves, free negroes and mulattoes, 1 Rev.
