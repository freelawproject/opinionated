Some part of the debt was made on <em>executions sued out </em>on the judgment against <em>Machir </em>and levied on his property; but far the greater part of it remained to be paid by the indorsers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A31\">The note of <em>Machir', </em>on which <em>E. M\u2019Carty, Armstrong </em>and <em>P. M'Carty </em>were his indorsers at <em>The Cumberland Bank of Alleghany, </em>was a note dated the 26th August ISIS, for 6000 dollars payable sixty days after date, which came to maturity on the 28th October, and was regularly protested for nonpayment; but it did not appear that any notice of the dishonour of the note was given to the indorsers. The bank brought an action on the note, in 1819, against <em>Machir, </em>the maker, and, after a, long contest, recovered judgment against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>him in May 1825, which proved unavailing, for <em>Machir </em>was then insolvent. The bank also brought an action against each of the three indorsers, but suffered non-suits in those actions in May 1823. What was the obstacle to the recovery against the indorsers, was not stated, and did not distinctly appear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-4\">In the meantime, the decree of the court of chancery in favour of <em>Higgins\u2019s </em>executors against <em>Machir </em>having been affirmed by the court of appeals, <em>Carthrae, </em>the' surety of <em>Machir </em>in the appeal bond, became liable for a balance of the debt due by the decree, after applying the proceeds of sale of a parcel of land, which was subjected to the debt, towards the satisfaction of it; and the creditors under the decree commenced proceedings against <em>Machir </em>and <em>Carthrae, </em>to recover the balance due them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-5\">Whereupon, <em>Carthrae, </em>in 1822, exhibited a bill in the superior court of chancery of <em>Winchester, </em>against <em>Machir, </em>the trustees named in the deed of trust of July 1820, <em>Hopewell </em>and <em>Dailey, Machir's </em>indorsers at <em>The Farmers Bank, E. M\u2019 Gariy, Armstrong </em>and <em>P. M\u2019 Gariy, Machir\u2019s </em>indorsers at <em>The Cumberland Bank, </em>and the other <em>ccstuis que trust </em>named in the <em>deed; </em>representing, that all of them had been already fully indemnified from all loss by reason of their suretyships and indorsements for <em>Machir </em>(some out of the trust subject, and some out of other property of <em>Machir </em>applied to the purpose), except the plaintiff <em>Carthrae, </em>and <em>E. M\u2019Carty, Armstrong </em>and <em>P. M\u2019Carty, </em>the indorsers at <em>The Cumberland Bank, </em>but that the debt due to that bank was not recoverable from the indorsers; and praying, that the remaining trust Subject should be sold, and the proceeds applied to the indemnification of the plaintiff from his liability as surety of <em>Machir </em>in the appeal bond. <em>Hopewell </em>and <em>Dailey, </em>in their answers to this bill, stated, that the debt due to <em>The Farmers Bank, </em>for which they were bound as- <em>Machir's </em>indorsers, had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>not been paid, nor had they been indemnified against loss on that account otherwise than by the deed of trust, and that the bank had brought suit against them for the debt, which was yet pending. <em>E. M\u2019Carty, Armstrong </em>and P. <em>M\u2019Carty answered, </em>that suits had been brought by <em>The Cumberland Bank </em>against them as indorsers of <em>Machir </em>on the note for 6000 dollars; that they were advised, the bank could not recover against them in any of the courts of this state, because <em>that bank was a corporation created by another state, </em>and <em>in consequence of the great indulgence extended by the bank to Machir after the note became due; </em>but if they should be held liable <em>for the debt, they </em>claimed the benefit of the indemnity provided for them by the deed of trust. As to all the other <em>cestuis que trust </em>in the deed, made defendants to <em>Carthrae\u2019s </em>bill, it appeared by their answers and by an account taken by order of the- court in the progress of the cause, that they had sustained no loss by reason of their suretyships for <em>Machir, </em>nor probably would sustain any. And, in May 1823, pending this suit of <em>Carthrae, The Farmers 'Bank </em>recovered judgments in their suits against <em>Hopewell </em>and <em>Bailey; </em>and <em>The Cumberland Bank </em>suffered nonsuits in their actions against <em>E. M\u2019Carty, Armstrong </em>and P. <em>M\u2019Carty, </em>so that they no longer claimed for themselves any indemnification under the deed of trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-4\">The court ordered a sale of the trust subject by the marshal, which was made accordingly. And the marshal having paid into court the sum of 3266 dollars collected of the proceeds of the sale, the court directed a commissioner to state an account of the claims of the <em>cestuis que trust </em>under the deed of trust, and to apportion the fund rateably among them. The commissioner reported, that the debt due to <em>Hopewell </em>and <em>Dailey </em>for their liability as indorsers for <em>Machir </em>at <em>The Farmers Bank, </em>was 3408 dollars 67 cents, and the debt due to <em>Carthrae </em>on <em>account of </em>his suretyship for <em>Machir </em>in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>appeal bond, was 874 dollars; and that there were no other parties to be indemnified: that, therefore, the proportion of the fund of 3266 dollars to be paid to <em>Carthrae, </em>was 666 dollars 51 cents, and the proportion thereof to be paid to <em>Hopewell </em>and <em>Dailey, </em>2599 dollars 49 cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-4\">Upon the hearing, in 1825, the court, as it appeared that the plaintiff <em>Carthrae, </em>and the defendants <em>Hopewell </em>and <em>Dailey, </em>were the only parties named and provided for in the deed of trust, who had as yet suffered any loss or damage so as to entitle them to demand indemnification out of the trust subject, decreed, therefore, that 666 dollars 51 cents (the rateable proportion of the fund reported to be due to <em>Carthrae) </em>should be paid to <em>Jacob Williamson, </em>the assignee of <em>Carthrae, </em>and 2599 dollars 49 cents (the rateable proportion thereof due to <em>Hopewell </em>and <em>Dailey) </em>should be paid to them, upon <em>Hopewell </em>and <em>Dailey </em>entering into bond to their <em>cocestuis que trust </em>in the deed,'in the penalty of 5000 dollars, with condition to pay them a rateable proportion of the trust fund, in case they should afterwards be compelled to pay any thing as sureties for <em>Machir, </em>as provided by that deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-5\">After the decree in the above mentioned suit of <em>Carthrae </em>against his <em>co-cestuis que trust </em>had been pronounced, the present suit was commenced ; which was a bill exhibited by <em>The Cumberland Bank, </em>in the superior court . of chancery of <em>Winchester, </em>against <em>Carthrae </em>and his assignee <em>Williamson, Hopewell </em>and the administrator of <em>Dailey </em>(the indorsers for <em>Machir </em>at <em>The Farmers Bank), E.

The court is of opinion, that a deed of trust to indemnify a surety is, in equity, looked upon as a security for the debt, and not as a mere personal favour to the surety; and hence <em>Machir\u2019s </em>deed of trust of July 1820, for the purpose (among other things) of securing the <em>M\u2019Cartys </em>and <em>Armstrong </em>against their indorsements, enured at once to the benefit of <em>The Cumberland Bank, </em>and the interest thus acquired existed, even though the indorsers became discharged for want of notice of protest, or otherwise, if such was the fact.\u201d Therefore, the court, approving the commissioner\u2019s apportionment of the fund, decreed that <em>Hopewell </em>and <em>Dailey\u2019s </em>administrator should pay <em>The Cumberland Bank </em>1625 dollars with interest &amp;c. and that <em>Williamson, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>assignee of <em>Carthrae, </em>should pay the bank 420 dollars with interest &amp;c. and that the bank might take out any proper executions for the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ag2\">From this decree, <em>Hopewell </em>and <em>Hailey's </em>administrator aPPea^ec\u00a1- 1\u00b0 this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b238-6\"><em>Johnson </em>and <em>Leigh, </em>for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADJ\">referred to <em>Machir's </em>deed of trust of July 1820, and shewed that, both in its terms and manifest intent, it merely provided an indemnification for the indorsers of the note for his accommodation at <em>The Cumberland Bank, </em>in case (only in case) they should sustain loss by reason of their indorsement. They had sustained no such loss, but, on <em>the </em>contrary, had been discharged (it was immaterial how) from all liability. The bank, therefore, could have no claim to participate in the trust subject, unless the principle declared in the chancellor\u2019s decree was correct; namely, that the deed of trust was not merely an indemnification for the indorsers, to the benefit of which the bank, if it had so dealt with- the note as to hold them bound, would have been entitled to be subrogated, but it enured to the bank, directly and immediately, as a security for the debt due on <em>Machir's </em>note; so that, though the indorsers were discharged from liability by the laches of the bank or otherwise, and so never became bound to the bank for the debt, nor ever sustained any loss whatever by reason of their indorsement, the bank was yet entitled, in equity, to the benefit of the deed of trust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-7\">They said, the right of a creditor to claim the benefit of counter or. collateral security obtained by a <em>surety </em>from the principal debtor, was founded in plain equity, and was not to be controverted; yet the authority to the precise point was very scant. They had found none but the <em>obiter dictum </em>of sir <em>W. Grant </em>in <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Morley, </em>11 Ves. 22. and the short note of the case of <em>Maure </em>v. <em>Harrison, 1 </em>Eq. Ca. Abr. 93, pi. 5. and the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>searches of judge <em>Carr, </em>who stated the proposition, <em>ar</em>guendo, in <em>M\u2019Mahon </em>v. <em>Fawcett, </em>5 Rand. 529. and of judge <em>Story, </em>who also stated it in his treatise on Equity, \u00a7 502. p. 481. had, in truth, discovered no other, as would be seen on an examination of their references. They apprehended, that the <em>principle </em>on which this equity of a creditor in such a case was founded, was quite obvious; but they were not aware, that it had been any where judicially explained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-4\">Let the doctrine as stated in <em>Maure </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>be taken according to the <em>letter, </em>without regard to the principle on which it was founded\u2014\u201c A bond creditor shall, in this court, have the benefit of all counter bonds or collateral security given by the principal to the surety; as if A. owes B. money, and he and C. are bound for it, and A. gives C. a mortgage or bond to indemnify him, B. shall have the benefit of it to recover his debt.\u201d The proposition, as they understood it, was, that where there was a surety for a principal debtor, bound for or with him, absolutely bound and continuing so bound, if the surety should obtain counter or collateral security for his indemnification from the principal debtor, equity, in such case, would give the creditor the benefit of such counter or collateral security. But put the case, that one not actually bound for or with a debtor as surety for the debt, but only apprehending that he might become so bound, should obtain a mortgage from the debtor to indemnify him from the apprehended danger, but, in the event, should never become bound as surety for the debt; could equity,- in such case, give the creditor the benefit of such a counter security, which, as to the party who obtained it, was certainly amere nullity ? This, they said, was, in effect, the present case. For the indorsers of the note for <em>Machir's </em>accommodation at <em>The Cumberland Bank, </em>did not contract the obligation of sureties for the debt to the bank: their undertaking was collateral, conditional, executory\u2014that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>the bank should use due diligence to get payment of the note from the maker at its maturity, and failing with such diligence to get payment from him, should give the indorsers due notice of dishonour; then they would pay the debt; then they would stand absolutely bound as sureties for it to the bank; else, they should not be bound for it at all. Such being the contract of the indorsers with the bank, they obtained a mortgage from the maker, to avail them for their indemnification, in case the bank had so dealt with the note as to hold them eventually liable for its contents. It was, on their part, a mere measure of precaution. The bank had neglected to take the proper measures to hold them bound: they never became sureties for the debt: they were discharged from the liability against which they were indemnified, and never incurred any loss. The mortgage, therefore, so far as the indorsers were concerned, and to the utmost extent of the purpose for which it was designed, was no longer a subsisting security. Equity could not give it a force and effect beyond its purpose, for the benefit of the creditor by whose own neglect its purpose had been annulled, when the parties for whose benefit it was designed could claim nothing under it for themselves. If, indeed, there had been a special agreement between the bank, <em>Machir </em>the maker, and the indorsers, that <em>Machir </em>should give the bank a security for the debt in the form of an indemnification to the indorsers, that might have given the bank a distinct ground of equity to stand on; though it would still have been very doubtful, whether such a ground was tenable, as against the other <em>cestuis que trust </em>provided for by the deed of trust, if they were no parties to such special agreement. But there was nothing of the kind in the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-4\">However, they said, the court must ascertain the reason, the principle, on which this equity of a creditor to claim the benefit of counter securities given by the principal debtor to the surety was founded, in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>ascertain whether <em>The Cumberland Bank </em>had just claim to the relief which the decree gave it. They insisted, that it was, and could be, no other than the equitable principle of subrogation. The decree declared a distinct principle of equity: that securities given by a principal debtor to his sureties for their indemnification, enured, directly and immediately, to the benefit of the creditor as a security for the debt; and therefore, <em>Machias </em>deed of trust enured at once to the benefit of the bank, and the interest it thus acquired existed, even though the indorsers were discharged from liability by the laches of the bank.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-4\">They said, this principle declared in the decree was peculiar, and, they thought, wholly new. They could find no colour of authority for it, or, at most, only co-lour of authority. It might be thought, perhaps, that the reasoning of judge <em>Carr </em>in <em>M'Mahon </em>v. <em>Fawcett, 5 </em>Rand. 529. 533. gave countenance to it: but an examination of the judge\u2019s opinion in that case would shew, that he did not intend to affirm any such principle; that he had no thought of any principle distinct from the equitable principle of subrogation, which it was his purpose to explain, and to shew its application to the case before him. If any vague expressions escaped him, that seemed to indicate the principle declared by the chancellor in this case, such expressions, on a point which it was nowise necessary he should decide, ought not to be made the foundation of a new and distinct principle of equity. Certainly, no such principle was indicated in the few authorities that had been cited for the equitable claim of a creditor to the benefit of counter securities given by the principal debtor to the surety. The note of the case of <em>Maure </em>v. <em>Harrison </em>merely affirmed this equity of the creditor, without indicating the reason on which it was founded. But sir <em>W. Grant, </em>in <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Morley, </em>plainly considered it as belonging to the doctrine of subrogation: he said, \u201c I conceive. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>that as the creditor is entitled to the benefit of all the securities the principal debtor has given to his surety, the surety has full as good an equity to the benefit of all securities the principal gives to the creditor;\u201d thus placing the equity of the <em>surety, </em>in the one case, and that of the <em>creditor, </em>in the other, on the same ground and then he proceeded to shew, that the equity of the <em>surety </em>was founded on the principle of subrogation; that \u201c the surety had precisely the same right that the creditor had, and was to stand in his place;\u201d that he <em>\u201chad </em>no direct contract or engagement\u201d\u2014\u201cbut only a claim through the medium of the creditor, and was entitled only to stand in his place.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-4\">They asked the court to look to the consequences of the principle declared by the chancellor. For instance, if the indorsers, in consideration of value paid them by their <em>co-cestuis que trust, </em>and of another security given them by <em>Machir </em>for their indemnification, had actually released their rights under the deed, and then the bank had by its own laches discharged the indorsers from liability to it, the bank, upon the principle of this decree, would still have had a right to the benefit not only of the second security, but of this mortgage also, though the bank had contracted for no security but the engagement of the indorsers, and though the bank had released the indorsers from their liability, and the indorsers had released this mortgage. For, if this deed enured, directly and immediately, as a security to the bank, the indorsers\u2019 release of it could not have divested the rights of the bank under it; and the bank\u2019s release of the indorsers from personal liability would have left their rights under the deed unimpaired. And if the bank, having discharged the indorsers from their liability, had neglected to sue <em>Machir </em>upon the note till the statute of limitations had barred their action; still, supposing the bank entitled to claim under the mortgage directly as a mortgagee, it might, at any time within twenty years, come into a court of equity to foreclose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Then, considering <em>The Cumberland Bank </em>as claiming participation in the trust subject mortgaged by the deed of trust for the benefit of <em>Machir's </em>sureties and indorsers therein mentioned, on the equitable principle of subrogation, they said, it was clear that the bank could not be entitled to such relief. A creditor holding the obligation of principal debtor and surety, and having existing right and remedy against both, was entitled, in equity, to be subrogated to the benefit of all counter securities given by the principal to the surety, of which the surety could avail himself for his indemnification ; to be subrogated, namely, to the rights and remedies of the surety, who was answerable to the creditor, against the principal, who was answerable not only to him but to the surety also in case he should be charged. In such a case, subrogation only avoided circuity of action. But subrogation could only have place, when the creditor had right or remedy against the surety, for which he could be subrogated to him, and the surety had right or remedy against the principal, to which the creditor could be subrogated. <em>The Cumberland Bank </em>had no right or remedy against the indorsers; and the indorsers, consequently, had no right to participate, in the trust fund. Having suffered no loss, and being relieved from all danger of loss, they could claim no indemnification. There were no rights or remedies belonging to either party on which subrogation could operate. It was true that subrogation was not the result of express contract between the parties, but of equity acting upon their relative rights; yet the rights on which equity so acted, must be rights resulting from contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-4\">New as the authorities were upon the precise question of subrogation presented in this case, the adjudications on the principle of subrogation, in analogous cases, were very numerous. And, they said, it would be found, that no one could be subrogated to another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>who had himself no right or remedy, and against whom the party seeking subrogation had not and never had any right or remedy: right or remedy actually subsisting : or right or remedy, which, though extinguished at law, was yet subsisting by intendment of equity; as if one bound for a debt with or for another who ought to pay it, should pay the debt, equity regarded the rights and remedies of the creditor against the principal debt- or as still subsisting for the benefit of the surety; for there, the creditor once had right and remedy against the principal debtor, and though these were extinguished at law by the surety\u2019s payment of the debt, yet, in the view of equity, he extinguished them only for himself, and for his benefit they should be regarded as still subsisting. By the civil law, the surety, in such cases, had a right to demand of the creditor an actual cession of all his actions against the principal; and the equitable doctrine of subrogation is founded on the same principle, though moulded in a different form.

The only case I have met with directly deciding that principle is that of <em>Maure </em>v. <em>Harrison. </em>The same principle, however, is asserted in several other cases, as one perfectly well established, and is referred to by the elementary writers as not at all questionable. The case of <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Morley </em>was one of a surety seeking to avail himself of a specific fund assigned by the principal debtor for the payment of an annuity, and sir <em>W. Grant </em>said \u201c that as the creditor is entitled to the benefit of all the securities the principal debtor has given to his sureties, the surety has full as good an equity to the benefit of all the securities the principal gives to the creditorthus reasoning from the first proposition, as a postulate requiring no support from authority. Nor has the doctrine been denied in/ the argument of the case at bar 5 .it is conceded, that if^ a <em>surety </em>is <em>bound </em>for the debt, and is indemnified by the <em>\\ </em>principal debtor, the creditor may pursue the indemni- &lt; ty, in exoneration of the liability of the surety. <em>And </em>this arises not from any notion of mutual contract between the parties, that in providing for the surety, the creditor shall be equally provided for, but from a principle of natural equity independent of contract; namely, that to prevent the surety from being first harassed ' for the debt or liability, and then turning him round to \u2018 seek redress from the collateral security given by the i; principal, a court of equity will authorize, and even en-? courage, the creditor to claim through <em>the medium o\u00ed </em>thet surety, all the rights he has thus acquired, to be exercised for his benefit, and in discharge of his obligations. The claim of the creditor, therefore, is as much founded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>on the well known doctrine of substitution, as the claim of the surety to stand in the place of the creditor who has received collateral security from the debtor; and, in my opinion, it has no other foundation. For when ^ principal debtor conveys property to his surety, not specifically bound to the creditor, he has no intention of giving any lien to the creditor, or to pledge the property to <em>him </em>for the debt; and as he has a right to dis-J pose of his property as he pleases, provided he com-(I mils no fraud, the court will not construe the instrument giving the lien beyond the intent; although it will, to effect the exoneration of innocent sureties, permit <em>their </em>substitution to the creditor\u2019s rights, or <em>his </em>substitution to theirs. By the civil law, this principle of natural justice was carried into effect by an actual cession of the action or debt; and this serves to mark the extent and nature of this doctrine, which we have evidently derived from that source. I cannot, therefore, agree ! that the deed of July 1820, to secure the <em>M\u2019Cartys </em>and <em>VArmstrong </em>against their indorsements, enured at once to <em>The Cumberland Bank, </em>as if it had been specially named as one of the <em>cestuis que trust </em>in the conveyance; and that the interest thus acquired existed even if the indorsers became discharged for want of notice of protest or otherwise. The obligation of <em>Machir </em>to the bank was not increased, or intended to be increased, by this transaction considered in itself; nor can it be construed into any new promise or acknowledgment of indebtedness on the part of the indorsers, superadded to the liability they had already incurred by their indorsement. The whole object of <em>Machir </em>was to secure s his indorsers against their contingent liability, by givjf ing them a specific lien on property, whilst they re-I mained at full liberty to contest the right of the credii tor to hold them responsible upon their indorsements. Considering the transaction in the light of a contract, it had this effect and no more; and if the bank has any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>claim, it must be derived <em>through </em>the sureties, on the principle of substitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">What then was the claim which the sureties had under the deed of July 1820 ? They had entered into a conditional engagement for <em>Machir, </em>which might bind them absolutely, in certain contingencies. If the paper they indorsed was common law paper, their undertaking was to pay after due diligence used by the creditor to obtain payment from the obligor, and a return of <em>nulla bona, </em>unless sufficient excuse was shewn for not pursuing the debtor: if the paper is treated as mercantile paper, (as I think it ought to be) their engagement was, that it should be duly honoured ; and if not, that they, the indorsers, would on the default of the drawer or maker, and due notice given to them of such default, pay the amount. This was the exteut and limit of their implied contract; and when the deed of July 1820 was made, it is not shewn that such contract had become an absolute and unconditional one. That deed merely recites the fact that the <em>M'Cartys </em>and <em>Armstrong </em>had become indorsers for <em>Machir </em>on a note for 6000 dollars in <em>The Cumberland Banh, </em>upon which suit had been brought against <em>Machir, </em>and that he was willing to secure them against all loss or damage in consequence of thus becoming his indorsers. It contains no intimation, in any part of it, that the indorsers were fixed for the debt, or that the bank had taken the proper steps to make them liable. If the deed, however, had been made for their indemnification only, and there had been no other <em>cestuis que trust, </em>it is very possible, that opposition to the claim of the creditor might be ineffectual; for the <em>M' Gariys </em>and <em>Armstrong </em>would have no interest to make it, and the principal debtor could scarcely object, in a court of equity, to the application of any portion of his property in discharge of a just debt. On that point, it is not necessary to give an opinion; for here, the deed was made for the indemnification of other sureties of <em>Machir, </em>who have been made respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>sible for more than the whole trust subiect has been sold for; and they, I think, have a right to raise the question of the title of other sureties to participate in the fund. The deed was unquestionably made for the the sureties, and no one of them was to have priority over the other. It was made to protect them against loss or damage .incurred or threatened, <em>arising out of liability; </em>and it was the evident intention of the grantor, that all should be completely secured; and, as a consequence, that if some were discharged from their obligations or were never bound, the benefit designed should enure to the rest, to the full extent of their engagements for him. This would be quite plain if the creditor had not interposed between them ; and if <em>he </em>claims by substitution, and his right is subordinate to that of the sureties and derived through them (as I think it is) he can stand in no better situation than if a surety were applying to the court for protection \u25a0against loss or danger. In such case, the other sureties, being directly interested in throwing the burden off the fund, for their own complete exoneration, would have a right to require the applicant to make out a case of liability for the principal debtor, bringing him within the terms and intention of the deed of trust. The bill in this case does not charge, that the <em>M\u2019Cartys </em>and <em>Armstrong </em>were ever liable for the debt. It does not even charge, that a demand had ever been made upon them for it. It makes, indeed, the proceedings in <em>Carthrae\u2019s. </em>suit a part of the record in this case; and in their answers to <em>Carthrae\u2019s </em>bill, the <em>M\u2019Cartys </em>and <em>Armstrong </em>do state that a suit had been brought against them ; but they also allege, that they are advised the bank cannot recover against them in any of the courts of this state, because it is a corporation created in another state, and in consequence of the great indulgenPe extended to <em>Machir </em>by the bank; yet they are unwilling to relinquish any right under the deed of trust until they are finally exonerated. <em>Carthrae </em>also alleges that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>the <em>M\u2019Cartys </em>and <em>Armstrong </em>are released; and shortly after their answers were filed, the bank suffered non-suits in the actions it had brought against them. Suppose, then, the <em>M\u2019Cartys </em>and <em>Armstrong </em>were plaintiffs asking for participation in this fund, and stating all the facts which appear in the bill filed by the bank, and in their own answers to <em>Carthrae\u2019s </em>bill, together with the additional fact that in May 1823, three years before the commencement of their suit, the bank had abandoned its claim against them; and the other sureties had resisted that prayer'of their bill: would the court have been justified in taking away from such other sureties, a portion of the fund already insufficient to indemnify them for actual losses sustained, and in decreeing its payment to the <em>M\u2019Cartys </em>and <em>Armstrong, </em>or impounding it for their benefit? I think not; and, therefore, I think the decree is erroneous in directing the payment to a plaintiff standing in their place. It is the more objectionable, because, in my opinion, the proceedings in the cause, as well as the absence of any proof, or even of any allegation, that the steps necessary to charge the indorsers had been taken by the bank, authorize us to conclude, that they never were liable for this debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">It is not necessary to notice, particularly, the numerous cases cited, illustrative of the doctrine of subrogation, since all of them are cases of rights and remedies actually existing; and the expressions sometimes used by the judges to explain the right of a creditor or surety to resort to a lien, as that \u201cit is the property of the principal debtor pledged for the debt\u201d (though not to the creditor or surety), must be taken in reference to the subject matter under discussion, and to the facts appearing in the case. Thus considered, there is nothing in the case of <em>M\u2019Mahon </em>v. <em>Fawcett, </em>or in any other referred to, which is inconsistent with this opinion. No more is meant, than that if the property is pledged to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>either the creditor or the surety, though not to the person seeking to charge it, it may be reached by substitution in a court of equity, without regard to the intention of the contracting parties. But still the party who seeks to be subrogated, must shew that the person, to whom the property is pledged or any other counter security is given, has or would have had a right, in the contemplation of a court of equity, to claim the benefit of the indemnification, by being one liable for the debt or obligation, or entitled to charge the fund <em>pledged; </em>and that the plaintiff has a subsisting equity to enforce the lien, or the counter security, in the same manner as if there were an actual cession of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The result of this view of the case is, that the decree must be reversed, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b250-9\">Cabell, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Aqnk\">Concurring in the general views expressed by judge <em>Parker, 1 </em>deem it necessary to say a word only. <em>The Cumberland Bank </em>is no party to the deed, the benefit of which it now seeks. The property is not conveyed to the bank, nor for its benefit. The declared object of the deed is to secure the indorsers from all or any loss or damage which they or either of them may sustain in consequence of their indorsement. There is no provision for effecting this indemnification by any payment directly to the bank, which might render a resort to the indorsers unnecessary; for the deed does not purport to give the bank a right, under any circumstances whatever, to call for a sale of the property, or an application of the proceeds. The deed prescribes a different mode for effecting its object, the indemnification of the indorsers. The indorsers are to be \u201c called upon,\u201d or the amount of the note \u201c demanded from them, <em>as indorsers, </em>in consequence of the | failure of Machir\u201d to pay the same. <em>They </em>are to re-j quest the sale of the property, and the proceeds of the ! sale are directed to be paid, directly, to <em>them. </em>If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>bank, then, is to be let in to any benefit from this deed, it cannot be on the ground of any contract between the grantor and the bank, or on the ground of any direction or intention, express or implied, on the part of the grantor, in its favour : it can only be on the well known principle of subrogation ; the right of a creditor to stand in the place of the surety. But this right must be unavailing to the bank, in this case, if, in fact, the indorsers themselves have not now, and never had, any right to call for the application of these funds. It is true that the indorsers incurred a contingent liability, by the mere act of indorsement; a liability depending on the condition that the note should be duly proceeded with, that <em>Machir </em>should fail to pay it at maturity, that the note should be protested, and that due notice thereof should be given to the indorsers. But if this condition was not complied with, the indorsers were as much discharged from liability, as if they never had indorsed. How stands the fact in this case ? The bill filed by the bank does not allege that any notice was given to the indorsers; and there is no proof of the fact. The other defendants in the cause were deeply interested in the question, and had a right to demand proof of notice to the indorsers (so as to fix their liability) before the indorsers, or those claiming under them, should be allowed to participate in the fund. Notice not being proved, we must regard it as not 'having been given, The indorsers, therefore, never were liable for the payment of this note; and, consequently, never had a right to call for the application of funds to its payment. And if <em>they </em>never had such right, I cannot perceive how the bank, claiming only <em>through them, </em>can have such right.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">I am of opinion that the .decree be reversed and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Brooke, J. concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Decree reversed, and bill dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
