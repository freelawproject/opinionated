In answer to the first four questions of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, <em>Vogdes </em>deposed that he was a house joiner and carpenter, and was at work at colo. <em>Ware's </em>building (the defendant\u2019s) from the date of the first article in the account for a period of from nine to twelve months; that he had examined the account and found it correct; that he was a stranger in the neighbourhood, and became acquainted with <em>Stephenson </em>about five weeks previous to the commencement of the account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-7\">The fifth and sixth questions, and the answers thereto, were as follow's : \u201c 5th <em>question. </em>What induced you to run up said account, and on whose authority was it commenced ? Stale all you recollect of the origination of the account. <em>Answer. </em>I was frequently solicited by mr. <em>Stephenson </em>to divide my custom with the merchants of the place, and I told mr. <em>Stephenson </em>1 must consult colo. <em>Ware </em>first, which I did, and colo. <em>Ware </em>and myself went to mr. <em>Stephenson </em>and had a conversation with him at the door of the store. Colo. <em>Ware </em>stated to mr. <em>Stephenson </em>that I was engaged on a building for him, and would want to be furnished with different articles out of his store, and that he <em>(Ware) </em>could not pay him for the articles until next harvest come one year. Mr. <em>Stephenson </em>assented to it, and received my orders for goods from that time until within three months of the finishing of colo. <em>Ware's </em>building. 6th <em>question. </em>Upon whose promise or undertaking to pay for the goods in said account, were they furnished by mr. <em>Stephenson </em>? <em>Answer. </em>I was induced to believe they were furnished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>upon colo. <em>Ware\u2019s </em>agreement to pay for them. I was a stranger, and did not think mr. <em>Stephenson </em>would eredit me, but it was to come out of the money which colo. <em>Ware </em>would owe me at the finishing of his building.\u201d '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-4\">Upon the cross examination, there were the following questions and answers: \u201c 7th <em>question. </em>Will you state whether the articles charged in the account you have alluded to were got for your own use and bene6t ? <em>Answer. </em>Yes, sir; for the benefit of myself, my family and hands. <em>Question. </em>In the conversation you have spoken of at the store door, was the understanding of the parties that mr. <em>Ware </em>was to stand as security for you ? <em>Answer. </em>That was the way I understood it, and that mr. <em>Ware </em>was to pay for the goods out of such moneys as might be due when the building was finished, and that mr. <em>Ware </em>was to be my paymaster, and to reserve'it out of such money as might be due me, upon a settlement with mr. <em>Ware </em>when the building was done. <em>Question. </em>Did you understand that mr. <em>Ware </em>was to pay the account whether there should be any money due to you on settlement or not? <em>Answer. </em>Certainly not. <em>Question. </em>Whilst the account you have mentioned was accruing, did mr. <em>Stephenson </em>frequently or at any time apply for payment of it, or to draw orders on mr. <em>Ware </em>in his favour, for money on that account? <em>Answer. </em>Yes, mr. <em>Stephenson </em>did frequently apply to me for orders on colo. <em>Ware, </em>and I think I gave him an order. He frequently applied to me to endeavour to secure the payment of the account-by drawing an order for the account on mr. <em>Ware, </em>which if he would accept, it would be all right. <em>Question. </em>Had mr. <em>Ware </em>any\u201dauthority to pay any part of the account without 'your direction to apply the money which might be due to you on settlement to such payment.? <em>Answer. </em>No, sir, he had not, nor had he any right to accept an order from me unless he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>chose to do so. At the commencement of the work, it was understood that mr. <em>Ware </em>would not accept my orders unless he chose. <em>Question. </em>Was the account kept against you in the first instance ? <em>Answer. </em>I cannot answer distinctly as to that. I am under the impression that the account was kept against me. I know the account in mr. <em>Stephenson\u2019s </em>ledger was headed with my name. The orders for goods were drawn by me, and, I think, the account kept against me. <em>Question. </em>Whose debt was it which grew out of the account? <em>Answer. </em>As I got the goods for my own use and that of my family and bands, I always considered it my debt, and mr. <em>Ware </em>as my security.\u2014Had you not a conversation with mr. <em>Stephenson </em>about the time of finishing mr. <em>Ware\u2019s </em>building, about the account, and did not mr. <em>Stephenson </em>agree to indulge you ? <em>Answer. </em>I had a conversation with mr. <em>Stephenson </em>on the afternoon of the finishing mr. <em>Ware\u2019s </em>building, and stated to him I had settled with colo. <em>Ware, </em>and that I was not able to pay all of his account; that I was very sorry that I could not pay him the whole account, but I was willing to give him my note for the balance, as I had done with the other merchants of the town. Mr. <em>Stephenson </em>then replied to me that he did not consider the debt mine, but the debt of colo. <em>Ware, </em>and refused to take my note. I then told mr. <em>Stephenson </em>that I would be in that country again in the spring, to work, and that I would use the utmost of my endeavours to see him paid ; but he never did say he would indulge me. <em>Question. </em>Will you state whether mr. <em>Stephenson </em>made very frequent applications to you, to endeavour to get the debt due to him on the said account secured to him in mr. <em>Ware\u2019s </em>hands, or through mr. Ware? <em>Answer. </em>Mr. <em>Stephenson </em>frequently applied to me for orders to mr. <em>Ware, </em>and I stated to mr. <em>Stephenson </em>that they would not be accepted by colo. <em>Ware. </em>He <em>(Stephenson) </em>told me his claim ought to be secured in colo. <em>Ware\u2019s </em>hands.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>The witness, upon a reexamination by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, deposed that the contract between him and <em>Ware </em>was, that he <em>{Ware) </em>was to pay the witness money, provided he had it at the time that the witness might apply to him for it, and that he was willing to get the witness, out of any of the stores, any articles that would answer for the witness and his hands. Witness was to wait with colo. <em>Ware </em>for any money that might be due him after the building was finished, until it should be convenient for colo. <em>Ware </em>to pay it; but <em>Ware </em>was to use every exertion to pay the witness off when the building was finished. The work, when it was finished, amounted to 2250 dollars. Colo. <em>Ware </em>paid the witness that sum during the progress of the building and after it was done, or assumed the payment after the building was done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel proved the handwriting of <em>Vogdes </em>to an order in these words : \u201c <em>Bcrryville, </em>Sept\u2019r 30. 1834. Colo. <em>Jos. Ware. </em>Sir, you will oblige me by paying mr. <em>Joseph F.

Luke, </em>deposed that he had lived with the plaintiff, as clerk and salesman in his store, from the 20th of August 1833, and, from that date until the close of the account, sold to <em>Vogdes </em>the greater part of the articles mentioned in the account. The account was kept in the name of <em>Vogdes. </em>Witness was under the impression that the credit was given to the defendant and not to <em>Vogdes, </em>because he <em>{Vogdes) </em>was a stranger in the neighbourhood, had no property there, and there were notes or bonds of <em>Vogdes </em>brought there by others from <em>Loudoun, </em>and offered for sale at a discount. There were kept at the same time, on the books of the plaintiff at his store, an account against the defendant, an account against defendant and <em>Strib</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number><em>ling, </em>in the name of <em>Ware and Stribling, </em>and an account against the two misses <em>Stribling, </em>for all of which the defendant was looked to by plaintiff for payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-3\">Another witness, <em>Treadwell Smith, </em>deposed that <em>Vogdes </em>came as a stranger to the neighbourhood of plaintiff and defendant. Witness had been informed by a friend of his in <em>Baltimore, </em>that said <em>Vogdes </em>had taken the benefit of the insolvent oath in that city, and was cautioned not to trust him. Witness did not know whether plaintiff was aware of <em>Vogdes\u2019s </em>insolvency. Witness did not speak of it, nor did he believe that <em>Vogdes\u2019s </em>circumstances were generally known in the neighbourhood.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-4\">The defendant demurred to the evidence introduced before the jury. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for 399 dollars 60 cents, with interest from the 1st of August 1834, subject to the opinion of the court on the demurrer. And the circuit court rendered judgment on the demurrer for the plaintiff. To which judgment a <em>supersedeas </em>was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b184-5\">The cause was argued in this court by <em>Leigh </em>for the plaintiff in error, and <em>Robinson </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-6\">I. <em>Leigh </em>insisted that <em>Vogdes </em>was not a competent <em>witness; Waggoner </em>v. <em>Gray\u2019s adm\u2019rs, 2 </em>Hen. &amp; Munf. 612. It is an attempt to swear himself out of responsibility for the debt, and to throw it in the first instance on <em>Ware.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-7\"><em>Robinson </em>said, the remark of judge <em>Roane </em>in <em>Waggoner </em>v. <em>Gray\u2019s adm\u2019rs </em>was only this, that it would be of dangerous consequence to permit <em>Slaughter to recover a debt of his own, </em>by his own testimony. <em>Slaughter </em>was in debt to <em>Waggoner, </em>and deposed that <em>Gray </em>was in debt to him, and he <em>{Gray) </em>agreed to pay <em>Waggoner, </em>and <em>Waggoner </em>agreed to credit <em>Slaughter. </em>The objection was that <em>Slaughter </em>would be discharged from <em>Waggoner\u2019s </em>claim, if <em>Waggoner </em>recovered from <em>Gray\u2019s </em>administrators, but would still be liable to <em>Waggoner, </em>if <em>Waggoner </em>failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>recover from <em>Grafs </em>administrators. <em>Slaughter </em>might \u2022 ii , . . .. indeed sue <em>Gray s </em>administrators, but he could not recover against them on his own testimony. The objection therefore was that <em>Slaughter </em>was doing indirectly wbat he could not do directly, viz. recovering a debt of his own, by his own testimony. But here, <em>Vogdes </em>is not recovering a debt from <em>Ware, </em>either directly or indirectly. And the recovery by <em>Stephenson </em>will in no manner promote his interest. It is true that if <em>Stephenson </em>fails to recover from <em>Ware, </em>he may sue <em>Vogdes; </em>but on the other hand, if he recovers against <em>Ware, Ware </em>may sue Vogdes. <em>Fancourt </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>1 Bingham\u2019s N. C. 681. 27 Eng. Com. Law Rep. 542.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-6\">II. Upon the demurrer to evidence, <em>Leigh </em>observed, that the old distinction taken by lord <em>Mansfield </em>between a promise to pay for articles before delivery, and a promise afterwards, was overruled. <em>Mawbrey </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>cited in 2 T. R. 80. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>Cowp. 227. <em>Matson &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Wharam, </em>2 T. R. 80. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Hayman, </em>1 H. Black. 120. <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>1 Ld. Raym. 224. <em>Keale </em>v. <em>Tempe, </em>1 Bos. &amp; Pul. 158. The doctrine now is that if the person for whose use the goods are fur-, nished be liable at all, the promise must be in writing. <em>Cutler </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>6 Rand. 509. Now here, the court must come to the conclusion that <em>Stephenson </em>might have maintained an action against <em>Vogdes. </em>Though <em>Ware </em>had other accounts, the goods were charged not to him but to <em>Vogdes. </em>On the part of Ware, there was nothing more than a stipulation that the fund in his hands should be applied to pay the debt. If there be variance between some parts of the evidence and others, the court must take it altogether, and draw from the whole such inferences as a jury might draw. The evidence of <em>Vogdes </em>on his cross examination, though contradictory, must be taken as a qualification of what he had previously said. He understood that <em>Ware </em>was to stand as <em>surety. Stephenson </em>so <em>understood; </em>for he made fre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>quent attempts to get orders on <em>Ware. </em>He obtained one order, which was not accepted. If the liability of <em>Ware </em>was direct, why did <em>Stephenson </em>raise the account against Vogdes? Why did he attempt to get orders from Vogdes? <em>Luke </em>says, he was under the impression that the credit was given to the defendant; but it is nothing more than an impression, for <em>Luke </em>did not hear the conversation between <em>Ware </em>and <em>Stephenson.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-4\"><em>Robinson </em>referred to <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>17 Johns. Rep. 114. <em>Towne </em>v. <em>Grover, </em>9 Pick. 306. <em>Bird </em>v. <em>Gammon, </em>3 Bingh. N. C. 366. 32 Eng. Com. Law Rep. 366. 369. and <em>Rixon and others assignees of Moore </em>v. <em>Hatfield, 2 </em>Bingh. 439. 9 Eng. Com. Law Rep. 471. which last case, he said, was very apposite. <em>West </em>had undertaken to do carpenter\u2019s work upon a house and find all materials, but wanting credit or funds to procure timber, <em>Hatfield </em>agreed - to pay <em>Moore \u00a350. </em>for timber out of the money that he had to pay <em>West, </em>provided <em>West\u2019s </em>work was completed; and upon this agreement <em>Moore </em>supplied the timber. The court were clear that this was not a collateral but a direct undertaking. Here the circumstances are very similar, and conduce to shew that <em>Ware\u2019s </em>undertaking wras direct. <em>Vogdes </em>was a stranger in the neighbourhood, and came there insolvent. He was at work on <em>Ware\u2019s </em>building. And <em>Ware </em>and <em>Vogdes </em>went to <em>Stephenson </em>and had a conversation with him. <em>Ware </em>stated that <em>Vogdes </em>would want articles out of <em>Stephenson\u2019s </em>store* and he <em>(Ware) </em>could not pay for them until next harvest come one year. <em>Stephenson </em>assented, and delivered goods until within three months of the finishing of the building. <em>Vogdes </em>states that being a stranger, he did not think <em>Stephenson </em>would have credited him. He believes the goods were furnished upon <em>Ware\u2019s </em>agreement to pay for them, but the payment was to come out of the money which <em>Ware </em>would owe him upon the contract between them. In a subsequent part of his deposition, he states that the amount growing out of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>contract was 2250 dollars. <em>Luk,e </em>too is under the impression that the credit was given to <em>Vogdes. </em>Leaving out the evidence upon the cross examination, every thing goes to shew that the credit was given to <em>Ware, </em>This inference is not rebutted by the fact that the account was entered on the books in the name of <em>Vogdes. </em>For <em>Ware </em>had various accounts, and it was convenient to keep the amount on account of <em>Vogdes </em>separate, that he might afterwards get it on a settlement with <em>Vogdes.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-6\">The principle is well settled, that a demurrant admits all the facts that could reasonably be inferred by a jury from the evidence given by the other party, and waives all the evidence on his part which contradicts that offered by the other party. This principle ought to be applied to the evidence on the cross examination. That evidence should be disregarded so far as it contradicts the evidence on the general examination. Besides, the evidence upon the general and cross examinations may be reconciled by treating the words <em>surety </em>and <em>paymaster </em>as synonymous. And so <em>Vogdes </em>regards them. To say that the debt was his and <em>Ware </em>the surety for it, he considers lh.e same as saying that <em>Ware </em>was paymaster to <em>Stephenson, </em>and he (Vogdes) was to pay the debt on a settlement with <em>Ware. </em>As to <em>Stephen-sons </em>applying for orders, that may be explained in two ways. One reason was to get prompt payment; the other, to have written evidence.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b179-18\"><em> </em>He decided the cause in the court below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b187-8\">Stanard, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ARXm\">The objection to the admissibility of the evidence of <em>Vogdes </em>was properly overruled. He stood entirely indifferent between the parties litigant, or if he had any interest, that interest was against the party who offered him as a witness. If <em>Stephenson </em>failed in the suit against <em>Ware, Vogdes </em>remained responsible to <em>Stephenson, </em>and if he succeeded, <em>Vogdes </em>would be certainly responsible for an equal amount to <em>Ware, </em>and might perhaps be also liable to <em>Ware </em>for the costs of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>this suit. This possible liability for the costs of this suit if it resulted in- a recovery against <em>Ware, </em>might have been an objection, if the witness had been offered by <em>Ware, </em>and <em>Stephenson </em>had objected, but is wholly unavailable in the mouth of <em>Ware.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">The demurrer to evidence presents a more serious if not a more difficult question. The <em>assumpsits </em>set out in the declaration are direct and original, not collateral. The necessity of shewing such an <em>assumpsit </em>by the proof is twofold. The proof of a collateral liability for goods sold and delivered to another would not support the declaration, though the undertaking were in writing; and if it would, the undertaking in proof being oral, the statute denies a right of action on it. Does the evidence prove a direct and original, or a collateral undertaking ? In ascertaining the facts proved directly or by inference, we must not be unmindful of the effect of a demurrer to evidence. By it the demurrant allows full credit to the evidence of the demurree, and admits all the facts directly proved by, or that a jury might fairly infer from, the evidence. And in determining the facts inferrible, inferences most favourable to the demurree will be made, in cases in which there is a grave doubt which of two or more inferences shall be deduced. In such cases it would not be sufficient that the mind of the court should incline to the inference favourable to the demurrant, to justify it in making that inference the ground of its judgment. Unless there be a decided preponderance of probability or reason against the inference that might be made in favour of the demurree, such inference ought to be made. The demurrer withdraws from the jury, the proper triers of facts, the consideration of the evidence by which they are to be ascertained ; and the party whose evidence is thus withdrawn from its proper forum is entitled to have it most benignly interpreted by the substitute. He ought to have all the benefit that might have resulted from a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>cisi\u00f3n of the case by the proper forum. If the facts of \u2022 \u2022 <em>i </em>\u2022 i &lt; the case depend upon circumstantial evidence, or inferences from facts or circumstances in proof, the verdiet of a jury ascertaining these facts would not be set aside, merely because the court might have made inferences different from those made by the jury. To justify the grant of a new trial, when it depends on the correctness of the decision between different inferences to be drawn from the evidence, it would not suffice that in a doubtful case the court would have made a different inference. The preponderance of argument or probability in favour of this different inference should be manifest. When the question is whether or no a fact ought to be taken as established by the evidence, either directly or inferentially, in favour of the demurree, I do not know a juster test than would be furnished by the enquiry, would the court set aside the verdict, had the jury, on the evidence, found the fact ? If the verdict so finding the fact would not be set aside, it ought to be considered as established by the evidence demurred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">In the case in judgment, the evidence was all parol, and adduced by the plaintiff. In ascertaining the facts established by it, we must look to all of it, and especially in ascertaining the facts established by any one witness, every thing stated by him, as well on his cross examination as on his examination in chief, must be considered. Facts imperfectly stated in answer to one question may be supplied by his answer to another; and when from one statement considered by itself an inference may be deduced, that inference may be strengthened or repelled by the facts disclosed in another. Under the guidance of these principles I proceed to the enquiry, does the evidence demurred to prove, directly or inferentially, a direct and original undertaking on the part of <em>Ware </em>to pay for the goods <em>Stephenson </em>might furnish to Vogdes?</p>\n<p id=\"ADR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>To support the affirmative, reliance is mainly placed on the answers of <em>Vogdes </em>to the fifth and sixth questions on his examination in chief. By neither of these answers is an <em>assumpsit </em>of any kind directly proved. <em>Ware </em>stated the relation between himself and <em>Vogdes, </em>from which he was to become the debtor of <em>Vogdes, </em>and <em>Vogdes\u2019s </em>want of supplies from <em>Stephenson\u2019s </em>store, and that he <em>(Ware) </em>could not pay <em>Stephenson </em>until after harvest. An <em>assumpsit </em>on the part of <em>Ware </em>of some kind is fairly inferrible from this statement taken by itself, but what that <em>assumpsit </em>was is not directly stated. Now, that <em>assumpsit </em>might have been a direct and original undertaking by which <em>Ware </em>alone became the debtor for the supplies to <em>Vogdes, </em>or it might be an <em>assumpsit </em>to see <em>Stephenson </em>paid, or it might be an undertaking to retain in his hands, of the money for which he might become the debtor of <em>Vogdes, </em>as much as was necessary to pay the debt that <em>Vogdes </em>might contract with <em>Stephe?ison, </em>and apply it in discharge of the debt. If the facts of the case depended on this isolated view of the evidence, I should, on the principles before stated as applicable to demurrers to evidence, consider it the duty of the court to select, of these implications, that most favourable to the demurree, because.such might not unreasonably be the implication of the jury; though the latter part of the answer to the sixth question would incline me to adopt the last of the above stated implications. But the first of the implications, (which is the only one that would justify a judgment in favour of <em>Stephenson </em>on the demurrer,) is directly confronted not only by facts stated by the witness, but by the strong presumptions which flow from other unquestioned facts. In answer to different questions, he states that he understood <em>Ware </em>was to stand security for <em>him; </em>that <em>Ware </em>was to pay for the goods out of the money that might be due witness when the building was finished ; and if on a settlement no money was due from <em>Ware, </em>he was not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>pay the account. These facts directly repel the idea that the undertaking of <em>Ware </em>was original and unqualified : and this is corroborated by fair if not necessary implication from the facts, that <em>Stephenson </em>applied to <em>Vogdes </em>to deal with him, that <em>Vogdes </em>was charged on the books of <em>Stephenson </em>with the articles supplied him, and that <em>Stephenson </em>frequently applied to <em>Vogdes </em>for orders on <em>Ware, </em>and obtained one for the amount of his account against <em>Vogdes. </em>The statements in <em>Vogdes's </em>evidence, that he supposed <em>Ware </em>was to be paymaster, and of the witness <em>Lulce </em>of his impression that the account was raised on the credit of <em>Ware, </em>which were relied on in argument by the appellee\u2019s counsel are quite compatible with the supposition that the undertaking was collateral; and so I think it must be regarded by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-3\">Whatever doubts may at one time have existed respecting the undertakings within the scope of the first section of the statute of frauds, it has long since been definitively settled that when the undertaking is for a consideration to be received by, or articles to be supplied to, a third person, if the transaction be such that the third person is responsible to the person who supplies the articles, or from whom the consideration proceeds, the undertaking is collateral, and if oral is not binding. <em>Matson &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Wharam, 2 T. </em>R. 80. <em>Cutler </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>6 Rand. 509. The doctrine of <em>Matson &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Wharam </em>has never, since it was decided, been effectually questioned in the courts of <em>Westminster. </em>In the case at bar, I think it clear beyond doubt, that whatever might have been the undertaking of <em>Ware, Vogdes </em>was responsible to <em>Stephenson. </em>No one would, I presume, doubt that if <em>Vogdes </em>were the defendant in this action, <em>Stephenson, </em>on the evidence in this case, would be entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">My opinion therefore is that the judgment is erroneous and ought to be reversed, and judgment entered on the demurrer to evidence, for the demurrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Cabell, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"A3D\">Brooke, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A2C\">My first impression of this case on the argument was, that the <em>assumpsit </em>to pay for the goods to be delivered to <em>Vogdes, </em>the party who received them, was a direct <em>assumpsit, </em>and not an alternative or collateral <em>assumpsit, </em>W'ithin the statute of frauds; and a very minute examination of the evidence set out in the demurrer has confirmed that impression. <em>Vogdes, </em>to whom the goods were to be delivered, was a housecarpenter and joiner, an entire stranger in the place, and in debt, as appears by the evidence of <em>Lulte, </em>who says he was under the impression that the credit for the said account was given to the defendant and not to <em>Vogdes, </em>because he was a stranger in the neighbourhood, without property there, and because there were notes or bonds of said <em>Vogdes </em>brought there by others from <em>Loudoun </em>and offered for sale at a discount. This is strong evidence that <em>Vogdes </em>was not the party intended to be credited by the plaintiff. But let us see what <em>Vogdes </em>himself says. He says that he was a stranger in the place; that he was engaged in building a house for the defendant, which, it appears, cost 2250 dollars; that the plaintiff and others solicited him to deal with them, (no doubt, on the credit of the money he was to receive for the house from the defendant <em>Ware); </em>that he said he must consult colo. <em>Ware. </em>He then states the conversation that passed between the plaintiff and defendant. He says, colo. <em>Ware </em>stated to <em>Stephenson </em>the plaintiff, that the witness was engaged in building for him, and would want to be furnished with different articles out of his <em>(Stephenson's) </em>store, and that he <em>(Ware) </em>could not pay him for the articles until next harvest come one year; to which <em>Stephenson </em>the plaintiff assented. This, I think, was manifestly not an alternative promise to pay the debt of another, in the words of the statute. <em>Vogdes </em>seems to have been no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>party to it, and of course was not intended to be bound by it. He was standing by, and was to receive the articles. He was not consulted as to the time of payment. The promise was not collateral to any undertaking of his, but, I think, a direct promise by <em>Ware </em>to pay for the articles. In a suit against <em>Vogdes, </em>could he be charged in the terms of the promise made by Ware? I think not. To the sixth question put to him, upon whose promise to pay for the goods in said account were the articles furnished ? his answer was, \u201c I was induced to believe they were furnished upon colo. <em>Ware's </em>agreement to pay for them.\u201d But I lay no stress upon this, or any other of the <em>opinions </em>of the witness. I rely upon the <em>facts </em>only that he states. He was an ignorant, though, from his testimony, a very honest man. He goes on: \u201cI was a stranger, and did not think mr. <em>Stephenson </em>would credit me, but it was to come out of the money that colo. <em>Ware </em>would owe me at the finishing of the building.\u201d In answer to another question, \u201c In the conversation you have spoken of, was the understanding of the parties that mr. <em>Ware </em>was to stand as security for you ?\u201d he says, <em>\u201c </em>That was the way I understood it.\u201d In another place he says, \u201c Mr. <em>Ware </em>was to be my paymaster, and to receive it out of such money as might be due me on settlement.\u201d All this and much more may be descanted on, but I rely on the terms of the promise made by the defendant to the plaintiff when the latter assented to deliver the articles to <em>Vogdes. </em>There is a great deal of cross examination, but no answer that contradicts the facts stated by him as to the terms of the promise made by the defendant to the plaintiff to pay for the articles to be delivered. The witness\u2019s opinions as to the effect of those facts are not facts, nor contradictory of those facts. As to the orders on <em>Ware </em>which he gave the plaintiff, they prove nothing as to the contract. One of them (which was rejected by the judge) was drawn on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>account of some plank furnished by <em>Vogdes </em>to the defendant. Other orders in favour of the plaintiff on the defendant are spoken of by <em>Vogdes; </em>but these orders, if for money due by the defendant to <em>Vogdes, </em>and if accepted and paid (which is not pretended) would not discharge the <em>assumpsit </em>of the defendant but for their amount, to which the plaintiff could -not object, as every creditor is willing to receive his money even before it is due. <em>Vogdes, </em>in another part of his evidence, says that the plaintiff told him he did not consider the debt to be his, but the debt of <em>Ware </em>the defendant, and refused to take his note for the amount; but the account was kept in the books of the plaintiff in the name of <em>Vogdes. </em>This would be a strong circumstance to prove that the plaintiff held <em>Vogdes </em>bound for the amount, but for the explanation given by <em>Luke, </em>the witness who kept the books. He says, there were other accounts kept in the books, in the names of others for whom <em>Ware </em>the defendant was held solely bound, which were not objected to by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">In all this evidence there is nothing to prove that <em>Vogdes </em>was expressly or impliedly bound to pay for the articles delivered to him by the plaintiff on the <em>assumpsit </em>of the defendant to pay for them, or to change the character of his <em>assumpsit </em>as stated by <em>Vogdes. </em>The contract of <em>Vogdes </em>was with <em>Ware </em>the defendant to build him a house, and not with the plaintiff. It is a well settled principle that where the party to whom goods are delivered on the promise of a third person to pay for them, is bound to pay for them, the <em>assumpsit </em>is not direct but collateral, and, if not in writing, within the statute of frauds : and the converse of the principle is also settled. In the case before us, I think it very clear that <em>Vogdes </em>was not bound to pay <em>for the </em>articles delivered to him. On the evidence in the demurrer, I think that a jury ought to have found a verdict for the plaintiff, and that no new trial ought to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>been awarded, if asked for. If the terms of the contract had been less strong, yet on the ground of the utter improbability that, in the circumstances of <em>Vogdes </em>as proved by the evidence, the plaintiff would have given him any credit, I think such a verdict ought not to have been set aside. I have examined many of the cases, but shall only quote one, to prove that the <em>assumpsit </em>of <em>Ware </em>the defendant was a direct <em>assumpsit, </em>and not a collateral promise within the statute of frauds. It is the case of <em>Dixon and others assignees of Moore </em>v. <em>Hatfield, </em>an action <em>of assumpsit </em>on the following agreement: \u201cI <em>Richard Hatfield </em>do agree to pay mr. <em>J. Moore </em>\u00a350. for timber &amp;c. out of the money that I have to pay <em>Wm. </em>West, provided <em>West's </em>work is completed.\u201d At the trial before <em>Best, </em>chief justice, it appeared that <em>West </em>had undertaken, for a certain sum, to complete the carpenter\u2019s work on the house in question, and find all the materials, but being delayed for want of credit or funds to procure timber, it was supplied by <em>Moore, </em>on the defendant\u2019s signing the above agreement. The jury found a verdict for \u00a350. and. <em>Vaughan, </em>Serjeant, moved for a rule <em>nisi </em>to set it aside, on the ground (among other objections) that the agreement was in effect a guarantee to pay <em>Moore </em>in the event that <em>West </em>failed to pay him, and if it was a guarantee, the consideration for the defendant\u2019s undertaking was not sufficiently expressed. But the court were clear that this was not a collateral but a direct undertaking, and the rule was refused. It is true, the agreement in this case was in writing; but I quote it to shew the character of the <em>assumpsit </em>of the defendant in the case before us. The circumstances of the two cases are very similar. The person for whom the agreement in the case cited was made, wanted credit:- so in the case before us. In <em>England, </em>the statute of frauds requires a consideration though the promise be in writing; under our statute, all that is required is that the promise should be direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>and not collateral, not a guarantee, and then no writing is necessary. Compare the words of the agreement in <em>Dixon and others </em>v. <em>Hatfield, </em>with the words used by <em>Ware </em>the defendant and addressed to the plaintiff, as proved by <em>Vogdes, </em>and I think it impossible to doubt that his <em>assumpsit </em>to pay for the articles to be delivered by the plaintiff to <em>Vogdes </em>was a direct and not a collateral promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">On the whole, I think the judgment of the court below was correct and ought to be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b196-5\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AXK\">I concur in reversing the judgment, and entering judgment for the defendant on the demurrer to evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Judgment of circuit court reversed, and judgment entered for the demurrant to evidence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
