During three years that he so acts, the slave, besides paying the hire, earns $ 200, of which he deposits \u00a7 75 with the owner. The owner, contemplating an eventual emancipation, makes a bill of sale, and delivers to the grantee possession of the slave, for the consideration of \u00a7 200, of which the \u00a1\u00a1j&gt; 75 in his hands is taken as part. The other earnings of the slave ($ 125) are afterwards collected and paid over in satisfaction of the balance of the consideration money. In the transaction, there is no intent to defraud the grantor\u2019s creditors. The grantee afterwards emancipates the slave, and the slave so emancipated is taken by execution to satisfy a debt of the first owner, contracted before he executed the bill of sale. Held, the bill of sale cannot be considered a purely voluntary one, and the slave so emancipated should, upon a <em>habeas corpus, be </em>discharged from custody, leaving the creditor to resort to <em>equity to </em>set aside the bill of sale and the instrument of emancipation, if he can properly do so, because of the inadequacy of the consideration for the bill of sale, or upon any other ground. <em>By two </em>judges\u2014 <em>dissentiente Tucker, </em>P.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-6\"><em>Adam Dirting </em>owning a man of colour named Ben, sometimes called <em>Ben Ware, </em>as his slave, died intestate, leaving his sons <em>John Dirting </em>and <em>Adam Dirting </em>his sole distributees, who received the slave from the administrator of their father\u2019s estate, in a course of distribution.

He had paper to the amount of 150 dollars, a horse that after-wards sold for 70 dollars, some other property (the particular value of which was not ascertained) and the money which had been and was thereafter to be paid him by <em>Ben, </em>as is presently mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-6\">Though the consideration for the bill of sale from <em>Dirting </em>was 200 dollars, yet <em>Barr </em>himself paid no part of that consideration, nor did he assume or promise to pay any part, but the whole amount was paid to <em>Dir-ting </em>by <em>Ben. </em>Whilst <em>Dirting </em>was the owner of <em>Ben, </em>he permitted him to work out, <em>Ben </em>paying him 1 dollar per week or 50 dollars per year; and all he earned over that sum was to be his own. <em>Ben </em>regularly paid <em>Dirting </em>the hire, and previously to the 31st of December 1833, deposited with him a little upwards of 75 dollars of his own money, which was taken and considered as part of the 200 dollars, the consideration\u00bb for which the bill of sale was executed. <em>Dirting </em>re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>lied on the promise of <em>Ben </em>to pay him the balance in a short time ; and the same was so paid by <em>Ben. </em>There was paid, on the 25th of January 1834, 50 dollars, and on the 11th of October 1834, 25 dollars. The dates of the other payments were not precisely ascertained, no receipts having been given; but those payments were made very shortly after December 1833 ; and all the money had been earned by <em>Ben </em>before that time, though not then collected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-4\">As to the value of <em>Ben </em>at the time the bill of sale was executed, there was conflicting evidence. Upon the whole thereof, the judge stated the fact to be that his value was 350 dollars; believing, from the evidence, that if he had been brought into market, he would have sold for about that sum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-5\">When the bill of sale was executed, on the 31st of December 1833, <em>Michael Barr </em>signed a paper writing in which he stipulated that <em>Ben </em>should be free at his death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-6\">From the 31st of December 1833 until July 1336, <em>Barr </em>exercised acts of ownership over <em>Ben </em>as his slave, by giving him orders permitting him to work for certain individuals and to receive the pay, and at one time a general order permitting him to work for any person he might choose. <em>The </em>earnings of <em>Ben </em>were in part received by him, and in part collected by <em>Barr </em>and paid over to him. <em>Ben </em>performed work for <em>Barr, </em>for some of which he was paid; for some he was not paid, as he did not claim anything. <em>Ben's </em>wife was a slave belonging to <em>Barr.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-7\">On the 11th of July 1836, a second bill of sale was executed by <em>John Dir ting, </em>conveying <em>Ben </em>to <em>Barr; </em>and it was acknowledged in court the same day. This bill of sale bears date, on its face, the 31st of December 1833, the day of the execution of the first bill of sale, and the time when possession of <em>Ben </em>was delivered by <em>Dirting </em>to <em>Barr. </em>The reason assigned for taking the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>second bill of sale, and which appeared to be the true reason, was that neither <em>Barr </em>nor his counsel was then apprized of the fact that <em>Adam Birting </em>had ever conveyed his interest in <em>Ben </em>to his brother <em>John. </em>The second bill of sale was therefore prepared, antedated as of the date of the first, and <em>Adam Birting </em>procured to witness it, that he might thereby impliedly waive any right or claim he might have to <em>Ben. </em>Afterwards the bill of sale of the 6th of May 1830 from <em>Adam to John </em>was discovered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-4\">The deed of emancipation from <em>Barr </em>to <em>Ben </em>was executed by <em>Barr </em>in consequence of the advice of an attorney whom he consulted, that he was liable to be presented by the grand jury for permitting <em>Ben </em>to work and trade as he did. This deed of emancipation, though dated the 31st of December 1833, was not executed until July 1836. It was antedated at <em>Barr's </em>request, with a view to shield him from prosecution for the time past, although he was told by the scrivener (who was the attorney he consulted) that the deed of emancipation could have no effect before it was recorded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-5\">There was in the hands of the sheriff of <em>Shenandoah, </em>an execution on behalf of <em>Sybert Jordan Sf Co. </em>against <em>Birting, </em>for a debt of 23 dollars 41 cents, due before the bill of sale of the 31st of December 1833 was executed : but <em>Jordan Sf Co. </em>to secure that debt, took of <em>Birting, </em>on the 11th of November 1834, a deed of trust on property sufficient at the time to pay the debt.

The money received by <em>Dirting </em>as the price of <em>Ben, </em>being <em>Dining\u2019s </em>own money, the conveyance to <em>Barr </em>was therefore without valuable consideration, and void as to creditors. The record further discloses that <em>Dining </em>and <em>Barr </em>meditated a fraud on the law, by permitting <em>Ben </em>to stay in <em>Virginia </em>against the policy of the statute requiring emancipated slaves to remove from the commonwealth. <em>Dining, </em>if able, might have emancipated <em>Ben </em>at once; but he would then have been required to leave the state. To evade the law in this respect, the title was conveyed gratuitously to <em>Barr, </em>who permitted <em>Ben </em>to act as a free man, paying him\u2014the master paying his own slave\u2014for all the labour he ever performed. Unless we are concluded by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>the opinion of the judge, there is also enough in the record to shew that <em>Dirting </em>and <em>Barr </em>intended a fraud upon creditors. The consideration, even if paid by <em>Barr, </em>was wholly inadequate; the sum of 200 dollars having been received for a slave worth, in the opinion of the judge, 350 dollars. <em>Dirting </em>was deeply involved in debt, and, in less than a year afterwards, had to take the benefit of the act for the relief of insolvent debtors. <em>Ruddle's </em>executor, moreover, was an antecedent creditor. As to him, the transaction should be treated as fraudulent and void, without regard to the amount of <em>Dirting's </em>debts, the value of his property, or his circumstances. <em>Reade\u2019s adm'r </em>v. <em>Livingston &amp; others, </em>3 Johns. Ch. Rep. 481. <em>Townshend </em>v. <em>Windham, 2 </em>Ves. sen. 11. If <em>Dirting </em>himself had manumitted <em>Ben, </em>it is clear, under the statute 1 Rev. Code, ch. 111. ^ 54. p. 434. that <em>Ben </em>would have been liable to be taken by execution to satisfy debts contracted by <em>Dirting </em>before making the emancipation. Now here, <em>Dirting </em>has voluntarily conveyed <em>Ben </em>to <em>Barr, </em>upon an understanding that he is to treat him as a free man from the first, and afterwards manumit him. If <em>Dirting </em>can thus evade the payment of his debts, he does that indirectly which he could not do directly.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b497-6\"><em>Alexander Anderson, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aje\">To <em>make </em>a deed voluntary, it must be without any, the least, valuable consideration. <em>Seward </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>8 Cow. 407. If any thing valuable pass between the parties, the transaction is a purchase. <em>Jackson v. Peek, </em>4 Wend. 301.

Lit. 117a. note 161. and 118a. \u00a7 177. But even if the conveyance be regarded as voluntary, the doctrine of setting aside such conveyances by persons indebted at the time, does not go to the extent contended for. <em>Tunno v. Trezevant, </em>2 De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>sauss. 270. A trifling indebtedness, where the grantor retains under his control property sufficient to meet his debts, is not enough to avoid a voluntary conveyance. In the case of such a conveyance, as in any other case, the question is whether there was actual fraud. And this question is to be determined upon the whole evidence. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Peek, </em>4 Wend. 301. Here, it cannot be alleged that there was the intent to delay, hinder or defraud creditors. Such an allegation is precluded by the state of the facts, as certified by the judge of the circuit court. Nor is there any other aspect in which the conveyance can be held fraudulent as to <em>Birting's </em>creditors. See <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Harben, </em>2 T. R. 587. <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Russel, </em>1 Cranch 309. <em>Sydnor </em>v. <em>Gee, </em>4 Leigh 535. <em>Wheaton </em>v. <em>Sexton's lessee, </em>4 Wheat. 503. <em>Sexton's lessee </em>v. <em>Wheaton, </em>8 Wheat. 229. and <em>Hinde's lessee </em>v. <em>Longworth, </em>11 Wheat. 199. Neither the sale to <em>Barr, </em>nor the subsequent emancipation by him, was <em>in fraudem legis; </em>because, 1st. <em>Birting's </em>object was neither the immediate nor remote emancipation of <em>Ben: </em>2dly, <em>Barr </em>bought him because he was the owner of his wife, and intended that <em>Ben </em>should be his slave, at least during <em>Barr's </em>own life. Nor can the emancipation be impeached on the ground that <em>Barr </em>was induced to it by fear of prosecution for a violation of law in reference to his duties and obligations as master. The grounds on which the rights of the defendant in error can be assailed must be such as derive their efficacy from considerations affecting the conduct \u25a0 of <em>jGirting, </em>and him alone.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-4\">Though it <em>be </em>supposed that <em>Birting </em>designed a fraud upon his creditors, still, if <em>Barr </em>was a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser, his title is not to be affected. <em>Sands </em>v. <em>Hildreth, </em>14 Johns. Rep. 498. The doctrine has moreover been sanctioned even by this court, that a fair and <em>bona fide </em>purchaser from one who was a volunteer under a fraudulent grantee, is entitled to protection against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>creditors of the grantor. <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Cocke, </em>6 Rand. 618. <em>Ben </em>may be regarded as an innocent purchaser without notice, and on that ground entitled to his freedom. See also <em>Eppes &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Randolph, 2 </em>Call 183. <em>Garland </em>v. <em>Rives, </em>4 Rand. 282. 1 Rev. Code, ch. 101. \u00a7 3. p. 373. and <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>6 Cranch 87.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b499-4\">Parker, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AYqc\">A preliminary question has been suggested in this case, which meets us <em>in limine. </em>It is whether the matters in controversy between these parties could be properly tried upon a writ of <em>habeas corpus. </em>If the issue was one of slavery or no slavery, and the right of the defendant in error to freedom was the litigated point, presenting some real and not merely colourable ground for controversy, I should concede that it ought not to be determined upon the <em>habeas corpus, </em>for the reasons assigned in the case of <em>De Lacy </em>v. <em>Antoine &amp; others, </em>7 Leigh 438. But it appears here that the matter in question is not the right to freedom, but the right to levy an execution on one who has been duly emancipated by an acknowledged owner. <em>Ben </em>is a free man under the act of assembly, but the claim is to make him liable for the antecedent debts of <em>Lining, </em>because <em>Lining's </em>conveyance to <em>Barr, </em>being <em>purely </em>voluntary, was not binding on creditors, although it was binding on <em>Lining. </em>The real question is, whether <em>Ben </em>is illegally confined in custody; and the solution of that question depends not upon the enquiry whether he was duly and properly emancipated, but whether, being emancipated, he is not liable <em>to </em>a charge which, if allowed, may or may not reduce him to his original state of slavery. No person is claiming to be his master, no person is detaining him as a slave, so as to authorize him to petition a court to be allowed to sue <em>in forma pauperis </em>for the recovery of his freedom, under our act of assembly; but the return to the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>is, that he has been taken in execution to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>satisfy a debt due from his former master, and the validity of that return depen'ds on considerations extraneous of the question whether or no he is a slave. Although the enquiry thus presented may be complicated and difficult, involving questions of fact as well as law, yet that is no reason for denying to the petitioner the benefit of the great and salutary writ of <em>habeas corpus. </em>It often happens that a judge is forced to decide the most embarrassing and delicate questions on the return to that writ. The writ itself applies to all cases of illegal detention of the person, except that which grows out of the relation of master and slave; and it would apply to that also, but that another remedy is provided which seems virtually to exclude a resort to the <em>habeas corpus. </em>If the petitioner were allowed to sue <em>in forma pauperis </em>one detaining him as a slave, and should recover'in the action, still that decision would not determine the questions raised on this record, or preclude the creditors of <em>Dining </em>from levying their executions. Therefore I think we may now adjudicate the right of the petitioner to be discharged from the custody of the sheriff of Shenandoah, in this proceeding by <em>habeas corptis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">There is no difficulty about the facts of the case. \u00a3Here the judge detailed them.]</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">In applying the law to these facts, we must recollect that the deed of emancipation from <em>Barr </em>to <em>Ben </em>is not assailed, and that it was not for a debt contracted by the person emancipating, before such emancipation was made, that the petitioner was taken in execution, (see 1 <em>Rev. Code, </em>cb. <em>111. </em>\u00a7 54. p. 434.) but for the debt of <em>Dining, </em>who had conveyed to the emancipator, and received at the same lime a paper writing stipulating that <em>Ben </em>should be free at the emancipator\u2019s death. Nor is the conveyance to <em>Barr </em>made utterly void as to creditors by the act of fraudulent conveyances; because the facts certified negative the idea that it was \u201c contrived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>of malice, fraud, covin, collusion or guile, to the intent or purpose to delay, hinder or defraud creditors;\u201d and because, if the consideration paid to <em>Dirting </em>is not \u201cdeemed valuable in law,\u201d the conveyance was by deed duly proved and recorded, and possession delivered by the grantor. Although therefore, if the deed be voluntary, creditors may certainly avoid it, yet it may be doubted whether, under the circumstances, this execution could be levied on the petitioner, who had been duly emancipated by <em>Barr </em>and was then in the enjoyment of all the rights of a freeman, without first setting aside the deed from <em>Dirting </em>to <em>Barr, </em>and the deed of emancipation from <em>Barr </em>to the defendant in error. But waiving this enquiry, I cannot bring my mind to the conclusion that the deed to <em>Barr, </em>with the view of ultimate emancipation, was a purely voluntary one: without which the plaintiff in error cannot subject Be\u00bb to the debt due from <em>Dirting </em>to his testator. <em>Dirting </em>had permitted his slave to act for himself, upon being paid a hire which is not proved to be an inadequate one. During the three years that he thus acted, the petitioner earned the 200 dollars which was after-wards paid to his master as the consideration for the conveyance to <em>Barr. </em>This money, if in the slave\u2019s possession, might have been taken from him by <em>Dining </em>notwithstanding the previous arrangement, if he chose to exercise the rigid power of a master; for I readily concede that in this commonwealth no contract between a master and slave is binding, and the latter can acquire no property of which the former may not deprive him. But this, I think, results from the <em>power </em>which the master may exert over the slave, and the denial to the latter of all remedy to recover back the money so taken, rather than from any acknowledged principles of right and justice. If the master does not choose to exercise the power over the extra earnings of the slave, and to commit a manifest injustice, I do not perceive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>that we are bound to allow his creditors to urge a want of consideration, when no fraud upon their rights was contemplated, and none can be practised, if an actual equivalent has been received, although that equivalent consists of something upon which the master, against conscience, might have seized. Besides, the case is stronger, where (as here) a part of the consideration was beyond the power of the master. About <em>125 </em>dollars of the earnings of the slave whilst the property of <em>Dirting, </em>had not been collected at the date of the conveyance, but was afterwards collected and paid as a part of the 200 dollars. <em>Dirting </em>could not have recovered this money from the employers of <em>Ben, </em>because he had permitted his slave, in violation of the law, to trade and act as a freeman, and that law would not have assisted him in recovering from others under a contract thus made with the slave. The money was, <em>however, </em>paid to <em>Ben </em>whilst <em>he </em>belonged to <em>Barr, </em>and was applied (by the latter, I presume,) in discharging the consideration money mentioned in the deed. This 125 dollars was more than the amount of the debt due to the testator of the plaintiff in error; and being received by <em>Dining </em>afterwards under such circumstances, prevents us, as I think, from considering the conveyance a purely voluntary one. Whether the price stipulated, or this portion of it, was adequate or not, might be a material circumstance in determining the question of fraudulent .intent; but as that is settled by the proofs before the judge, it can have no influence on the question now under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The cases cited are those wherein a fraud was meditated upon existing creditors; or where the conveyance was made with a view to future indebtedness; or where a conveyance of property, although accompanied by possession, has been set aside in equity for the want of a valuable consideration. The case at bar does not belong to either of the two first classes; nor to the last, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>unless we are prepared to decide that the master cannot bestow upon the slave the privilege of acquiring any property, which may serve as a foundation (it the master\u2019s will and conscience so determine) for a consideration moving, mediately or immediately, from the slave to the master, for the inestimable grant of freedom. In this anomalous case, where there is no authority to bind us, I conceive we may obey the dictates of humanity and justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-3\">I am therefore for affirming the order of the judge discharging the petitioner from the custody of the sheriff of <em>Shenandoah; </em>leaving the plaintiff in error to seek his remedy in equity, if he has any.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b503-4\">Stanard, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"An0\">expressed a strong doubt as to the propriety of the remedy resorted to.

He became insolvent within a year afterwards, and was considerably indebted at the time, having regard to his property and resources and his condition of life. It is moreover clear from the evidence, that the deed was altogether voluntary. It is not pretended that <em>Barr </em>paid, or contracted to pay, one cent. The pretended consideration was paid and to be paid out of the earnings of <em>Ben, </em>accruing whilst he remained the slave of <em>Birting. </em>These earnings already belonged to <em>Birting, </em>and could form no consideration for the sale to <em>Barr. </em>The uncollected portion of them ought to have been surrendered in <em>Birtingh </em>schedule, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>for his creditors had a right to it. The law recognizes no power in a slave to acquire property. What he acquires becomes, <em>eodem flatu, </em>his master\u2019s. The right to himself includes an absolute right\" to all that he acquires. Of this opinion <em>Blackstone </em>clearly was, when, in discussing the question of slavery, he said that if a man could sell himself, the price given for him by his master would instantly belong again to the master. Our law, certainly, recognizes no such power in the slave to acquire property; and as the introduction of such a principle into our jurisprudence might lead to consequences not easily foreseen, it is better that the subject should be left to legislative provision, by which the necessary safeguards against mischief may be supplied. If I am right, there was then no consideration for the deed to <em>Barr. </em>Without therefore considering the other questions discussed, it is sufficient to say, that the deed being void as to the plaintiff in error, his execution was properly levied upon the property: and moreover the act of emancipation by the donee cannot bar or impair his rights. If indeed the debt be discharged, then the deed will be good between the parties, and the deed of emancipation will have effect. But while the debt is unsatisfied, the superior right of the creditor must ride over both. The consequence would be the reversal of the judgment, and an order that the defendant in error be remanded to the custody of the sheriff', to be proceeded with under the execution, unless such proceeding be restrained hereafter by any other process of law. But my brethren being of opinion that there was no error in the order of the judge discharging the said defendant, that order must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"ANS\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
