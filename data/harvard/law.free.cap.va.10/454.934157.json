For that heretofore, to wit, on the 19th day of March 1831, by an act passed by the legislature of <em>Virginia, </em>entitled \u201c an act to provide for the construction of a turnpike road from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number><em>Winchester </em>to some point on the <em>Ohio </em>river,\u201d the said defendants were incorporated by the name of \u201cthe president and directors of the northwestern turnpike road\u201d as aforesaid, with power, among other things, to sue and be sued, and to cause to be constructed a road from <em>Winchester </em>in the county of <em>Frederick </em>to some point on the <em>Ohio </em>river, to be selected by the principal engineer, and to erect bridges across streams of water, at such sites as the said principal engineer should indicate ; as by the said act will more fully appear.
