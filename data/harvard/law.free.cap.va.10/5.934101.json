It is my will and desire that my son in law <em>Samuel Collins </em>have a support out of the property left in trust as aforesaid, during his natural life.\u201d <em>Moses Hughes </em>and <em>James Hughes </em>were appointed the executors of the will; which was proved and recorded in <em>Nelson </em>county court in June 1824. Both the executors qualified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-6\"><em>Samuel Collins, </em>the son in law of the testator, between the years 1819 and 1824, contracted a debt with the firm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>of <em>Lofftus &amp; Co. </em>of 423 dollars and 4 cents; for which <em>Lofftus Co. </em>brought an action against him in <em>Nelson </em>county court, and in May 1825 recovered a judgment for the amount of the debt, with interest and costs. Being arrested under a <em>ca. sa. </em>sued out by the plaintiffs upon the judgment, <em>Collins, </em>on the 26th of August 1825, subscribed and delivered in a schedule of his property (to wit, one rifle gun and one table) and took the oath of an insolvent debtor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-3\">In 1826, <em>Lofftus fy Co. </em>filed their bill in the superior court of chancery holden at <em>Lynchburg, </em>against <em>Samuel Collins </em>and <em>Moses </em>and <em>James Hughes, </em>in their own right and as executors of <em>Moses Hughes </em>deceased, impeaching a conveyance that <em>Collins </em>had made of certain property to <em>Moses </em>and <em>James Hughes </em>on the 13th of August 1824, as fraudulent and void; and charging also, that the slaves bequeathed as aforesaid by <em>Moses Hughes </em>the testator, in trust for mrs. <em>Collins </em>and her children, were liable to the debts of <em>Samuel Collins, </em>because those slaves had been in the quiet and uninterrupted possession of the said <em>Samuel Collins </em>for more than seven years \u2022 before the testator\u2019s death. Neither mrs. <em>Collins </em>nor her children were made parties to this suit. In May 1830, a decree was rendered therein, by which the conveyance aforesaid, and so much of the testator\u2019s will as bequeathed the slaves <em>Sam, Charles, </em>and <em>Dicey </em>and her increase, in trust for mrs. <em>Collins </em>and her children, were declared fraudulent and void as to the plaintiffs, and accordingly set aside, and the defendants ordered to deliver the property comprised in the conveyance, and the slaves <em>Sam, Charles, </em>and <em>Dicey </em>and her increase, to the marshal of the court, who was directed to advertise and sell the same, or so much thereof as should be sufficient to defray the expenses of sale, and satisfy the principal money, interest and costs due to the plaintiffs. The marshal was further required to deposit the proceeds of sale in bank to the credit of the cause, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>report his proceedings lo the court in order to a final 1 decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A4\">Whereupon, in July 1830,. mrs. Collins, by <em>John Hughes </em>her next friend, exhibited her bill in the same superior court of chancery against <em>Lofftus Sf Co. Samuel Collins, </em>and <em>Moses </em>and <em>James Hughes, </em>executors of <em>Moses Hughes </em>deceased, setting forth the above mentioned provisions of her father\u2019s will, insisting on her rights under the same, and that, as the controversy respecting the slaves thereby bequeathed had been carried on in a chancery suit against her trustees, to which she was not a party, she was consequently not bound by the proceedings and <em>decree in </em>that suit; in which she further alleged that her interest had not been properly defended by the trustees. She charged, that <em>Samuel Collins </em>her husband never had any title whatever to the said slaves, nor any control or possession of them during her father\u2019s lifetime except as manager for him of the plantation on which the complainant, with her said husband and their children, resided. Wherefore she prayed an injunction to restrain <em>Lofftus Sf Co. </em>from proceeding lo execute the decree aforesaid, so far as the same directed a sale of the slaves bequeathed for her benefit; and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-9\">The injunction, having been refused by the chancellor, was awarded by a judge of the court of appeals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-10\">The answer of <em>Lofftus Sf Co. </em>alleged that the slaves in question had remained in the quiet and undisturbed possession of <em>Samuel Collins </em>for more than five years previous to his dealings with these respondents; and insisted that they were properly subject to the debts of the said <em>Collins.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-11\">The defendants <em>Samuel Collins, Moses Hughes </em>and <em>James Hughes </em>answered,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3O\">admitting in substance the allegations of the plaintiff\u2019s bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-12\">A general replication having been put in by the plaintiff to the answer of <em>Lofftus Sf Co. </em>the depositions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>various witnesses were taken and filed on behalf of those parties respectively, with a view to shew the duration and character of the possession which <em>Samuel Collins </em>had held in the slaves in controversy, during the testator\u2019s lifetime. The effect of the evidence, according to the view taken of it by the court of appeals, is stated in the opinion delivered by the president.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-4\">In October 1830, upon the motion of the defendants <em>Lofftus Sf Co. </em>the court of chancery ordered that the injunction be discharged, as having been improvidently awarded. From which decree this court, on the application of the plaintiff\", allowed her an appeal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-10\">The cause was argued here, by <em>Stanard </em>for the appellant, and <em>Johnson </em>for the appellees, upon two questions of law : 1. What is the effect of the first decree against the trustees ? does it bind the rights of the <em>cestuis que trust </em>who were no parties to the suit ? 2. Whether, if chattels lent remain more than five years in the possession of the loanee, and then the loan be regularly declared according to the statute 1 Rev. Code, ch. 101. \u00a7 2. p. 373. a creditor of the loanee, whose lien did not attach by judgment till after the loan was so declared, can subject the property to the satisfaction of his demand ? And upon the evidence in the cause, a third question was discussed, namely, Whether, in point of fact, <em>Samuel Collins </em>ever had possession of the slaves in controversy, for five years without interruption ?</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b33-11\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AhP\">I am far from thinking that the injunction in this case was improvidently awarded by a judge of this court. The property of the <em>feme covert </em>settled upon her by her father\u2019s will had been decreed to be sold to satisfy her husband\u2019s debts, in a cause to which she was not a party, her trustees alone being the defendants. In the estimate of a court of equity, they were unsubstantial shadows. That court could not pronounce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>upon the rights of the parties really interested, without having them before it. At law, indeed, the trustee is the proper party defendant; but in equity no decree can be rendered affecting the rights of the <em>cestui que </em>trust, unless he is a <em>party; </em>for it is a fundamental principle of the court that all parties, however remotely concerned in interest, must be before it, or no decree can be made to bind them. Mitf. Plead. 144. <em>3 </em>Munf. 376. And 2 Madd. Ch. Pract. 142. This is particularly the case as to <em>cestuis que trust, </em>since the trustee is a mere nominal party, and the real beneficial interest is in the <em>cestuis quetrust. 2 </em>Johns. Ch. Rep. 238. 1 Ball &amp; Beatty 181. 184. The exceptions to the rule it is unnecessary to state, as they would have no application here. I think the injunction was properly awarded, and that the only question in the cause is upon the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">As to the merits, I am satisfied that the weight of the evidence is decidedly against the allegation that any of the slaves were <em>given </em>to mrs. <em>Collins. </em>I have in other cases declared that I deemed it necessary, in order to sustain an alleged parol gift by a father to his daughter on her marriage, that the evidence of such gift should be clear and cogent; and in that opinion I understood my brethren to concur. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Handley, </em>7 Leigh 119. <em>Mahon </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>7 Leigh 317. In this case, to say the least, the testimony is very meagre. I think it altogether insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Then, as to the alleged loan : It will be unnecessary to say any thing upon the legal question spoken to in'the cause. It has been long settled in this court, that according to the true construction of the loan act, a resumption of possession by the lender, or recording a deed or wfill granting away the property to another, within the five years, avoids the operation of the act and puts an end to the loan. <em>Beasley </em>v. <em>Owen, </em>3 Hen. &amp; Munf. 449. The evidence of a loan in this case is itself equivocal. <em>Hughes, </em>having married his daughter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>to <em>Collins, </em>puts him upon one of his plantations to manage it for him, and sends with him various slaves, some to work in the field, and <em>Dicey as a house servant. </em>She was therefore still as much in his service as any of the rest, and the evidence clearly proves that <em>they </em>were not loaned. On the whole of them, including <em>Dicey, </em>he always paid the taxes, and listed them with the commissioner of the revenue in his own name. What more can the owner of slaves do, who places them in the hands of a manager to do service on his estate ? How can a creditor complain of being deceived, who advances goods to my manager, not for my use, upon the credit of property held by him upon <em>my own </em>estate, worked by <em>my own </em>slaves, which slaves are listed in <em>my name </em>on the commissioner\u2019s books, and the taxes on them paid'by me ? If he uses ordinary diligence, or if he does not wink hard that he may <em>not </em>see, he must learn that he should not give the credit. In this case, if he had gone to the farm, he would have found it was <em>Hughes's: </em>if he had applied to <em>Collins, </em>he would have learned that the property was not his; and if (as was most natural) he had gone to the commissioner\u2019s books, which furnish a record of the property of individuals, he would have there seen that <em>Hughes </em>claimed to be the owner of the slaves, and paid taxes on them as such. In no other way can the owner of property under the management of another, better manifest his own rights, and negative a pretension on the part of creditors to charge his estate with the debts of that other. Therefore, even if there was no further proof, I should be opinion to reverse the decree. But it is proved that in four years after the marriage, <em>Hughes </em>himself went and lived on the place which <em>Collins </em>lived on, and continued to live there till his death. It was managed for him by <em>Collins, </em>and he received the crops, allowing <em>Collins </em>part of them for his services. He lived in the house where <em>Dicey </em>was house servant, and even if she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>not before that time been in his possession, y,et from <em>tjiai </em>time she must be construed to have been so. The <em>possession </em>must be construed to be with the <em>property, </em>unless the contrary be actually proved; and that has not been done here, as <em>Dicey </em>was a menial in a household where a father and his daughter and son in law appear to have resided together, all having the services of the slave; the father having (as one of the witnesses testifies) \u201c gone to live with them that the daughter might be better provided for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Upon the whole, I am of opinion that this is one of the numerous instances afforded by our courts, of an attempt to make one man pay another\u2019s debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">I am of opinion to reverse the decree, reinstate the injunction, and send the cause back'for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The other judges concurring, decree reversed, injunction reinstated, and cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
