After issue is joined, the parties on both sides will have an opportunity of examining their witnesses, the cause will be matured for rehearing, and, upon a rehearing, such decree will be made as may be just and right.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-7\">On the second of July 1834, <em>Gideon Howland </em>sued out of the office of the circuit court of <em>Henrico </em>a <em>subpoena </em>in chancery against <em>Daniel Platt </em>and <em>Jonathan W. Beers, </em>with an indorsement thereon, stating that' it was \u201c to attach the estate, moneys, debts, goods and effects of the defendant <em>Daniel Platt </em>in the hands of the other defendant, so that he be restrained from paying away, conveying or secreting the debts by him owing to, or the moneys, goods and effects in his hands belonging to the defendant <em>Daniel Platt, </em>until the further order of the court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-8\">At the rule day to which the process was returnable, the plaintiff filed his bill, alleging that <em>Platt </em>was justly indebted to him in the sum of 433 dollars and 40 cents, with interest thereon from the eleventh day of December 1S33, as appeared by his account therewith filed ; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>that <em>Platt </em>resided out of the commonwealth ; and that # # <em>Beers </em>had effects in his possession to a large amount, belonging to <em>Platt.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ad5\"><em>Beers </em>answered, saying that he has no personal knowledge of the plaintiff\u2019s demand, except from admissions of <em>Platt, </em>from which he believes <em>Platt </em>to be indebted to the plaintiff; that he has in his hands, as the property of <em>Platt </em>consigned by him for sale, two barouches and one sulky, which he supposes to be worth <em>500 dollars or thereabouts, </em>which he is ready to surrender to the order of the court; that he has not had a final settlement of accounts with <em>Platt, </em>and cannot say, therefore, whether he owes <em>Platt </em>any money; but he will settle the account at any moment, and'account at once for the balance, if any.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-7\">Against <em>Platt, </em>the plaintiff proceeded in the mode prescribed by law against absent defendants; and he failing to appear and answer, on the motion of the plaintiff, his bill was taken for confessed as to that defendant. And the cause coming on to be heard, the court, on the 23d of January 1836, decreed that the sheriff of <em>Henrico </em>county sell the two barouches and sulky by public <em>auction, to </em>the highest bidder, in the manner prescribed by law for the sale of perishable property, and out of the proceeds of sale- pay to the plaintiff the sum of 433 dollars, with interest from the 11th of December 1833 till paid, and the costs, and deposit the residue (if any) in the bank of <em>Virginia, </em>to the credit of the cause. In case there should not be a sum sufficient, after deducting the charges of sale, to satisfy the sum aforesaid with interest and costs, then, unless <em>Beers </em>should admit a fund in his hands sufficient to make up the deficiency, he was directed to render before a commissioner an account of the property, goods and moneys of <em>Platt </em>which bad come to his hands prior to the service of the <em>subpoena. </em>The decree provided that the plaintiff was not to have the benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>thereof, until he, or some person for him, should enter into bond with security, in the clerk\u2019s office, in a penalty equal to double the money to be received by him under the decree, payable to Platt, and conditioned as prescribed by law in the case of absent defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-4\">Bond with security was given accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-5\">On the 4th of July 1836, <em>Platt </em>presented a petition to a judge of this court for an appeal from the decree, assigning as error, that it was rendered without any proof to support the claim. The judge allowed the appeal on the usual terms ; but afterwards on the 20th of February 1837, this court, being of opinion that it was improvidently allowed, ordered that it be dismissed with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-6\">A copy of the order of this court dismissing the appeal being transmitted to the court below, the plaintiff and the defendant <em>Platt </em>were heard in that court, by counsel, on the 10th of April 1837, upon the motion of .the said defendant for leave to file his answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-7\">The court, having considered the motion, made an order on the 19th of June 1837, allowing the answer to be filed, upon security being given for the payment of such costs as might be awarded to the plaintiff, and also for the fees which would become due from the said defendant to the officers of the court. The security was accordingly given, and the defendant filed his answer, to which the plaintiff replied generally. Immediately thereupon, the defendant moved the court to set aside the interlocutory decree pronounced on the 23d of January 1836 ; w\u2019hich motion was opposed by the plaintiff. The parties being fully heard, the motion was overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-8\">Whereupon, on the petition of <em>Platt, </em>an appeal was again allowed him by a judge of this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b533-9\"><em>Mayo </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b533-10\"><em>Lyons </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AYC\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ADj\">There is no error in these proceedings 0f which the defendant <em>Platt </em>can avail himself. Having submitted to a decree against him as an absent defendant, the statute leaves him but one remedy. That remedy is the right to appear and file his answer, and proceed to have the cause reheard, and the decree rescinded, if, after hearing, it shall prove to be erroneous. The appellant, then, having instituted his proceeding according to the statute for rescinding the original decree, cannot, at the same time, arraign it by proceeding by appeal in this court. The correctness of the original decree is thus out of the case', and the only question which the appellant can raise is whether, before the cause is prepared for a rehearing, the absent defendant has a right to demand that the decree already made should be set aside. I think not. Upon his petition to rehear the cause, he may, on giving security for costs only, file his answer, to which the plaintiff may reply; and issue may be joined, witnesses examined, and other proceedings, decree and execution had, as may be just and right in the cause. To rescind the former decree before the cause is matured for rehearing, would be to adjudge first and hear after-wards. The practice would moreover be most mischievous in many respects. Whether the attached effects, or the effects in the hands of the garnishee, would or would not be discharged, it may not be necessary to decide. But if the decree be set aside upon filing the answer, then it would seem to follow that all the proceedings under it must be set aside also; and thus the sale of the attached effects, the. payment by the garnishee, and the receipt of his demand by the plaintiff, may be vacated at any time within seven years after the decree, although, upon the rehearing, it may turn out that the first decree is unassailable. This would not only be without.the sanction of the statute, but in conflict with the general principle as to bills of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>review and petitions for rehearing, that such bill or petition does not prevent the execution of a decree, and money decreed must be paid before the bill is filed, though it may afterwards be ordered to be refunded. Mitford\u2019s Plead. 79. SO. Hinde 58. 59. In this regard, there is no difference between reviewing and rehearing, though in both a discretion may be exercised in suspending such parts of a decree as if once performed would place the defendant beyond the relief of the court. Ibid. The court therefore very properly declined, at this stage of the cause, to set aside the first decree; that being to be done after a rehearing only. The appeal is therefore again premature, and the order of the circuit court must accordingly be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The other judges concurring, order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
