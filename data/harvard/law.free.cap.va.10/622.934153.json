The declaration, after setting out the covenant, alleged, in substance, that <em>Kiger </em>wras prevented by the act and contrivance of <em>O\u2019Rear, </em>from paying him, on the 15th November 1818, the \u00bf\u00a3100. which he covenanted to pay him on that day, and that he tendered him that sum on the 16th November, but <em>O\u2019Rear </em>refused to receive it; and then alleged, that <em>O\u2019Rear </em>was afterwards, to wit, on the \u2014\u2014 day of-1819, appointed to the office of high sheriff of the county of <em>Frederick, </em>and obtained the said office in the order in wffiicb he stood on the list of magistrates for the county; and that on the day on which <em>O\u2019Rear </em>and his deputies were qualified to the-office, to wit, on the - day of \u00bb\u2014 \u25a0 1819, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>when <em>Kiger </em>should have been sworn in, if he had been \" appointed deputy according to the terms of the covenant, <em>Kiger </em>was ready and offered to pay to <em>O'Rear </em>the sum of 500 dollars appointed by the covenant to be paid by <em>Kiger </em>on the day on which he should be sworn in as deputy, and was ready and offered to procure and give ample security, both for <em>O'Rear </em>and himself, for executing the duties of the office, but <em>O'Rear </em>refused to receive the said 500 dollars or <em>to </em>avail himself of the said security : and averring, that <em>Kiger </em>was ready and willing, and offered to <em>O'Rear, </em>to do and perform all things which by the covenant he was to do and perform on his part, and that <em>O'Rear on </em>his part refused to accept the proffered performance, the declaration assigned the breach of the covenant, that <em>O'Rear </em>did not and would not appoint <em>Kiger </em>his deputy in the office of sheriff. The administrators of <em>O\u2019Rear </em>(against whom the action had been revived) put in a general demurrer to the declaration, and pleaded <em>covenants performed, </em>on which an issue was made up. The court overruled the demurrer. And upon the trial of the issue, the defendants demurred to the evidence. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for 5000 dollars damages, subject to the opinion of the court on the demurrer to evidence; upon which the court held, that the law was for the plaintiff, and gave him judgment for the damages assessed by the verdict. <em>O'Rear's </em>administrators applied to this court for a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b648-6\">The cause w'as argued here, by <em>R. C. Stanard </em>and <em>Lyons </em>for the plaintiffs in error, and <em>Leigh </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b648-7\">Many points arising both on the demurrer to the declaration and on the demurrer to the evidence, were debated at the bar; but the cause was decided on a single point, made by <em>Stanard </em>and <em>Lyons; </em>namely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>that, though a sale of the deputation of the office of sheriff, made by the sheriff after his appointment to the office, was valid according to the decision.of this court in <em>Salling </em>v. <em>M'Kinney, </em>1 Leigh <em>42. </em>yet a covenant by a justice of the peace for the sale of the deputation of the office of sheriff, prospectively, when and in case he should, at a future time, be appointed to it, was contrary to the statute against buying and selling offices, criminal and void. They referred to the statute 1 Rev. Code, ch. 145. p. 559. and maintained, that such a prospective, executory contract as this between <em>O'*Rear </em>and <em>Eiger, </em>for the sale of the office of sheriff, which <em>O\u2019Rear </em>might or might not obtain at a future and uncertain time, was condemned by the three first sections of the statute, and was not protected by <em>the proviso </em>contained in the fourth section, \u201c that nothing in the act contained should be so construed, as to prohibit the appointment, qualification and acting of any deputy clerk, or <em>deputy sheriff, </em>who should be employed to assist their principals in the execution of their respective offices.\u201d For, they said, the <em>proviso </em>excepted out of the inhibition of the statute the deputation only of actually existing offices. And the sanction of such a contract as this would be of most pernicious consequence; since the sheriff, after <em>his </em>appointment to office, would have the strongest inducement to appoint the person to whom he had contracted to sell the office, his deputy, though he should, in the interval between the contract and the appointment, have proved wholly unworthy of the trust, and so avoid an action on his covenant, and damages for the breach of it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b649-4\"><em>Leigh </em>said, the counsel for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASY\">in <em>Salling </em>v. <em>M'Kinney, </em>had contended, that the true effect of the <em>proviso </em>in the statute was to except out of the previous inhibition, not the <em>sale </em>of the office of deputy sheriff but only the fair deputation of the office, which had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>always been held legal in the construction of the en\u00bb glish statutes <em>in pari materia; Gulliford </em>v. <em>De Cardonell, 2 </em>Salk. 466. <em>Godolphin </em>v. <em>Tudor, </em>Id. 468. Willes 575. <em>S. C. </em>in note. But this court held, that the effect of <em>the proviso </em>was to except the deputation of the office of sheriff wholly out of the statute; so that though, in that case, there was unquestionably a <em>sale </em>of the office, the contract was held legal; and to shew that this was the precise point there decided, he referred to the opinions of the judges. And in that case, the contract was for the sale of the office of deputy sheriff, not only for the first year for which <em>M'Kinney </em>had been appointed, but for the second year also, for which he had not yet been, but for which he expected to be, appointed : in regard to the second year of the office, that was, like this, a prospective executory contract for the deputation of the office, when and in case the principal should be appointed to it; and the prospective executory contract was held good ; for it was under the contract for the deputation of the second year of the office that the case arose. It was too late, now, to depart from the construction put on the statute in <em>Salling </em>v. <em>M\u2019Kinney; </em>almost all the contracts between sheriffs and their deputies, made since that adjudication, had been regulated by <em>it; </em>and if the law as there declared, ought to be altered, the alteration should be made by the legislature. He said, he could see no distinction, in principle, between the case of <em>Salling </em>v. <em>M'Kinney </em>and this case. If a contract for the sale of the deputation of the office of sheriff actually existing, was not prohibited by the statute, and was lawful and valid, he could see no reason why a contract for the sale of such an office when it should be obtained in future, should be void. As to the mischievous consequences which had been suggested, he said, it was as much the duty of the sheriff to remove from office a deputy whom he had actually appointed, in case he should prove unworthy of the trust, as it was his duty not to appoint a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>deputy who was unworthy; and the inducement of the sheriff to appoint an unworthy deputy, in order to avoid an action on his Covenant for the deputation of the office, and damages for the breach of it, was not stronger than the inducement to continue a deputy in office whom he had appointed, after he had proved himself unworthy of trust, in order to avoid an action for breach of his covenant .for the deputation of the office during the whole term. He thought it probable, that at least half of the deputations of the office of sheriff throughout the commonwealth, had been made under prospective contracts, like that in the case before the court, for deputations of the office when the principals should be appointed in future. <em>[Scott, J. </em>said, that in his part of the country, the practice was general, if not universal]. If such prospective contracts were criminal and void <em>ah initio, </em>the appointment of deputies in pursuance of them, after the principals had received their appointments, could not cure the original vice which annulled the contracts; and the sheriffs, in all such cases, would be deprived of all remedy against their deputies and their sureties, for neglect or malfeasance in office.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b651-6\">Brooke, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3F9\">delivered the opinion of the court, that the contract set out in the declaration did not come within the <em>proviso </em>contained in the fourth section of the statute against buying and selling offices, but was plainly within the three first sections of that statute, and was therefore illegal and voidt and that, therefore, the judgment should be reversed, and judgment entered for the defendants .on the demurrer to the declaration.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Scott, <em>J. </em>dissented.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b651-8\"> The reporter understood, that the court did not mean to disturb the authority of <em>Sailing </em>v. <em>M\u2019Kinney, </em>1 Leigh 42.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
