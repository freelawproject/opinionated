Plea not guilty, with leave to give the special matter in evidence. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs for $ 300 j <em>but, </em>on the next day, the court set aside the verdict and granted a new trial, because a law, which was then produced, could not be had upon the trial: and the defendant filed a bill of exceptions, stating, that part only of the justices who tried the cause was present when the new trial was granted. Upon the second trial, the jury found a special verdict, which stated, that the slave had been conveyed by <em>John Hamilton </em>by deed of the 30th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>of November, 1793, which they find in <em>hcec verba. </em>That the defendant was deputy sheriff for the county in the years 1783,1784; and that <em>Hamilton, </em>who resided in that county, was indebted to the commonwealth for the taxes of those years. That the defendant distrained the slave on the land of <em>Hamilton </em>in the year 1795, and sold him for the taxes aforesaid. That the slave had continued in the possession of <em>Hamilton, </em>from the time of the conveyance to the plaintiffs, to that of the distress, except for a short time after the delivery of the deed. The county court gave judgment upon the special verdict for the defendant. The district court reversed the judgment; and <em>Winslow </em>appealed to the court of appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b61-4\"><em>Williams, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"An5\">Trespass, and not case, was the proper action, as the injury was immediate, and not consequential. 6 <em>Bac.

Code, Pl. edi. </em>133. It was not material, that some of the justices who sat at the first trial were not present when the new trial was granted; for it was the same court, notwithstanding the change of members.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b61-5\">\n<em>Randolph, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"An9\">It might have been uncertain, when the evidence should be produced, whether trespass or case lay; and, under that embarrassment, the plaintiffs will not be held to the strictness of the distinction in actions upon cases of that kind. 2 <em>Burr. </em>1113. Trover would have lain; and as the declaration states all the circumstances, they will amount to a charge of the conversion. A new trial ought not to have been granted in the absence of three of the justices who tried the cause. The plaintiffs were not bound to shew that there was other property which might have been taken; for it lay upon the defendant to justify his own act.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b62-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number><em>Williams, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ar1\">The case in <em>Burrows </em>does not support the plaintiffs\u2019 action : for it shews.that, if the testimony proves an immediate trespass, the plaintiffs will be non-suit. The declaration contains none of the features of trover; but it is, to every intent, a special action on the case. It was not necessary, that the same justices who tried the cause should all be present when the new trial was awarded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b62-10\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b62-11\">Fleming, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Aen\">I have some doubt as to the action; for I am not satisfied that the mistake is not cured by the statute of <em>jeofails; </em>which declares that the omission of <em>vi et armis, </em>or other formal words, shall not vitiate. But I give no opinion upon that point, as I am clear as to several other parts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">With respect to.the objection, that all the justices, who tried the cause, were not present when the new trial was granted, I answer, that it does not clearly appear whether they were or not. But it is immaterial which way the fact is; for the want of the act of assembly upon the trial of the cause was a sufficient ground for awarding the new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-13\">The defendant was entitled to judgment upon the special verdict. For the act of assembly gave him power to dis-train the slave, if no other property could be found; and as no abuse of the power is shewn, the plaintiffs have made no case to entitle them to judgment. The county court, therefore, decided rightly; and <em>the district </em>court erred in reversing it. I am consequently of opinion, that the judgment of the district court should be reversed; and that of the county court affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b62-14\">Carrington, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ATe\">It is difficult to say what action the plaintiffs intended to bring; but all the facts stated by them are plainly trespass: for the injury, if any, was immediate, and not consequential. Of course, trespass, and not case, was the proper remedy; and therefore, upon that ground, the plaintiffs were not entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>But, independent of that, the cause, upon the merits, is in favour of the defendant. For he had a right to distrain for the arrears of taxes; and, where no abuse is shewn, the law <em>prima facie </em>presumes, that a public officer does his duty. The county court, therefore, decided rightly; and I am of opinion, that the judgment of the district court should be reversed, and that of the county court affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b63-4\">Lyons, President.</author>\n<p id=\"A4\">The declaration states a trespass, and therefore case was, perhaps, improperly brought. But it is immaterial whether that be so, or not: for the verdict shews no cause of action whatever. The judgment of the district court is consequently to be reversed; and that of the county court affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
