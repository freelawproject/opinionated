And the bill then alleged, further, that the defendant <em>Benjamin </em>had, sometime before the year 1821, <em>given' </em>to each of the defendants <em>John </em>and <em>George, </em>who were his sons, 250 acres of land, and executed deeds conveying the same to them respectively; and that both the sons had ever since and still remained in possession of the lands so to them given and conveyed; but that the defendant <em>Benjamin </em>had afterwards induced both of the sons to restore to him the deeds he had executed and delivered to them for the lands. The object of the bill was, to have satisfaction of the judgment due to the.plaintiff from the defendants <em>John </em>and <em>George, </em>out of the lands which had been given and conveyed to them both, and satisfaction of the simple contract debt due from <em>John, </em>out of the land which had been given and conveyed to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-5\">The answer of <em>Benjamin Grayson </em>stated, that in April 1817, he conveyed to each of his sons <em>John </em>and <em>George, </em>200 acres of land; but in June or July following, in consequence of an occurrence in his family, which made it necessary that his lands should be divided among his children in a manner different from that intended when those conveyances were made, the sons voluntarily surrendered to him the deeds he had given - them, which had never been recorded, to be cancell\u00e9d, and they were actually cancelled. He admitted, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>he had allowed the sons, respectively, still to reside on the lands, and to cultivate the same for their own benefit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-6\">The answers of <em>John </em>and <em>George Grayson </em>were to the same effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-7\">There were many depositions filed in the cause; but the evidence did not vary the case from that stated in the answers, except that, perhaps, it led to an inference, that the surrender of the deeds by the sons to the father occurred at a later date than that stated in the answers, namely, in 1820, \u201921 or \u201922, but still prior to the dale of <em>Richards\u2019s </em>judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-11\">II. <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Otho Beatty </em>also exhibited a bill against <em>John </em>and <em>Benjamin Grayson, </em>shewing that <em>John Grayson </em>was indebted to them on a bond for the sum of 51 dollars with some arrears of interest; and making the same allegations touching the gift and conveyance of land by the defendant <em>Benjamin </em>to his son <em>John, </em>as were contained in the bill of <em>Richards; </em>this bill likewise prayed satisfaction of the bond debt due from the defendant <em>John </em>to the plaintiffs, out of the land so given and conveyed to him by the defendant <em>Benjamin. </em>The answer's of the defendants to this bill were exactly to the same purpose with their answers to <em>Richards\u2019s </em>bill; and the proofs in this cause were also the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-12\">Both causes coming on to be heard together, the chancellor, being of opinion, that the lands which had been conveyed by <em>Benjamin - Grayson </em>to his sons <em>John </em>and <em>George, </em>and which yet remained in their possession, were, notwithstanding the cancellation of the deeds of conveyance, liable for the debt due from the sons to <em>Richards </em>upon his <em>judgment </em>against them <em>; </em>and that the land which had been conveyed to <em>John, </em>ought to be charged with the debt due from him on his <em>promissory note </em>to <em>Richards, </em>and likewise with the debt due from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>him on his bond to <em>T. O. Beatty; </em>decreed, accordingly? that the money should be raised by sale of the lands to be made by the marshal. From which decree, the defendants appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Ar7\">The causes were argued here, by <em>Leigh </em>for the appellants, and by <em>Stanard </em>for <em>Richards, </em>the appellee</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ai\">in the first case; there was no counsel for <em>T. fy O. Beatty, </em>the appellees in the second case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-5\"><em>Leigh </em>contended, 1st, that the voluntary surrender of the deeds of conveyance by the sons <em>John </em>and <em>George to Benjamin </em>the father, for the purpose of being cancel-led, and the actual cancellation thereof, had the effect of divesting the sons of all title on which the claims of their creditors could attach. He argued, that the creditors of the sons could only claim satisfaction out of these lands upon the strength of the rights of their debtors in them : that the sons, after their voluntary surrender of the deeds to their father to be cancelled, with a view to divest themselves of the title, and actual cancellation, could never have recovered the lands from their father, by any proceeding at law or in equity; they could not have maintained ejectments upon proof of the contents of deeds which they surrendered to be cancel-led ; and equity would not have aided them to compel their father to execute new deeds of gift: that the creditors of the sons, claiming under them, could not set up a title in them, which they could nowise have set up for themselves : and that, therefore, the debts due to the appellees ought not to have been charged on the lands. He said, there was no authority to the point, that after a <em>voluntary </em>surrender of a deed of <em>gift </em>of lands by the donee to the donor to be cancelled, for the purpose of divesting the title of the donee and revesting it in the donor, and the actual cancellation of such deed, no fraud ' or mistake being imputable to the transaction, any title remained in the donee for the benefit of his subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>creditors, or for any purpose whatever. And to shew ^ <em>x </em>x i*it . that there was no such authority, he cited and examined 4 Cruise\u2019s Dig. tit. 32. Deed. ch. 26. \u00a7 14. 15. 16. 17. p. 338. <em>Leech </em>v. <em>Leech, </em>2 Chan. Rep. 100. 13 Vin. Abr. Faits or Deeds.

Rep. 24. <em>Inhabitants of Conway </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of Deerfield, </em>11 Mass. Rep. 327.\u2014But 2ndly, supposing the decree right in charging the judgment debt due to the appellee <em>Richards, </em>on the lands which had been conveyed to <em>John </em>and <em>George, </em>he said it was wrong in charging the simple contract debt due from <em>John </em>to <em>Richards, </em>and his bond debt due to the appellees <em>T. O. Beatty, </em>upon the land that had been conveyed to him ; for if the title remained in him notwithstanding the cancellation of his deed, yet his creditors could only acquire a lien on it by getting judgments against him. <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Liggat, 2 </em>Leigh 84.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-7\"><em>Stanard </em>cited, on the first point, Gilb. Law Ev. 95. and <em>Magennis </em>v. <em>Mac Cullogh, </em>Gilb. Rep. 236. and relied on that case and the case of <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Archbishop of York, </em>to shew, that the cancellation of the deeds did not divest the title of the sons <em>John </em>and <em>George, </em>and restore it to the father <em>Benjamin. </em>He remarked, that the reasoning, in those cases, upon the effect of the english statute of frauds, was equally applicable to the provision of our statute of conveyances, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 99. \u00a7 1. p. 361. \u201c that no estate of inheritance or freehold, or for a term of more than five years, in lands or tenements, shall be conveyed from one to another, unless the conveyance be declared by writing sealed and delivered.\u201d Indeed, the statute alone was conclusive of the point. For the deeds of the father to the sons cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>tainly vested the title of the lands in them, and that title could no otherwise be conveyed back to the donor but by <em>deed; </em>nor could the cancellation of the deeds, by any violence of construction, be held tantamount to E reconveyance. Then as to the other objection to the decree; he said, that the appellee <em>Richards, </em>having a right to resort to the court of chancery for satisfaction of the judgment debt due to him from <em>John </em>and <em>George, </em>out of the lands conveyed to them, had a right to tack his simple contract claim against <em>John </em>to his judgment against him, especially as the debtor (except for his right in this land) was insolvent. And while <em>Richards </em>was properly entertained to charge the debts due to him on the land in question, as the property of the debtors, any other creditor of the same debtors, or of either of then},'v^as^also^pjopeply entertained to ask satisfaction of th\u00e9-'debts due fife\u00ae out of the same subject. The case of <em>Tate </em>v. Liggat was not in point to this case, which ought to be deqjded upon the principle of <em>Tinsley v. Anderson, </em>3 Call 329.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b81-13\"> He decided the causes in the court of chancery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b86-4\">The couR^f*</author>\n<p id=\"ARv\">approved and affirmed the decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
