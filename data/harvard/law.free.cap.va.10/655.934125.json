By the original will and the codicil of January 1826, mr. <em>Randolph </em>emancipated all his slaves; and bequeathed to his executor <em>(William Leigh) </em>the sum of 8000 dollars, and other funds, for transporting and settling the emancipated slaves in some other state or territory of the <em>U. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number><em>States, </em>and purchasing lands for them ; and he devised valuable lands in <em>Virginia </em>to be sold at his executor\u2019s discretion, and bequeathed the proceeds to <em>'Francis Scott Key </em>and <em>William Meade, </em>to be disposed of towards bettering their condition. The will and codicils were propounded for probat by mr. <em>Meade. </em>The heirs at law and next of kin of mr. <em>Randolph </em>were his nephew <em>John St. G. Randolph </em>(a lunatic) who was the only child of a deceased brother of mr. <em>Randolph, </em>and his only heir of the whole blood, <em>Henry St. G. Tucker </em>and <em>Nathaniel Beverley Tucker, </em>his brothers of the half blood, and <em>St. George Tucker Coalter </em>and <em>Elizabeth Tucker Bryan </em>(wife of <em>John Randolph Bryan) </em>children of his deceased sister of the -half blood ; and of these <em>John St. G. Randolph </em>by <em>Frederick Hobson </em>his committee, <em>Henry St. G. Tucker, </em>and <em>John R. Bryan and wife, </em>appeared as parties in the general court, contesting the probat of the will and codicils; but <em>Nathaniel B. Tucker </em>and <em>St. George T. Coalter </em>did not appear by the record to have been parties. <em>Hobson, </em>the committee of <em>John St. G. Randolph, </em>took an appeal from the sentence of probat to the court of appeals; and <em>Henry St. G. Tucker </em>and <em>John R. Bryan and wife </em>appealed from so much of the sentence as admitted to probat the instruments other than the codicil of the 26th August 1831. The court of appeals affirmed the sentence. And <em>William, Leigh, </em>the sole executor named in the will, qualified as such, in the general court, at December term 1837.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b680-10\">Immediately after the qualification of the executor, <em>Nathaniel B. Tucker </em>and <em>St. George T. Coalter </em>exhibited a bill in chancery in the circuit superior court for the county of <em>James City </em>and city of <em>Williamsburg, </em>against <em>Leigh </em>the executor, <em>Meade </em>and <em>Key </em>the trustees for the emancipated slaves, and the plaintiff\u2019s coheirs and codistributees, <em>John St. G. Randolph, Henry St. G. Tucker, </em>and <em>John R. Bryan and wife, </em>setting forth the will and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>codicils of mr. <em>Randolph </em>above mentioned, the probat thereof, and the qualification of the executor: alleging that mr. <em>Randolph, </em>at the time of making and publishing the testamentary papers which had been admitted to probat, and each and every of them, was of unsound mind and memory, and therefore not of capacity to dispose of his estate by will; that he had afterwards can-celled the first of the testamentary papers, namely, the <em>will </em>to which the others W'ere <em>codicils; </em>that he had, in the spring of the year 1832, subsequently to the last \u25a0of the codicils, made a will, whereby he devised and bequeathed his whole estate to his heirs at law and next of kin, of the whole and of the half blood, above named, to be divided among them according to the statutes of descents and distributions, and revoked all former wills; and that this his true last will had never been cancelled or otherwise revoked by him during his life, but it had been lost and destroyed by some person to the plaintiffs unknown : suggesting, that by the admission of the above mentioned testamentary papers to probat, and the grant of administration thereupon to <em>Leigh </em>the executor, he and <em>Meade </em>and <em>Key, </em>the trustees for the slaves thereby emancipated, w\u2019ould consider themselves empowered and required to carry into effect the provisions in relation to the slaves, and would, unless restrained by the court, immediately transport them beyond the limits of the commonwealth, so that in case those testamentary papers should be pronounced by the decree of the court not to be the last will and testament of mr. <em>Randolph, </em>their distributable interest in the slaves would be utterly lost to the plaintiffs, or they would be forced into a foreign jurisdiction to assert their claim to them: and praying, therefore, that the \u25a0 court should direct an issue or issues of <em>devisavit vel non, </em>to be tried by a jury on the law side of the court, to ascertain whether the testamentary papers which had been admitted to probat, or any of them, were the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>last will and testament of the deceased; that the court should compel the production of his last will and testament made in the spring of the year 1S32, when it should be discovered, or admit proof of the contents thereof, so that the same might be admitted to probat; and, in the mean time, that Leigh, the executor, should be restrained and injoined from carrying into effect any of the provisions of the said testamentary papers in relation to the slaves, and from removing them out of the commonwealth, and from doing any act as executor prejudicial to the rights of the plaintiffs as heirs and distributees of the deceased, and that <em>Meade </em>and <em>Key </em>should likewise be restrained and injoined from executing the trust conferred on them in relation to the slaves.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b682-9\">The injunction prayed for by the bill was awarded by the judge of the circuit superior court of <em>James City </em>and Williamsburg, and the order for the process was directed to the <em>cleric </em>of that <em>court, who </em>accordingly issued the process returnable to that court. The process 'was served on the defendants <em>Bryan and wife </em>in <em>Williamsburg, </em>they being there at the time, though they did not reside there : and it was sent to other parts of the commonwealth, where the other defendants resided or were found, and served on them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b682-10\">The executor <em>Leigh, </em>in his answer, controverted all the material allegations of the bill touching the validity of the testamentary papers of his testator admitted to probat in the general court; 'and he alleged, that both <em>the </em>plaintiffs, though they did <em>not </em>appear on the record <em>of </em>the court of probat, as parties contesting the probat, yet in fact joined in contesting the probat there, and therefore could not maintain this bill; that the defendants <em>Bryan and wife </em>were parties on the record contesting the probat, and were made defendants in this cause, in order by serving the process on them at <em>Williamsburg, </em>though they were only nominally defendants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>to give colour of jurisdiction to the circuit superior court for <em>James City </em>and <em>Williamsburg, </em>in which the suit was brought; that that court was held at a great distance from the residence of all the real defendants, and of the most material witnesses upon whose evidence the validity of the will in question depended, and was a most inconvenient tribunal for the trial of the cause; and (according to the construction put upon his answer by his counsel) he objected, that, in point of law, the court had no jurisdiction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b683-4\">The defendants <em>Meade </em>and <em>Key </em>referred to the answer of the executor <em>Leigh, </em>and relied on the grounds of defence therein stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b683-5\">The defendant <em>Henry St. G.

They made no objection to the jurisdiction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b683-7\">And <em>Hobson, </em>the committee of <em>John St. G.

Tucker </em>resided at <em>Williamsburg; </em>the plaintiff <em>St. George T. Coalter, </em>in <em>King William, </em>county. The defendant <em>Leigh, </em>the executor, resided in the county of <em>Halifax. </em>He was a judge of the general court assigned to the <em>ninth </em>circuit, composed of the counties of <em>Halifax, Charlotte, Prince Edward, Lunenburg </em>and <em>Mecklenburg. </em>The <em>next </em>or <em>adjacent </em>circuits were the <em>second, </em>the <em>eighth </em>and the <em>tenth: James City </em>and <em>Williamsburg </em>belonged to the <em>third </em>circuit, which was not adjacent to the <em>ninth. \u25a0 </em>The defendant <em>Meade </em>resided in the county of <em>Clarke; </em>the defendant <em>Key, </em>in the district of <em>Columbia; </em>the defendants <em>Bryan and wife, </em>in the county of <em>Gloucester; </em>the defendant <em>Henry St. G. Tucker, </em>president of the court of appeals, was a housekeeper in the city of <em>Richmond </em>during the session of the court there, but his residence, when he was not engaged in the discharge of his official duties at <em>Richmond </em>and <em>Lewisburg, </em>was in the county of <em>Jefferson.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b684-13\">The cause coming on for hearing in November 1839, the defendants <em>Leigh, </em>the executor, <em>Meade </em>and <em>Key, </em>the trustees for the manumitted slaves, and <em>Bryan and wife, </em>moved the court, 1st, to dismiss the bill for want of jurisdiction of the court in the cause; and if that motion should be overruled, then, 2dly, to remove the cause to some other court more convenient to the defendants and their witnesses; and if both those motions should be overruled, then, 3dly, to direct the issue of <em>devisamt vel non </em>to be tried at the bar of some other court more convenient to the defendants and their witnesses. The court overruled the motion to dismiss the cause for want of jurisdiction, on the ground, chiefly, that the objection to the jurisdiction was not distinctly pleaded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>m the answer of the defendant Leigh, but it also expressed the opinion that it had <em>jurisdiction; </em>and then overruled the other two motions, and directed an issue of <em>devisavitvel non to </em>be tried by a jury on the common law side of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b685-5\">The defendants <em>Leigh, Meade </em>and <em>Key</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3DB\">applied by petition to this court for an appeal from the order; which was allowed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b685-12\">The cause was argued here by <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Robertson </em>for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Am1\">and by <em>Brooke </em>and <em>R.

The provisions of the circuit court law of 1819,1 Rev. Code, ch. 69. \u00a7 53. 54. p. 239. \u201cIf either of the judges of the general court be interested in any suit, which, in the case of any other person, would have been proper for the jurisdiction of such judge, it shall be lawful to institute such suit in any court within <em>an adjacent circuit, </em>and the process from such <em>adjacent </em>court may be served in the circuit to which such judge shall be allotted, or in which he shall reside, and proceedings shall be thereupon had.\u201d\u2014 \u201cWhen any judge of a circuit court shall be interested in any cause depending in his circuit, or related to either of the parties, or in any manner situated so as to render it improper, in his judgment, to preside at the trial, it shall be lawful for such judge to cause the same to be removed to <em>the next circuit, </em>and to the most convenient court in that circuit, for trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-15\">2. The 38th section of the circuit superior court law, Supp. to Rev. Code, ch. 109. p. 151. \u201cIf there be more than one defendant in any suit in chancery, brought or pending in any circuit superior court, the said suit may be instituted in the circuit superior court of the county or corporation <em>wherein either of them may reside, </em>and the clerk shall and may issue process against the other defendant or defendants, directed to the counties or corporations in which they may be found; and on the return thereof, the like proceedings shall be had as if all the defendants resided within such county or corporation: <em>Provided, </em>that any such circuit superior court sitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>\u2022in chancery, may, at any time, on motion and for good cause shewn by any defendant or defendants <em>residing </em>in any other county or corporation than that wherein such suit in chancery may be brought, or for reasons appearing to the court itself, order any such suit to be removed to the circuit superior court of the county or corporation, wherein the defendant or defendants principally interested or chargeable may reside.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-13\">And 3. the 41st section of the same statute, which provides, that \u201cthe judges of the circuit superior courts shall each have and exercise a general jurisdiction in awarding injunctions, whether the judgment or proceeding injoiued be rendered by a superior or inferior court, <em>within </em>or <em>without </em>their respective circuits, or the party against whose proceeding the injunction be asked, be a resident <em>within </em>or <em>without </em>the circuit of such judge awarding the same; but the order of such judge, awarding an injunction to a judgment <em>or proceeding not within his circuit, </em>shall be <em>directed to the cleric of the court of that county or corporation, </em>in which such judgment shall be rendered, or <em>proceeding apprehended; </em>on which such proceedings in all respects shall be hereafter had, as if the order had been made by the judge in whose circuit such judgment may have been rendered, or proceeding had or apprehended.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b686-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Scott, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AyW\">delivered the opinion of the court\u2014That the 41st section of the circuit superior court law, which gives general jurisdiction to each of the judges of the circuit superior courts, to award injunctions to judgments rendered, or to proceedings had or apprehended, without as well as within his own circuit, yet expressly requires, that -the order of the judge awarding an injunction, in such case, shall be directed to the clerk of the court of that county or corporation, in which the judgment shall have been rendered, or the proceeding is <em>apprehended; </em>that, in such case, the statute, in effect, gives the judge jurisdiction only to award the process, not to hear and determine the cause, and refers the cause to another and more convenient tribunal; and that, as the proceedings which were apprehended in this case, and which were in-joined, were proceedings that were to be had in the county of <em>Charlotte, </em>the judge erred in directing the order for the process of injunction to the clerk of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>circuit superior court for <em>James City </em>and <em>Williamsburg, </em>and the process and the subsequent proceedings being founded on that order, were without authority and erroneous. That, therefore, the same should be reversed with costs.
