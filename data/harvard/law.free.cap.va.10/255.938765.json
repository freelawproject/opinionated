In an action of debt upon a bond, defendant pleads that the bond was given for the price of goods which he bought of plaintiif, who represented that they were sound and marketable, when in fact they were unsound and damaged, and by means thereof unsaleable; but the plea does not aver a warranty of the quality of the goods; or that the plaintiff knew that the said representations made by him were untrue; or that he used any fraud or art to disguise or conceal their true condition or quality. The plea is defective; and properly rejected when tendered.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b273-10\">2. But in such ease the \u2022 plea avers that the representations were untrue, and that the plaintiif at the time of making them knew them to be untrue, and knowingly made them with the intent to defraud the defendant; and proceeds to set out the unsoundness of numerous articles purchased, and to detail particulars in which the representations had turned out to be untrue: This is a good plea.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b273-12\">3. Duplicity in a plea can only be objected to by a special demurrer.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-13\">This was an action of debt on a bond for four hundred and four dollars, instituted by Smith and Sinclair against H. B. Cunningham, in the Circuit court of Ritchie county. The defendant filed a special plea in the nature of a setoff, for two hundred dollars, to which the plaintiff demurred. He also tendered another special plea in the nature of setoff', which was objected to by the plaintiff and rejected by the court: To which opinion of the court rejecting the plea the defendant excepted. Both of these are set out in their substance in the opinion of Judge Daniel. On the hearing of the cause the court below sustained the plaintiff\u2019s demurrer to the defendant\u2019s plea, and rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiff for their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>whole debt. Whereupon the defendant applied to this</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b274-9\"><em>Fry, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b274-10\">There was no counsel for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b274-4\">Daniel, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Aok\">The plea rejected by the court was, I think, defective. It does not aver a warranty of the quality of the goods for the price of which the single bill in the declaration mentioned is alleged to have been given; nor does it aver that the defendants in error knew that the representations alleged to have been made by them with respect to the soundness and marketable quality of said goods were untrue, or that they used any fraud or art to disguise or conceal their true condition or quality. The plea is, I think, liable also to a further objection. After setting out that the defendants in error had represented the goods to be sound and marketable, when in fact they were unsound and damaged, and by reason thereof unsaleable, the plea proceeds to state further that the plaintiff in error was a merchant doing business, &amp;c., and that he had endeavored to the best of his skill to keep for sale articles of merchandise of a sound and marketable character, and had usually done so until he was induced, by the false representations of the defendants in error, to purchase the goods in question, and that the mixing of them with the merchandise on hand in his store injured the sale of the others, depriving the said plaintiff in error of custom, and seriously damaging him in his business. And the plea concludes by averring his right to have the damages sustained by reason of the several matters in the plea set forth allowed as a setoff to the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">If the special damage to the business of the plaintiff in error as a merchant, just above mentioned, could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>avail him as a defence in any form of plea, (about which it is not necessary to express an opinion,) I think it very obvious that a plea relying on remote consequences would have to be characterized by a particularity of averment, in which the one under consideration is plainly wanting. The plea was, I think, properly rejected. I have been unable, however, to discover any valid ground of objection to the plea demurred to. It distinctly avers that the defendants in error represented, the articles bought to be sound and of a good and marketable quality; and that the plaintiff in error, relying upon and believing the said representations, purchased the bill of goods: And that said representations were untrue, and that the defendants in error, at the time of making them, knew them to be untrue, and knowingly made them with the intent to defraud the said plaintiff in error. And the plea then proceeds to set out the unsoundness of numerous articles purchased, and to detail, otherwise, particulars in which the representations had turned out to be untrue. The plea substantially sets out a false warranty and avers damage from its breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">It is true that this plea labors under the formal defect of duplicity, in as much as it also avers that by the agreement the defendants in error were to forward and deliver all of the articles purchased, and that some of them had never been forwarded and delivered; and damage is claimed for this breach of the agreement. Two distinct grounds of defence, breach of warranty and partial failure of consideration, are thus relied on in one plea. This defect might have been remedied if it had been pointed out by a <em>special </em>demurrer, but it is not of a character so essential to the defence as to be reached by a <em>general </em>demurrer. I think therefore that the court erred in sustaining instead of overruling the demurrer; and that for this cause the judgment should be reversed as to the amount of two hundred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>dollars, the damages claimed as a setoff by the plea, and affirmed as to the residue; and the cause remanded further proceedings, with liberty to the defendants tn error to withdraw their demurrer and reply to said Plea\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">The other judges concurred in the opinion of <em>Daniel, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
