Held, although, according to the strictest and most formal practice, the plaintiff may be required to amend his bill and urge therein the objections to the settlement shewn by the evidence, yet it is competent to the court to \u25a0dispense with this proceeding, and permit the plaintiff to proceed in respect to the objections shewn by the evidence, in like manner as if they had been noticed by the bill.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b458-9\">In such case, if the defendant object that he is surprised by the new objections to the account, the court may and ought to give him time to combat them; and if he urge the privilege he would have by answer to an amended bill, to explain and defend the account in these respects, that privilege may and ought to be secured to him, by allowing him to file his affidavit containing such explanation and defence, and by giving to such affidavit the lijce credit and effect, as his answer containing the like matter would be entitled to. <em>Per Stanard, J.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b458-10\">On a bill impeaching a settled account, the title of the complainant to relief depends on his success in shewing errors against him in the settlement, and when the court directs an account to 'be taken, the commissioner, in executing the order of account, \u25a0should confine himself to a statement of those errors, the sum of which is the proper measure of relief.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b458-11\">Articles of agreement are several times made between the same parties, each for the sale of a separate parcel of the same tract of land. The articles, on most occasions, import that a good and sufficient title is to be made by a specified time, and that the vendee is to pay when such title free of all incumbrance is made. In some of the articles it is stated, that the vendee is to pay in one month after such title is made; and on one occasion the articles, after mentioning that the <em>money is to </em>be paid so soon as such title is made, and after specifying the time when the title is to be made, proceed to state that if the vendee pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>sooner, lie is to have interest for the amount paid, and peaceable possession of the land until the obligation is complied with. By virtue of these stipulations and agreements, the vendee (although in possession and receiving the profits) claims interest on all sums paid by him before a title is made him free of incumbrance. This claim is afterwards compromised. The commissioner, and the court below, disregard the compromise as well as the articles of sale, and allow the vendee interest on his payments, only until he obtains possession. Held, the compromise ought not to be disturbed, unless on specific allegation and proof of fraud, imposition or mistake.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-12\">On the 5th of February 1815, <em>Evan S.

A deed was thereupon made conveying the same to <em>Shugart; </em>the consideration expressed in which conveyance is the sum of 2740 dollars. The deed bears date the 18th of April 1818, and on its face purports to be the deed, of that date, of both <em>Thompson </em>and wife. But the privy examination of mrs. <em>Thompson </em>was not taken till the 17th of August 1819, and the certificate thereof was not returned to the clerk\u2019s office till the 20th of October 1819.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-6\">In April 1822, the parties applied to <em>Benjamin Estill </em>to assist them in adjusting the principles upon which a settlement contemplated between them was to be made. In the suit in equity of <em>Thompson </em>herein after mentioned, the deposition of <em>Estill </em>was taken for <em>Shugart </em>on the 24th of March 1824. <em>Estill </em>deposed that the parties differed principally about the interest which <em>Shugart </em>charged upon the payments made for the land. <em>Thompson </em>contended, that as <em>Shugart </em>had the land in possession and was receiving the profits, he <em>Thompson </em>ought not to pay interest; that if he paid interest, <em>Shugart </em>ought to pay rent. This, <em>Estill </em>considered to be natural justice. But <em>Shugart </em>contended, that by various contracts he was to have interest on all payments, till he got his title, clear of all <em>incumbrance; </em>and that being the contract, he claimed it as a right. The mother of <em>Thompson, Shugart </em>said, had a life estate in all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>the lands sold, this part of the land having been as\u00bb signed her for her dower in a larger tract. He anticipated difficulty and expense in extinguishing her title, and was moreover liable to her for rents and profits. ,jje therefore conceived it fair and reasonable that he should have interest on his money. <em>Estill </em>proposed a compromise, to which the parties consented; <em>Shugart </em>with apparent reluctance. On the same day, he prepared the writing containing the compromise; which was executed, and attested by him. This writing bears date the 20th of April 1822. It is under the hands and seals of <em>Shugart </em>and <em>Thompson, </em>and witnesses \u201cthat the said <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Shugart </em>have agreed to settle their accounts relating to the purchase and payment of <em>Thompson's </em>land by <em>Shugart, </em>on the following terms: said <em>Thompson </em>will immediately procure to be conveyed to <em>Shugart </em>his mother\u2019s right of dower in those lands, and will allow said <em>Shugart </em>interest on all payments made therefor before the lands were conveyed by <em>Thompson and wife </em>to <em>Shugart, </em>or within one month after the conveyance wTas made, excepting such sums as <em>Shugart </em>was bound by his various articles of agreement to pay immediately, or before a title was made to him ; such as the 28 dollars to <em>William Love, </em>the 100 dollar horse, the 200 dollars to colo. <em>Tate, See. </em>on all which class of payments no interest is to be allowed to <em>Shugart. </em>Said <em>Shugart </em>is also to be allowed interest on all bonds, notes &amp;c. held by him on <em>Thomp</em>s&lt;m.until one month after the said conveyance was made by <em>Thompson and wife. </em>Said settlement to be made on these principles, within two weeks from this date.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-7\">On the 3d of May 1822, the parties met at the house of <em>William Love </em>in order to have a settlement, and an account was then drawn up by <em>Love, </em>by direction of <em>Shugart: but Thompson </em>claiming credit for more land than was allowed for by <em>Shugart, </em>and objecting to some items claimed by <em>Shugart, </em>the disagreement between the parties prevented any settlement being made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Shortly afterwards, <em>Shugart </em>brought an action at law in the county court of <em>Washington, </em>against <em>Thompson, </em>upon his bond of the 5th of February 1815, and at November term 1822 obtained judgment for the amount thereof. Execution was issued immediately, and levied on <em>Thompson\u2019s </em>slaves.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-4\">On the 14th of December 1822, <em>Thompson\u2019s </em>mother relinquished her right to the lands sold <em>Shugart, </em>and her deed was admitted to record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-5\">Upon this relinquishment being made, the sale of the slaves was suspended.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-6\">On the 25th of January 1823, the sheriff who had levied the execution, <em>Charles Tate, </em>met <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Shugart, </em>at the request of <em>Thompson </em>and at his house, for the purpose of assisting in making a settlement between them. <em>Thompson </em>produced no vouchers, but a settlement was made by the account and vouchers of <em>Shugart. </em>At this settlement, credits were given to <em>Thompson </em>for the land bought of him by <em>Shugart, </em>amounting to 2563 dollars 9^ cents; credits were given to <em>Shugart </em>for payments, interest and setoffs (exclusive of the bond on which judgment had been obtained) to the amount of 2441 dollars 22 <em>cents; </em>and for the difference, amounting to 121 dollars 87\u00bf- cents, <em>Shugart </em>gave <em>Thompson </em>a due bill, or rather a memorandum, stating thaL he would account for that amount, subject to a deduction for the costs of a chancery suit which <em>Shugart </em>had brought against <em>Thompson </em>and his mother. At the same time, <em>Shugart </em>wrote an order to bis attorney to dismiss that suit, and <em>Thompson </em>signed a receipt for 2563 dollars 9\u00a3 cents, in full for the land conveyed to <em>Shugart.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-7\"><em>Thompson </em>desiring a new settlement, delivered up that due bill, and asked that the receipt which he had signed should be returned to him. <em>Shugart </em>declined this, but deducted from the amount of the due bill 34 dollars for the costs of the chancery suit, and 22 dol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>lars 75 cents upon another account; and the balance of 65 dollars 12\u00a3 cents he credited upon the forthcoming bond which <em>Thompson </em>had been compelled to give.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A7y5\">In this state of the accounts, <em>Thompson, </em>on the 9th of May 1823, presented a bill to the judge of the supenor court of chancery at <em>Wythe </em>courthouse, alleging, that at the time of the settlement of the 25th of January 1823, he was at the mercy of <em>Shugart </em>and compelled to submit to any terms he might dictate, and had for that reason submitted to the settlement which he now impeached. The bill sets forth credits improperly omitted and charges improperly made, and claims that <em>Shugart </em>is indebted to the complainant <em>more </em>than 1100 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-5\">An injunction being prayed for by the bill, to restrain <em>Shugart </em>from proceeding farther on the forthcoming bond, the chancellor awarded the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-6\">On the 27th of May 1823, <em>ShugaH </em>filed his answer, denying all the matters alleged in the bill as grounds for, impeaching or setting aside the settlement of the 25th of January 1823, and shewing some of those allegations to be unfounded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-7\">Two days after the answer was filed, a motion was made to dissolve the injunction; but the court overruled the motion, and ordered that an account be taken between the parties before commissioner <em>Johnston.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-8\">The commissioner, upon the proofs before him, reported various sums as having been either charged twice by the defendant, or charged for a greater amount than was proper; but the surcharges established by these proofs were not those alleged in the bill. The commissioner allowed the defendant interest on his payments until he obtained possession of the lands, but no longer. And the result of his report was, that the bond upon <em>which </em>judgment had been obtained at law was paid, and there was a balance due <em>Thompson, </em>as of the 15th of October 1823, of 534 dollars 2 cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>On the motion of th\u00e9 defendant, supported by his affidavit, the court, on the 23d of October 1823, recommitted the report to the commissioner. There being, in the opinion of the commissioner, farther proof establishing an additional overcharge, the result shewn by this second report was, that the bond was paid off, and a balance due <em>Thompson, </em>as of the 15th of October 1823, of 716 dollars 22J- cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-4\">To this report the defendant filed ten exceptions. The 8th was in these words : <em>\u201c </em>Because the commissioner did not conform, in stating the accounts between the parties, to the agreement entered into on the 20th day of April 1822, which is not pretended to be impeached, either on account of fraud, incapacity, or a'ny other ground, either alleged or supported.\u201d The 9th exception was because the commissioner did not conform his statement of the accounts between the parties to the settlement made between them on the 25th of January 1823.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-6\">The cause coming on to be heard upon the bill, answer, exhibits, examinations of witnesses, and the report of commissioner <em>Johnston </em>with the exceptions thereto, the court, on consideration thereof, decreed that the first and fourth exceptions be sustained, and that all the others be overruled, except the fifth, which was sustained in part. And the report was thereupon recommitted to commissioner <em>Matthews, </em>to be reformed accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-7\">After the court had made this decree, it is a little remarkable that at the next term, on the motion of the defendant, it was ordered that the report of commissioner <em>Johnston </em>be recommitted to commissioner <em>Matthews, </em>who was directed to consider the same with the exceptions filed thereto, and report thereupon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-8\">Commissioner <em>Matthews </em>fixed on the first of January 1818, as the date from which interest was to be allowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>the plaintiff on the whole amount of purchase money. On the sums paid by the defendant he allowed interest from the <em>time </em>of payment, with the exception of the 100 dollars for a horse, 28 dollars to <em>William </em>Love, 200 dollars to <em>Charles </em>Tate, and one other payment particularly provided for in the articles. On these sums the commissioner did not allow interest until after the first of January 1818. On some of the other matters which were the subject of exception, the views of commissioner <em>Matthews </em>were different from those of commissioner <em>Johnston. </em>His report resulted in shewing a balance due <em>Shugarfs </em>estate on the 1st of January 1824, of 372 doliars. And exceptions thereto were filed by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-4\">Before a decision upon these exceptions, both parties died, and the cause was revived in the name of the plaintiff\u2019s administrator against the defendant\u2019s administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-5\">At April term 1838 of the circuit court of <em>Wythe, </em>the administrator of <em>Shugart </em>presented a petition for a rehearing. Besides insisting that there was error in overruling the 5th exception to the report of commissioner <em>Johnston </em>(an exception involving no principle whatever, but depending entirely upon the evidence), the petitioner urged that there was error in overruling the 8th exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-6\">On the 23d of April 1838, the court decreed that the rehearing prayed for be refused, that the exceptions of the complainant to the report of commissioner <em>Matthews </em>be sustained, that the same be recommitted to him, and <em>that he make out his report </em>in conformity with the opinion of the court before given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-7\">On the petition of <em>Shugarfs </em>administrator, an appeal was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b466-8\"><em>M'Comas </em>argued the cause in this court for the appellant.

But the order of account having been made, the parties proceeded with their proofs before the commissioner; and the facts developed there, if they do not sustain the specific objections to the settlement taken in the bill, and in those respects establish a surcharge thereof, ascertain to my satisfaction that the settlement may be justly surcharged in other respects. This being so, one of two courses might have been taken by the court below. If that court had pursued the strictest and most technical rule of practice, it might have declined to proceed to grant the plaintiff relief in respect to the objections to the settlement shewn by the evidence though not noticed by the' bill, unless the plaintiff amended his bill in this respect, and urged those objections as further matter of surcharge and falsification of the account, so as to afford the defendant the benefit of the explanation and defence he might make by his answer to such amended bill. Or, dispensing with this circuitous and formal proceeding, the court might permit the commissioner to proceed in respect of the matters embraced by the objections so developed, in like manner as if they had been noticed by the bill. My opinion is, that it was within the competency of the court to take the latter course. Such a practice seems to me recommended by many considerations. It is more compendious and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>less expensive, and tends to prevent or shorten those delays in the administration of justice, which are grievanees admitted by all, and by many urged as a reproach to its ministers. Every object of the more formal proceeding, and every privilege of defence it would afford, may be attained under this more summary practice. If the defendant should object that he is surprised by the new objections to the account, the court may and ought to give him time to combat them ; and if he urges <em>the privilege he </em>would have by answer <em>to </em>an amended bill, to explain and defend the account in these respects, that privilege may and ought to be secured to him, by allowing time to file his affidavit containing such explanation and defence, and giving to such affidavit the like credit and effect as his answer containing the like matter would be entitled to. Thinking that several errors are shewn in the settlement of January 1823, by the proofs in the case and the investigations of the commissioner, my opinion is that the proposition of the appellant, that the bill ought to be dismissed because those errors had not been specifically noticed therein, cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Proceeding to the other questions brought before this \u2022court by the appeal, the first and most important is that presented by the 8th exception of the appellant to the report of commissioner <em>Johnston.' </em>My opinion is that-that exception ought to have been sustained. By it the appellant insists, that the charge of interest on his payments should be governed by the agreement of the parties, made the 20th of April 1822; and that the court <em>below, in </em>overruling that exception, in effect not only cancelled that agreement, but also the former agreements made by the parties, under which, if carried into \u2022effect, the appellant would have been entitled to a large allowance of interest. Waiving the investigation of the \u2022question how far the stipulations in some of the contracts between the parties, that the purchase money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>should be payable <em>when a complete and unincumbered^ title should he made, </em>would postpone the accrual of interest on the purchase money until such title should be made, even though the purchaser had possession before that time; and without scrutinizing the particular agreements made by the parties in regard to the interest on some of the payments made intermediately between the contracts of purchase and the conveyance of a complete title, I have no doubt that the claims of the appellant founded on such stipulations and agreements might be compromised by the parties, and that a compromise of them ought not to be disturbed unless on specific allegation and proof of fraud, imposition or mistake. In this case, the agreement in question was a compromise of the claims aforesaid, and so far from being impeached by the bill, there is no allusion to it in the bill, and the only evidence in respect to it (that of B. <em>JEstill) </em>instead of fastening on it the stain of fraud or imposition, tends to free it from that imputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">Besides, if this compromise were disregarded, and the rights of the parties depended on the effect of the stipulations and previous agreements aforesaid, it is at least problematical whether more interest would not be allowed to the appellant, or withheld from the appellee, than is so under the compromise. The result is, that in the settlement of the accounts, that compromise ought to regulate the charge or allowance of interest on the payments that were to bear interest, and on the purchase money. I am further of opinion that the settlement of January 1823 should be the basis of a resettlement, rejecting from that account such items of charges to the appellee as are ascertained to be incorrect or improper, and giving him the proper credits that have been omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">[The judge proceeded to express an opinion on such of the details of the case as had been brought under the notice of the court below, and pointed out the ere<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>dits omitted in the settled account which should be gi<em>j </em>ven to the appellee, and the charges against him there-'s in which were improperly made; and concluded as follows:]</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">One of the results of the view I have taken of the case is, that the reports of both the commissioners are entirely wrong in the frame they have given the accounts. The balance appearing due on the settlement of January 1823 having been paid by the appellant, and his due bill taken in, the extent of the errors of that settlement was ascertainable by adding the errors of the charges to the appellee to the amount of the omissions of credit, and the sum was the measure of relief to which he was entitled. If that sum exceeded the injoined judgment, the court should have perpetuated the injunction, and decreed in favour of the appellee for the excess; if it was less than the judgment, it should have been set off against the judgment, the injunction dissolved for the excess of the judgment and perpetuated for the amount set off, and in both cases the costs ought to have been decreed to the appellee, and in the latter case the court should have certified against damages on the sum for which the injunction was dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-13\">The decree of the court of appeals was in conformity with the foregoing opinion. This decree (in which all the judges concurred) declared, that the title of the appellee to the relief he sought in the court below, depended on his success in shewing errors in the settlement of January 1823, either in the charges made against him or the credits allowed him in that settlement; and that, as a consequence of this, when the commissioner proceeded to execute the order of account made by the court below, he should have confined himself to a statement of those errors, the sum of which was the proper measure of relief to which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>appellee was entitled. It further declared, that in executing the order of account, the commissioner should have been governed by the agreement between the parties dated the 20th of April 1822, in relation to the allowance of interest on the payments of the appellant, before the 20th of November 1819, on account of his several purchases of land, and the allowance of interest to the appellee on the purchase money of the lands sold the <em>appellant; </em>interest on, that purchase money not accruing, under that agreement, before the said 20th of November 1819.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">On the proofs in the record, the settlement of January 1823 was declared to be surchargeable, for omitting to credit the appellee with particular sums, and improperly charging him with others; all of which were specified in the decree. It was then declared, that the reports of both the commissioners are radically wrong in the manner of stating the accounts, as well as erroneous in many respects; and that they should be entirely set aside, and a new account taken, which should not go at large into the transactions,between the parties, but should simply state the erroneous charges to the appellee, and the credits to which he was entitled but which were omitted, in the settled account of January 1823, the aggregate of which is the proper measure of relief to which he is entitled j and if that aggregate should exceed the amount of the injoined judgment, the injunction should be perpetuated and a decree rendered in favour of the appellee for the excess, and if not equal to the judgment, it should be set off against it, and the injunction should be dissolved for the excess of the judgment; and in either case the costs in the court below should be decreed to the appellee, and in the latter the court should certify against damages on the amount for which the injunction may be dissolved. The court therefore adjudged and decreed, that so much of the interlocutory orders of the circuit superior court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>law and chancery for the county of <em>Wythe, </em>made in this cause, as may conflict with the foregoing opinions be reversed and annulled, and that the appellant recover of the appellee the costs by him expended in the prosecution of his appeal in this court, to be levied &amp;c. And the cause was remanded to the said circuit superior court of law and chancery, for further proceedings according to the principles of this decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
