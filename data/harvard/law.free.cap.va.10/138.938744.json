Reeves. In his bill he charged that the note on which the judgment was recovered, was given for the price of one-sixteenth of a tract of seventy-five acres of land in the county of Grayson, on which it was represented there was a silver mine. That before his purchase Reeves represented to the plaintiff that the ore on the land had been tested, and had been ascertained to be silver ore. That the plaintiff had made no experiment himself, and knew nothing of the quality of the ore, or what kind of ore it was; but relied wholly on the representations of Reeves. That after his purchase the plaintiff and others who had an interest in the mine, proceeded to search for ore, and to make some experiments; but they could find no silver ore; and that the ore found on the land had been tested and ascertained to be iron. That it was untrue as stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>by Reeves, that the ore had been tested and ascertained to be silver, prior to plaintiff\u2019s purchase, and that said representation was fraudulent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-4\">The plaintiff further stated that the land on which this silver mine was supposed to be, was held in the early part of the year 1845, by Richard Billings, by virtue of a title bond executed to him by Charles Doughten. That after the pretended discovery of the silver ore, Billings commenced to sell interests in the said mine to various persons; and amongst others, he sold to Jesse A. Reeves one-fourth of the whole interest in the mine. That this contract was conditional that if the ore upon the land proved to be good silver ore, he was to pay to Billings five hundred dollars; but if the ore did not prove to be silver the contract was to be void. That afterwards, in the month of March 1845, Reeves sold to the plaintiff one-fourth part of his interest for six hundred dollars, for the payment of which the plaintiff executed his bond payable in six months. That after the experiments made as before stated, by the parties having an interest in the mine, the plaintiff determined to make a further experiment, and for that purpose went upon the land where the mine was represented to be, when Billings refused to permit him to work upon it, he being in possession of the land and alleging that those, and among them Reeves, who had purchased from Mm an interest in the mine, had refused to pay him. That Reeves, as plaintiff had understood and believed, had not paid any part of the purchase money, but had refused to do so. That he could not make a sufficient title to the interest he had sold the plaintiff. That he had not acquired the legal title to any part of the land. That Doughten and Billings were not vested with the title; but that it was outstanding in another person, upon whom there was no obligation to convey it to any <em>one; </em>so that if the ore in the mine was really silver, the plaintiff was advised that under Ms contract with Reeves, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>he ought not to he compelled to pay the purchase money until the title was secured to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-10\">Reeves answered the bill. He admitted the facts as to Billings\u2019 title to the land under a title bond from Doughten; and that he had purchased from Billings upon the condition stated in the bill. But he denied that the plaintiff relied wholly on his representations in reference to the mine a'nd the quality of the ore; or that he . had made any such representations to the plaintiff as he stated in his bill; and he alleged that before the plaintiff purchased he had an experiment made with the ore. He further stated that the plaintiff knew, before his purchase, the terms on which defendant had purchased from Billings; and that he knew further, that after he had agreed to purchase, defendant had agreed to pay Billings. That plaintiff had endeavored to prevent Billings from fulfilling his agreement with the defendant, and had procured him to forbid plaintiff\u2019s working the mine that he might have an excuse for putting such a charge in his bill. The plaintiff knew the condition of the title when he purchased; and in fact there was no difficulty about it, as defendant hoped would fully appear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-11\">The testimony in the cause showed that Dickey did, before his purchase, test the ore; and there was a total absence of any proof that Reeves made any representations to him as to the character or quality of the ore. Whilst the cause was pending, Doughten executed a deed by which he conveyed the land to Billings; and' Billings conveyed to Reeves.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-12\">The deposition of Jesse Austin was taken, and he stated, that he claimed a part of the land sold by Doughten to Billings; and he stated further, that he had executed a bond to Reeves and others, by which he had bound himself that if any part of the mineral was on his land they should have it on the same terms on which they were to get it from Billings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-13\">In 1849 the cause came on to be heard, when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>court perpetuated the injunction; whereupon Reeves obtained an appeal to this court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>twelve thousand dollars, and executed to him his note for eight hundred dollars, which he afterwards paid. At the same time Peay executed a deed bearing the 9th of June 1836, by which he conveyed to Morrison the real estate purchased of him upon the condition that if Peay paid the note of eight hundred dollars, with interest from the 11th of April preceding, when it fell due; and further, if Morrison should fail to collect from the Clarkes the bond for twelve thousand dollars, or any part thereof, with its interest, then if Peay, his executors, &amp;c. should pay the same, or any balance that should be due thereon, according to the terms thereof, to Morrison or his assigns, then the deed to be void. But it was expressly agreed between the parties, that if the said bond for twelve thousand dollars could not or should not be paid from the proceeds of any sale which might take place under the deed of trust by which it was secured, Morrison was not to be required to pursue the obligors in the bond personally; but might have immediate recourse to this mortgage for any balance either of principal or interest which might be due and unpaid on said bond.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number><em>Floyd, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b159-5\"><em>B.

Relief is sought against the judgment on the grounds, first, of fraud in making the sale; and secondly, of want of title. Let us see whether and how far such relief should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">First. On the ground of fraud. The appellee has wholly failed to prove that the appellant was guilty of any fraud in making the sale. I have carefully examined and considered the evidence in the case, and am of opinion that so far from sustaining the allegations of fraud contained in the bill, it proves the contrary. I deem it unnecessary to review the evidence in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">But it is argued by the counsel for the appellee, that the appellant had only a conditional interest in the mine, and, in selling an absolute interest, sold what was not his; and was therefore guilty of a fraud. A sufficient answer to this argument is, that the appellee made the purchase with full knowledge of the nature of the appellant\u2019s interest: and it is difficult to conceive how, in such a case, a vendor can be guilty of fraud in selling a greater interest than he has. The fact no doubt is, that the appellant, in the view of the parties, substantially had the interest which he sold. That interest was his if the mine was of any value; and if of no value, the matter was of no real importance. . The material difference between Billings\u2019 contract with him and his with the appellee was, that by the former the purchase money was to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>be paid conditionally, whereas by the latter it was to be paid absolutely. It was certainly competent for the appellant, having purchased an interest for a sum of money payable conditionally, to sell it for a sum payable absolutely. The interest being his, however acquired, could lawfully be sold on such terms as might be agreed on between him and the purchaser. In selling an absolute, when he had only a conditional interest, he may have sold what, formally, was not his. But he did not thereby deceive the purchaser, nor do any injustice to Billings, who was probably privy to the sale, and at all events would be willing to ratify it on receiving the purchase money which the appellant had stipulated to pay him. To obtain the ratification of Billings, the appellant had only to dispense with the condition annexed, for his benefit, to his purchase, and make it absolute. Indeed, he might make his purchase absolute by admitting for that purpose that the mine was valuable. And he would be benefited by doing so, even if it were necessary for him to pay for the three-sixteenths purchased of Billings, to insure the sale of one-sixteenth to the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">Secondly. As to the want of title. The appellee knew at the time of his purchase, that Billings held the land by a mere title bond from Doughten; for the fact is recited in his contract. But he avers in his bill that neither Billings nor Doughten is vested with the title; and that it is outstanding in another person, upon whom there is no obligation to convey it. The name of that person is not stated in the bill. But it appears from the evidence that Jesse Austin claims a part of the land, and has recently brought an action of trespass against Billings. <em>When </em>the claim was first asserted, does not appear; though it probably was not until after the sale to the appellee. The fact, however, is not material. Before the claim was asserted Austin purchased from Billings an interest in the mine; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>he has since given his bond to the appellant and others to sell to them on the same terms on which they had purchased from Billings, if any part of the minerals should be on any part of his land. Therefore, if it should turn out that Austin is entitled to any part of the land included in the bounds of the tract sold by Doughten to Billings, the appellant would have the same right to perfect his title to one-sixteenth of the minerals on that part as on the residue of the tract. At all events, the appellant having been guilty of no fraud in making the sale, and there being no just ground for rescinding it, he ought to have a reasonable opportunity of perfecting the title if it be defective. He conveyed the interest to the appellee at the time of the sale, who has since, in effect, been in the enjoyment of it, and explored and worked the mine. It is true he says in his bill, that he had recently determined to make a further experiment, and went for that purpose to the land, when Billings forbid and refused to permit him to work upon it. But it is proved that this was by the procurement of the appellee, and a mere contrivance to avoid the sale and evade the payment of the purchase money. It appears, from exhibits filed in the cause and copied into the record, that since the suit was instituted Doughten has conveyed the land to Billings; and the latter has conveyed one-sixteenth of the mines and minerals on the land to the appellant. So that it is probable the title is either already perfect, or may be made so by a release from Austin, if he has any right to any part of the land. But the appellee ought not to be compelled to pay the purchase money without having a good title.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">I therefore think the decree should be reversed, and the cause remanded, with directions to the Circuit court to ascertain whether a good title has been or can be made; and if it has been, or can and shall, in a reasonable time, be made, to dissolve the injunction; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>otherwise, to perpetuate it. But as the appellee had not received a good title when the hill was filed, and therefore rightfully came into a court of equity to enjoin the judgment, he should recover his costs in the Circuit court, in any event, and should pay no damages in case the injunction should be dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">The other judges concurred in the opinion of Judge <em>Moncure.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">The decree was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">The court is of opinion, that the contract of sale in the proceedings mentioned, between the appellant and appellee, was fairly made without any fraud or misrepresentation; and there is no just ground for rescinding it: That the Circuit court ought to have ascertained, by reference to a commissioner or otherwise, whether a good title had been or could be made by the appellant to the appellee, to one-sixteenth of the mines and minerals which may be on the tract of land referred to in the said contract; and ought to have dissolved the injunction, if such title had been, or could and should in a reasonable time be made; or to- have perpetuated it if otherwise: and that therefore the said decree is erroneous. Therefore the same is reversed with costs; and the cause is remanded to be further proceeded in according to the- foregoing opinion. But as the appellee had not received a good title when his bill was filed, and therefore rightfully came into a court of equity to enjoin the judgment, he should recover his costs in the Circuit court, in any event, and should pay no damages.in case the injunction should be dissolved.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
