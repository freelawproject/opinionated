That <em>Presley Thornton </em>at the same time, to give credit to the bill, and in consideration of the value thereof in current money <em>paid to the said Philip Thornton, </em>endorsed it for payment to the plaintiff, who afterwards endorsed it to <em>William Stewart. </em>That on the \u00e1aid 8th January, 1795, a notary presented the bill to <em>Charlotte Thornton </em>and demanded payment, the time limited for payment of the bill, since noted for non-acceptance, being expired ; and the said <em>Charlotte </em>having answered in behalf of herself and the said <em>Charles Thornton, </em>that they had paid \u00a3827. 5. of the bill and would not pay the balance, the said notary protested it; of all which the said <em>Philip </em>and <em>Presley </em>had notice on the-day of April, 1795, from the plaintiff, who had a right to demand the same, the said <em>Stewart </em>having returned to him the said bill. That it was agreed by the said <em>Philip </em>and <em>Presley, </em>that the sum in current money paid for the bill, to wit: \u00a3 1552, should be considered as if the same were expressed in the said bill as appears by a memorandum of the said agreement taken by <em>Bushrod Washington, </em>esq. profer\u00ed of which is .made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-11\"><em>JW Carty Fitzhugh </em>and <em>Robert Allas on, </em>securities for the appearance of the defendants, by attorney, prayed oyer of the bill and protest, and plead that the defendants did not owe the debt in the declaration mentioned : Upon which there was an issue made up. The jury found for the plaintiff the debt in the declaration mentioned and one penny damages, if the court should be of opinion that the bill of exchange and copy of the protest, both set out in <em>hmc verba </em>(the original appearing to have been lost), were <em>sufficient </em>to support the plaintiff\u2019s action, though no notice of protest was proved to have been given till the institution of this suit, it also being proved that the current money value \u00a3 1562, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>should be considered, and the bill have the same effect, as if the said sum had been expressed therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-4\">The copy of the bill referred to in the verdict was payable in London, and endorsed as follows : <em>\u201cPresley Thorn-ion,\u201d \u201c </em>pay to <em>Adam Stewart </em>or order, <em>Samuel Love.\u201d \u201c Adam Stewart.\u201d </em>Besides which, there was a receipt from <em>James Esdal Co. </em>for the <em>\u00a3 827. 5.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-5\">Instead of the original protest, under the seal of the protesting notary, the verdict refers to a copy certified by a notary of Liverpool to be a true copy of the London notary\u2019s protest, the original remaining in the office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-6\">The expenses (all of which are necessarily comprehended in the plaintiff\u2019s demand of <em>\u00a3 2. 12. 9. </em>for \u201c charges of protest\u201d) are stated at the foot of the copy, and are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-7\">Prot. for non-acceptance, <em>\u00a3 0 </em>16</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-8\">Prot. for non-payment, 0 16 0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-9\"><em>Postage, 2 </em>6</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-10\"><em>Commission, </em>1 7 2</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-11\"><em>Charges of notarial copy at Liverpool, </em>5 7</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-12\">\u00a32 12 9</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-13\">The memorandum of the agreement taken by <em>B.

That agreement was made two months after the bill was drawn, and it is merely that the 1st, 3d and 4th bills should be considered as if the current money had been expressed therein, as it was in the 2d of the same tenor and date; but nothing is said about the sum in current money.

The agreement to change the current money into sterling, is not established; ndr the charges of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>protest supported by proper testimony. The notarial copy of the protest is not evidence, although the original was lost; for the deposition of the notary ought to have been taken. The plaintiff was not entitled to bail; and as it was an action of debt, the judge had not authority to direct it. 2 <em>Wash. </em>181. Notice of the protest ought to have been given to the drawer and endorser both. The holder gave time to the debtor by receiving part of the money; and, therefore, the drawer and endorser are discharged. <em>Lovelass\u2019s </em>Bills, 59, 77.

The agreement to change the current money into sterling, was not objected to at the trial, nor proof of the charges of protest called for; and, therefore, neither will be permitted now. The verdict is certain enough, as it reserves points of law, and not evidence, for the judgment of the court. If <em>Thornton </em>be discharged, the judgment ought to be affirmed against the drawer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b24-10\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b24-11\">Tucker, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Au\">The declaration charges, that <em>Philip Fitzhugh </em>drew a bill of exchange in favour of <em>Samuel Love, </em>or order, on certain persons in Great Britain. That after-wards, on the same day, <em>Presley Thornton, </em>at the special instance \u00a1and request of the said <em>Philip, </em>and in order to give a credit to the said bill of exchange, and to induce <em>Love </em>to receive it from <em>Fitzhugh, </em>and in consideration of <em>Love\u2019s </em>paying to <em>Fitzhugh </em>the value in current money, and actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>received by <em>Fitzhugh, </em>did, by his endorsement, made on the said bill, according to the custom of merchants, endorse the same for payment to the said <em>Samuel Love: </em>which was partly paid, and protested for the balance. Whereupon this suit is brought upon the act of assembly. Plea, <em>nil debei, </em>and issue. The bill of exceptions states a copy of the bill and protest made by a notary public in Liverpool, made, as he alledges, from the original hill and the protest thereof, made in London : By which it appears, <em>that there was no special undertaking on the part of Thornton, to warrant the payment; but a mere endorsement of his name, prior to that of Samuel Love, in whose favour the bill was drawn. </em>Tho jury found a verdict for tho plaintiff, if the court should be of opinion that the bill of exchange and the copy of the protest, (the original appearing to have been lost,) are sufficient to support the plaintiff\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-3\">The question referred to tho court by the jury, so nearly resembles that which must have occurred to the court itself upon the declaration, that it may be regarded as, in substance the same. Which, is this, Whether <em>Presley Thornton </em>is an endorser of thebill in the sense and meaning of the custom and usage of merchants, or not ?</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">A bill of exchange may be defined an open letter of request, addressed by one person to a second, desiring him to pay a sum of money to a third, or to his order; or it may be made payable to hearer. Tho person who makes the bill, is called the drawer: lie to whom it is addressed, tho drawee; and if he undertakes to pay it, he is then called the acceptor: The person to whom it is ordered to be paid, is called the payee; and, if he appoints another to receive the money, that other is called the endorsee, as the payee is, in respect to hitn, the endorser. <em>Kyd's Bills ,Ew. </em>3, 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">Endorsement is a term known in law, which by the custom of merchants, transfers the property of the bill to the endorsee. <em>Cunningh. Bills, </em>57. 3 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>609. 4 Bac, <em>Ab. </em>703.</p>\n<p id=\"AYK\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Bills payable to bearer are transferred by delivery. But to transfer those payable to order, as this bill is, it is necessary, in addition to delivery, that there should be something by which the payee may appear to express his order. This additional circumstance is an endorsement. <em>Kyd, </em>88.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">Every transfer implies a property in the person transferring, or an authority to make it, given by him in whom the property is vested. In this case, it is not pretended that <em>Thornton </em>ever had any property in the bill; nor was he the agent of any person having a property in the bill. He, therefore, was not an endorser according to the custom of merchants.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">At the time he wrote his name on the bill, it was incapable of being transferred, but by the previous endorsement of <em>Love </em>the payee. <em>Thornton </em>was neither drawee nor payee, nor assignee nor endorsee, at that time. His endorsement, therefore, was a mere nullity, according to the custom of merchants. Upon every other ground, it was a <em>nudum pactum. </em>He received no consideration for warranting the payment of the bill, nor is any legal consideration charged. He was, therefore, not liable for the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">The action is joint. The plea is joint. The judgment is joint. It cannot be severed in this action. <em>Thornton, </em>then, not being liable, the judgment is erroneous, and must, I conceive, be wholly reversed. No opinion is, therefore, necessary as to the validity of the evidence. I shall only say, an attested copy by a notary public in New York or Norfolk, would have been just as good evidence, as this copy by a notary in Liverpool, whose attestation, as it re spects a bill of exchange on LondoD, and protested there, is perfectly extra official; and, consequently, no evidence. If the original were lost, why was not an attested copy produced from the office of the notary in London, who made the protest?</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">Fleming, Judge, concurred that the judgment ought to be reversed; for the case was not like that of <em>Call </em>v. <em>Scott, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>4 Call, 402; because, there, the consideration for the endorsement expressly appeared in the proceedings; and, consequently, the endorsers were clearly liable.</p>\n<author id=\"b27-4\">Carrington, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AVH\"><em>Thornton </em>was neither payee, nor had any interest in the bill; and, therefore, he was not an endorser within the meaning of the act of assembly, allowing an action of debt against the endorser: nor was he liable upon the bill in any action, as there was no consideration for the endorsement proved, .in which respect, it differs from the case of <em>Call </em>v. <em>Scott: </em>for, in that case, the consideration for the endorsement appeared in the proceedings; and, therefore, the whole court thought the endorsers liable. Neither Mr. <em>Washington's </em>memorandum of the agreement to change the current money into sterling, nor the notarial copy of the protest ought to have been allowed to go to the jury in this case: and, upon the whole, 1 think that the judgment is erroneous; and that it ought to be reversed.</p>\n<author id=\"b27-5\">Lyons, President.</author>\n<p id=\"Af\">The declaration contains no ground for an action of debt upon the act of assembly against <em>Thornton ; </em>for if he had been liable at all, an action upon the case would have been the proper remedy. But he was not liable; for it is not proved that there was any consideration for his endorsement; and, therefore, it is not like the case of <em>Call </em>v. <em>Scott: </em>for, in that case, the consideration appeared in the proceedings. The notarial copy of the copy ought not to have been allowed to go to the jury in the present case; for there is nothing to shew, that a more authentic copy might not have been procured. I concur that the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
