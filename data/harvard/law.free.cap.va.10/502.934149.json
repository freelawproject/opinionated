It states that the plaintiffs came by their attorney, \u201cand the defendants having heretofore acknowledged legal notice of this motion, and now failing to appear, therefore it is considered by the court that the plaintiffs recover against the said defendants the sum of 378 dollars and 58 cents, with six per centum per annum interest on 20 dollars and 1 cent part thereof from the first day of April 1816, on 57 cents other part thereof from the first\u2019 day of April 1817, on 71 dollars and 60 cents another part thereof from the first day of April 1820, on 71 dollars and 60 cents another part thereof from the first day of April 1821, on 71 dollars and 60 cents another part thereof from the first day of April 1822, and on 71 dollars and 60 cents another part thereof from the first day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>of October 1822, until paid, also seven and a half per cent, damages upon the said principal and interest according to law, and also their costs by them about their motion in this behalf expended.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-6\">The declarations referred to in the notice, and numbered 1044, 778 and 1946, were filed by the plaintiffs. No. 778 was a declaration by <em>William, Skipwith, </em>made the 14th of January 1806. No. 1044 was a declaration by <em>Henry Skipwith, </em>made the 12th of June 1806. And No. 1946 was a revaluation of the buildings declared for assurance by declarations Nos. 778 and 1044, and a new declaration for assurance of the same buildings by <em>James B. Woodson </em>and <em>John Trent, </em>acting under the firm of <em>James B. Woodson f Co. </em>This revaluation and new declaration of assurance were made the 3d of March 1816.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-7\">A <em>supersedeas </em>was awarded to the judgment, on the petition of <em>Skipwith </em>and, <em>Trent, </em>assigning the following errors:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-8\">1. The motion is stated to have been continued from term to term for several terms, without its appearing that the petitioners consented to such continuances, or were called, or otherwise notified thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-9\">2. In October 1827, the motion is stated to have been continued until the ensuing term; and the next proceedings that appear were at the May term 1829. This chasm in the proceedings created a discontinuance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-10\">3. At the May term 1829, judgment was rendered against the petitioners, without its appearing that they were called, or were present in court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-11\">4. The judgment being by default, the record should shew sufficient grounds to warrant the recovery. If the declarations are not to be regarded as a part of the <em>record, then there is no </em>foundation for the judgment. If on the other hand, being referred to in the notice, they make a part of the case and a proper part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>record, then the judgment cannot be sustained : 1. because the declaration No. 778, executed by <em>William Skipwith, </em>cannot make him responsible for quotas falling due upon the property after it was declared for insurance by <em>Woodson </em>and <em>Trent </em>in March 1816, yet judgment is given against him for quotas and interest subsequent to that time : <em>2. </em>because <em>Trent, </em>who declared for insurance with <em>Woodson </em>in 1816, was not liable separately, or in conjunction with <em>Skipwith, </em>but only in conjunction with his copartner; neither was <em>Skipwith </em>liable jointly with <em>Trent.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b529-5\"><em>Robertson </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b529-6\"><em>Macfarland </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b529-7\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"A5a\">I do not think that the objections made to the proceedings in this case in relation to the continuances have any validity. The party having appeared and acknowledged the notice, the case must have been regularly placed upon the docket, and then stood in court precisely upon the footing of other causes which are continued from term to term but not to any particular day, and which, under the general law of continuances, if not tried during the term, stand continued, without any order, until the next term. And after the defendant has once appeared, it is his duty to attend to his cause at every term until it has been decided or discontinued.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">On the merits, however, the case is, I think, clearly against the appellees. The defendants not having appeared at the trial, as the record ascertains, there should appear upon it sufficient to warrant the judgment. From the manner in which this record is made up, I take it that the notice was spread upon it, and is therefore part of it. This was not the case in <em>Ayres </em>v. <em>Lewellin, </em>3 Leigh 609. The notice here demands certain quotas, due \u201cas per declarations signed, sealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>&amp;c.\u201d These declarations being thus referred to, and' being filed by the plaintiffs, make part of their case, , and are, properly speaking, part of the record. In a summary motion on a forthcoming bond, the bond is considered a part of the record without being spread upon it by exception; for it is the foundation of the plaintiff\u2019s claim: and the bond certified by the clerk is taken to be that on which judgment was given. <em>Beale </em>v. <em>Wilson and </em>others, 4 Munf. 380. <em>Pari ratione </em>the declaration, in a case of the mutual assurance society, being the foundation of the demand, must be taken to be part of the case, even without an exception. If this be so, then is this judgment erroneous, since it makes the appellant <em>SJcipwith </em>responsible for quotas subsequent to the revaluation and insurance of the same property by <em>Woodson </em>and <em>Trent, </em>and moreover enters a joint judgment against parties not jointly bound, while it severs the joint contract of <em>Woodson </em>and <em>Trent, </em>by pursuing <em>Trent </em>without <em>Woodson. </em>The judgment must therefore be reversed, and judgment entered that the plaintiffs take nothing by their motion; without prejudice to any other motion which may be hereafter made by the society against the proper parties for any quotas in arrear.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b530-5\">Stanard, <em>J. </em>and Brooke, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A1_y\">gave no opinion on the question of discontinuance, but concurred with the president on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
