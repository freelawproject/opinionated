Besides, as this was a debt antecedently due from the whole, the revival of the remedy by one was lawful, and his <em>assumpsit </em>bound the rest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b68-13\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b68-14\">Lyons, President,</author>\n<p id=\"ATp\">delivered <em>the </em>resolution of the court, that the judgment of the district court was to be reversed, and that of the county court affirmed.

That the evidence was therefore properly admitted ; and consequently, that the judgment of the district court was erroneous, and that of the county court clearly right.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
