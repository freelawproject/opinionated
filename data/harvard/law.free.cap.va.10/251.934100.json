A conversation ensues as to the value of the slave, and $ 600. is fixed on as a fair price. Whereupon C. agrees that if A. will convey the slave to him, he will advance the money that is wanted, and if it is returned at Christmas with interest, he will release the slave, and if it is not returned by that time, he will make it $ 600. and keep the slave. A. being informed of this proposition, declares himself willing to comply with it, and observes that the slave is the one he preferred to sell, and that he thinks $ 600. a fair price. Afterwards A. and C. go together to a scrivener, and request him to write a conditional bill of sale for the slave, which he writes accordingly, and it is thereupon executed by A. It expresses on its face that A. in consideration of $ 393. 89 cents, which is paid to him, has bargained and sold the slave to C. with the following conditions, to wit: if A. shall pay to C. the sum of $ 393. 89 cents on or before the 25th of December following, with lawful interest from the date, then the conveyance is to be void; but if A. shall fail to return the said sum and interest on or before the 25th of December, he obliges himself, upon C.\u2019s paying him the sum of $ 206. 11 cents, (which makes up the $ 600.) to deliver to C. the slave, and make him a complete title. A. failing to make payment on or before the 25th of December, C. gets possession of the slave, and insists that the transaction is a conditional sale, which he can make absolute by paying the $206. 11 cents; whereas A. contends it is a mortgage, which he may redeem by paying the $ 393. 89 cents with interest. Held, the transaction is a conditional sale, and not a mortgage; <em>dissentientibus Tucker, </em>P. and <em>Brooke, </em>J.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b275-6\">A. failing in his bill to redeem, the question arises whether a court of equity has jurisdiction to make any decree as to the $ 206. 11 cents, which C. in his answer declared his willingness to pay.

That <em>Moss </em>agreed to lend the money on the following terms, <em>viz. </em>that for the loan of the money, the complainant should give him a conditional bill of sale for a negro woman named <em>Creasy, </em>and her two children named <em>Eliza </em>and <em>Lucy, </em>redeemable by the payment of the money, with interest, at Christmas fob lowing. That <em>Rhoda </em>was sold by the sheriff about ten days after <em>Sussex </em>court, in October 1819, and was cried out to <em>Moss </em>as the highest bidder, at about the price of 230 dollars, or perhaps 3 or 4 dollars more. That <em>Moss </em>agreed positively, before and at the sale, that the complainant should have the right of redemption on the terms aforesaid. That no money was then paid, but it was agreed to be paid by <em>Moss </em>at the next <em>Sussex </em>court, and the sheriff gave <em>Moss </em>a bill of sale for <em>Rhoda, </em>until the conditional bill of sale for <em>Creasy </em>&amp;c. should be drawn. That the said execution being for a considerable sum, and the complainant not having a sufficient sum to pay it off, he borrowed of <em>Moss </em>the farther sum of 23 dollars 56 cents <em>Virginia </em>money, and about 140 dollars 39 cents <em>North Carolina </em>bank notes at 7 dollars discount, and at the same time executed to <em>Moss </em>a conditional bill of sale for the said negro woman <em>Creasy </em>and her two children, expressing on the face of it, as the complainant believes, that he should have the right of redeeming them on the twenty-fifth day of De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>cember next. That the complainant was to retain possession of the slaves. That it was stipulated by <em>Moss, </em>that if the complainant did not pay the said borrowed money, with interest, on the 25th of December ensuing, then, if <em>Moss </em>should pay the complainant the sum of 206 dollars and 11 cents, the complainant should deliver up to him the said negro woman <em>Creasy </em>and her said two children. That on the 25th of December, the complainant had the money with interest ready to pay, but was very much indisposed, and did not carry and offer it to <em>Moss, </em>nor did <em>Moss </em>offer him, then or since, the said sum of 206 dollars and 11 cents, or any part of it (if that could have availed him). That on the said 25th of December, however, the said woman with her two children ran away from the complainant to <em>Moss, </em>and he has detained them ever since. That on the 27th of December, that is, two days after the time for redemption, <em>Moss </em>came to the complainant, near his dwelling-house, and complainant stated to him his indisposition on the 25th, but that he had then, and still, the borrowed money ready to pay to him, as he wished to redeem the woman and her two children. That <em>Moss </em>then told the complainant, explicitly, that he would not permit him to redeem them ; that they had been, since the 25th of December, at his house, and he would keep them ; that he had got the advantage of complainant, and would keep it. But <em>Moss </em>made no tender or offer to pay him the said sum of 206 dollars and 11 cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-6\"><em>Moss </em>is made defendant to both the original and the supplemental bill: and the prayer is, that complainant be permitted to redeem <em>Creasy </em>and her two children, on paying up the sum borrowed, with interest; that <em>Moss </em>may be compelled to pay a reasonable hire for <em>Creasy </em>from the 25th of December 1819, till he shall deliver her up to the complainant; that he be also decreed to deliver up the bill of sale for <em>Bhoda; </em>and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number><em>Moss </em>answered, saying, that the allegations in the bill as to <em>Green\u2019s </em>borrowing money from him are untrue: that <em>Green </em>applied to him for a loan of money, through one of his neighbours, but he declined the application: that afterwards a negro belonging to <em>Green, </em>to wit, <em>Rhoda, </em>being exposed to public sale, defendant purchased her at the sale, being the highest bidder, and took a bill of sale for her from the sheriff who sold her, which bill of sale defendant has in possession: that <em>Green, </em>through a certain <em>William Parham, </em>solicited defendant for a sum of money on loan, which the defendant refused, and told <em>Parham, </em>if <em>Green </em>would sell defendant a negro woman he had in possession, to wit, <em>Creasy, </em>and her two children, he would give up to <em>Green </em>all title he had to <em>Rhoda, </em>and pay <em>Green </em>the balance in cash, or on such terms as might be agreed on: and that <em>Green </em>acceded to the offer, and executed to defendant a bill of sale for the said negro woman and children ; which bill of sale defendant files with his answer, and prays to be made a part thereof.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> As to any conversations of defendant with <em>Green </em>respecting a loan of money to him, or any promise to permit him to redeem the said negroes, he says he never negotiated with <em>Green </em>in any way, except in the way alleged in this answer. He relies on the sealed instrument filed by him, as disclosing the whole transaction respecting the said sale of negroes. He paid to <em>Green </em>the sum of 393 dollars 89 cents, as is expressed in the said bill of sale, in part for the said negroes, and <em>Green </em>never did offer to pay defendant the said sum, either before the 25th of December next ensuing the execution of the said <em>bill </em>of sale, or on, that day, or since that day, but defendant did tender to <em>Green </em>the sum of 206 dollars 11 cents, the balance he was to pay, making in all the sum of 600 dollars, which was adjudged by all who saw the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>negroes to be tbeir full value, and was in reality their adequate value. He is now ready, and ever has been ready since the execution of the bill of sale, to comply on Part with the condition. He did consider and now considers the instrument in his possession, conveying the said slaves to him, as a conditional sale, to be defeasanced by complying with its terms. <em>Green </em>failed on his part. And defendant came peaceably into the possession of the slaves, and insists that he ought not to be disturbed in that possession. All the allegations in the original and supplemental bills, contrary to this answer, are denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-4\"><em>William Parham </em>deposed, that in October 1819, <em>Green </em>came to him, and informed him that he had some property in the hands of the sheriff, which was to be sold in a few days, and he was very anxious to release it, and that he had a part of the money and wished to borrow <em>the balance; </em>and enquired of deponent if he knew of any person who had the money, that would lend it for a short time; and farther said he would pledge a negro for the payment by Christmas following. Deponent informed <em>Green, </em>he had heard that <em>Moss </em>had some money by him ; and <em>Green </em>requested him, if he should see <em>Moss, </em>to endeavour to get the money for him, and he would give a bill of sale for a negro woman, to secure the payment, with interest, by the Christmas following, and if the money was not paid by that time, he should have the negro. Deponent saw <em>Moss </em>the next day, and mentioned the subject to him. He at first refused to have any thing to do with <em>Green </em>in any way <em>whatever; but </em>after some conversation with deponent on the subject, he agreed to advance the money, upon condition that <em>Green </em>would let him have, at a fair value, a negro woman named <em>Creasy </em>and her two children (which woman a negro man of his had for a wife). <em>Moss </em>then described .the negroes to deponent, and asked him what he thought they were worth; and deponent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>answered, that from the description given, he thought six hundred dollars would be a fair price for them. <em>Moss </em>then agreed that if <em>Green </em>would convey to him the said negro woman <em>Creasy </em>and her two children, with her future increase (she being pregnant at the time), he would advance the money wanted, and if the sum advanced was returned by the Christmas following, with interest, he would release the said negroes, and if the money was not returned by that time, he would make the sum so advanced 600 dollars, and keep the negroes. A day or two afterwards, <em>Green </em>applied to deponent to know if he had made an arrangement for him to get the money. Deponent informed him of the proposition of <em>Moss, </em>and he said he was willing to comply with it, and observed that the negro woman was the one he preferred to sell, and that he thought 600 dollars a fair price for her and children. Deponent then advised him to go to <em>Moss, </em>and request him to meet at deponent\u2019s house the next morning, take a conveyance for the negroes, and pay the money. <em>Green </em>came to deponent\u2019s house the next morning, and waited some time, and <em>Moss </em>did not come ; and at <em>Green\u2019s </em>request, deponent wrote a letter by him to <em>Moss </em>on the subject, in the following words : <em>\u201c </em>Sir, I have seen mr. <em>Green, </em>and he is willing to convey to you his negro woman <em>Creasy </em>and her two children, for the loan of the money that he now wants, and if he fails to return it to you with interest by Christmas, he will then deliver you the negroes upon your making the sum loaned him 600 dollars.

The negroes are at my house, and there I mean to keep them.\u201d <em>Green </em>enquired how they came there, for he knew nothing about their going. <em>Moss </em>replied, \u201c Well, they are there, and I have come to pay the money for them.\u201d <em>Green </em>said, \u201c I don\u2019t wish you to pay me any money, for I would rather pay you than that you should have the negroes.

I have the money in my pocket, and if you will go with me to mrs. <em>Green\u2019s, </em>I will pay you every cent. I have your bond, but I will not offer you that. I have got the <em>Virginia </em>money and specie.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-5\">There were two other depositions, one as to the fact of <em>Moss\u2019s </em>boarding with <em>Green </em>some years before, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>the other mentioning a settlement between them subsequent to the boarding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-5\">On the 9th of February 1826, the chancellor decreed that if the plaintiff should, within six months, pay to the defendant the sum of 393 dollars 89 cents, with interest thereon from the second of November 1819, the defendant should deliver to the plaintiff the slaves <em>Creasy </em>and <em>Eliza </em>and <em>Lucy, </em>and their increase, and should also deliver to the plaintiff, to be cancelled, the bill of sale of the second of November 1819. And the court further ordered that the defendant render an account of the hires of the said slaves during his possession of them, before one of its commissioners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-6\">Commissioner <em>Ritchie </em>was of opinion that <em>Moss </em>was entitled to compensation for keeping the n\u00e9groes from the year 1820 to the 9th of August 1826, the time of the plaintiff\u2019s default to satisfy the claim <em>; </em>after which period, the elder children becoming valuable, he thought the plaintiff should receive hire. The result according to his report was, that instead of any hires being due to the plaintiff, there was a balance due from him, for support of the negroes, of 95 dollars 9 cents, with interest on 75 dollars, part thereof, from the first of January 1830. To this report <em>Green </em>excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-7\">In the mean time, <em>Moss </em>having refused to receive the money which the decree required <em>Green to </em>pay him, <em>Green, </em>on the 24th of August 1829, deposited in the office of the bank of <em>Virginia </em>at <em>Petersburg </em>a sufficient amount in specie, with his check on the office for the same, to be paid to any person legally authorized to receive it, after a final decree in the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-9\">On the 24th of March 1830, the cause came on to be heard on the report of the commissioner. On consideration whereof, the court, disapproving so much of the report as relates to hires, and being of opinion that a reasonable hire should be allowed for the woman <em>Creasy, </em>and that 20 dollars per annum would be this reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>able hire, amounting, for the time of the defendant\u2019s possession, to 208 dollars -33 cents, and that this hire should be deducted from the debt with the interest thereon to the date of the deposit, which would leave a balance due to the defendant of 417 dollars 42 cents, decreed, that after deducting the plaintiff\u2019s costs from the last mentioned sum, the defendant, on receiving a check for the balance out of the money deposited in the branch of the bank of <em>Virginia </em>at <em>Petersburg, </em>should deliver to the plaintiff the negro woman <em>Creasy </em>and her children, and also the bill of sale, to be cancelled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-4\">From this decree <em>Moss </em>appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A5N\"><em>Shands, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aix\">observed, that the nature of the contract was fully disclo\u00e1ed by the sealed instrument. <em>Green, </em>in order to redeem the slaves, was bound to pay a.certain sum on a certain day, and in case of default on his part, the right accrued to <em>Moss, </em>by advancing a sum of money, to be put in possession of the slaves and have his title perfected. The evidence of the witness who drew the contract shews most clearly that an absolute sale was intended and an adequate price fixed. A sale being intended, a court of equity ought not, under the circumstances, to permit <em>Green </em>to redeem. The agreement in this case is substantially like that in <em>Chapman\u2019s adm\u2019x </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>1 Call 280.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b284-6\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Acn\">said, that the question whether a transaction was a conditional sale or a mortgage, was always one of no little nicety. It is to be determined upon a view of all the circumstances of the transaction, without being confined to the written evidence of it. The cases which have been decided on the subject are <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Davenport, </em>1 Wash. 125. <em>Chapman\u2019s adm\u2019x </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>1 Call 280. <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Campbell &amp; Wheeler, </em>2 Call 421. <em>King </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>2 Munf. 40. <em>Roberts\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Cocke ex\u2019or &amp;c. </em>1 Rand. 121. <em>Leavell </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>2 Leigh 161. In this case the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>appellee relies on the facts, 1. that the money advanced by <em>Moss </em>was to be returned by <em>Green with interest; 2. </em>that the property was in the mean time to remain with the bargainor; and 3. that the delivery of the slaves at Christmas by <em>Green </em>to <em>Moss </em>was made dependant on a double condition, <em>viz. </em>that <em>Green </em>should not <em>then </em>refund the 393 dollars 89 cents with interest, and that <em>Moss </em>should <em>then </em>pay him the 206 dollars 11 cents. Now, if <em>Green </em>did not pay the former sum, neither did <em>Moss </em>pay him the latter. To make the conditional sale complete, the two conditions were to be con-temporarily complied with, namely, at Christmas. If <em>Green sold </em>on condition of his not paying 393 dollars 89 cents at Christmas, <em>Moss </em>purchased on condition that he should pay 206 dollars -11 cents at the same time. <em>Moss </em>did not pay the money. What passed on the 27th of December was not even a tender of it. This last circumstance distinguishes this case from all the others that have been before this court, and seems to indicate the necessity of holding that <em>Green </em>should be allowed to redeem. For the doctrines in <em>England, </em>see <em>Willett </em>v. <em>Winnell, </em>1 Vern. 488. and 2 Cruise\u2019s Dig. 93, 4.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b279-6\">It is tile instrument of the second of November 1819, inserted in the commencement of this report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b285-6\">Stanard, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A8F\">A careful examination of the record has resulted in the conviction that the transaction between these parties, which the appellee insists was, and the court below has adjudged to be, a loan secured by mortgage, was a conditional sale and purchase. This to me is made manifest by the terms of the bill of sale, coupled with the evidence of <em>Parham </em>and <em>Myriclc. </em>The real contract, as understood by both parties and the witnesses, was a sale of the slaves at a price fairly fixed to the satisfaction of both parties; the one intending to buy, and the other being willing to sell; the purchaser advancing a part of the purchase money ; the seller reserving the right to abrogate the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>tract of sale by returning the money so advanced, with interest, at or before a particular time; and if not so abrogated, the contract to be completely executed, by the purchaser paying the residue of the purchase money, and the seller surrendering the possession of the slaves. To give the relief sought by the appellee, would be to give the active assistance of a court of equity to a party seeking to absolve himself from a fair contract. This ought not to be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">My opinion therefore is, that the decree of the court of chancery is erroneous and ought to be reversed: and as the appellant avows his willingness to pay the balance of the purchase money; and as, from delay by reason of the pursuit of a supposed right of redemption, and the sanction of that claim by the court below, and the possession by the appellant of the slaves, there may be some difficulty in the recovery of it by a suit at law, which in strictness was the proper remedy,\u2014 therefore, to prevent the occasion of future litigation between the parties, I think it fit that a decree should be rendered in favour of the appellee for the balance \u2022of the purchase money and interest, but without costs.</p>\n<author id=\"b286-10\">Parker, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Akd\">The bill was filed in this case to redeem certain slaves alleged to have been conveyed to the defendant as a security for the repayment of a loan of 393 dollars 89 cents. The answer, which is responsive to the bill, denies that the deed for the slaves was intended merely as a security for money loaned. It avers that the respondent refused to advance his money on the terms proposed by <em>Green </em>of pledging a slave for the <em>repayment; </em>but that the proposition made and accepted was, that if <em>Green </em>would <em>sell </em>him a negro woman named <em>Creasy </em>(whose husband he owned) with her two children, for a price ascertained, he would advance the sum then required by Green, in part payment, and <em>Green </em>should be at liberty to return it on or before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>25th of the ensuing December, and avoid the contract; but if not, that he would pay the balance, and take the slaves in possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">The depositions of <em>Parham </em>and <em>Myriclc go </em>far to verify this statement. <em>Green </em>had applied to <em>Parham </em>to get from <em>Moss </em>the money he wanted, and said he would give a bill of sale for a negro woman, to secure the repayment with interest at the following Christmas, and that if the money was not paid at that time, <em>Moss </em>should have the negro. When <em>Parham </em>made this proposition known to <em>Moss, </em>he at first refused to have any thing to do with <em>Green, </em>but after some conversation said, if <em>Green </em>would let him have <em>Creasy </em>and her two children, he would advance the money he wanted, upon condition that he would <em>let him leave them at a fair value. </em>That value was then agreed on between <em>Parham </em>the agent of <em>Green, </em>and <em>Moss, </em>at six hundred dollars, and it was arranged that <em>Moss </em>should, if <em>Green </em>approved it, advance the sum then required by <em>Green, </em>and take a conveyance of the slaves, with a stipulation that if the sum so advanced was returned by Christmas with interest, <em>Mass </em>would release the slaves, but if the money was not then returned, he would make up the sum of 600 dollars and keep them. <em>Parham </em>informed <em>Green </em>of this proposition and valuation, who said he was willing to comply with it; that <em>Creasy </em>was the negro woman he preferred to <em>sell, </em>and that he thought 600 dollars a fair price for her and her children. After this, <em>Parham </em>took no further part in the transaction, except, as he says, to write a letter to <em>Moss, </em>(which it does not appear that he received,) informing him of <em>Green\u2019s </em>acceptance of his terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The bill of sale was written and attested by <em>Howell Myriclc. </em>He proves, that he was requested by <em>Moss </em>and <em>Green </em>to write <em>a conditional hill of sale </em>for <em>Creasy </em>and her two children; that <em>Moss </em>had previously bought, at a sheriff\u2019s sale made-by <em>Myriclc, </em>a negro woman belong<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>ing to <em>Green, </em>named <em>Rhoda; </em>and it was agreed, on the occasion referred to, that the price paid for <em>Rhoda </em>was to be a part of the <em>consideration </em>money for <em>Creasy </em>and her children, and that the balance of the consideration money in the conditional bill of sale mentioned should be paid, as it was in fact paid, to <em>MyricJc. </em>The bill of sale expresses the consideration <em>to </em>be 393 dollars 89 cents, and is in the common form of such instruments, but reserving liberty to <em>Green </em>to repay the said sum of 393 dollars 89 cents, with interest, on the 25th of the ensuing December, in which event the sale was to be void. If, however, <em>Green </em>neglected or refused to do so, then he bound himself, upon <em>Moss\u2019s </em>paying him the additional sum of 206 dollars 11 cents (to make up the price agreed on of 600 dollars) to deliver <em>Creasy </em>and her children to <em>Moss, </em>and to make him a complete title therefor. No time is fixed for this additional payment, but it must necessarily have been after the 25th of December, because, until that day expired, it could not be known whether <em>Green </em>would pay the 393 dollars 89 cents or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\"><em>Green </em>failed to pay or tender the money at the time stipulated, but on the 27th of December-, merely said to <em>Moss </em>he was ready to <em>settle </em>with him, if he would pay him for his board; which it seems had been due, if due at all, some eight or nine years before. <em>Moss </em>got possession of the slaves, and on the same 27th of December, offered to pay the additional 206 dollars 11 cents; which <em>Green </em>refused, and in 1821 brought this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">Upon this state of facts, the question propounded to the court is whether this transaction between <em>Green </em>and <em>Moss </em>was a mere mortgage, or a conditional sale ? If it was in its inception a mortgage, I agree that the court will not permit it to be converted into an absolute purchase, for the default in the payment of the mortgage money at the appointed time. The rule is, <em>once a mart</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number><em>gage always a mortgage, </em>to which the right of redemption is inseparably incident, and cannot be restrained by any clause or agreement whatever made at the time of the loan. <em>Willett </em>v. <em>Winnell, </em>1 Vern. 488. (which, by the very terms of the statement, was admitted to be a <em>borrowing </em>of money and <em>a mortgage to secure it.) </em>But if the intention of the parties is to do something more than provide a security for money loaned or advanced, and to make a conditional sale if a further sum is advanced or the first sum is not repaid, there is certainly no rule of law which authorizes a court to control that intention. Thus in the case of <em>Newcomb </em>v. <em>Bonham, </em>1 Vern. 8. 214. 232. where A. made an absolute conveyance for a sum of money paid, and by another deed of equal date the lands were made redeemable at any time during the life of the grantor, the final decision of the court of chancery, affirmed in the house of lords, was that the estate was absolute in the grantee after the death of the grantor; <em>there being proof </em>that such was the intent of the parties, and their understanding at the time. So in the case of <em>Chapman's adm\u2019x </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>1 Call 280. an instrument in the following words was held to be a conditional sale, irredeemable after the day fixed for the payment of the money loaned : \u201c I this day received of mr. <em>Jno. Turner </em>the sum of \u00bf\u00a330. and put a negro woman named <em>Hannah </em>in his hands as security, and if the said \u00bf\u00a330. is not paid at or before next July <em>Hanover </em>court, the said <em>Turner </em>is to have the said negro for the said \u00bf\u00a330.\u201d (Signed) <em>\u201cRichard </em>Chapman.\u201d The words \u201cand put a negro <em>Sec. </em>in his hands as security\u201d were considered to have effect by construing the sale as defeasible till July <em>Hanover </em>court, (during which time the negro would be only a security,) and after-wards absolute : whereas the other words of the agreement, \u201cand if the said \u00bf\u00a330. is not paid at <em>Sec. Turner </em>is to have the said negro for the said \u00bf\u00a330.\u201d would have no effect, (judge <em>Roane </em>said,) without de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>creeing the sale absolute after default in nonpayment. It was also said in that case, that no loan was contemplated between the parties, as <em>Turner </em>had refused to lend, wishing to invest his money in property. That case is stronger against the construction placed on it by the court than the one at bar, because the \u00bf\u00a330. was not proved to have been the value of the negro, agreed on between <em>Turner </em>and <em>Chapman, </em>or to have been a fair value; although, as judge <em>Roane </em>said, it did not fall short of the general estimate of the witnesses \u201c in any <em>excessive </em>degree.\u201d Here, it is proved that the 600 dollars was the full value of the slaves, and that <em>Oreen </em>was willing to sell them at that price, subject to his right to return the portion of the money paid, within a stipulated time. In the other circumstances, the cases are alike. The sale was defeasible until christmas, and until that period the slaves would be considered as a security; but if, after that, it is not deemed to be absolute, we shall have to reject the subsequent words of the agreement, and plainly violate the intention of the parties. In this case, too, <em>Moss </em>refused to lend money and take a bare security. His object was to buy the wife of a slave he owned, but to give time to <em>Oreen </em>to return the money advanced. That object was wrell known <em>to Oreen, </em>who consented to <em>sell </em>on the <em>terms </em>proposed. Thus the cases are similar in every circumstance relied on by the judges in <em>Chapman\u2019s adm\u2019x </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>to sustain their opinions that the transaction in that case was a conditional sale; and there are, in the case at bar, facts proved which tend to strengthen such a conclusion. Besides the fact, already alluded to, of the value of the slaves being arranged and settled with <em>an express reference to a sale, </em>the parties applied to <em>Myriclc </em>to write a conditional bill of sale, <em>eo nomine; </em>and it must be, intended that they understood the difference between such an instrument and a mere security for money .lent.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Another case in this court, confirmatory of this view of the case before us, is that of <em>Roberts's adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Cocke ex\u2019or &amp;c. </em>1 Rand. 121. It was a loan of money,\u2014a pledge for its repayment by a given day, with interest,\u2014 and a stipulation that if not repaid at the day, <em>Roberts </em>should have the negro. It appearing that the <em>\u00a3 </em>100. mentioned in the bill of sale was probably the <em>agreed price of the negro, </em>as evidenced by the subsequent acts of the parties, no redemption was permitted. To the same effect is the case of <em>Leavell </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>2 Leigh 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">In the case of <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Campbell &amp; Wheeler, 2 </em>Call 421. judge <em>Pendleton </em>observed that it was often a nice and difficult question to draw the line between mortgages and conditional sales. \u201c The great <em>desideratum,\u2019\u2019 </em>says he, \u201c which this court has made the ground of their decision, is whether the purpose of the parties was to treat of a purchase, the value of the commodity contemplated, and the price fixed; or whether the object was a loan of money, and a security or pledge for the repayment intended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Tried by these criteria, or by the authorities I have cited, I think the transaction between <em>Moss </em>and <em>Green </em>amounted to a conditional sale. The object of the security was not merely to compel repayment, but a sale and purchase was evidently intended, subject to the right of the vendor to defeat it.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">That the agreement was executory does not render it the less binding: nor does the fact that the possession was for a time retained by <em>Green, </em>(which, by the way, was the reason why interest was to be allowed if the money advanced was returned,) change the nature of the transaction; for when <em>Moss </em>asked or obtained possession of the slaves, he was bound to pay the additional sum ; while <em>Green </em>was not bound to return any part of the 393 dollars 89 cents if he did not choose to do so, and although the slaves had died subsequent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>the 25th December, he would still have been entitled to the additional sum, and the loss would have fallen on <em>Moss.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\">I am therefore of opinion to reverse the decree, and enter one for the balance only of the purchase money, with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Cabell, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b292-5\">Brooke, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AgsA\">After what has already been said of the details of this case, I shall say very little. It has been often said, that it is frequently very difficult to distinguish a conditional sale from a mortgage j and I add, that conditional sales ought not to be countenanced by a court of equity, as I think they are too frequently the vehicle of extortion. In the case before us, when the treaty for the loan of money was begun through <em>Parham, </em>the property of <em>Green </em>the borrower was under execution, and he might in some sense be said to be the slave of the lender. It is true, that before the loan was consummated, his property had been sold and <em>Moss </em>had become the purchaser; but it does not appear that he was then less embarrassed, and <em>Moss </em>was well apprized of his embarrassment, and appears <em>to </em>have had a great desire to possess the slaves in question, so much so that when he got possession of them against the consent of <em>Green, </em>he determined to keep them, instead of resorting to the proper tribunal for a decision on his contract. The first part of that contract was certainly nothing more than a mortgage; but to bar any right of redemption, the latter part of it, which by itself might be construed a conditional sale, was afterwards inserted\u2014no doubt with the consent of <em>Green; </em>but that is of no consequence in a court of equity, which will not permit that which is a mortgage to be made irredeemable, even with the consent of parties ; its maxim being <em>once a mortgage always a mort</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number><em>gage. </em>I shall not again cite all the cases that have been cited by the bar and bench. The first case in this court is <em>Chapman's adm'x </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>1 Call 280. and I shall compare it with the case before us. In that case, the slave was delivered to <em>Turner </em>the lender of the money, at the same time that the money was received, and the money was to be repaid without interest; circumstances characteristic of a sale, and not of a mortgage. In the case before us, the slaves were retained by <em>Green </em>as his property, and the money was to be repaid with interest; both of which are circumstances characteristic of a mortgage. I think these cases are totally unlike. The first was decided by this court to be a case of conditional sale; and able judges have been heard to say, that even that case ought to have been differently decided; such is the unwillingness of courts of equity to sustain forfeitures or to limit the right of redemption, when it sees that the first object of the victim was to borrow money, and not to sell property. If the latter was the object in this case, what good reason can be given for <em>Green's </em>retaining the property, and agreeing to pay interest on the money ? If the intention was to sell on condition, (a condition not likely to be performed, if we are to judge by the state of <em>Green's </em>affairs,) why was the slave not delivered, as is usual in the sale of a slave ? why was interest to be paid on the money borrowed P On these grounds, I think the decree of the superior court was correct in deciding that the contract was a mortgage, and not a conditional sale.</p>\n<author id=\"b293-5\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Akq\">I should be much concerned at a difference with part of my brethren on this occasion, if it were not that the line of discrimination between mortgages and conditional sales is confessedly indistinct, and that each case must in a great measure depend upon its own particular circumstances. In this case I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>am very clearly of opinion that the transaction between the parties was a mortgage, and not a conditional sale.</p>\n<p id=\"AfO\">In considering this question, I am of opinion that it ^ unnecessary to recur to the parol testimony for an explanation of the intention. Not that I deny the admissibility of parol testimony to shew that, by the act of the scrivener, that which was intended as a mortgage has been turned into a conditional sale, or that which was designed as a real though defeasible sale has been converted into a <em>mortgage, </em>against the true meaning of the contracting parties. But where there is no pretence that the agreement is not truly drawn, and where, on the contrary, the party insists on the agreement <em>as drawn, </em>and protests against any change of it by parol evidence, I do not admit that the party so insisting can be permitted to resort to such evidence, for the purpose of proving that the transaction was not what upon its face it purports to be. Such is the case here. The defendant in his answer says, that \u201c he relies on the sealed instrument as disclosing the whole transaction respecting the said sale of the negroes, and is still willing to be bound by it on his part.\u201d Although, therefore, in many cases parol evidence has been freely admitted to prove an absolute sale in form to be a mortgage in fact, and in some has been admitted for the much more questionable purpose of explaining away a mortgage into a conditional sale <em>(Chapman's adm'x </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>1 Call 280.) yet such evidence cannot be admissible here. The supposed purchaser does not pretend that the true character of the instrument has been perverted by the fraud, mistake or ignorance of the scrivener, but relies upon it as \u201c disclosing the whole transaction,\u201d and strongly indicates his protest against an attempt to affect its character by an appeal to loose conversations.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">How then is the case upon the face of the written document ? It announces that <em>Green, </em>for the consideration of 393 dollars 89 cents to him in hand 'paid by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number><em>Moss, </em>bargained and sold the slaves to <em>Moss, </em>to hold to him and his heirs forever, upon the condition that if <em>Green </em>repaid the money with interest at Christmas, the conveyance should be void. If the deed had stopped there, it is not perceived that there could be any doubt that it was a mortgage; a construction confirmed by the fact that the slaves were retained in the possession of the mortgagor, and that the money was to be repaid with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">The deed, however, proceeds with a further provision, that if <em>Green </em>fails to pay the 393 dollars 89 cents at christmas, he obliges himself, upon <em>Moss\u2019s </em>paying him the further sum of 206 dollars 11 cents, (to make the sum of 600 dollars, the consideration value of the said negroes,) to deliver the negroes to <em>Moss, </em>and make him a complete title for them. Does this clause convert what was before a mortgage into a conditional sale ? I think not. It is well settled that no restraints will be permitted on the equity of redemption, since, if permitted, they would be perpetually extorted from the necessities of the borrower. And hence a court of equity allows validity to no agreement, made <em>at the time </em>of the mortgage, that in case the money be not repaid, and a further sum be advanced, the conveyance shall be absolute. Thus in the case of <em>Willett </em>v. <em>Winnell, </em>1 Vern. 488. A. mortgaged lands for securing the payment of <em>\u00a3 </em>200. to B. with the usual provision to be void upon payment at the day; and it was agreed that if the .\u00a3200. was not duly paid, then B. was to pay A. a further sum of <em>\u00a3 </em>78. in full for the purchase of the premises. The transaction was held to be a mortgage, and the heir of A. was permitted to redeem upon repayment of the two sums of &lt;\u00a3200. and <em>\u00a3 </em>78. the last of which had been paid by the creditor to the administrator of A. This case seems to me to be full to the point, and it has never in any subsequent case been questioned, but on the contrary is referred to by the best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>elementary writers and abridgments, as establishing the principle that no agreement made at the date of the mortgage, for the purchase of the property on failure of payment, shall be held to operate an extinguishment of the equity of redemption. 5 Bac. Abr. 6. 1 Eq. Ca. Abr. 313. pi. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">It is objected indeed that here there is no covenant for repayment of the money, and lord <em>Hardwiclce </em>and other judges, it is said, have always considered the want of it as a circumstance of some weight. But all admit that it is not conclusive. This is very strikingly evinced in <em>Lawley </em>v. <em>Hooper, </em>3 Atk. 278. 280. where lord <em>Hardwiclce </em>himself says: \u201cIt is objected that this is not to be considered as a mortgage, because there is no covenant in the deed to repay the money; but that objection is not well founded, <em>for it is not </em>necessary.\u201d See also <em>Conway's ex'ors </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>7 Cranch 218. <em>Mellor </em>v. <em>Lees, </em>2 Atk. 494. <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>Grierson, </em>2 Ball &amp; Beatty 278. It seems indeed wonderful that a covenant should be considered so important; for without it the mortgagee has full remedy for his debt, even if the mortgaged subject were to be destroyed. For, as was justly said in <em>King </em>v. <em>King, 3 </em>P. Wms. 358. every mortgage, although there be no covenant nor bond to pay the money, implies a <em>loan, </em>and every loan <em>a debt; </em>as in the case of the mortgage of a ship at sea\u2014though she was taken, and thus lost to the parties, the executor of the mortgagor was decreed to pay the debt secured by the mortgage. So as to welsh mortgages, which never contain a covenant for repayment. <em>Howel </em>v. <em>Price, </em>1 P. Wms. 291. So in <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Norvell, </em>1 Wash. 14. there was no covenant for repayment. So in <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Campbell &amp; Wheeler, </em>2 Call 421. there was no such covenant. So in <em>King </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>2 Munf. 40. And so indeed must it be, of necessity, in every case of an absolute sale in form, though, as we well know, many of them have, upon evidence of the trust, been converted into mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>In opposition to this very equivocal fact of the want of a covenant for repayment, we have in this case some of the strongest indications of a mortgage. The first of these is, that the debt and <em>interest </em>upon it are both to be repaid; and as a stipulation for repayment <em>without interest </em>has been considered as evidence that money advanced is <em>purchase money, </em>and not a loan, (1 Call 280.) so the converse seems equally true, that the insisting upon interest is evidence of a <em>loan, </em>and not a purchase. Secondly, the slaves were left in the possession of <em>Green </em>the original owner; which, as judge <em>Pendleton </em>remarks in <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Norvell, </em>is contrary 'to the ordinary effect of a sale. On the other hand, it is with equal truth said by the chief justice, that such retention of possession is of the very nature of a mortgage. This fact, therefore, furnishes the \u2022 most unequivocal negation of the transaction having been a sale. Considered as a sale, indeed, it would have been void, (for want of delivery of possession,) as to creditors and purchasers. It would be held, as to them, fraudulent <em>per se; </em>but if it be a mortgage, it is valid and unassailable. Now, where one construction of a transaction makes it fraudulent, and another makes it legal, the court should surely incline towards the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">It may be remarked, however, that in no view of this transaction is it a sale. At most it is but a contract to sell upon certain events and on certain terms, at a future day; both parties having, I think, the <em>locus pcenitentice. </em>It is to my mind very clear that <em>Moss </em>at least was not bound <em>to </em>take the <em>slaves. </em>The obligation is on the part of Cree\u00bb alone. He signs the instrument; <em>Moss does </em>not. The words are his, not <em>Moss\u2019s. </em>They oblige him, if he does not repay the sum advanced, <em>to </em>convey the slaves to <em>Moss </em>upon his paying him 206 dollars 11 cents more. This would not have amounted to an obligation on the part of <em>Moss to take the </em>slaves, even though he had been party to the deed, and had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>sealed and executed it. For the words would leave an option with him to pay the additional sum or not, at his pleasure. 2 Bac. Abr. <em>Cov\u2019t. </em>A. p. 64. <em>Drummond\u2019s adm\u2019rs </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>2 Munf. 337. <em>Suffield </em>v. <em>Baskervill, 2 </em>Mod. 36. And certain it is that if the negroes had died, he would not have completed the purchase unless he was obliged. It would be more reasonable to consider this a mortgage, in which the parties would stand on equal terms, than to hold it a conditional sale, in which <em>Green </em>would be absolutely bound if <em>he </em>could not raise the money, and <em>Moss </em>would be bound or not, at his pleasure; for the rule is that both parties should be bound, or neither. If the instrument were not under seal, this would be undoubted. <em>Cooke </em>v. <em>Oxley, </em>3 Term Rep. 653. Whether it is equally true in the case of a sealed instrument, may perhaps be questionable; but if not, yet there is a gross inequality in the contract, considered as a sale, which should lead us to reject that interpretation of it: for if the slaves-had died, <em>Moss </em>would have insisted on the return of the money as a loan; as they lived, he insists upon the transaction as a purchase. <em>Green, </em>though looked upon as a vendor, is compelled to take the hazards of a mortgagor, without his rights. He is the insurer of the lives of the slaves, though they are the property of <em>Moss </em>if he does not pay the money in the short period of six or eight weeks. In such a construction of the contract I cannot concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">It is said, indeed, that <em>Moss </em>absolutely refused to lend his money, and would agree to nothing but a purchase. It is very clear that <em>Green\u2019s </em>object, at least, was <em>to borrow. He did not </em>wish to part with the slaves, as appears from the provision for redemption. And as to <em>Moss\u2019s </em>refusing a loan, it is but a common contrivance for extortion and the extinction of the equity of redemption. But in these cases, as in cases of usury, these covers for fraudulent designs are little respected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number><em>by </em>courts of equity. In <em>Lawley </em>v. <em>Hooper, </em>3 Atk. 278. the case was thus. <em>Lawley, </em>an indiscreet young man, having an annuity for life of \u00bf\u00a3200. per annum, and having no means of delivering himself from jail except by disposing of the whole or some part of it, <em>sold </em>to one <em>Lavenant, </em>by indenture, \u00bf\u00a3150. per annum for \u00bf\u00a31050. In the deed there was a proviso, that if <em>Lawley </em>at any time should desire to purchase back the part of the annuity assigned, and would give <em>Lavenant </em>six months notice, and at the expiration of the notice repay the \u00bf\u00a3 1050. then <em>Lavenant </em>would reassign. This was decided to be a mortgage; lord <em>Hardwicke </em>saying, \u201cI think there is strong foundation <em>to </em>consider this \u00e1 loan of money, and I really believe in my conscience that ninety-nine in a hundred of these bargains are nothing but loans, turned into this shape to avoid the statutes of usury\u201d\u2014or, I will add, to extinguish a power of redemption. So in this case, though <em>Moss </em>disavowed a willingness to lend, what was the transaction in effect but a loan, if <em>Green </em>had repaid the money, with interest (for which the deed provided) ? or if, the slaves having died, <em>Moss </em>had refused to pay the 206 dollars 11 cents, and sued for the money which he had advanced ?</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">With these views, and without adverting to the parol evidence, (as the appellant has avowed that the deed discloses the real character of the transaction, and does not seek to impeach it on the ground of fraud, ignorance or mistake,) 1 am very clearly of opinion that the decree is right upon the merits, and that the appellee was entitled to redeem. I have, however, examined the evidence very carefully, and am satisfied that it ought to make no difference in the result. The distinctions between conditional sales and mortgages are so nice, that I am but little inclined to look to the opinions or to the loose language of witnesses to decide the question. In the case before cited, lord <em>Hardwicke </em>observes, \u201c The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>proviso uses.the word <em>repurchase; </em>but there is very little difference in reality' between the meaning of the words <em>repurchase </em>and <em>redemption. </em>One of the witnesses uses the word <em>redemption, </em>and I take-the word <em>purchase, </em>used in all the other depositions, to be only a cant word, meaning a sale or a mortgage; and the indorsement shews they were used promiscuously.\u201d Where to common understandings the shades of difference between terms are so slight, it is hazarding too much to trust to the testimony of individuals not versed in such nice discriminations, instead of resting upon the written and unquestioned evidence of the contract of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">There are some other questions of detail, and perhaps some irregularities and errors in <em>the </em>manner in which the court has carried out its principles, which I shall not examine, as the direction to be given to the case by the opinions of my brethren will render it unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">Decree reversed with costs. And this court proceeding &amp;c. it is further decreed and ordered that the appellant do pay unto the appellee the sum of 2.06 dollars 11 cents, with interest at the rate of six per centum per annum from the 25th of December 1819 till payment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
