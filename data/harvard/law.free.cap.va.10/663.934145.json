Burwell, </em>late of <em>Richmond </em>county, by bis will dated in September 1811, after devising to his uncle <em>Bacon Burwell </em>part of his land and farm lying in the counties of <em>Frederick </em>and <em>Berkeley, </em>bequeathed to him one half of the personal estate on that farm (chargeable with \u00bf61000. to be paid to the testator\u2019s aunt <em>Rachel Emmerson </em>of <em>Tennessee </em>within two years after his decease) and to <em>John R. F. Corbin </em>all the remainder of his estate in those counties. The probat of the will being contested, <em>Corbin </em>was appointed, in November 1811, curator of the testator\u2019s estate in <em>Richmond, </em>and <em>Bacon </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number><em>Burwell </em>curator of his estate in <em>Frederick </em>and <em>Berkeley. </em>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 But in March 1812, after the probat, administration with the will annexed was granted to <em>Corbin, </em>and he took possession of the whole of the testator\u2019s personal estate. The will was the subject of controversy in the case of <em>Burwell v. Corbin, </em>1 Rand. 131-164. decided in April 1822, in which it was held, that it was not well proved as a will of <em>real </em>estate, leaving it as to the <em>personal </em>in full force.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b688-6\">In June 1823, <em>Thomas Emmerson, </em>husband of the legatee <em>Rachel Emmerson, </em>brought a suit in the superior court of chancery of <em>Richmond </em>to recover, not his wife\u2019s legacy of \u00bf\u00a31000. but whatever should be found due <em>to Bacon Burwell </em>on account of the legacy bequeathed to him by the testator\u2019s will as above stated, which the plaintiff claimed as the assignee of that legatee. The bill alleged, that <em>Corbin, </em>the administrator, had not <em>accounted For and </em>paid <em>to Bacon Burwell </em>all that was due to him as legatee, had not returned a full and true inventory of the estate, had converted to his own use the profits of a large number of slaves which were part of the legacy bequeathed to <em>Bacon Burwell, </em>and had become wholly insolvent; and that <em>Bacon Burwell </em>had made an assignment to the plaintiff, of all his interest <em>in the </em>testator\u2019s <em>estate, </em>particularly his claim for the profits of the slaves bequeathed to him, and had given the plaintiff an irrevocable power of attorney to sue for, collect and appropriate to his own use, whatever upon a full and fair settlement of the accounts should be found due from <em>Corbin, </em>the administrator, to <em>Bacon Burwell, </em>on account of his legacy, as (the bill said) would appear by the power of attorney now filed in the office of the court, which would be produced when necessary. The bill made <em>Bacon Burwell, Corbin, </em>the administrator with the will annexed, <em>Tebbs </em>and <em>Settle, </em>surviving sureties of <em>Corbin </em>in his administration bond, and <em>Beale </em>and <em>Christopher </em>administrators of <em>Turbeville </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>a deceased surely, parties defendant. And it prayed an account of <em>Corbin's </em>administration, and especially an account of the profits of the slaves belonging to <em>Bacon Burwell's </em>legacy, and a decree against <em>Corbin </em>\u00e1nd his sureties, for whatever should be found due from <em>Corbin </em>to tbe legatee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b689-5\">But though <em>Bacon Burwell </em>was made a party defendant, it did not appear that any process was served upon him, or that he ever appeared as a party in the cause : but he died pending the suit, and his administrator appeared as a party before the commissioner to whom the accounts were referred, and he afterwards consented in court to the recommitment of the report. And <em>Bacon Burwell's </em>assignment to the plaintiff of his claim against <em>Corbin, </em>and irrevocable power of attorney to the plaintiff to sue for and collect the money due from <em>Corbin </em>and to appropriate it to his own use, though the bill referred to the instrument as filed in the office of the court, ready to be produced when necessary, did not appear by the record to have been in fact exhibited, nor was there any proof thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b689-7\"><em>Corbin </em>answered, that he had made and returned full and true inventories of his testator\u2019s estate, which he exhibited: that in November 1818, a division was made by commissioners under a decree of the county court of <em>Frederick, </em>of all the slaves on the testator\u2019s farm in <em>Frederick </em>and <em>Berkeley, </em>between <em>Bacon Burwell </em>and himself to whom the same were bequeathed, and he and <em>Burwell, </em>at the same time, divided between themselves all the other personal property on that farm; for proof of which he exhibited the report of the commissioners, whereby it appeared that about seventy slaves were allotted to <em>Burwell: </em>and, in regard to the profits, that many of the slaves having been in fact chargeable, and the defendant having, on his part, waived all charge for his commission and compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>tion for his trouble, Bur-well, on his part, had waived the account of the profits which his assignee now asserted. The defendants <em>Tebbs </em>and <em>Settle, </em>and <em>Beale </em>one of the administrators of <em>Turbeville, </em>put in their answers, in which, referring to <em>Corbin\u2019s </em>answer, they controverted the right of <em>Bacon Bur-well, </em>and consequently of the plaintiff, to call for an account of profits, or any other account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b690-4\">But neither in the answer of <em>Corbin, </em>nor in that of <em>Tebbs </em>and <em>Settle, </em>was the fact alleged in the bill, of <em>Bacon Bur-well\u2019s </em>assignment of his claim to the plaintiff, in any way denied, nor did those defendants call for proof of the assignment. And the answ'er of <em>Beale </em>did not deny the fact of the alleged assignment, or call for proof of it in any other way than by <em>disclaiming, </em>in general terms, <em>all knowledge of the claims alleged in the bill.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b690-5\"><em>Christopher, </em>the other administrator of <em>Turbe-ville, </em>did not answer, nor w'as there any process in the record whereby the cause was matured for hearing against him on his default. Yet the record shewed, that he in fact appeared by counsel, and joined in the defence: for he, with <em>Tebbs </em>and <em>Settle, </em>and his coadministrator <em>Beale, </em>filed exceptions to the first account of profits reported by the commissioner; and that account was recommitted, by consent of all the parties, including <em>Christopher; </em>and then, the counsel of all the parties, including <em>Christopher, </em>attended the taking of the account <em>before the </em>commissioner, which was finally reported, and was the foundation of the decree of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b690-6\">The defendant <em>Corbin </em>died pending the suit, and it was revived against his administrator. And the report of the commissioner to whom the accounts were referred, shewing a balance of 12977 dollars, with interest on 8291 dollars, part thereof, from the 1st September 1826, due from <em>Corbin </em>the administrator to the lega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>lee <em>Burwell, </em>on account of the profits of the slaves from the year 1812 to 1818, during which time they were in <em>Corbin's </em>hands; and there being no exceptions to this report; the court, upon the final hearing, decreed that the defendants should pay the plaintiff, as assignee of <em>Bacon Burwell, </em>the above mentioned balance with interest &amp;c. From which decree the defendants <em>Beale </em>and <em>Christopher, </em>by petition to a judge of this court, prayed an appeal; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b691-4\">The cause was argued here by <em>G. Johnson </em>and <em>G. N. Johnson </em>for the appellants, and <em>Leigh </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b691-6\">The main question, on the merits, was a question of fact depending on the'evidence: Whether, at the time of the division between <em>Corbin </em>and <em>Bacon Burwell </em>in November 1818, <em>Burwell </em>waived and abandoned his claim to have an account of profits from <em>Corbin, </em>as <em>Corbin </em>alleged in his answer, and for the reasons and considerations therein stated ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b691-7\">Supposing that <em>Burwell </em>did not abandon his claim to profits, there were many other questions of fact and of law, arising on the accounts, and the proceedings in the cause, which were argued at the bar; but of these questions it is necessary to mention only one, since the court decided no other\u2014The counsel for the appellants objected, that there was no proof of the assignment by <em>Bacon Burwell </em>to the plaintiff of this claim of <em>Burwell </em>against <em>Corbin; </em>and that as the assignment was the whole foundation of the plaintiff\u2019s claim to relief, proof of it was indispensable, even if <em>Burwell </em>had been regularly brought before the court; but though he was a necessary party, and though he was made a party by the bill, he never appeared, and no process was taken out against him. They cited <em>Ray </em>v. <em>Fenwick, </em>3 Bro. C. C. 25. <em>Cathcart </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>1 Ves. jun. 463. <em>Purcell </em>v. <em>Maddox, </em>3 Munf. 79. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Long, </em>4 Rand. 451. <em>Tennent's heirs </em>v. <em>Pattons, </em>6 Leigh 196. 207.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEiL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number><em>Leigh </em>said, that none of the process had been inserted in the record, and for aught that appeared to the contrary, there might have been a <em>decree nisi </em>served on the defendant <em>Burwell; </em>but however that was, his administrator, after his death, was made a parly, and he appeared. The fact of <em>Burwell\u2019s </em>assignment of his claim to the plaintiff, was one in which none of the defendants but <em>Burwell, </em>and after his death his administrator, had any <em>interest; </em>and <em>Burwell\u2019's </em>administrator made no complaint, and had not appealed from the decree. The decree would be a complete protection to the defendants whom it charged with the debt, against a claim for the same debt by the representative of the assignor; which was all those defendants could desire. The alleged assignment was not denied by any of the answers; nor was proof of it called for in any of them, unless the general disclaimer in <em>Beale\u2019s </em>answer, of all knowledge of the claims alleged in the bill, could be supposed to call for proof of the assignment; but that was only a disclaimer of knowledge on the subject of <em>Burwell\u2019s </em>claims, not of his assignment of those claims to the plaintiff. It was obvious the court below proceeded on the supposition, that the assignment under which the plaintiff claimed, was unquestionable as it was unquestioned <em>; </em>and the omission to exhibit the instrument of assignment was the result of inadvertence, or, more probably, of the circumstance, apparent on the record, that the assignment was not a point of dispute between the parties. Therefore, if the court should reverse the decree for want of proof of the assignment, he submitted, that it ought to settle the other points in the cause, and then remand it in order that the plaintiff might have an opportunity of supplying the proof.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b692-4\">Scott, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayq9\">delivered the opinion of the court\u2014That in every case of a bill in equity asking relief for the plaintiff as assignee of the rights of another, the as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>signor must be made a party to the cause, and the assignment ought to be shewn and proved, though the fact be not denied, nor proof of it called for, in the answers. The production and proof of the assignment ean only be dispensed with by an admission of the fact by both the assignor and the parties against whom the relief is asked. Much more were the production and proof of the alleged assignment indispensable in this case, in which the assignor and his administrator, if the cause was regularly matured for hearing as to either of them at all, were in default; so that it cannot be pretended, that they or either of them admitted the assignment. This objection is fatal to the decree, upon the record as it now stands. But if this were the only error in the decree, the court, reversing it for this error, might remand the cause to the court of chancery, where the plaintiff might have an opportunity of producing and proving the assignment. The court has, therefore, examined the case upon the merits. And upon a view of all the circumstances of the case proved by the evidence, we are of opinion, that <em>Bacon Burwell, </em>at the time of the division between him and <em>Corbin </em>as legatees in 1818, waived, and intended to waive and abandon, all further claim against <em>Corbin </em>as administrator of his testator, on account of the legacy bequeathed to him, and especially all claim for an account of the profits of the slaves; and that, therefore, <em>Burwell, </em>if he had filed this bill himself preferring the claim on his own behalf, would not have been entitled to relief. Of course, the plaintiff, his assignee, is entitled to none. Therefore, the decree is to be reversed with costs, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
