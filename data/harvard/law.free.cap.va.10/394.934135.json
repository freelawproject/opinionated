On the day of the judgment, <em>Mays </em>prayed an appeal to the court of appeals, and upon his entering into an appeal bond with <em>Patrick Beirne </em>as his surety, the appeal was allowed. The bond was with the usual condition, that if the appellant should pay the judgment, and all such costs and damages as should be awarded by the court of appeals in case the judgment should be affirmed, then the obligation was to be void. On the 3d of April 1835, it was considered by the court of appeals that the judgment be affirmed, and that the appellee recover against the appellant damages according to law for the retarding the execution thereof, and also his costs by him expended about his defence in the court of appeals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AVbZ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>A' copy of the decision of the court of appeals was received by the clerk,of the circuit superior court of law and chancery for the county of <em>Greenbrier </em>on the <em>22d </em>of May 1835, and on the 1st of June 1835 a writ of <em>fieri facias </em>was issued, commanding the sheriff that of the goods and chattels of <em>John Mays </em>he should cause to be made the sum of 148 dollars 6-3 cents, damages, with interest from the 7th of September <em>1825 </em>until the 8th of May 1S28, also 26 dollars 89 cents costs, and damages at the rate of ten per centum per annum on the aforesaid damages and costs, from the said 8th of May 1828 until the 22d of May 1835, and also 32 dollars 76 cents for the costs in the court of appeals, and 1 dollar 58 cents for costs in the circuit superior court. This execution being returned \u201c no property found,\u201d <em>Patrick Beirne </em>the surety in .the appeal bond, on the 3d of August 1835, paid 362 dollars 64 cents in satisfaction of the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-4\">In the mean time, to wit, between the date of the judgment in the superior court and the date of the affirmance thereof by the court of appeals, <em>Mays </em>and wife, by a deed bearing date the 26th of November 1834, and admitted to record in the office of <em>Greenbrier </em>county court on the 5th of January 1835, conveyed to <em>William M\u2019Clung </em>certain real estate, in trust for the purpose of securing to <em>Samuel M'Clung </em>1732 dollars 44 cents, with legal interest thereon from the 26th of November 1834.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-5\"><em>Mays </em>having, at the suit of one of his creditors, taken the oath of an insolvent debtor, Beirne, on the 22d of January 1836, filed his bill in the circuit court of <em>Green-brim- county, to be substituted to the </em>rights of <em>Callison </em>the judgment creditor, and enforce his lien on the real estate conveyed to <em>M\u2019Clung, </em>which the bill stated had been sold to <em>Thomas Matthews </em>and <em>Hugh Wilson.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-6\">The answer of <em>Matthews </em>and <em>Wilson </em>stated, that at the time of the deed to <em>M\u2019Clung, </em>under which they purchased, there was left in the hands of <em>Mays </em>more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>than sufficient real estate to satisfy the judgment; and they insisted that all the real estate so left in the bands of <em>Mays </em>ought to be exhausted before subjecting the property purchased by them. <em>Mays, </em>it was true, had, after the deed to <em>M\u2019Clung </em>under which they purchased, made other conveyances; to wit, a deed of trust of the 1st of December 1834, to <em>Patrick Beirne, </em>to secure a debt to <em>Andrew Beirne; </em>a deed of trust of the 22d of January 1835, to secure a debt to <em>James Withrow; </em>a deed of bargain and sale, of the 27lh of January 1835, to <em>William M\u2019Clung; </em>and a deed of bargain and sale, of the 17th of January 1835, to <em>William H. Syme. </em>But they insisted that the judgment debtor could not, by the act of selling or transferring his remaining lands, throw the burthen of that judgment back upon the first purchaser. The land in the hands of the last alienee, they said, should be first subjected, and if insufficient, then the land in the hands of the alienee next preceding the last, and so on until the judgment was satisfied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-4\">Thereupon the complainant <em>Patrick Beirne </em>obtained leave to amend his bill, and at June rules 1837, filed his amended bill, setting forth the deed of trust of the 1st of December 1834, to the complainant, to secure a sum of money to <em>Andrew Beirne; </em>the conveyance of the 17th of January 1835, to <em>Syme; </em>a deed of trust of the 22d of January 1835, to <em>Elisha Callison, </em>for the benefit of <em>James Withrow; </em>and the conveyance of the 27th of January 1835, to <em>William M\u2019Clung: </em>stating further, that one of the lots conveyed to <em>Syme </em>had been conveyed by <em>Syme </em>and wife to <em>John Dunlop: </em>and making <em>Mays, Andrew Beirne, Syme, Dunlop, Callison, Withrow </em>and <em>William M\u2019Clung </em>defendants, in order that the property conveyed by those several deeds, or so much thereof as might be necessary, might, according to the principles of equity, be directed to be sold in satisfaction of the money which the complainant had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>compelled to pay, with interest, and the costs of this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aqtq\">The defendant <em>William M\u2019Clung, </em>by his answer, insisted that the lien, if it existed at all, was only to the amount of the judgment of the court below, and that the liability of the vendees was in proportion to the value of the land purchased by them respectively from <em>Mays.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-8\">The answer of <em>Withrow </em>insisted that the utmost for which a lien could be claimed by force of the original judgment, was the amount of that judgment with interest and costs, excluding the costs and damages in the <em>court </em>of appeals. It admitted that all the lands held by <em>Mays </em>at the date of the original judgment, and those since acquired, were liable to satisfy it, and to that end the several vendees were bound to contribute <em>pro rata. </em>But the respondent added, that he was not satisfied that the complainant had a right to be substituted in the place of <em>Callison </em>the judgment creditor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-9\">The cause being heard the 18th of May 1838, the circuit court was of opinion, that the judgment bound the lands owned by <em>Mays </em>at the time of the rendition of the judgment against him, or acquired thereafter and before the judgment was satisfied, and that the complainant was entitled to be substituted to the lien of the judgment,* but that whatever might have been the rights of the judgment creditor at law, the complainant had no right to ask more than equity, and could not <em>throw </em>the burthen of payment from subsequent <em>to </em>prior alienees. The decree of the court was, that unless the defendants, or some of them, should pay the plaintiff, on or before the 20th of June following, the sum of 362 dollars 64 cents, with interest thereon from the 3d day of August 1835 till paid, and the costs of this suit, there should be a sale of the property conveyed by <em>Mays </em>to <em>William M\u2019 Clung, </em>and if the proceeds thereof should not be sufficient, then a sale of the other pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>perty, or so much thereof as might be necessary, in the following order, <em>viz. </em>first, the property conveyed by <em>Mays </em>to <em>Callison </em>for the benefit of <em>Withrow; </em>secondly, - the property conveyed by <em>Mays </em>to <em>Syme; </em>thirdly, the property conveyed by <em>Mays </em>in trust for the benefit of <em>Andrew Beirne; </em>and fourthly, the property conveyed by <em>Mays </em>in trust for the benefit of <em>Samuel M\u2019Ciung.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-4\">The equity of redemption of <em>Mays </em>in the property conveyed by the deed of trust to <em>Beirne, </em>had, with other property, been conveyed absolutely to <em>Syme </em>by the deed of the 17 th of January 1835. B ut the property embraced in the deed of the 22d of January 1835, from <em>Mays </em>to <em>Callison, </em>was merely conveyed to secure to <em>Withrow </em>a debt of 631 dollars 20 cents, with interest from the 28th of August 1834. So that, in this property, <em>Mays </em>had still an equity of redemption, at and after his conveyance of the 27th of January 1835 to <em>William M\u2019Ciung. </em>But the fact of there being such an equity of redemption, which ought to be subjected before the property conveyed to <em>William M\u2019Ciung, </em>does not appear to have been adverted to in the circuit court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-6\">The deed to <em>William M\u2019Ciung </em>purported to be in consideration of the sum of 200 dollars. None of the defendants asked for an enquiry to ascertain the annual rents and profits of the property conveyed by this deed, or of the property conveyed by any of the deeds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-7\">The terms of sale directed by the decree were, that the purchaser or purchasers should pay one third of the purchase money in hand, and execute bonds with good security for the residue, payable in six and twelve months; and the land sold was directed to be held liable for the payment of the purchase money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-8\">Upon the petition of <em>William M\u2019Ciung, </em>an appeal was allowed from the decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b423-9\">The cause was argued in this court by <em>Samuel Brice </em>for the appellant, and <em>William Smith </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AMT\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Alph\">I am of opinion that there is no error in the decree in substituting the appellee to all the rights and remedies of <em>Callison </em>under his original judgment. To the benefit of it he had the clearest right, upon the .ordinary and well established principles of the court j nor was it necessary to entitle him to it that he should have been a party to that judgment. It is enough that having paid off the amount of it to <em>Callison, </em>to whom he was bound by the appeal bond, he had a right to demand a cession of every remedy <em>Callison </em>had for the recovery of his demand from his debtor. Among these was the execution by <em>elegit, </em>which reached all the lands of which <em>Mays </em>was seized at the date of that judgment, or at any time afterwards. The decree was therefore right in giving him the benefit of it.</p>\n<p id=\"AhKR\">Nor do I think there was any error in charging upon the real estate bound by the original judgment, the damages and costs in the court of appeals. Had an execution by <em>elegit </em>been sued out, it must have included those damages and costs, and must have, directed the levy of them, as well as of the amount of the original judgment, by extent of the lands whereof the defendant was seized at its date. They are but emanations of that judgment, which opens to receive them, in like manner as the interest of the debt, and the fee for issuing an execution, though accruing subsequent to the judgment, are considered and taken to be part of it or appendages to it. In <em>England, </em>upon a writ of error in the exchequer chamber or in parliament, <em>to </em>a judgment in the king\u2019s bench, the damages are certified to that court, for the purpose of being included in the execution, which can only issue from it, as the record itself still remains there. Tidd\u2019s Practice 1244. Tidd\u2019s Prac. Forms 539. 14 Vin. Abr. 614. 2 Wms. Saund. 101. z. 2 Lilly\u2019s Entries 571. So here, the affirmance and the award of damages are certified to the court below, whose clerk is directed to. calculate the amount, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>and the execution issues including it accordingly. The damages and costs in the appellate court thus become appendages to the original judgment; for the judgment of affirmance is no new judgment. It is but a ratification of the original judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Passing over the objections to the shortness of the credit allowed and the supposed rigour of the terms of sale, which I think are without foundation, these being matters of sound discretion, and there being nothing in the record to shew it was exercised improperly, (see <em>Perine </em>v. Dunn, 4 Johns. Ch. Rep. 140. and the act of assembly, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 66. \u00a7 41. p. 20. which authorizes a sale for cash or upon credit,) I proceed to consider whether the appellant had a right to demand that the other vendees and incumbrancers should contribute ratably.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">In this case it is clear that had <em>Callison </em>the creditor issued his <em>elegit, </em>it must at law have comprehended the whole of the lands in the hands of all the defendants,. and a moiety of the whole, without distinction, would have been extended for the payment of his demand. The plaintiff, who seeks in equity to be subrogated to his rights, cannot fairly be shorn of any portion of the remedy by the necessity of coming into equity. He is therefore clearly entitled to charge the whole. But it is no invasion of his rights, to provide that the respective parties should be chargeable as equity would direct, provided he is neither delayed nor deprived of any portion of his security. Of this he does not complain ; and indeed, as I understand the decree, he is not delayed; for the whole of the lands are, I take it, to be advertised together, and then sold in immediate succession, until enough is raised to pay the debt. The question then is, whether, as between the defendants, either is entitled to preference, and what should be the order of liability if they are not to be charged <em>pro rata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AEi\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>In the case of <em>Conrad </em>v. <em>Harrison et al. </em>3 Leigh 532. <em>Sisson </em>mortgaged 360 acres of land to <em>Broclc. </em>He then mortgaged 235 acres of the same land to Harrison, retain mg <em>75 </em>acres: and he afterwards again mortgaged the whole, including the <em>75 </em>acres, to <em>Conrad. </em>In this state of the incumbrances, it was decided that as, after the mortgage to Harrison, he had a right to demand that the 75 acres reserved in the hands of <em>Sisson </em>should <em>be \u00f1rst charged by Brock's </em>mortgage, so, after the mortgage to Conrad, he had a right still to insist on subjecting the same 75 acres to the discharge of the prior mortgage as far as it would go, for bis indemnification. This decision rested upon the plain and equitable principle, that if there be a mortgage on two acres, and the mortgagor sells one of them, the vendee has a right to demand that the other lot retained by his vendor shall be first sold to satisfy the debt; and as this right at once attaches, it cannot be lost by a sale of the other lot to a third person, but he must sit in the seat of his vendor, and be first liable. This principle had been repeatedly acted upon by chancellor <em>Kent, </em>and is also recognized and approved by the whole court in <em>Nailer </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>10 Serg. &amp; Rawle 450. 455. By the unanimous judgment of this court, it was approved in the above mentioned case of <em>Conrad </em>v. <em>Harrison et al.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">In the case of <em>Beverley </em>v. <em>Brooke et al. 2 </em>Leigh 425. it had, however, been decided that where a <em>judgment </em>is obtained against a debtor, who afterwards aliens his lands to divers alienees by divers conveyances, all the lands in the hands of the several alienees are alike liable to the judgment creditor, and must contribute <em>pro rata. </em>This case is different from that of <em>Conrad </em>v. <em>Harrison et al. </em>as it is the case of a <em>judgment; </em>and that difference was adverted to by the judges in the decision of <em>Conrad </em>v. <em>Harrison, as </em>important. It was not expressly overruled, and it cannot be distinguished, I think, from the case at bar. We must therefore either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>overrule it, or, in deferring to it, we must say that the decree in this case is, upon this point, erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">My own opinion is that that case should be reviewed, as one of the most distinguished judges who decided it, expressly renounced it in <em>Conrad </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>and as it appears that the point was not fully discussed, nor were the respectable authorities produced which have since been brought before the court. (10 Serg. &amp; Rawle 450. <em>Clowes </em>v. <em>Dickenson, </em>5 Johns. Ch. Rep. 235.) The case was decided by only three judges, one of whom having since distinctly declared that he could not distinguish it from <em>Conrad </em>v. <em>Harrison et al. </em>which he yet decided the other way, it stands now as the decision of only two judges, and so is no longer an authority binding upon us.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Upon reviewing this case, and revolving the principles decided in <em>Clowes </em>v. <em>Dickenson </em>and <em>Conrad </em>v. <em>Harrison et al. </em>I am compelled to say that I think those principles should govern it. The case put by chancellor <em>Kent, </em>of a <em>judgment </em>binding lands, is precisely the case of <em>Beverley </em>v. <em>Brooke et al. </em>and its naked statement exhibits the truth and applicability of the principle laid down by him. The case put by judge <em>Car?-, </em>in 3 Leigh 539, 40. is apt and forcible for its illustration. The argument, seems to me unanswerable, that the right of the prior vendee to demand that his vendor\u2019s land should, for his relief, be first charged under an <em>elegit, </em>cannot be taken away without his consent. The consequences of the contrary doctrine are also worthy of the gravest consideration. A debtor who, after judgment, has sold part of his lands, has every temptation to defraud his grantee of his right to resort to the residue for his relief. He has every inducement to sell that residue and pocket the price, the purchaser holding it free from more than a <em>pro rata </em>charge. It is worth nothing in his own hands, but\" by selling it to another, it brings profit to himself.</p>\n<p id=\"AzY\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>It is said, indeed, that the <em>law </em>has settled the rights of the alienees. It has declared that all are <em>in cequali jure, </em>and that equity cannot control the law. I do not think so. Admit that all are upon equal footing at law, the question still recurs whether one may not have superior equity to another. This is admitted as it respects the vendor himself. If the <em>elegit </em>takes (as in strictness it must take, and as in fact it usually does take) <em>all the </em>lands, as well the alienee\u2019s as the debtor\u2019s, the alienee has no relief at law, but yet he may have relief in equity against the debtor himself. Why ? Because he has superior equity. So if all are alienees, they are all <em>in cequali jure </em>at law, but the prior has superior equity over the latter. He had, before the last alienation, an equitable right to charge the land so aliened. Has he lost that right by the last alienation ? Does not the last alienee take subject to that equity ? Assuredly, if he purchased with notice of it. He had notice of the judgment, and that it bound his land. If he had notice that there were other lands which were bound by it, and which were previously aliened, he had notice that what he was buying was, in his vendor\u2019s hands, bound for their indemnity. If he did not <em>know this, he must protect </em>himself, if at all, by a plea of his purchase without notice of the equitable rights of prior alienees. This has not been done in the present case. If therefore it be admitted that the last alienee can protect himself at all, it is not upon the principle that he is, in equity, <em>in cequali jure, </em>but upon the ground that he purchased without notice of the equity, and is therefore not affected by it. It is possible that this might protect him: but as to this, I do not think it necessary now to give an opinion. It is enough here to say., that where the last alienee cannot so protect himself, he must be the first to suffer in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>The next error assigned is the failure to ascertain whether the rents and profits would not pay the debt in a reasonable time. To this it may be answered, 1. that the defendant, not having asked the enquiry, is presumed to have waived it. <em>Manns </em>v. <em>Flinn\u2019s adm\u2019r, </em>reported <em>ante, </em>p. 93.\u20142. That the price of the property (200 dollars) is a sufficient assurance that the rents of half of it would be inadequate even to pay the interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Thus far I have been able to discover no error in the decree. But I am of opinion that in some other points it is clearly erroneous. First, the decree is for interest on the aggregate sum of 362 dollars 64 cents, instead of the original sum of 148 dollars 63 cents. Secondly, the equity of redemption in the land conveyed in trust for <em>Withrow </em>should have been first sold out and out,\u2014 not a moiety only, but the whole. <em>Haleys </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>1 Leigh 140.\u20143. If that fell short of satisfying the demand, then the tract conveyed to the appellant should have been next sold, and so in succession, until the debt should be satisfied, or one half in value of the whole lands should be sold. For had the <em>elegit </em>been executed, one half of <em>each </em>tract would not be extended, but one half of the whole lands, and that half which was last sold should bear the burden.
