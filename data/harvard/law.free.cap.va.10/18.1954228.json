Plea not guilty, and issue. Five successive juries were sworn, but neither of them rendered a verdict. In consequence of which, the parties, by consent, transferred the cause to the district court, where it was docketed-and tried. The jury found that the plaintiff was free, and assessed her damages to $ 30 : which she released. The judgment of the court was, that she should recover her freedom with costs of suit: And <em>Parish </em>appealed to the court of appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b34-15\"><em>Randolph, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7\">The district court had not jurisdiction ; for the cause originated in the county court, and was docketed in the district court by consent of counsel, who could not transfer jurisdiction. 2 <em>Wash. </em>300. 1 <em>Call, </em>54. The plea is not guilty generally, and does not state whether the plaintiffs were bond or <em>free; </em>which is er<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>ror; for the condition of the plaintiff in a suit of this kind ought to be alledged in the pleadings. The verdict is uncertain, as it does not distinguish which of the plaintiffs are free.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b35-4\">\n<em>Botts, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ay\">All that relates to the children is surplus-age ; for one person cannot sue for another. The court had jurisdiction; because the plaintiff may appear to a declaration without a writ; and, if he does so, he is <em>rectus in curia, </em>and cannot object afterwards that he has not been properly called into court. 1 <em>Wash. </em>379. This, in fact, was no more than that; for it is, in effect, the filing of a declaration by the plaintiff, and an appearance by the defendant. The cases cited by the appellant\u2019s counsel only prove that consent cannot give jurisdiction to a court which has not original cognizance of the subject; and not that the parties are unable to waive <em>the form of </em>citation, and come into court without process. Thus, in <em>M\u2019Call </em>v. <em>Peachy, </em>1 Call, 55, it was decided, that the very essence of the jurisdiction of this court was, that there should be an <em>appeal, </em>as the court had not original cognizance. Of course, one of the main ingredients of jurisdiction was wanting in that case ; because there was no <em>appeal. </em>But the case would have been different, if the court had had original cognizance. 2 <em>Wash. </em>214. It was the defendant\u2019s own fault, that he did not put the condition of the plaintiff in issue; and therefore, if any inconvenience results to him from the omission, he has no right to complain ; especially as the plaintiff could not compel him to plead that she was a slave. But it was not necessary that the point should be specially stated ; for any form of pleading will do, and the merits may be examined at large, although the issue be not technically regular. <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Dick and Patt, </em>1 Wash. 238. The finding of the jury is, in substance, a general verdict for the plaintiff, as all the irrelevant matter may be rejected as surplusage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b35-5\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b36-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Lyons, President,</author>\n<p id=\"AJQ\">delivered the resolution of the court, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">The only real plaintiff in the cause is <em>Jenny Gray; </em>and the mention of her children has no other effect than as serving to shew, that a verdict in her favour would enure to their benefit. It was therefore a mere redundancy, without any operation, as the same consequence would have followed from the verdict, whether those words were inserted or not. Of course, they may be disregarded ; and then it is a suit brought by the mother only; which obviates the objection, that the verdict has only found for the plaintiff, without saying which of them, or any how disposing of the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">With respect to the exception, that the plaintiff\u2019s condition is not put in issue, the answer is, That it was the defendant\u2019s own fault; since he had his choice to plead it, or not: And, if he' has failed to do so, he certainly has no right to complain. But how is he injured ? There is nothing which looks that way; for it appears by the verdict, that a full enquiry into the plaintiff\u2019s right to freedom was allowed; and therefore, he had the same benefit upon this, that he would have had upon the other issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-11\">The objection to the jurisdiction of the district court is altogether unfounded. For the cause was docketed by consent; and it was no more, in effect, than a dismission of the suit in the county court, and' filing the same pleadings, by mutual consent, in the district court; where both parties appeared, and as the court had jurisdiction over the subject, neither could afterwards object to the mode of bringing the cause into.court.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-12\">The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
