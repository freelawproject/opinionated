The first clause of the codicil was intended to benefit <em>Bryan Fairfax </em>personally : and that the second was meant to benefit the family of <em>Bryan Fairfax </em>generally, - without regard to any particular child, is manifest upon the following considerations. The testator has used no words so unequivocally designating particular children, as to amount to what the law calls a <em>descriptio persona: </em>and the language which he has used is inconsistent with the idea of any such particular designation ; for it appears by the grant made to <em>Bryan Fairfax </em>in 1765, and by the testimony in the cause, that he knew, at the date of the codicil, that the second and third children of <em>Bryan Fairfax </em>were sons, and the fourth a daughter; yet to each of the objects of his bounty he continues the annuity during <em>his </em>or <em>her </em>natural life; and this, not by an independent clause, but by one connected with and immediately following that in which he has provided for the father\u2014which is always considered a strong circumstance to shew a general intent. It is unquestionable, that the testator did not mean to restrict his bounty to the particular individuals who were the second, third and fourth children of <em>Bryan Fairfax </em>at the date of the codicil: his acquaintance with those individuals, viewed in connexion with the fact of his using language which imports that each object of his bounty might be either a male or a female, renders such a restrictive construction impossible. He designed to leave indeterminate and unascertained, at that time, the persons who were to take upon the death of the annuitants. Nor is there any thing in the language of the testator, in the circumstances of his own family, or in those of the family of <em>Bryan Fairfax, </em>which indicates, or renders probable, an intention that the persons who were to take the annuities of the nieces should become determinate at his own death. His language is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>opposed to that construction ; for he devises, that <em>\u201c upon </em>. . ' , . . ,, , the death or each annuitant, her annuity shall be continued to \u201c the <em>second\" </em>&amp;c. child of <em>Bryan Fairfax; </em>and ..... . - , i i even it this be somewhat equivocal, and do not necessarily import that the annuity is to be taken by such child as, <em>upon </em>the death of the annuitant, <em>may be </em>the second, &amp;c. still,\u2019that meaning occurs more obviously and naturally than any other; while the extraneous circumstances, which must necessarily be looked to in every case like this, combine to strengthen the probability that such, and no other, was the real intent of the testator. He undoubtedly intended a benefit to <em>some three </em>of <em>Bryan Fairfax's </em>children ; but he knew that if he designated, by the terms of his will, the particular child who was to succeed to each particular annuity, so that, before the death of the prior annuitant, the successor might be individually known and named, his or her death in the lifetime of the prior annuitant would cause the lapse of the annuity, although other children of <em>Bryan Fairfax, </em>equally dear to him, might be living; and it is therefore unlikely that he designed to ascertain, previous to the death of the annuitant, the person who was to be the successor. Supposing this to be the proper construction of the clause, and that the testator intended to leave the objects of his bounty thus indeterminate until the period when that bounty was to be enjoyed, such an intention contravenes no rule of. law. The authorities establish, beyond all doubt, that where property is given to a <em>class </em>of persons, as children, grandchildren, brothers <em>See. </em>all persons that anstver the description at the time for distributing the fund, no matter whether they were in being at the date of the will, or were born after the testator\u2019s death, nor whether they be the offspring of a marriage contracted before the testator\u2019s death, or afterwards, are entitled to,share in the distribution. <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>Severn, 1 Bro.

If <em>Ann Catlett, </em>then, at the death of <em>Ann Susanna Martin </em>the third annuitant, was the fourth child of <em>Bryan Fairfax, </em>she fell within the exact description of the testator, at the first moment that the annuity could vest in or be taken by any person under the will; and by the strongest and clearest analogy, she was entitled to take it. To the construction which we contend for, it may perhaps be objected that the children of <em>Bryan Fairfax </em>and the three nieces of' the testator <em>might </em>so have died, as to render the execution of the will difficult or impracticable. But with such considerations the court has nothing to do, in any case where the intention of the testator is ascertained. <em>Difflis </em>v. <em>Goldschmidt, </em>1 Meriv. 417. <em>S.

In the language of lord <em>Ellenborough </em>in <em>Driver </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>3 Maule &amp; Selw. 55, 6. the court is not warranted in making another will for the testator than that which he has actually made for himself, because inconveniences which he did not foresee or provide against might, in another state of events, have resulted from the- will which he has made.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-3\"><em>Johnson </em>and <em>Leigh, </em>for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aeb\">contended that those of <em>Bryan Fairfax's </em>children who were the second, third and fourth in the order of seniority at the death of the testator, became entitled to the annuities in succession to the nieces respectively. In maintaining this construction of the codicil, they said, they had not to encounter any one of the propositions of law stated by the counsel for the appellants. All of those proposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>tions might be admitted, without affecting the case in the slightest degree. Supposing the testator\u2019s general intent to have been, as assumed on the other side, to make a provision for <em>Bryan Fairfax </em>and his family, that intent was perfectly consistent with the construction for which they contended: while that construction would at the same time explain the use of the alternative words \u201c his or her,\u201d applied to each of the children designated; since, even admitting that the testator knew, at the date of the codicil, all the children of <em>Bryan Fairfax </em>then living, he could not know whether, at the period of his own death, the second, third and fourth children wmuld be the same individuals who then answered that description, or not. On the other hand, the construction insisted on by the appellants involved consequences which it was impossible to regard as having been within the contemplation and intent of the testator. It might be presumed that he did not intend any one child to have more than one annuity: yet, according to the construction of the appellants, all the annuities might have gone to the same child ; for possibly, of the three annuitants, <em>Ann Susanna </em>might have died first, <em>Sybella </em>next, and <em>Frances </em>last, and the same individual might have been the fourth child of <em>Bryan Fair-fax </em>at the death of <em>Ann Susanna, </em>the third at the death of <em>Sybella,, </em>and the second at the death of <em>Frances. </em>Again, one and the same individual might possibly have been the fourth child of <em>Bryan Fairfax </em>at the death of <em>Sybella, </em>the third at the death of <em>Frances, </em>and the second at the death of <em>Ann Susanna; </em>in which case, upon the same construction, he would have taken no one of the annuities, though he survived all the annuitants. And the person taking all three of the annuities, in the case first supposed, might be a child of <em>Bryan Fairfax </em>born after the testator\u2019s death: while the person losing all of them, in the other case, might be one of the very \u2022 children with whom the testator was acquainted in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>lifetime. The general rule is, that wherever the legatee is not named, but designated by description, you ascertain at the death of the testator who answers that description. There are doubtless exceptions ; but whoever relies upon an exception must take the <em>onus </em>of shewing that his case falls within it. In this case, no ground of exception has been suggested. The cases of <em>Hansford &amp; ux. </em>v. <em>Elliott et al. </em>9 Leigh 79. <em>Doe d. Long </em>v. <em>Prigg, 8 </em>Barn. &amp; Cres. 231. 15 Eng. C. L.

C. </em>3 Maule &amp; Selw. 25. <em>Lady Lincoln </em>v. <em>Pelham, </em>10 Ves. 166. <em>Bowles </em>v. <em>Bowles, </em>Id. 177. and <em>Danvers </em>v. <em>Earl of Clarendon, </em>1 Vern. 35. are strong authorities in support of that construction for which the appellees here contend. All of them proceed on the principle, that the law favours such a construction as will leave bequests contingent as short a time as possible : and this is more especially the case where legacies are charged upon land, since then the ascertainment of the persons entitled is important as well to the heir or devisee whose land is charged, as to the legatees themselves, whose interests, when vested, become a marketable property, though the vesting in actual possession may be still uncertain and contingent. The cases cited on the other, side, in which a fund was bequeathed to be distributed among a designated class of persons, are not adverse. The .result of them all is simply this: All persons answering the description, who are <em>in esse </em>at the testator\u2019s death, take vested interests (unless some other provision necessarily keeps them contingent) and those not then <em>in esse </em>take vested interests as they successively come into being: the shares vest in possession immediately, if there is no particular estate, or if there is one, then as soon as it is determined: and even if some peculiar provision keep the shares of the legatees contingent till the happening of a particular event, still these contingent interests are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>transmissible to their representatives, if the persons to whom they are contingently given be certain and determinate.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b103-10\">He decided the cause in the court of chancery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b113-6\">Parker, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AqS\">In expressing the opinion which I have formed in this case after long consideration, I do not mean to enter at large upon the various topics discussed with so much ability by the counsel who argued it, but merely to state the grounds of my judgment, that the decree ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Lord Fairfax, by his will, bequeathed to his nieces <em>Frances Martin, Sybella Martin </em>and <em>Ann Susanna Martin, </em>and to each and every of them living at his death, an annuity of \u00bf\u00a3100. sterling during their and each of their natural lives, and charged his land devised to his nephew <em>Denny Martin </em>with the payment. This will is dated in 1777. By a codicil thereto, dated the 27th of November 1779, he made some provision for <em>Bryan Fairfax, </em>and after reeding the bequest of the annuities aforesaid, he. adds, \u201cI do hereby devise and bequeath that upon the death of <em>Frances Martin, </em>her annuity of \u00bf\u00a3100. be given and continued to the second child of the aforesaid <em>Bryan Fairfax, </em>during <em>his </em>or <em>her </em>natural life: and that upon the death <em>o\u00ed' Sybella Martin, </em>the annuity of \u00bf\u00a3 100. sterling bequeathed to her be given and continued to the third child of the aforesaid <em>Bryan Fair-fax, </em>during <em>his </em>or <em>her </em>natural life : and further, that upon the death of my other niece <em>Ann Susanna Marlin, </em>the annuity of <em>\u00a3 </em>100. sterling bequeathed to her be given and continued to the fourth child of the said <em>Bryan Fairfax, </em>during <em>his </em>or <em>her </em>natural life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">At the date of the will and codicil and at the death of the testator, <em>Bryan Fairfax </em>had five children living; and at those periods, <em>William, Ferdinando </em>and <em>Elizabeth </em>answered the description of his second, third and fourth children. But at the. death of <em>Ann Susanna Martin </em>in 1817, the wife of the complainant answered the deserip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>tion of <em>Bryan Fairfax's fourth </em>child, in consequence of death of some of his other children; and in this character she claims the annuity of <em>\u00a3 </em>100. sterling bequealhed to the said <em>Ann Susanna. </em>The question therefore is between a child of <em>Bryan Fairfax </em>answering the description at the date of the codicil and at the death of the testator, and another child answering the description at the death of the annuitant; and it is a question purely of intention. The only rule of law which seems to be applicable to the subject is this; that in general the courts are inclined to favour the vesting of legacies or other gifts, as soon as the words of the instrument will admit of it: and where lands are charged, there is good reason for this rule, in order that the precise nature of the charge may be understood, and the rights of property ascertained. If the intent, however, be apparent on the face of the will, neither the technical rule respecting the early vesting of an estate, nor possible inconveniences arising from a literal adherence to such intention, are to be regarded. We are not warranted (as lord <em>FUerihorough </em>expressed himself in <em>Driver </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>3 Mau. &amp; Selw. 25.) in making another will for the testator than that which he has actually made for himself, because inconveniences not foreseen or provided against might, in a certain state of events, result from the will which has been made: although (in the language of another eminent judge on the same occasion) the case is very different where the intention is not fully expressed, but is to be collected and inferred as onl}\u2019 probable. In that case the probability, from which the intention is to <em>be inferred, </em>may be outweighed by the improbability that the testator could intend to make a distribution of his property, attended with such inconveniences as would follow from carrying into effect his supposed intention. And to this extent only can we give weight to the argument founded, in this case, on the difficulty, confusion and injustice which might result, if it should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>be considered that the persons who were to take these several annuities were not determinate until the deaths of the first annuitants.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">In ascertaining the intention of lord <em>Fairfax, </em>we must remember that he was not standing <em>in loco parentis </em>to the children of <em>Bryan Fairfax; that Bryan Fairfax was </em>but distantly related to him ; that the testator was probably acquainted with the four eldest children of Bn/aa <em>Fairfax </em>some time before the date of his will and codicil, and with no other child, <em>Robert </em>the youngest being then an infant of tender years; that <em>Bryan Fairfax </em>was, at the date of the codicil, almost certainly a widower; and that no <em>general </em>intent appears, to provide for all the children of <em>Bnjan </em>Fairfax, but only for his second, third and fourth. If we ascertain what children were in the contemplation of the testator, as sustaining the character of second, third and fourth child, no difficulty can arise about the time at which the gift vested; for it cannot admit of a doubt, that where a legacy is given to one for life, and after his decease to a determinate child of another, or to younger children generally, it vests at the death of the testator, and is not postponed till the death of the tenant for life, when the estate is to come into possession. <em>Lady Lincoln </em>v. <em>Pelham, 10 </em>Ves. 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">In the case before the court, the testator has not clearly indicated the period when the* right to the annuities should vest in interest, in the second, third and fourth child of <em>Bryan Fairfax. </em>But the circumstances under which he made his will, and the state of <em>Bryan Fairfax </em>and his family at the lime, render, it highly probable that he looked only to the second, third and fourth child at the dale of the bequest, or at the lime of his own death. The expressions <em>his </em>or <em>her </em>certainly prove that he contemplated the possibility of the second, third or fourth child being male or female, at the lime of enjoying the annuity; but the chancellor has properly remarked that the necessity for the use of these terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>equally existed, whatever time he looked to as ascerlaining the persons to take. If that time was to be the period of his own death, <em>Elizabeth </em>the fourth child might, by the death of hei brothers, become the second or third, <em>R\u00b0bert </em>be substituted in her place. There being then no clear intent manifested on the face of the will, and the circumstances shewing that lord <em>Fairfax </em>more probably designed to benefit the children known to him and then <em>in esse, </em>answering the description, than children to be born at a future period ; and this construction coinciding with the principle established by this court in the case of <em>Hansford &amp; ux. </em>v. <em>Elliott et al. </em>on the authoritjr of <em>Doe d. Long </em>v. <em>Prigg, 8 </em>Barn. &amp; Cres. 231. that where no special intent to the contrary is manifested, the vesting of legacies shall be referred to the death of the testator, and not to the lime of distribution and payment; and being, as I think, further supported by the case of <em>Driver </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>3 Mau. &amp; Selw. 25. <em>S. C. </em>6 Price 41.\u2014I am of opinion that the second, third and fourth child of <em>Bryan Fairfax </em>at the death of the testator, were entitled in interest to the annuities; an interest which, though contingent, and not transmissible to representatives, wras valuable and saleable, and therefore to be noticed and protected by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The decree is to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The other judges concurred. Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
