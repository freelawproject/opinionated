The jury find that the defendant has had possession of 100 acres of land, described in a patent to him bearing date the 25th of June 1S13, and set forth <em>in Tuzc verba, </em>which possession was adverse to the plaintiff and those under whom he claims, and was so for more than 20 years before the institution of this suit, and extended to the limits of the said patent: that the defendant is in possession of the land described in a deed from <em>Samuel Honeyman </em>and wife to him, set forth <em>in hc&amp;c verba, </em>which deed bears date the 6th of October 1825, and conveys a parcel of land on <em>Cole </em>river by metes and bounds, said to contain about 500 acres, and to be part of the tract patented to <em>James, Molineaux </em>and <em>Pollock: </em>that the defendant has been in possession of the land described in the deed to him from <em>Honeyman </em>and wife, from the date of that deed to the time of the verdict: that this deed includes the defendant\u2019s tract of 100 acres, and is included within the limits and bounds of the tract of 93026J acres.

The record, he ' said, shews that the defendant confessed lease, entry and ouster, and agreed to rely upon title only, at the trial. This is not only an admission of the fact which it is said is not proved, but an agreement also that no such proof will be required at the trial. The object is to narrow the issue, supersede useless evidence, and render the,proceedings in ejectment more simple. Where a tenant in common is sued by his cotenant, and denies the ouster, upon application to the court, supported by affidavit denying the ouster, he is permitted to confess lease and entry only, and deny the ouster. This course is in perfect accordance with the principles of the action. The court prescribe the terms on which the tenant shall be permitted to defend, and every fact which may not tend to settle the title, is required to be admitted on the record. But when a defendant shews to the court good reason why a particular fact, usually admitted, ought not to be admitted, he is permitted to appear without making the admission., and a special consent rule is entered, suited to ,the case. The plaintiff is then notified that the fact so denied must be proved, and prepares his proof accordingly. When the special consent rule, however, is not entered\u2014when lease, entry and ouster are confessed on the record, .the party is \u00a1not required to prove that which has been confessed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Adams on Eject. 236, 7. and notes. 7 Mod. 39. <em>Wigfall </em>v. <em>Bryden, </em>Burr. 296. <em>Little </em>v. <em>Heaton, </em>Ld.

Dividing the 59017 acres among <em>James\u2019s </em>heirs, it gives 11805 acres to each. <em>Hill </em>was found to be in possession of 400 acres under a conveyance from <em>Honeyman </em>and wife. Supposing the pleadings and proofs to shew an ouster as to these 400 acres, then as to this land the deed to <em>Van B. </em>and <em>Franklin Reynolds, </em>made while <em>Hill </em>was in possession, is void, the third count must be left out of view, and the case decided on the two other counts. Is there such an ouster as will authorize a recovery upon the first and second counts, against <em>Hill, </em>who holds to his exclusive use and benefit 400 acres of the land ? To maintain ejectment by one tenant in common against another, the ouster must be actual; that is,' there must be an actual adversary possession by the defendant, and an actual dispossession of the lessors of the plaintiff, of the land held in common. Adams on Eject. 55. Burr. 2604. <em>Barnitz's lessee </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>7 Cranch 457. Now here, the land held in common being 59017 acres, it is obvious that the holding by one tenant in common of 400 acres to his exclusive use cannot constitute an actual ouster of his cotenants or either of them. Every tenant in, common is equally entitled, to possession according to his interest, and if the tenant in possession of the 400 acres is subject to a recovery, he may equally recover against his cotenants in proportion to his interest in every farm on the 93026 acre tract which may be held and exclusively enjoyed under any one of the heirs of <em>Robert James, </em>The actual ouster required to maintain ejectment by one tenant in com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>mon against another is not only an exclusive and separate possession, by one of the tenants, of a part of the common property, but an entire dispossession of his co-tenants. <em>Doe e. d. Hellings </em>v. <em>Bird, </em>11 East 49. <em>Jackson e. d. Jones </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>18 Johns. Rep. 400. Where they are in unequal possession, the remedy is by writ of partition under the statute, or by bill in chancery. In this view, the authorities cited on the other side cannot be of any avail. They only establish that the confession of lease, entry and ouster is sufficient evidence of actual ouster from the land in controversy. They do not establish that it is evidence of ouster from the whole of the property which was held in common. And such ouster must be established, to authorize a recovery against a tenant in common before partition. If the plaintiffs can take from the defendant a part of the 400 acres in his possession, including his improvements, <em>Pollock </em>and <em>Molineaux, </em>and every other tenant in common, can do the same thing. All holding in common, each would recover a possession equal to his interest. To permit this, would answer no good purpose, as the parties would at last be forced to resort to a court of equity to settle their rights. Thus far, supposing the position to be correct, that the confession of lease, entry and ouster will, in the courts of <em>Virginia, </em>render proof of actual ouster unnecessary. But is that position correct ? It is not denied that the practice in <em>England, </em>as well as in <em>New York, </em>is as contended for. But this practice has never been adopted in <em>Virginia, </em>or in any of the states except <em>New York. </em>On the contrary, in the case of <em>Barnitz\u2019s lessee </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>7 Cranch 463. 471. in which the question was raised and discussed, the supreme court of the <em>United States </em>decided that notwithstanding the confession of lease, entry and ouster, the plaintiff in ejectment must prove an actual ouster, to entitle him to a recovery against his cotenant in common.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number><em>Smith, </em>in reply. The lessors of the plaintiff have an interest in the land held by <em>Hill. Hill </em>has no interest in any other portion. And they have a right to come into the enjoyment of their portion of what he is holding. Whether or no there was a confession of lease, entry and ouster in the case in 7 Cranch, does not appear, except from the statement of counsel in the argument. The point seems to have received very slight consideration. No authorities were cited by counsel, nor does the court refer to any. It was decided only by a majority of the court, and it does not appear who were the dissenting judges. If the chief justice was one, that would much weaken the authority of the case. The weight of authority elsewhere, the history of the action of ejectment, and the difficulties in practice out of which it sprung, as well as precision and propriety in pleading, are all opposed to the decision. The legislature, too, has been extending the remedy, by authorizing tenants in common to join, 1 Rob. Prac. 465. and it has given it greater simplicity, by providing that after issue joined, no objection shall be taken to the substance or form of the declaration ; 1 Rob. Prac. 452. and remarks of <em>Oreen, </em>J. in <em>Whittington &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Christian &amp;c. </em>2 Rand. 356. When the legislature is thus enlarging and encouraging the remedy, it would be remarkable if the courts should make decisions counteracting that liberal policy. Convenience requires that the practice should be settled as now contended for. If the party who means to deny the ouster be required to enter into the consent rule specially, there can be no surprise. And when it is entered into, if possession be all the plaintiff seeks, he can take possession and dismiss his suit.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b487-3\">Parker, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ae8\">This is an action of ejectment against one tenant in common, by several others. The defendant appeared and entered into the common rule, ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>cording to the form in Robinson\u2019s Forms, p. 12.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> A special verdict was rendered, which omits to find the' ouster; and the court gave judgment for the defendant. It is now contended that it was not necessary to prove the ouster, because it was confessed, and that for the same reason it was not necessary for the jury to find the fact. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">In <em>England, </em>when an ejectment is brought by a joint tenant, parcener or tenant in common against his companion (to support which an actual ouster is necessary) the practice is for the defendant to apply to the court, upon affidavit, for leave to enter into a special rule, requiring him to confess lease and entry at the trial, but not ouster also, unless an actual ouster of the plaintiff\u2019s lessor by him the defendant should be proved. Adams on Ejectm. 236. But I regard this as a mere point of practice, conformable to rules invented from time <em>to time by the courts to </em>advance the remedy by ejectment, and to force the parties to go to trial on the merits, without being entangled by formal objections to fictitious averments in the declaration. There are, however, essential differences between the rules of the several english courts themselves, and between those courts and our own. I do not believe we have ever adopted the special rule, the form of which is given in the appendix to Adams on Ejectm. No. 25. but in all cases our clerks make the entry of the consent rule in the form given by <em>Robinson. </em>Under it, I see no reason why the defendant should be bound by his confession of the fictitious ouster laid in the declaration, unless an actual ouster of the plaintiff\u2019s lessor be proved, in which event the plaintiff ought not to be called upon to prove the ouster of the fictitious lessee. Otherwise the defendant cannot avail himself of the real merits, of his defence, and must have the costs of the suit thrown upon him, although there has been no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>actual ouster of his cotenaut. The court will always - so mould the proceedings as that the real merits of the controversy shall be tried, without entrapping either party by the rules it has itself prescribed; and if it has admitted a tenant in common to defend the action, only on his confession of lease, entry and ouster, it will give such effect to that confession as is consistent with a trial of the merits. Such was the decision of the supreme court of the <em>United States </em>in the case of <em>Barnitz\u2019s lessee </em>v. Casey, 7 Cranch 456. where the defendants, tenants in common, having confessed lease, entry and ouster, it was insisted that an actual ouster need not be proved. But the court.decided that as a tenant in common could not in general maintain an action of ejectment against his cotenant, and there were no facts found in the case to prove an actual ouster and take it out of the general rule, the judgment in favour of the tenant should be affirmed. There, as here, I infer that a special verdict had been found.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">But if the confession so far dispensed with the proof of actual ouster as to authorize the jury to find it as a fact in the cause, yet as they have not found it, I am of opinion that we, in deciding on the special verdict, cannot infer it. Facts admitted by the pleadings of the parties need not perhaps be found; but I do not think that this rule extends to the <em>pro forma </em>confessions of facts not actually existing, required under a rule of court to bring the merits of a controversy under judicial decision. We ought not to hold that a confession that <em>Richard Roe </em>ejected <em>John Doe, </em>not only precludes the necessity of proving that the real defendant ousted the real plaintiff, but also the necessity of the jury\u2019s finding that fact, without the existence of which the plaintiff ought not to succeed. It is clear that if, in a special verdict not uncertain in itself, the case made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>by the plaintiff is a defective case or a defective title, the judgment should be for the defendant, and a <em>venire de novo </em>should not be granted. <em>Brown &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>4 Leigh 51. 56. Therefore I am for affirming the judgment, and especially as the plaintiff may bring his new ejectment, and prove, if he can, the actual ouster.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b488-5\">In the new edition, vol. 1. p. 175.
