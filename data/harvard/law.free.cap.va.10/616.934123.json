Harrison, </em>against <em>John M. Botts, </em>the defendant <em>John M. Botts </em>obtained an injunction to stay proceedings at law on the execution, which being dissolved, another execution was sued oyt on the forthcoming bond. Before the return day of this execution, but after it bad been levied on the defendant <em>Boas\u2019s </em>property, <em>Scott, </em>the creditor, having a pressing demand for ready money, applied to <em>Tabb, </em>a broker, to negotiate a sale of his claim on the execution, upon the best terms he could for cash. <em>Tabb </em>made several efforts to effect a sale, without success; and <em>Scott </em>becoming very urgent, <em>Tabb </em>at length applied to <em>Brooke </em>to purchase one moiety of the claim upon the execution, saying that he held a sum of money as the agent of his' two sisters which he was willing to invest in the purchase of the other moiety. <em>Brooke, </em>after some hesitation, assented, upon condition, however, that his name should not appear in the transaction, because he wished to avoid importunities for indulgence. The claim was purchased, one half for <em>Brooke, </em>and the other half with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>the money and for the benefit of <em>Tabb's </em>sisters; and <em>Scott </em>executed an assignment of the execution, and an order on the sheriff for the proceeds thereof, to <em>Tabb </em>as <em>\u201cagent,\u201d </em>but neither the assignment nor the order pressed <em>for whom. Tabb </em>was agent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-5\">After this, <em>Botts </em>exhibited another bill in the circuit superior court for <em>Henrico </em>and <em>Richmond, </em>against <em>Tabb </em>and <em>Scott, </em>in which he stated, that <em>Tabb </em>had taken an assignment of the execution in his own name; <em>that Botts </em>was the owner of three judgments against <em>Tabb, </em>amounting nearly to the sum due on <em>Scott's </em>execution against him which had been assigned to <em>Tabb; </em>that <em>Tabb </em>was insolvent, and had taken the benefit of the statute for relief of insolvent debtors; so that <em>Botts </em>could not sue out executions on the judgments against <em>Tabb, </em>while <em>Tabb </em>was proceeding on the execution against <em>Botts, </em>which <em>Scott </em>had assigned to him ; and praying, therefore, that the debt due to <em>Botts </em>on the judgments against <em>Tabb, </em>should be set off against the execution against <em>Botts, </em>which had been assigned by <em>Scott </em>to <em>Tabb, </em>and that, in the mean time, <em>Scott </em>and <em>Tabb </em>should be in-joined from further proceedings on that execution. The injunction was awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-6\"><em>Tabb, </em>in his answer, admitted the justice of <em>Botts's </em>claims against him, but he denied, that he had any interest in <em>ScUl's </em>execution against <em>Botts; </em>and declared, that he had purchased it as agent for his sisters and for <em>BrooJce, </em>as above stated. And <em>Scott, </em>in his answer, confirmed <em>Tabb's </em>account of the transaction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-7\">On the 8th March 1S38, the defendants moved the court to dissolve the injunction. <em>Botts </em>opposed the motion, first on the merits, and secondly, upon the ground, that he was a member of the general assembly then in session, and his privilege as such ought to prevent any action on the subject at that time. The court overruled this last objection ; but it also overruled the motion to dissolve the injunction, with leave to the defendants to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>renew it, and to <em>Botts </em>to amend his bill and make new Parties-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AVi\"><em>Botts </em>filed an amended bill, making <em>Brooke </em>and the two sisters of <em>Tabb </em>(for whose benefit, and with whose money, <em>Tabb </em>said he had purchased <em>Scott\u2019s </em>execution, as their agent) parties defendants; and they filed their answers immediately. <em>Brooke, </em>in his answer, said, that <em>Tabb </em>had purchased one moiety of the claim due on <em>Scott\u2019s </em>execution, as his special agent for the purpose, with his money, and for his benefit; and the two sisters of <em>Tabb </em>said, that he had purchased the other moiety of it, as their <em>general </em>agent, with their money and for their benefit; and the answers denied, that <em>Tabb </em>had any beneficial interest in the claim. And that this was the true state of the case, seemed clear, not only from the answers of the parties, but from the assignment of <em>Scott\u2019s execution </em>to <em>Tabb </em>as \u201cagent,\u201d and other evidence in the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-6\">On the 31st March 1838, the circuit superior court, on the motion of the defendants, dissolved the injunction. <em>Botts </em>applied by petition to a judge of this court, for an appeal; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b642-7\">The cause was argued here by <em>Harrison </em>for the appellant, and <em>R. T. Daniel </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b642-8\">I. The question on the merits, whether <em>Tabb </em>bad any beneficial interest in the execution against <em>Botts, </em>which was assigned by <em>Scott </em>to him as <em>agent, </em>was a mere question of fact upon the evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b642-9\">II. <em>Harrison </em>contended, that the privilege of <em>Botts </em>as a member of the general assembly, should have prevented the court from acting on the case at all, during the session. He referred to the statute, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 51. \u00a7 31. p. 163. which provides, that \u201cthe members of the general assembly are, and ought to be, and forever shall be, in their persons, servants and estates, both real and personal, free, exempt and privileged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>from all arrests, attachments, executions and all other process whatsoever, save only for treason, felony or breach of the peace, during their attendance upon the general assembly, and one day, before and after, every twenty miles they must necessarily travel to and from home; and, in the mean time, <em>process in which they are parties shall he suspended without abatement or discontinuance; </em>and if any person taken in execution, be delivered by privilege of either house of the general assembly, so soon as such privilege ceaseth, he shall return himself a prisoner in execution, or be liable to an escape.\u201d And he said, the statute required all process, whatever was its nature, to which a member might be a party, to be suspended, whether the member was party as plaintiff or defendant; and <em>process, </em>there, could only mean the suit pending or in process. In <em>E?igla?id, </em>privilege of parliament extended to protect a member from all civil process whatever; from citation or summons, as well as process on which he might be arrested. 1 Black. Comm. 164, 5. 4 Inst. 24, 5. And one of the reasons on which the privilege was founded, was, that the member was obliged to attend the service of the public, <em>5 </em>Bac. Abr. <em>Privilege. </em>C. 1. p. 626. and ought not to have his attendance on the public business withdrawn, in order to attend to his lawsuits; a reason which required, that the proceedings should be suspended in all suits to which he was a party, as well as that he should be exempt from the service of process. One being chosen a burgess of <em>Buckingham, </em>and having a trial at bar to be had on tuesday before the sitting of parliament, moved to have his privilege, but was denied in regard the parliament was not sitting, nor to sit till after the trial had; Id. 642. where the reason for denying the privilege, shewed that if parliament had been in session, it must have been allowed. In <em>Bolton </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>1 Dali. 296. a member of the convention of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>called for the ratifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>tion or rejection of the constitution of the <em>U. States, </em>having been served with a <em>summons </em>from the court of common pleas of <em>Philadelphia </em>during the session of the convention, the court discharged him from the action; because, the court said, \u201c a member of assembly ought not to be diverted from the public business by lawsuits brought against him during the sitting of the house, which, though not attended with the arrest of his person, might yet oblige him to attend to those lawsuits, and to bring witnesses from a distant county, to a place, whither he came, perhaps solely, on account of public business.\u201d And in <em>Geyer\u2019s lessee </em>v. <em>Irwin, 4 </em>Dall. 107. in ejectment, the defendant\u2019s attorney, on the cause being called for trial, confessed judgment; and on motion to set aside the judgment, on the ground, that the defendant was a member of the general assembly, attending bis public duty at <em>Philadelphia </em>at the time of marking the cause for trial and confessing judgment, the -court denied the motion, because the defendant\u2019s privilege had not been objected in due time, but it <em>said\u2014\u201c A </em>member of assembly is undoubtedly privileged from arrest, summons, citation, or other civil process, during his attendance on the public business confided to him: and we think, on principle, his -suits cannot be forced to trial and decision, while the session of the legislature continues.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b644-6\"><em>Daniel </em>answered, that the appellant was not a defendant in the court of chancery against whom process was sought, but a plaintiff who, before the session of the assembly, had asked and obtained process from that court to injoin proceedings on an execution at law, sued out against his property, not his body, before the session: there was no process of any kind pending against him in the court of chancery. He bad not been drawn into that court by process at the suit of others ? he had gone there, of his own accord, for process against others \u25a0: -the appellees had taken no mea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>sures against the member of assembly to divert him from his attendance on the public business; it was he who had taken measures against them that required his attendance in court. The privileges of members assembly were defined by the statute of <em>Virginia; </em>and they had no privilege but that which the statute gave them. The word <em>process, </em>as used in the statute, did not mean <em>proceedings, </em>but original, mesne or final process ; process of the same kind with that mentioned in the statute; and there was no such process in the court of chancery, against the appellant, which the court could have suspended.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b645-3\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq2i\">The order of the circuit superior court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
