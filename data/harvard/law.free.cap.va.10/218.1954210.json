Subsequent to the execution of the deed, Q. had the . land surveyed, and found it to contain much less than 800 acres: Whereupon, he filed a bill in chancery, for a deduction from the purchase money, proportionable to the deficiency in the land: which W. resisted, upon the ground, that the purchase was, in fact, of 800 acres, <em>more or less. </em>The court was of opinion, that although there was no fraud in the sale, yet as both parties acted under a mistake as to the quantity, the deficiency was too great for a purchaser, notwithstanding the sale was for 800 acres, <em>more or less ; </em>and therefore, decreed a deduction from the purchase, in proportion to the deficiency, upon the ground of mistake. And W. was likewise decreed to give Q. an indemnity against all charges and incumbrances on the estate.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-7\"><em>JYoel Quesnel </em>filed a bill in the high court of chancery, against <em>Woodlief </em>and others, stating himself to be a native of France, but then a resident of the county of Prince George, in the state of Virginia. That late in the year 1786, he came to reside in the town of Blandford, in the county aforesaid, as a merchant, and soon became acquainted with the defendant <em>Thomas Woodlief </em>of <em>Sion Hill, </em>in the said county; and placed great confidence in him. That <em>Woodlief </em>grew embarrassed in his affairs, and offered his said tract of land, called <em>Sion Hill, </em>for sale, always speaking of it as containing 800 acres; and by public advertisement, of the 6th of March, 1788, asserted it to be that quantity, or <em>thereabout. </em>That the plaintiff hearing the same from <em>Woodlief </em>himself, entered into a treaty with him for the purchase thereof. That, upon the first mention of the subject, <em>Woodlief </em>asked \u00a34000 for it, amounting to \u00a35 per acre; which being more than it was worth, the plaintiff refused to take it at that price; but offered, afterwards, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>letter of the 25th of April, 1788, (in which he mentioned that his counsel should examine the deeds,) <em>\u00a3 </em>3200, believing, at the time, that the tract contained 800 acres. That, under these impressions, he subsequently became the purchaser of the same, for the said sum of <em>\u00a3 </em>3200, equal to \u00a3 4 per acre, payable as follows, viz : \u00a3 500 in October 1788, <em>\u00a3 </em>500 in December 1789, \u00a3 500 in December 1790, <em>\u00a3500 </em>in December 1791, \u00a3600 in December 1792, and \u00a3 600 in December 1793; for which said several sums, (except the first,) he gave his bonds to the said <em>Woodlief. </em>That the plaintiff, after the purchase, intended to require a survey of the land ; but, having understood that it had been in <em>Woodlief\u2019s </em>family for many generations; and, having never heard, that any part of it had been sold, he omitted to do so, determining, however, to have the deed prepared by <em>William Davies, </em>his counsel, as he himself was a foreigner, not well versed in the American language, and still less acquainted with conveyancing. That the contract was not finally concluded until <em>Monday </em>the 28th of April, 1788, when the plaintiff being at the house of <em>Edmund Ruffin, </em>jr. the defendant, in the said county of Prince George, a deed was proposed to be drawn for the said tract of land, by the said <em>Ruffin, </em>as well as a deed of trust upon the same, to secure payment of the purchase money : to which, the plaintiff at first objected, as wishing to have the aid of his counsel, the said <em>Davies ; </em>but, being pressed thereto by <em>Wood-lief </em>and <em>Ruffin, </em>(who declared himself capable of preparing the deed,) he at length assented, believing <em>Ruffin </em>to be both capable and disinterested : and the deeds for the said tract of land called <em>Sion Hill, </em>describing it as containing 800 acres, \u201c <em>more or less,\u201d </em>were accordingly executed upon that day, the deed of trust, however, expressing the quantity to be 800 acres, without the addition of the said words, <em>\u201c more or less.\u201d </em>That the plaintiff believed, at the time, that there were 800 acres; and, as possession was not to be delivered until a future day, he intended to have it surveyed before he occupied it; of which <em>Woodlief </em>was not ignorant. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>the plaintiff, immediately after the execution of the deeds, and before possession was delivered, sent for Harris, the surveyor of the county, for that purpose; but <em>Woodlief </em>being from home, the survey was not made until September 1788; when, to the astonishment of the plaintiff, the tract was found to contain only 510 acres, although, by an after survey, it appeared to contain 577 acres. That <em>Woodlief, </em>in asserting the tract to contain 800 acres, must have relied on general opinion, although he could not have been ignorant, that two parcels of land had been conveyed at different times, between some branches of the family nearly allied to him ; which having finally come into his possession, or the possession of his brother, from whom he inherited the estate, he had himself conveyed, a part thereof, to his brother <em>Peter Woodlief, </em>who was then in possession of 230 acres, formerly parcel of the tract; and which, added to the quantity then held by the plaintiff, would make up the 800 acres. That this was corroborated by the circumstances. For it appeared by a patent dated the 25th of July, 1038, that the ancestors of the defendant <em>Thomas Woodlief, </em>were in possession of the tract of land, called <em>Sion Hill, </em>before that period. That <em>John Woodlief, </em>being in possession of the said tract of land, on the 11th of February, 1737, devised his whole <em>real </em>estate, and the greater part of his personal, \u2022to his son John. That the said <em>John Woodlief, </em>the son, (by the name of <em>John Woodlief, </em>senior), and <em>Catharine his </em>wife, on the 14th February, <em>1761, conveyed </em>202 acres to <em>Campbell: </em>which, from the boundaries, did not appear to have been part of <em>Sion Hill. </em>That the said last mentioned <em>John Woodlief, </em>on the 10th of March, 1761, conveyed to <em>Peter Woodlief, </em>his near relation, 100 acres, called <em>Deep Bottom ; </em>which joins the land conveyed to the plaintiff, and made part of the original tract; and, on the 15th of December, 1770, conveyed, to his eldest son, <em>John Woodlief, </em>junior, 130 acres, being also part of the <em>Sion Hill </em>tract: Which two tracts of 100 and 130 acres, added to the 577, make up the 800 acres sold to the plaintiff. That the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>last mentioned <em>John Woodlief, </em>junior, being in possession of the 130 acre tract, on the 17th of February, 1775, devised, to his nephew, <em>John Woodlief, </em>son of <em>Peter Wood-lief, </em>and elder brother of the defendant, <em>Thomas Woodlief, </em>the residue of his estates, which included the lauds called <em>Sion Hill; </em>and, in order to re-unite the <em>Deep Bottom, </em>tract to <em>Sion Hill, </em>devised to his nephew, <em>Peter Woodlief </em>(brother to the said last named <em>John Woodlief, </em>and the defendant, <em>Thomas Woodlief), </em>\u00a3 250, provided he conveyed, to his brother <em>John </em>aforesaid, the said <em>Deep Bottom </em>tract of 100 acres. That the said last mentioned <em>John Woodlief, </em>on the 4th of February, 1777, devised several personal legacies charged (as well as the personal legacies left by his uncle, the said <em>John Woodlief,) </em>upon his lands; all of which he gave, by the residuary clause of his will, to the defendant, <em>Thomas Woodlief. </em>That the defendant, <em>Thomas Woodlief, </em>had never paid the \u00a3250; and had actually conveyed the said tract of 130 acres to his said brother, <em>Peter Wood-lief, </em>who still kept <em>the Deep Bottom </em>tract. Which proved, that the <em>Sion Hill </em>tract, although spoken of as 800 acres, was, in fact, but 570 acres ; and was called 800 acres, only, when the said two tracts of 100 and 130 acres were united to it. That, on the 28th of April, 1788, it being suggested that the defendant <em>Thomas Woodlief s </em>estate was pledged to the defendant, <em>Edmund Ruffin, </em>junior, and his father, <em>Edmund Ruffin, </em>senior, an endorsement, by way of release, was made on the back of the deed, but no consideration was expressed. That the said <em>Edmund Ruffin, </em>junior, on the 3d of May, 1788, undertook to guarantee the title to <em>Sion Hill, </em>so far as the said incumbrances might extend : which added to the plaintiff\u2019s confidence, that there were 800 acres, as the said <em>Edmund Ruffin, </em>junior, and <em>Edmund Ruffin, </em>senior, his father, had both lived adjoining to it. That the defendant, <em>Thomas Woodlief, </em>having passed away one of the plaintiff\u2019s bonds to <em>Claiborne, </em>the defendant, <em>Edmund Ruffin, </em>junior, gave the plaintiff notice not to pay it. That 60 acres of the <em>Sion Hill </em>tract had been sold by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>the sheriff of Prince George for the taxes of 1787; and <em>j$airg </em>hac] a c]ajtn f0r 50 acres. That, on the 2d of October, 1708, a certain <em>John Woodlief, </em>senior, conveyed 70 acres of land to <em>Stainback, </em>described to be part of the manor plantation, bounded by Deep Bottom run. That, on the 27th of October, 1788, the plaintiff gave the defendant, <em>Edmund Ruffin, </em>junior, notice, that he would not pay the bonds, and that he claimed an allowance for the deficiency in the land sold to him by <em>Woodlief: </em>Which notice he also gave to the said defendant,' <em>Thomas Woodlief, </em>requiring that he should either make the deduction, or annul the contract. But that the said defendants, <em>Thomas Woodlief </em>and <em>Edmund Ruffin, </em>junior, had directed <em>Harrison, </em>the trustee named in the deed of trust, to proceed to sell the land, in order to satisfy the bonds for the purchase money. The bill, therefore, interrogating the defendants as to the matters aforesaid, and particularly whether <em>Quesnel </em>was shewn the boundary lines, before he purchased, prayed for an injunction, and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-6\">The answer of the defendant, <em>Thomas Woodlief, </em>states, that after having previously advertised <em>Sion Hill </em>for sale, he, about the month of April 1788, contracted to sell it to the plaintiff for <em>\u00a3 </em>3500; but, as the contract was by word of mouth only, and no witnesses to it, the plaintiff refused to comply, as he knew the defendant\u2019s embarrassed situation; to relieve which, he afterwards sold it to the complainant for \u00a3 3200. That he had, repeatedly, <em>offered the </em>said tract of land, to the plaintiff, at the supposed quantity of 800 acres; or to survey it, if the plaintiff would pay for the excess; which the plaintiff, <em>after going over the land, </em>refused ; and has since declared, that he thought, <em>from the boundaries, </em>that there must be more than 800 acres in the tract. That, on concluding the bargain, the deeds drawn by col. <em>jDavies, </em>not corresponding with the intention of the plaintiff and defendant, were rejected ; and the defendant, <em>Edmund Ruffin, </em>jr. was requested, by the parties, to draw others for that purpose; which he consented to do: and <em>Monday, </em>the 28th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>of April, 1788, was fixed on, by the plaintiff, as most convenient to him, to attend at the house of the said <em>Edmund Ruffin, </em>jr.; which he did, and the deeds were, there, executed, the plaintiff declaring himself better pleased with them, than with those prepared by col. <em>Davies, </em>whose assistance, he did not express any desire to have; and sometime after-wards, declared himself satisfied with the purchase, and wished people would suffer him to make his own bargains. That several years, before the date of the sale to the plaintiff, the defendant had listed 900 acres of land with the commissioner ; and, prior to the said sale to the plaintiff, had sold the tract of 130 acres to his brother, the said <em>Peter Woodlief; </em>leaving the <em>supposed </em>quantity of 770 acres, which justified his advertising the <em>Sion Hill </em>tract, as containing 800 acres, or <em>thereabout: </em>but, at the time of the advertisement, he verily believed that it contained fully 800 acres. That the tract of 130 acres lies on the south side of Deep Bottom run; never was considered as part of the <em>Sion Hill </em>tract: and was in possession of the said <em>Peter Woodlief, </em>for some time, before the treaty between the plaintiff and the defendant commenced. Denies combination, &amp;tc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-4\">The answer of the defendant, <em>Edmund Ruffin, </em>jr., states, that in April 1788, he was informed by the defendant, <em>Thomas Woodlief, </em>that he was about to conclude a bargain with the plaintiff for <em>Sion Hill; </em>and was requested to attend at Blandford, in order to see part of the purchase money paid; which was to discharge two executions, against <em>Wood-lief, </em>on replevy bonds, to which the plaintiff was security. That the defendant did attend ; when the plaintiff refused to pay the money, unless the defendant would relinquish all claims, the defendant, or <em>Edmund Ruffin, </em>sen., his father, had upon the land; which the defendant readily did, as he knew there were none at that time; all such having been previously cancelled, without ever having been recorded. That the plaintiff, thereupon, paid part of the purchase money ; but, before he did so, he and the defendant went to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>col. <em>Davies, </em>and observed to him, the variance between the actual contract, and the deeds, which the said <em>Davies </em>had drawn. That some conversation ensued; after which) the plaintiff and defendant left him; and returning to the store of <em>James Campbell, </em>the plaintiff agreed to make the payment. That it was then proposed, that the deeds <em>should he </em>drawn by the defendant; for which purpose, the plaintiff furnished memoranda of the terms of the bargain; and in conformity thereto, the defendant prepared the deeds. That the parties met at the house of the defendant, on the <em>28th </em>of April, 1788, (being Monday) the day fixed on by the plaintiff himself for the purpose: at which time, the defendant delivered the deeds to the plaintiff, who, assisted by <em>William Ragsdale, </em>jr.' (a young gentleman who wrote in the clerk\u2019s office, and was tolerably well acquainted with conveyancing) perused them; and expressed his approbation of them, in the presence of several disinterested persons, adding that he was better pleased with them, than with those which had been prepared by col. <em>Davies. </em>That,, while the plaintiff was perusing the said deeds with <em>Ragsdale </em>as aforesaid, when they came to the words, \u201c <em>more or less,\u201d </em>he asked whether <em>Woodlief </em>would not make a deduction for any deficiency in the quantity of land, provided, upon survey, the tract proved to contain less than 800 acres? To which <em>Woodlief </em>answered, that he would, provided the plaintiff would pay for the excess. That the plaintiff, who appeared not to relish the proposition, made no reply; but executed the deeds and bonds, without being pressed thereto by any person. That the defendant believes, that both <em>Woodlief </em>and the plaintiff thought the tract would contain more than 800 acres, from the circumstance of its being an old survey. That the defendant had no inclination, or inducement, to deceive the plaintiff, as there would have been land enough to pay him, notwithstanding the deficiency, which he did not suspect, and he had other ample securities. That the defendant believed, at the time, there were 800 acres; and, under that impression, had, theretofore, taken two deeds of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>trust upon it, as containing that quantity, <em>more or less, </em>as by \" the said deeds, cancelled previous to the sale to the plaintiff, will appear. That the tract of 130 acres, and the <em>Deep Bottom </em>tract of 100 acres, were no part of the <em>Sion Hilt </em>tract, which was entailed; and therefore could not be aliened before the year 1776. That the <em>John Woodlief, </em>who sold the 130 acres to the said <em>John Woodlief o\u00ed Sion Hill, </em>was no relation of that family; but was the husband of the said <em>Catharine </em>mentioned in the bill. That the defendant does not believe that <em>Baird </em>has any title to the said 50 acres of land referred to in the bill. That the defendant wrote the wills of <em>John Woodlief </em>the elder and younger; and is confident that neither of them meant to charge the real estate with the payment of the <em>legacies; </em>which would have been useless, as the personal estate of both was fully sufficient to pay them; and the defendant knows that a considerable part of them has been actually paid. That the bond, in the hands of <em>Claiborne, </em>was withdrawn from the defendant <em>Woodlief, </em>under a promise to return it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AQft\">The answer of <em>Harrison, </em>the trustee, admits the deed of trust; and <em>Ruffin\u2019s </em>direction to him to sell the laud, in order to satisfy the purchase money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-8\">There was a general replication to the answers; and the following depositions were taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-9\"><em>William Ragsdale, </em>jr. says, That, on <em>Monday, </em>the 28th of April, 1788, he was desired, by the defendant, <em>Edmund Ruffin, </em>jr. to draw a deed, from <em>Thomas Woodlief </em>to <em>JYoel Quesnel, </em>for the <em>Sion Hill </em>tract of land; and did so. That the plaintiff requested him to read it, to him the said plaintiff, that he might compare it, with that drawn by col. <em>Davies, </em>which the plaintiff held in his hand ; and when the deponent had finished reading it, the plaintiff expressed his satisfaction with it; and said he liked it better than the one col. <em>Davies </em>had drawn. That when the deponent, in reading the deed to the plaintiff, came to the words \u201c 800 acres, <em>more or less,\u201d </em>the plaintiff asked <em>Thomas Woodlief, </em>if there should not be the full quantity of 800 acres, he would make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>a deduction from the purchase money, for whatever land might be wanting? To w'hich <em>Woodlief </em>answered, he would, if the plaintiff would pay for whatever surplus land there might be at the rate of <em>\u00a34 </em>per acre. That the deponent wrote the bonds, or great part of them, for the purchase <em>money; </em>saw them executed; and heard the plaintiff express no desire, to have the land surveyed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-9\"><em>James Campbell. </em>That, on <em>Quesnel\u2019s </em>telling him and his partner Wheeler, that he had purchased <em>Sion Hill, </em>they advised him to consult col. <em>Davies; </em>and have a proper right made to him. That <em>Quesnel </em>told them \u201cthe tract contained 800 acres; but as it was an <em>old survey, </em>he supposed it would contain more land, having been told that was common in <em>old surveys.\u201d </em>That some time afterwards, <em>Quesnel, Woodlief </em>and <em>Rufjin, </em>jr. called at <em>Campbell fy Wheeler\u2019s </em>store, about the land, and the tract was said to contain 800 acres; but that there might be <em>more or less ; </em>and the first was most probable.

That <em>Quesnel, </em>at that time, informed him, there was <em>computed </em>to be 800 acres of land ; but being an <em>old survey, </em>it was expected to contain more, as he understood such surveys generally contained more than the grant expressed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-11\"><em>John H.

That, after it had been discovered by <em>Harris\u2019s </em>survey, that there was a deficiency in the land, the deponent heard <em>Quesnel </em>say, he had bought <em>Sion Hill </em>for 800 acres, <em>more or less.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-12\"><em>Francis </em>Eppes.

The circumstances, which took place, at <em>Ruffin\u2019s, </em>when the deeds were executed, shew that there was a misgiving, in the mind of <em>(\u00bfuesnel, </em>as to the quantity; and that, bereft of the aid of his counsel, he fell a victim to the influence of his adversaries.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-6\">But, if there was no actual fraud, there was, at least, misrepresentation without guilt ; that is to say, such a representation as, though not fraudulently made, misled the appellant; and that produces the same consequences. For the purchaser acted under delusion, and contracted under ignorance of the true circumstances : Which ought to have been unfolded to him, and opportunity given to consult his counsel. But as this was not done, he is not precluded from relief; for the deficiency in the land is excessive; and he ought not to have been exposed to the hazard of it, with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>out all the time to deliberate and consult his counsel, which a man, in his isolated situation, had a right to require.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Agq\">Besides, there was a concealment of an important fact; for <em>Quesnel </em>was not apprized of the sale of the sixty acres, by the sheriff, for the taxes : And whether this arose from design, or inadvertence, will make no difference; for either way, it was a fact, which <em>Quesnel </em>was interested in knowing; and therefore, he ought to have been informed of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2H\">But waving all this, and coming to the actual contract between the parties: <em>Quesnel </em>alledges, that he meant to give <em>\u00a3 </em>3200 for eight hundred acres; and that he never intended to pay that sum for less: Which is hot contradicted by any testimony in the cause : for if he did not agree, at Ruffin\u2019s, to <em>Woodlief\u2019s </em>offer to survey, he did not disagree; and the insertion of the words <em>more or less </em>in the deed, is not important, for they are the usual language in all conveyances, and are cqnfined to small deficiencies.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-7\">The diminution of the land is so great, that it produced such an inadequacy in the contract, that, if there had been no deed, a specific performance, upon a bill filed by the vendor, would not have been decreed, without a correspondent deduction from the purchase money : And the conveyance is but a- form, which only changes the plaintiff into a defendant, but does not bar the equity; for the same principle exists, and entitles the vendee to relief, notwithstanding the deed. 2 <em>Ves. 155.

For there is not the slightest proof of any deception. <em>Woodlief </em>never spoke of any thing, but the <em>Sion </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number><em>Hill </em>tract: which he honestly believed to be more than 800 .... .... . , acres; advertised it, as containing <em>about </em>that quantity; and offered to survey it, which <em>Quesnel </em>declined. The execution of the deeds was mutually voluntary; and <em>Quesnel </em>was under no embarrassment; for the whole subject had been previously discussed and settled in Blandford, after a conversation between himself, <em>Ruffin </em>and col. <em>Davies, </em>relative to the nature of the contract, and the provisions of the deeds: And he met, according to his own appointment, at the house of <em>Ruffin, </em>to execute those that were to be drawn by that gentleman; which arc as well and faithfully drawn, as any counsel could have drawn. Nor did he ask for time to deliberate, or consult his counsel, but declared himself better satisfied with them, than with those prepared by col. <em>Davies; </em>which he held in his hand, and compared with the new deeds, prior to the execution thereof. After which, it is in vain to say, that he was imposed upon, or that he stood in need of time to deliberate, or consult his counsel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-8\">Neither <em>was there </em>any misrepresentation. For the whole communication on the part of <em>Woodlief </em>was, that it was the ancient family seat, which had been held for a long succession of generations, under the old survey; and the whole of this proves to be true. Under these circumstances, and with a full knowledge of every thing, <em>Quesnel </em>purchased upon his own view of the area; for the bill interrogates the defendants, whether the plaintiff was \u201c shewn the boundary lines of the tract of land, previous to his purchase ?\u201d And the answer of <em>Woodlief, </em>which is responsive in that respect, expressly states, \u201c that the complainant went over the land, seemed well satisfied both with the quality and <em>quantity, </em>and rejected the offer of having it surveyed, as had been proposed by the respondent; and has since declared, in the presence of several persons, that he thought, <em>from the boundaries, </em>that there must be a greater number than eight hundred acres.\u201d He purchased, therefore, upon his own judgment, after an inspection of the premises, the extent of the boundaries, and a perfect knowledge of every thing relating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>to them, which it was in the power of the vendor to communicate. This, necessarily, bound him ; for it is a general rule of law, that when the vendee purchases upon his own judgment, after a view of the subject to be sold, the vendor is not responsible for defects, 2 <em>Esp. Nis. Pri. </em>629, cites <em>Chandelor </em>v. <em>Lopus, </em>Cro. Jac. 4.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-6\">There was no concealment on the part of <em>Woodlief, </em>who disclosed every thing he knew. 1. Because the 60 acres of land, sold by the sheriff for taxes, were not part of the <em>Sion Hill </em>tract, but of the 130 acres sold to <em>Peter Wood-lief. </em>Besides, the sale was utterly void, on account of the irregularity in conducting it: for it was not duly advertised, nor made upon the premises, in the presence of the high sheriff; and there was personal property enough to pay the taxes. <em>Jlcts October Session </em>1787, <em>ch. </em>42. 2. Because it is proved, that the <em>Deep Bottom, </em>tract, <em>Stainback\u2019s </em>70 acres, and the 130 acre tract, were not part of the <em>Sion Hill </em>tract. The two first never; the last for a short time only; and excepted in the deed from <em>Woodlief </em>to <em>Quesnel, </em>being at that time the residence of <em>Peter Woodlief, </em>as <em>Stainback\u2019s </em>deposition proves; and which, therefore, the plaintiff must have seen, when he inspected the land, before his purchase.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-7\">There has been no departure from the contract: which the plaintiff, as before observed, enjoys, precisely, as he made it, 1. Because <em>Ragsdale, Campbell, Fitzgerald </em>and <em>Eppes </em>prove that he purchased the land, for 800 acres, <em>more or less; </em>and the two first, that <em>he declined, </em>a survey, when it was offered him; at the time of executing the deeds. <em>Wheeler, </em>too, says, that, on the day that he and <em>Campbell </em>advised him to consult col. <em>Davies, </em>he reasoned upon the probability of an excess, from its being an old survey. 2. Because the deed of mortgage, drawn by col. <em>Davies, </em>is for 800 acres, \u201c <em>more or less,\u201d </em>without any provision for a deduction from the purchase money, in case of a deficiency of the land; and he must have drawn it according to directions; which is corroborated, by the confidence which he says, in his deposition, <em>Quesnel </em>afterwards shewed, as to the quantity. 3. Because the deed, to the plaintiff, executed at <em>Ruffin\u2019s, </em>is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>also for \u201c <em>more or less;\u201d </em>without any provision for deduction, from the price, in case there were not 800 acres : And it was accepted hy <em>Quesnel, </em>after a discussion whether there should be any such deduction, and after his declining to accept the offer of a survey. <em>4. </em>Because the whole proceedings shew, that the plaintiff purchased according to the old survey, and the long possession of the <em>Sion Hill </em>family under it. It is no objection, that the original survey is not produced, because it was not called for by the bill, and the title to the land was not controverted; nor could have been controverted after a possession, which the bill states to have been upwards of a hundred years. The argument of the appellant\u2019s counsel, upon the words <em>more or less, </em>has no weight; for whatever may be their effect in common deeds, they were meant, upon the present occasion, to exclude responsibility for quantity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-4\">The supposed inadequacy of the contract has no influence. For it is not true, that <em>Quesnel </em>would not have been compelled to a specific performance, without a deduction from the purchase money: because it was a bargain of hazard, and fair upon both sides. If the land held out more than 800 acres, the purchaser was to gain; if it fell short of that quantity, he was to lose. It was what the civilians call <em>Emptio spei; </em>that is to say, it was a purchase of the contingency as to the excess ; which, according to several authorities, is a good ground of contract; for the hazard is mutual ; and, if there be a full disclosure of the circumstances, as there was in this case, neither can complain.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-5\">The supposed inequality of the situation of the parties has no weight. For, in point of fact, <em>Quesnel </em>was the more sagacious man of the two. He spoke English intelligibly; and wrote it better than <em>Woodlief </em>could, as the papers written by him, in the record, shew.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-6\">The alledged defect of title consists in the supposed lien for the personal legacies, but <em>Ruffin\u2019s </em>answer affirms that he knows most of them have been paid; and the bill only states, that the plaintiff is informed, that \u201c <em>one of the legacies\u201d </em>remains unsatisfied. The suit of <em>Cox </em>is neither re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>ferred to in the proceedings, nor is it certified to be still depending ; and therefore the probability is that it has been discharged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b254-9\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b254-10\">Lyons, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AoqB\">delivered the resolution of the court as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">The bill charges, that a fraud was practised upon the plaintiff, in the sale of a tract of land called <em>Sion Hill; </em>which it asserts the defendant <em>Woodlief, </em>fraudulently misrepresented, as containing 800 acres, although he knew that to be more than was actually comprehended in the tract at that time, as several parcels had been previously conveyed to other persons, without that fact being disclosed to <em>Quesnel, </em>who purchased under a belief that there were actually 800 acres; but that upon a survey, since made, there appears to be much less. The fraud and misrepresentation are denied by the answers; and the evidence does not support the allegations of the bill with respect thereto; but proves clearly, that the parcels conveyed were not parts of the original <em>Sion Hill </em>tract; which was the estate <em>Woodlief </em>contracted to sell; and which there is every reason to believe, he actually thought contained, at least, 800 acres. For the land had been the family seat for ages, and <em>Woodlief </em>supposing it to be held under an old survey, which he and his predecessors had always estimated to comprehend 800 acres, advertised it as containing about that quantity; and <em>Quesnel </em>relying upon those circumstances, purchased it, under a belief, that there were that number of acres in the tract. Both parties, therefore, appear to have acted innocently ; and there is, consequently, no cause for relief, upon the ground, either of fraud or misrepresentation. But, as both vendor and vendee proceeded under <em>mistalce, </em>each believing that the tract, certainly, contained 800 acres, and perhaps more; that constitutes a proper ground for relief in equity : which adjusts and equalizes contracts, according to the exigencies of the case. The mistake, therefore, ought to be rectified, and a deduction made from the purchase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>money, proportioned to the deficiency of the land. But, as ... . lit \u00abti the original survey is not produced, the court is unable ascertain, what the real quantity contained in the <em>Sion Hill </em>tract was, further than the record shews; and, by <em>that, </em>the survey, made under the direction of the court of chancery, reduces it to 608 acres, 1 rood, and 13 perches: which is too great a loss for a purchaser to sustain, under an agreement for an <em>estimated </em>quantity, notwithstanding the words <em>\u201c more or less,\u201d </em>inserted in the deed; which ought to be restricted to a reasonable, or usual, allowance, for small errors in surveys, and for a variation in instruments. A correspondent deduction, from the purchase money, is consequently to be made. And <em>Quesnel </em>ought moreover to be indemnified against the claim of <em>Cox </em>and wife, and all other existing incumbrances, if any : which is not only agreeable to the general principles of equity, but the deed of <em>Woodlief </em>to the plaintiff, expressly covenants, that he has a good title; and that he will make further assurance, and defend it. So that there was no necessity, as the appellees\u2019 counsel contended, to suggest that suit, or any incumbrance, specifically in the bill; for a reasonable apprehension, appearing at the trial, was, upon the principles of <em>quia timet, </em>sufficient. In conformity to these ideas, the following decree has been prepared by the judges, and is to be entered as the judgment of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">\u201c The court is of opinion, that the appellee <em>Woodlief, </em>not having surveyed the tract of land in the bill mentioned called <em>Sion Hill, </em>before he advertised the same for sale, or sold it to the appellant, but that <em>supposing </em>there had been an old survey, which he has not produced, or referred to, and does not appear in the proceedings in this cause, under which the land had been long held, as he suggested, by the former proprietors of the said land, and estimated, <em>by them and him, </em>as containing eight hundred acres, he advertised it as containing about that quantity, and the appellant was thereby induced to purchase it, <em>expecting </em>it would contain that full quantity; and the appellee <em>Woodlief </em>having, afterwards, asserted his <em>belief </em>thereof, occasioned the appellant to accept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>of a deed for the same as containing eight hundred acres, 7 , \u201e , j 1 <em>more or less, </em>and it appearing irom the survey made by <em>Robert Turnbull </em>and returned to the high court of chancery, pursuant to an order of the said court, in this cause made, for ascertaining the exact quantity of land in the said tract called <em>Sion Hill, </em>that the same contains only six hundred and eight acres, one rood and thirteen perches, <em>so that both parties were mistaken </em>in the quantity and number of acres contracted for, the said <em>mistake </em>ought to be rectified in a court of equity, and the appellant allowed a deduction, from the price agreed by him to be given for the said land, for the deficiency in quantity, that deficiency being too great for a purchaser to lose under an agreement for a <em>reputed </em>quantity, notwithstanding the words, <em>\u2018 more or less,\u2019 </em>inserted in the said deed, which should be restricted to a reasonable, or usual, allowance, for small errors in surveys and for variations in instruments; the value of the deficiency, when ascertained \u25a0 under the direction, and to the satisfaction of, the said high court of chancery, to be deducted from his bonds for the purchase money in the hands of the appellees <em>Woodlief </em>and <em>Ruffin, </em>or either of them, if sufficient to satisfy the same; and, if more than sufficient, the injunction to be dissolved for the residue, but if not sufficient, the appellee' <em>Woodlief </em>to be decreed to refund it, with interest^ and also to secure and indemnify the appellant from the suit and claim of <em>John Cox </em>and <em>Hannah </em>his wife, in the proceedings mentioned, and from all charges or incumbrances <em>on </em>the said land made by himself, or by any other person or persons, from or under whom he derives his title to the said land, before the said injunction be dissolved ; and that the said decree is erroneous : Therefore it is decreed and ordered that the same be reversed and annulled; and that the appellees pay to the appellant his <em>costs by </em>him expended in the prosecution of his appeal aforesaid here; and it is ordered that the cause be remanded, to the said court of chancery, for a final decree to be entered therein, according to the principles of this decree.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
