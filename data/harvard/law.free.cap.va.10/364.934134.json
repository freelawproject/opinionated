No part of the purchase money being paid, an arrangement is made by an agent of the vendor <em>with the </em>vendee\u2019s devisee, by which she is to have the lot during her life, and the vendor is to have the reversion. The vendor then, for value received, sells the lot to another person, to whom he executes a bond to make him a deed, with a reservation of the life estate of the devisee. After this, the agent who had made the arrangement with that devisee, procures from her an assignment to himself of the title bond originally executed to her devisor. He obtains the assignment without agreeing to give her any consideration but that already provided for her, to wit, the life estate, and he obtains it with full knowledge of the sale to the second vendee, and of his having paid the purchase money. The same agent deals also with the second vendee. He does not communicate to the second vendee the fact of the arrangement made by him, on behalf of the vendor, with the first vendee\u2019s devisee, but represents the bond to the first vendee as being still valid, and as taking from the vendor all right to convey the lot to the second vendee; and the second vendee, in ignorance or misapprehension of his rights, makes to the agent an assignment, for a pecuniary consideration, of the title bond executed to him by the vendor. Held, 1. the arrangement made by the agent, on behalf of his principal, with the devisee of the first vendee, cannot be defeated by that agent for his own benefit, and the assignment to him by the devisee gives him no right whatever; and 2. the ignorance or misapprehension under which the assignment was made by the second vendee, having been produced in some measure by the declarations and conduct of the assignee during the negotiation, the claim under that assignment is also unsustainable.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-6\">On the 16th of January 1811, <em>William Robinson junior </em>executed a writing under his hand and seal, whereby he acknowledged that he was bound to <em>Arge Allen to </em>convey to him in fee simple the out lot numbered two, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>in <em>Parkersburg, </em>upon his payment of the purchase money specified in his two notes of equal date therewith, for 94 dollars 37 cents each, one payable the 1st of September 1811, the other the 1st of September 1812.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-4\"><em>Arge </em>or <em>Argy Allen </em>was a coloured man, and lived upon the lot mentioned in this obligation, when he made his will, on the 5th of November 1829.

The papers will shortly be prepared.\u201d On the 27th of October 1831, <em>Jackson </em>wrote to <em>Robinson </em>as follows : \u201c Agreeably to your directions, I have made an arrangement with the widow and devisee of <em>Argy Allen </em>as to the lot he purchased, and she has executed a deed to release and reconvey the lot to you, on your executing to her a lease for life for the lot.

He obtained possession of the title bond from <em>Robinson </em>to <em>Arge Allen, </em>with an indorsement thereon under the hand and seal of <em>Jenny Allen, </em>stating that, for value received, she assigned and set over to <em>John J.

The declaration and notice were served before September term 1833 of <em>Wood </em>circuit court. <em>Jane Allen </em>and <em>John J. Jackson </em>were the defendants. At April term 1835, the jury found a verdict for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>plaintiff, subject to the reservation contained in the deed of <em>Robinson and wife </em>to <em>Gibbons, </em>in favour of <em>Jane Allen, </em>Judgment was rendered accordingly, and a writ of possession awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-4\">Thereupon, <em>Jackson </em>filed his bill on the chancery side of the court, setting forth the sale to and possession of <em>Argy Allen; </em>stating that the two notes mentioned in his title bond were left in the hands of <em>Thomas Neale </em>deceased, who for several years acted as the agent of <em>Robinson; </em>and charging that <em>Neale </em>received of <em>Argy Allen, </em>in part of the said notes, to the amount of 160 dollars or upwards. The bill states that the notes have been lost, and the complainant does not know whether the amount paid was credited or not. After mentioning the devise to <em>Jenny Allen, </em>and her assignment to the complainant, for which he says he secured to her a valuable consideration, he states that under the said assignment he entered into possession, intending to pay off to <em>Robinson </em>the balance due on the notes, and procure a deed, should he be mistaken in a point of law, on which, until the term of court just ended, he had not supposed there could be any doubt, <em>viz. </em>that <em>Allen </em>and his devisee having the uninterrupted possession of the lot for 20 years, there was brought to such a possession the legal title. The title bond from <em>Robinson </em>to <em>Gibbons </em>is afterwards mentioned, and it is charged that both <em>Gibbons </em>and <em>Robinson </em>well knew, when the same was executed, that <em>Jane Allen </em>was living on the said lot. The bill then proceeds as follows : \u201c Your orator further charges that after the said <em>Gibbons </em>returned from <em>Pittsburg, </em>your orator suffered him to cut and remove some very large trees that stood on the said lot, as he . had others which were obstructing the view between your orator\u2019s house and the river. But the said <em>Gibbons </em>being about to sell a part of the said lot to <em>Tarlton Brovm, </em>and the said <em>Brown </em>being about to erect a house on said lot, your orator interfered and forbade the build<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>ing of the said house, and called on the said <em>Gibbons, </em>gave him a copy of the title bond and assignment, explained to him the title of your orator, and also added that your orator did not attach much importance to the lot, except that part of it which was immediately in front of your orator\u2019s house, and to that he attached no other importance except to prevent any person building to intercept the view of the river in front of your orator\u2019s house, and that if he would bind himself that no building should be put up on that part of it in front of your orator\u2019s house, your orator would give him the benefit of the contract he had made with Jame <em>Allen; </em>and told the said <em>Gibbom </em>to take copies of your orator\u2019s papers, submit them to counsel, and give him an answer the next evening; giving him 24 hours to decide. Your orator charges that the matter rested so until the 26th of February 1833, when the said <em>Gibbom </em>came to the office of your orator, and after a great deal of desultory conversation, informed your orator that he did not care any thing like as much for the lot as he had done; that he had contemplated to build on it, but had altered his mind; that he was looking for mr. <em>Dodge, </em>to whom he owed a considerable sum of money; and he proposed to your orator, that if your orator would give him his money that he had paid, and interest, and his expenses to <em>Pittsburg, </em>he would relinquish his claim to your orator. After some reflection and conversation, your orator informed him that for the sake of peace, <em>and to prevent hard thoughts, </em>he would do it. The assignment was then written, and presented to <em>Gibbons </em>for signature. He insisted on some alteration : it was made. The paper was then given to <em>Gibbons </em>for signature. Your orator went to the house for the money. When he returned, <em>Gibbons </em>had signed it, and he paid <em>Gibbom </em>the amount he had paid <em>Robinson, </em>the interest, and his expenses to <em>Pittsburg. </em>He heard no more on the subject until April, when, the value of property, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>the estimation of some, having undergone a considerable improvement, <em>Gibbons </em>applied to your orator to rescind the contract. Your orator declined. He then instituted an action of ejectment.\u201d <em>Gibbons </em>and <em>Robinson </em>are made defendants. The prayer is, that the complainant may have a decree for the legal title, on the bond to Alen, or on the assignment from <em>Gibbons; </em>that <em>Gibbons </em>be injoined from enforcing his judgment; that he be decreed to convey whatever title he has, to the complainant; and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-4\">The injunction was awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-5\"><em>Gibbons </em>answered, denying that <em>Neale </em>was the agent of <em>Robinson </em>in the matter of the lot, or in any other matter connected with this transaction. <em>Argy Allen </em>never pretended that he had paid, either to <em>Robinson </em>or his agent, any money on account of the lot. His complaint was that he had deposited with <em>Neale </em>some part of the money, to be by him paid over to <em>Robinson </em>or his agent, and that this had not been done, and he would lose the money. At that time <em>Jacob Beeson </em>was the agent of <em>Robinson. </em>After <em>Beeson\u2019s </em>death, the complainant became either a general or special agent of <em>Robinson </em>respecting these town lots, or at least gave out that he was. The agency of the complainant in rescinding the contract between <em>Robinson </em>and <em>Argy Alen </em>is then detailed, and it is charged that the assignment by <em>Jenny Mien </em>to the complainant was antedated, and that for it no other consideration was given to <em>Jenny Allen </em>than what <em>Robinson </em>had before provided for her. What transpired after the respondent went to <em>Pittsburg </em>for the purpose of buying the property, is stated by him as follows : \u201cAfter purchasing it, he returned to <em>ParJcersburg, </em>and not getting his deed as soon as promised, he became uneasy and somewhat alarmed about it. The complainant, who owned the property on the opposite side of the street, finding out that this respondent was about putting up a building upon the lot, came to him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>and claimed the lot as his own, affirming in <em>strong </em>and solemn language that <em>Robinson </em>had no power to sell the same, that <em>Argy Allen </em>had bought the property, and that he had bought <em>Argy Allen's </em>right to it, which was a good and indefeasible right, and would hold the property in spile of <em>Robinson; </em>and further intimated, in pretty strong terms, that the bond given by <em>Robinson </em>to respondent was valueless, not being binding, and expressed great doubts whether <em>Robinson </em>would ever refund to respondent the purchase money for the lot which he had received, and at the same time proposed to this respondent, as a matter of favour, that he would endeavour to get back the money from <em>Robinson </em>for him. This respondent, being a man wholly unacquainted with law, and confidently relying upon the legal knowledge and opinion of the complainant (who is a lawyer of very high professional standing in <em>Rarlcersburg, Virginia, </em>the scene of these transactions, and a practitioner there) and also relying upon his representation of facts as to <em>Robinson's </em>want of means or inclination to refund the money paid him, and being also not a little influenced by a remark of complainant\u2019s, that he would not take the same trouble for any body else, nor would he do it for him, but for the respect he felt for the family, inasmuch as respondent\u2019s wife was a member of the same church to which he the complainant belonged\u2014or words to that effect,\u2014(and in truth the complainant was at that time a regular member in full communion with a certain class of Christians)\u2014this respondent, thus confidently relying upon the opinion thus expressed by him in relation to the bond of <em>Robinson, </em>in a legal point of view, and upon his morality and integrity as a man and a Christian, in his communication of facts, consented to receive back his money and yield the lot, and accordingly surrendered up the title bond of <em>Robinson </em>to him; upon which the complainant sat down to write the matter on the back of it, which this respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>dent not understanding, declined to sign; but on the complainant\u2019s representing to this respondent, that it was necessary for him to have something to shew <em>Robinson </em>that he had paid the money back to respondent, in order that he might get the money out of <em>Robinson, </em>whose agent he represented himself to be, your respon-^ dent signed the paper,\u2014not for the purpose to which it is now sought to be applied, <em>viz. </em>a transfer of his right to the lot, but simply for the purpose of furnishing complainant with the evidence, that he had, for and on account of <em>Robinson, </em>refunded back the money that he (Robinson) had received for the lot from respondent. Some months after this occurrence, the deed for the lot from <em>Robinson and </em>wife,to this respondent was brought down the river from <em>Pittsburg, </em>where it had been, some months before, duly executed, acknowledged and deposited for this respondent.\u201d The respondent then mentions circumstances which led him to take an unfavourable view of the complainant\u2019s conduct, and determined him to probe the matter. \u201c Accordingly\u201d (the answer proceeds) \u201c he called upon complainant, and mentioned to him the conversation had between them, the representations he had made to him, the fact of his not only suppressing the knowledge he had of the <em>Argy Allen </em>contract being abandoned, but also of his representing it as .a good, subsisting equitable title, indefeasible in equity,\u2014the fact of his not having drawn on <em>Robinson </em>for his money, and the fact of the arrival of his deed from <em>Robinson </em>for said lot, contrary to his expectations and complainant\u2019s representations; when, to his surprise, for the first time he learned that the writing that he had been prevailed on to sign was now said to be, not evidence that complainant had advanced money to respondent for <em>Robinson, </em>but an actual assignment of all respondent\u2019s right, title, interest and claim of, in and to the lot aforesaid.\u201d The respondent states that he then tendered to complainant the money he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>received of him, and demanded a surrender of the papers; but he refused to receive the former, or yield the latter; and thereupon the respondent brought his <em>. r . </em>action oi ejectment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-6\"><em>Robert S. Smith </em>deposed, that in 1825 or thereabouts, deponent went with <em>Samuel H. Fitzhugh </em>(who was appointed a receiver by the chancellor in a case between <em>Robinson </em>and <em>Doddridge) </em>to the residence of <em>Argy Allen; </em>when <em>Fitzhugh </em>told <em>Allen, </em>he had, as receiver, a claim against him for the purchase money for the lot. <em>Allen </em>replied, that he had paid <em>Thomas Neale </em>for the lot, but <em>Neale </em>had broken up, and he <em>{Allen) </em>had nothing to shew for the payment. <em>Fitzhugh </em>then told <em>Allen, </em>if he did not pay for the lot, he <em>{Fitzhugh) </em>would be obliged to bring a suit against him to recover the purchase money. <em>Allen </em>replied, he was not able to pay the money; and after some further conversation, it was agreed by <em>Fitzhugh </em>and <em>Allen, </em>that <em>Allen </em>should give up the lot. It was either so agreed, or else <em>Fitzhugh </em>proposed to <em>Allen </em>to give up the lot, to prevent a suit; but whether it was the one or the other that made the proposition, deponent does not distinctly recollect. At a subsequent period, in a conversation between <em>Robinson </em>and <em>Allen, </em>deponent being present, <em>Robinson </em>told <em>Allen, </em>that if he would give up the lot, he might retain possession of it as long as he lived ; and deponent says that <em>Allen </em>did live on the lot till the day of his death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-7\"><em>Benjamin Willard,, </em>a witness for the complainant, who drew the will of <em>Argy Allen, </em>deposed to <em>Allen's </em>conversations about the payments made by him; his saying that his widow, without the interposition of friends, might in her old age be deprived of a home; and his requesting the witness to use his best endeavours to effect the best practicable arrangement with <em>Robinson </em>for the benefit of his widow. <em>Willard </em>deposed that he, on behalf of <em>Jenny Allen, </em>had several interviews with <em>Jackson </em>as the agent of <em>Robinson, </em>and after the lapse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>more than a year from <em>Allen\u2019s </em>death, <em>Jackson </em>informed deponent that he had made the desired arrangement. Deponent was directed by <em>Jackson </em>to prepare a lease for the lot to <em>Jenny </em>during her life, to be executed by <em>Robinson, </em>upon the execution and return of which, <em>Jenny </em>was to execute a release to <em>Robinson </em>of all her right and title to the lot, to take effect from her death. The lease was prepared accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-4\">It bore date the first of October 1831, and, after mentioning the purchase by <em>Argy Alien, </em>the two obligations executed by him, and the devise to his widow, states that he \u201c departed this life on the 28th day of June 1830, leaving said obligations unsatisfied and unpaid, thereby constituting a good and valid lien on said lot in favour of said <em>Robinson.\u201d </em>The grant to <em>Jenny Allen </em>is of lot No. 2. during her life, yielding to <em>Robinson, </em>yearly during the term, the yearly rent of 25 cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-5\"><em>Willard </em>deposed that the lease so prepared was submitted to the inspection of <em>Jackson </em>some time in October 1831, and by his direction deposited with <em>A.

Deponent kept the papers for some time, and in the fall of 1834 returned them to <em>John J.

About <em>Creel\u2019s </em>right to this lot, <em>Robinson </em>seems to have wanted information; and this probably was what caused the delay in executing the papers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-9\">The complainant acknowledged that the assignment of the title bond from <em>Jenny </em>to him was made after he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>heard that <em>Gibbons </em>had purchased the lot. This acknowledgment was written at the foot of <em>Willard\u2019s </em>deposition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aiou\"><em>Willard </em>deposed that he procured the assignment at the request of <em>Jackson. </em>There was no money paid, but <em>Jackson </em>executed a covenant, by which he guarantied <em>to Jenny, </em>during her life, that part of the .lot on this side of <em>Pond </em>run.

Hutcheson, </em>taken by the deponent, detailed a conversation at <em>Pittsburg </em>between the deponent and mrs. <em>Robinson, </em>which the deponent, on his return, repeated to <em>Gibbons. </em>The object of the complainant in taking this deposition was, to infer from the conversation, that there was reason at the time to doubt whether <em>Gibbons </em>would get a deed, and that this, together with the length of the time which had elapsed since the deed was to have been sent, was the cause of his making the arrangement with the complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-7\"><em>Tarlton Brown </em>proved <em>Jackson\u2019s </em>offer to relinquish his right, if <em>Gibbons </em>would bind himself not to put up a building above the upper end of <em>Jenny\u2019s </em>lot, in front of his <em>house; </em>and that <em>Gibbojis </em>took a copy of the title bond from <em>Robinson </em>to <em>Argy Allen, </em>to see if it was a good one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-8\"><em>Iruther Edgerton </em>detailed a conversation, in his store, between <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Gibbons.

Jackson </em>further said, that if <em>Gibbons </em>would transfer the bond to him, he would pay him <em>Gibbons </em>the money he had paid to <em>Robinson, </em>and run the risk of getting it back from <em>Robinson. </em>During this conversation, deponent believes <em>Jackson </em>said in substance, that <em>Robinson </em>had no right to make a deed, as he had parted with all his right to old <em>Argy, </em>and that consequently <em>Robinson\u2019s </em>bond to <em>Gibbons </em>was good for nothing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-4\"><em>John Cross </em>deposed that he brought to <em>Gibbons </em>the deed from Robinson, in the beginning of April 1833; and when <em>Robinson gave </em>the deed to deponent, he stated that it had been ready some time, but he had no previous opportunity to send it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-5\"><em>Edgerton, </em>in his deposition, after detailing the conversation already mentioned, testified that subsequently thereto, and before May 1833, another conversation between the same parties took place. <em>Gibbons </em>being in the store of deponent, <em>Jackson </em>came in, when <em>Gibbons </em>told <em>Jackson </em>he had received his deed from <em>Robinson, </em>and wished to get the bond back from him <em>Jackson.

His claim to the relief he sought was twofold : <em>first, </em>as assignee of a title bond of <em>Robinson </em>to <em>Argy Allen, </em>under an assignment of that bond to him by <em>Jenny Allen </em>the devisee of <em>Argy; secondly, </em>as assignee of an obligation of <em>Robinson </em>to the appellant for the conveyance of the lot in question, under an assignment <em>of </em>that obligation by the appellant. The suit, having regard to either ground of claim, is essentially one for the specific performance of a contract, and the principles which guide the discretion of courts of equity in giving or withholding relief in such cases, should govern in ascertaining the relief that ought to be administered in this. One of those principles, and a fundamental one, is, \u201c that <em>the </em>contract must be certain, fair, and just in all its parts; and if any of these ingredients be wanting in the case, the court will not decree a specific performance.\u201d <em>Buxton </em>v. <em>Lister, </em>3 Atk. 385. <em>Ellard </em>v. <em>Ld. Llandaff, </em>1 Ball &amp; Beatty 241. Under the influence of this rule, the aid of the court to enforce the performance of contracts has been refused w'here material facts have been concealed, or where the defendant resisting the execution of the contract entered into it under a mistake or material misapprehension of his rights, or of facts affecting those rights, especially if the plaintiff had had any agency in causing that mistake or misapprehension. <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>1 Russell &amp; Mylne 527. 4 Cond. Eng. Ch. Rep. 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>The appellee had no title to relief under the assignment he procured from the devisee of <em>Argy Allen, </em>of the title bond given by <em>Robinson </em>to <em>Argy Allen. </em>This is perfectly clear, and is conceded by his counsel. But still it is proper to take a brief view of that claim, because of the light it reflects on the situation of the parties to the other assignment, and the consequent influence it may have on the title to relief under that assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">In support of the claim under the assignment of <em>Jenny Allen, </em>the appellee, by his bill, suggests that about 150 dollars of the purchase money had been paid, and that he had given a valuable consideration for the assignment. There is, however, no proof, or attempt at proof, of the payment of one dollar of the purchase money. The evidence in the record distinctly shews that the appellee was agent of <em>Robinson, </em>and in pursuance of instructions from <em>Robinson, </em>had, in the fall of the year 1831, made an agreement with <em>Jenny Allen </em>for the surrender of the title bond, in consideration of a life estate to her in the lot. Though the evidence does not distinctly ascertain that this contract was carried into execution, yet it does not shew that there had been any rescission of it. In August 1832, <em>Robinson, </em>in his contract with the appellant, recognizes a contract with <em>Jenny Allen, </em>and treats it as one executed by him : and when the appellee obtained the assignment from <em>Jenny Allen, </em>he confessedly had full notice of the contract of <em>Robinson </em>with the appellant, and <em>Jenny Allen </em>agreed to receive, for the surrender or assignment of the title bond, the same consideration that <em>Robinson </em>had recognized as due and as having been secured to her. The stipulation of the appellee that she should have the consideration which had been provided for her in the contract of <em>Robinson </em>and the appellant, is all the consideration of the assignment to the appellee, and therefore, in effect, none passed from him. The entire con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>sideration was already provided for her, and came from <em>Robinson. </em>The appellee, <em>too, </em>was the agent of <em>Robinson, </em>who had been charged with the duty of bargaining for the surrender of <em>Jenny Allen's </em>interest. This being so, the assignment by her of the title bond enured to the benefit of <em>Robinson. </em>If <em>Robinson </em>had not sold to the appellant, I think it clear that he could have successfully resisted the claim of the appellee under the assignment of <em>Jenny Allen. A fortiori, </em>that resistance could be made by a purchaser from <em>Robinson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The claim of the appellee under the assignment from the appellant is resisted by him, and he insists he ought to be absolved from his contract, on the ground (among others) that that assignment was procured from him under a misapprehension as to the right alleged by the appellee to exist under the title bond to <em>Argy Allen, </em>and the validity of that claim\u2014a misapprehension produced, as the appellant alleges, by the concealment or misrepresentation of the appellee. The evidence ascertains, beyond any reasonable doubt, that the appellee opposed to the claim of the appell\u00e1nt under his contract, the ostensible claim under the title bond of <em>Allen, </em>(of the assignment of which claim to the appellee, the appellant seems then to have had no notice;) that he insisted on the. validity of that claim, and endeavoured to impress on the mind of the appellant the conviction that it was valid, that <em>Robinson </em>could not make him a title, and that he was in danger of losing his money. The evidence as clearly ascertains that the appellant would not have transferred or given up to the appellee his contract with <em>Robinson, </em>but for the apprehension excited respecting the validity of the claim under the title bond to <em>Allen; </em>in producing which the appellee at least participated. The summary notice of the claim under the assignment of that title bond to the appellee has already shewn that that assignment, instead of reviving and aiding a hostile claim against <em>Robinson </em>or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>bis vendee, had, in point of law and equity, extinguished it, except to the extent that it was recognized and admitted by the contract between the appellant and <em>Robinson ; </em>and no one can doubt that had this been known to the appellant when he made the assignment to the appellee, that contract would not have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">\"Without adverting to other objections urged by the appellant to the relief sought by the appellee, and canvassing the law or evidence on which they rest, what has been said presents a case in which a decree for specific performance ought not to be rendered against the appellant. He ought, however, to return the money he has received from the appellee, because his justified resistance to the execution-of his contract leaves the appellee without the consideration for which it was paid. It occurred to me at one time, that the court might and ought to make provision, in this case, to secure the repayment of that money to the appellee. But further reflection has satisfied me that it is neither necessary nor proper: not necessary, because the appellee has a plain and adequate remedy at law to recover it: not proper, because he had not come into equity for that redress; and that being the only claim which, in the view that has been taken of the case, the appellee has on the appellant, if he had asserted that claim only, there would have been no occasion to resort to a court of equity for redress, nor was that the proper forum in which to seek it.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">I am of opinion that the decree of the court below is erroneous, and ought to be reversed, and instead thereof a decree rendered dismissing the appellee\u2019s bill, and that the appellant recover his costs in this court and the court below.</p>\n<author id=\"b403-6\">Cab\u00e9ll, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AmL\">The appellee\u2019s bill, in one of its aspects, is a bill for specific execution. In all such cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>the application is addressed to the discretion of the <em>r L </em>court; and it is a settled principle, that the plaintiff, to entitle himself to relief, must come in with clean hands and be free from all imputation. He must not have been guilty of any material misrepresentation or suppression of the truth in relation to the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"AzE\"><em>Robinson </em>sold the lot in controversy to <em>Argy Allen </em>in the year 1811, and gave him a bond to make a title. <em>Argy Allen </em>made his will devising the lot to his widow <em>Jenny Allen, </em>and died in 1830, having never received a deed, or paid any part of the purchase money. After <em>Allen\u2019s </em>death, <em>Robinson </em>employed <em>Jackson </em>as his agent to make an arrangement with the widow and devisee of <em>Alen, </em>by which the sale was to be cancelled, and she was to release her interest in the lot to <em>Robinson, </em>on his executing to her a lease of the lot for life, reserving only a nominal rent. This arrangement was actually entered into and agreed upon, between <em>Jenny Allen </em>on the one part, and <em>Jackson, </em>as the agent of <em>Robinson, </em>on the other. It seems, however, not to have been carried into formal execution; the failure to do which is not accounted for in the evidence. But there is no reason \u2022 to believe that it was ever revoked, annulled or objected to by either party, except possibly that the life estate of <em>Jenny Allen </em>may have been subsequently restricted to a part only of the lot. It is clear that she never after-wards claimed any title to the inheritance, and that <em>Robinson, </em>considering himself as owner, sold the lot to <em>Gibbons, </em>received the purchase money, and gave a bond to execute a deed, \u201c with the reservation of the life estate granted by the said <em>Robinson </em>and wife to the widow of <em>Argy Allen.\u201d </em>After this, <em>Jackson, </em>with full knowledge of <em>Gibbons\u2019s </em>purchase and of his having paid the purchase money, procured from <em>Jenny Allen </em>an assignment to himself of the title bond which <em>Robinson </em>had originally executed to <em>Argy Allen. </em>For this assignment he gave no other consideration than his own covenant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>that he would secure to her, during her life, the enjoyment of a <em>part </em>of the lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">It is well established that an agent cannot make himself an adverse party to his principal. What then was the effect of this assignment to <em>Jackson </em>? Shall he be permitted to avail himself of it, so as to defeat, for his own benefit, an arrangement which he, as agent, had previously made for another ? Certainly not. The law regards the assignment as enuring to the benefit of his principal, <em>Robinson, </em>and those claiming under him, and gives it the same effect as if it had been made directly to him or them. <em>Jackson's </em>claim under this bond is therefore worthless.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">His claim under the assignment of the bond to <em>Gribbons </em>is equally unsustainable in a court of equity. It is manifest that this assignment was made by <em>Gibbons </em>in ignorance or misapprehension of his rights; that this ignorance or misapprehension was produced, in some measure at least, by the declarations and conduct of <em>Jackson </em>during the negotiation; and that he would not have made the assignment, had he not been thus misled. He represented the prior bond to <em>Argy Allen </em>as being still valid, and as taking from <em>Robinson </em>all right to convey the land to Gibbons, when he well knew that it could not subserve that purpose; and he failed to communicate the material fact of the arrangement, made by his own agency, by which that bond was to be cancelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">I am of opinion to reverse the decree, to dissolve the injunction, and to dismiss the <em>bill; </em>but without prejudice to any suit which <em>Jackson </em>may be advised to bring for the recovery of the money which he paid to <em>Gibbons.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b405-7\">Parker, <em>J. </em>and Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Aer\">concurring, decree reversed, injunction dissolved, and bill dismissed with . costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
