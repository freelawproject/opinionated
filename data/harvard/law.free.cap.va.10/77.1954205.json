The general replication is not sufficient; for there is a difference between a replication and a plea; the act of assembly allowing several matters to be contained in the latter, but not in the <em>former; </em>and a general replication to a special plea necessarily involves various distinct things. The court, therefore, cannot by any intendment aid him; for they will not presume that he meant to apply his general replication to any particular fact, when he has left the whole at large, and thereby the issue multifarious. 1 <em>Wash. </em>155. <em>2 Call, </em>379.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b93-7\">\n<em>Hay, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoU\">The replication denies all the facts contained in the plea; and that puts the parties at issue. <em>Co. Litt. 126. </em>The most that can be said against it is, that there is some irregularity in joining the issue : But that is not material after verdict. 2 <em>Wash. 1, </em>71, 364. 2 <em>Call, </em>514. Multifariousness in the issue is no objection : for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>defendant chose to rely on various matters of defence; and therefore, the plaintiff was obliged to negative the whole, either specially or generally; otherwise he would not have answered the plea; and it could make no difference, to the defendant, whether all his facts were denied together, or each one separately.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b94-5\"><em>Wickham, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkN\">The cases, cited by the counsel on the other side, do not apply; for, in them, the pleas had denied the whole declaration, and the replication operated merely as a <em>similiter </em>to maintain the declaration, and complete the issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b94-6\">\n<em>Cur. adv-i vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b94-7\">Lyons, President,</author>\n<p id=\"A72\">delivered the resolution of the court, that the <em>supersedeas </em>should be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
