N executed to B a bond with sureties living in Virginia, with condition to indemnify him against injury for having entered into the undertaking as surety for the said costs. In an action by B against N and his sureties, the records of the suits brought by N in South Carolina were offered in evidence by B, and were objected to on the ground that they showed that B had not become the surety at the date of the bond of N and his sureties to him. Held : That the defendants not showing that B was surety for N for costs in other cases, their bond must be held to refer to these suits; and they are estopped by their bond from denying that B was the surety of N at the time of its execution.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-10\">This is an action of covenant brought by Edward Burch against Charles Cordle, on two obligations of Josiah Holley and his sureties, of whom the defendant was one; by one of which obligations the obligors bound themselves to pay unto the plaintiff, Edward Burch of Chesterfield district in the state of South Carolina, whatever sum of money he might be compelled by law to pay for the said Josiah Holley, \u201c he, the said Burch having become the said Holley\u2019s security for costs in two suits instituted by the said Holley against Thomas Kirkley and John Squiers his security, of the district and state aforesaid;\u201d and by the other, after reciting that \u201cEdward Burch of Chesterfield district, state of South Carolina hath entered into bond for the costs that may accrue in certain cases wherein Josiah Holley is plaintiff and Thomas Kirkley and John Squiers are the defendants, in case the costs should fall on the said Holley in the said cases,\u201d the obligors bound themselves to indemnify the said Burch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>from any harm or injury that he might sustain from having entered into the bond aforesaid. The only plea was \u201c conditions performed,\u201d to which the plaintiff replied generally; and on the issue thereon joined, verdict and j udgment were rendered for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-4\">On the trial of the issue the plaintiff offered in evidence the two obligations aforesaid; and two transcripts of records of the Court of common pleas in the district of Chesterfield in the state of South Carolina, being the records of the two suits instituted by the said Nolley against the said Barkley and Squiers, and of the proceedings against the plaintiff Burch as security for costs in the said suits. From these records it appears that the suits were instituted in December 1829, a rule was made for security for costs in March, and renewed in September 1830, and the bond of Burch as such security bears date the 8th of March 1831; whereas the obligations executed for his indemnity bear date, one of them on the 15th of March, and the other on the 29th of July 1830. All of the six persons whose names- are signed to the first of these two obligations, are named as obligors in the last, but only three of them signed it. The last is a more formal instrument than the first, and seems to have been executed for that reason, as the object of each of them is the same. The defendant moved the court to exclude the said records from going in evidence, to the jury; because it appeared that the plaintiff had not in fact become the security of the said Nolley at the date of either of the said obligations, but had become so afterwards, as appeared by said records. But the court overruled the motion, and told the jury that in the absence of any proof to the contrary, they ought to regard the said records as evidence of the amount of costs which the plaintiff had paid for Nolley, and for which the defendant was liable to the plaintiff. The defendant excepted to this opinion ; which is the only error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>assigned in the judgment. There being a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff, Cordle applied to this court for a <em>supersedeas, </em>which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AvE\"><em>G. N.

There is no variance between the records and the obli.gations and declaration. The defendant offered no evidence of the existence of any other suits, or any other securityship for costs to which his obligations could refer; but rested his defence alone upon the ground that the bond by which the plaintiff became security for costs bears date <em>after </em>the date of the said obligations, which purport to be for the indemnity of the plaintiff against a <em>prior </em>securityship.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-14\">But though the obligations bear date, it does not follow that they were fully executed, before the bond. Delivery is necessary to the complete execution of a bond, which may not be delivered until long after its date, and will take effect from its delivery, not from its date. The date is <em>prima facie, </em>but not conclusive, evidence of its delivery at that time. The presumption may be repelled by other evidence. It is not unusual that a bond dated at one time and intended to be delivered at another, recites that the consideration has been received; when, in fact, it has not been received at the date, but is expected to be, at or before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>the delivery of the bond. The bond is considered as speaking at the time of its delivery, and not of its date. In such a case there is no incongruity; and if the consideration be received at or about the time of delivery, according to the intention and expectation of the parties, there can be no doubt as to the obligation of the bond on all the obligors, whether principals or sureties.</p>\n<p id=\"AY\">The circumstances strongly tend to show that this is precisely such a case; and well warranted the jury in so considering it. Holley, residing in Virginia, instituted two suits in South Carolina, and was required to give security for costs. He had friends in Virginia who would become his sureties, but not, it seems, in South Carolina. The plaintiff Burch residing in that state agreed to become his security on being indemnified by a bond with sureties residing in Virginia ; and accordingly the obligations aforesaid were given for his indemnity, and he became security for costs. It does not expressly appear when, or how, the obligations were delivered, nor whether delivered before, at the time, or after he became security for costs. They were signed in Virginia and delivered in South Carolina : Of course some time intervened between their date and delivery. They may have been sent by Holley to his attorney in the suit to be delivered to Burch on his entering into bond as security for costsf if he had not already done so. In natural order, the delivery of the obligations, would follow the .execution of the bond; and it is fair to presume, in the absence of proof to the contrary, that such was the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">But it is immaterial in what order the obligations were delivered and the bond .was executed. The whole was one continuous transaction. The substance of it plainly was that Burch agreed to become security for costs, and Holley agreed to indemnify him. Burch did become such security, and these obligations were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>delivered to him for his indemnity. It must be presumed that they were so delivered with the defendant\u2019s consent. He acknowledged in them that Burch had become security for costs, and is thereby estopped from denying the fact, or showing that it occurred after, instead of before, the obligations were executed. <em>Cecil </em>v. <em>Earley and others, supra </em>198, and <em>Cox, &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Thomas, &amp;c. </em>9 Gratt. 312, and cases cited in the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">I think the court did not err in refusing to exclude the said records from the jury, nor in giving the instruction which it did; and am therefore for affirming the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">The other judges concurred in the opinion of <em>Moncure, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
