The failure of the defendant to convey to <em>Hyer Jackson </em>the son of <em>Henry </em>is alleged, and from that failure is deduced the defendant\u2019s indebtedness for the 255 . dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-6\">The third count was also on the writing, but omits any mention of the lots, and claims the 255 dollars absolutely. A consideration is likewise averred in this count.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-7\">The fourth count was to the following effect: <em>\u201c </em>And for that also the said defendant, heretofore, to wit, on the 15th day of September 1835, at &amp;c. made and executed his certain other agreement in writing, and then and there signed and subscribed his abbreviated name of <em>C.

By means whereof the said defendant then and there became liable, among other things, to pay to the said plaintiff the said sum of 255 dollars in this count specified, according to the tenour and effect of said agreement, and being so liable, he the said defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>in consideration thereof, then and there, to wit, on &amp;c. at &amp;c. undertook and then and there faithfully promised him the said plaintiff to pay him the last mentioned sum of 255 dollars, when he should be thereunto afterwards requested.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-5\">The fifth count was substantially, and almost literally, the same as the fourth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-6\">The sixth count was precisely like the fourth and fifth, except that it described the agreement as one by which the defendant agreed to pay to the plaintiff the further sum of 255 dollars &amp;c.

Chitty on Bills 356. <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Da Costa, </em>3 Mau. &amp; Selw. 352. <em>Coombs </em>v. <em>Ingram, </em>4 Dow. &amp; Ry. 211. 16 Eng. Com. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Law Rep. 194. The cases cited on the other side were upon instruments of a different character. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Smith </em>was upon an assignment of a bond or note. <em>Beverleys </em>v. <em>Holmes </em>was on a written promise to pay <em>Augusta </em>bonds. <em>Moseley </em>v. <em>Jones </em>was on a written contract to deliver corn and pay money, and the form of the declaration does not appear.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b475-4\">(Before <em>Harrison </em>replied, <em>Stanard, </em>J. observed, that in <em>England </em>there is no action of debt on the note <em>per se. </em>The note is only evidence of debt. Here, debt lies on the note itself. And the question arises, whether this may not authorize the declaration in <em>assumpsit </em>to be framed in <em>Virginia </em>differently from what would otherwise be requisite.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b475-6\">Harrison, in reply. There is no distinction between a verbal promise and a promise in writing. A consideration is equally necessary to both. In England, promissory notes are placed on the footing of bills of exchange. Not so here.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b475-7\">Parker, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AHB\">The only question in this case arises upon the 4th, 5th and 6th counts, and it is only necessary to analyse one of them, all being liable to the same objection, <em>viz. </em>that no consideration for the promise is alleged. The fourth count avers that the defendant, on the 15th of September 1835, at &amp;c. executed his certain other agreement in.writing, undertaking to settle with <em>Thomas Bland </em>&amp;c. 320 dollars, and then to pay to the plaintiff the further sum of 255 dollars according to the tenour and effect of the said agreement, and being so liable, he the defendant, in consideration thereof, promised to pay to the plaintiff the lastmentioned sum of 255 dollars. Whether this count is defective or not, depends altogether on the question how far, in an action of <em>assumpsit </em>on a writing of this character, the plaintiff is bound to allege and prove a consideration for the promises and undertakings set forth in it. I am clearly of opinion he must do both.</p>\n<p id=\"AN7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>That in general the plaintiff who brings an action of <em>assumpsit </em>must state a consideration, no one doubts. But in <em>assumpsit </em>on a promissory note, it is said that no consideration need be averred and proved, because our act of assembly allows an action of <em>debt </em>to be brought on' the note itself, without laying or proving a consideration ; (see <em>Peasley </em>v. <em>Boatwright, 2 </em>Leigh 195. <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Daigh, 2 </em>Va. Cas. 521.) and it is supposed that this provision authorizes us to imply a consideration from the nature of the instrument, in the same manner that, in an action of <em>assumpsit </em>on a promissory note in <em>England, </em>a sufficient consideration is presumed. But there it is not owing to the form of the bill or note, nor to the circumstance of its being in writing, that the law gives it that effect, but because it is commercial paper. Chitty on Bills, p. 9. 10. Previous to the statute of <em>3 </em>and 4 Ann. c. 9. an action of debt could not be maintained on a promissory note, as of itself importing a debt, but the plaintiff was obliged to declare on the contract as in <em>assumpsit, </em>stating and proving the real consideration at large. By that statute, and \u201c to the intent to encourage trade and commerce,\u201d (which, says the preamble, \u25a0\u201c will be much advanced if such notes shall have the same effect as inland bills of exchange,\u201d) notes in writing promising to pay money were in all respects put upon the footing of inland bills; and after that, no question could arise concerning the necessity of alleging a consideration in any form of action upon them. It was a peculiar privilege conferred upon them by the force of the statute, that (as in bills of exchange) a sufficient consideration should be implied from the commercial nature of the instrument. But that does not seem to \u25a0me to be the effect of our act of 1730, 4 Hen. Stat. at \u2022large, p. -275. It simply allowed an <em>action </em>of debt on the note, to the end that the recovery of the money \u25a0\u201c might be rendered more easy.\u201d It did not change the nature of the instrument, nor give to it the charac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>ter of a bill of exchange; nor do I conceive it would have been impressed with that character, had the clause allowing discounts been omitted, unless it had been expressly assimilated to an inland bill, or other commercial paper. The only effect of the act seems to me to be, to allow a new form of action to be brought on the writing itself, namely, an action of debt, and, if that action is brought, to dispense with the averment or proof of consideration. If, however, debt is brought on the original contract, it is still necessary to shew a consideration to support it; and <em>a, fortiori </em>if <em>assumpsit </em>is brought, which is always on the original contract, the same consequence must follow. In the case of <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Daigh, </em>the judge delivering the opinion of the court declares expressly, that it was not intended to interfere with the action of <em>assumpsit; </em>and judge <em>Carr, </em>in <em>Peasley </em>v. <em>Boatwright, </em>carefully confines his observations to the action of debt: so that this case is one of the first impression in this court, although I am satisfied the general opinion of the profession has heretofore been, that in all actions of <em>assumpsit </em>brought in this state, except on bills of exchange and notes placed expressly on the same footing, it is necessary to aver and prove a consideration. The counsel for the appellee accounted for the omission in some of the counts in this declaration, by candidly avowing that it was because he feared no consideration could be proved; and the probability is that the verdict was obtained without such proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">There is another consideration entitled <em>to </em>weight in this cause. The <em>assumpsit\u25a0 </em>is brought upon an instrument promising to settle with the sheriff a certain sum of money, and to pay another sum to the plaintiff by having a credit for it with <em>Hyer Jackson </em>in the sale of lots. I doubt much whether any action of debt could be maintained on it. Certainly it could not be brought on the promise to settle with another; and as the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>are joined in this fourth count, it would seem that the-count could only be in <em>assumpsit, </em>unless two actions, one in <em>assumpsit </em>and the other in debt, could be brought on the same written agreement. In this respect it is very similar to the case of <em>Moseley </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>5 Munf. <em>23. </em>where the court decided that, the judgment was erroneous, there being no consideration laid in the declaration. It is, however, useless to enlarge on this point, since, on the other, I am of opinion that the demurrer to the 4th, 5th and 6th counts ought to have been sustained, and that, for overruling it, the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b478-4\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AVjO\">concurred. But Stanard and Cabell, <em>J. </em>being of a different opinion, and the court being thereby equally divided, the judgment was affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
