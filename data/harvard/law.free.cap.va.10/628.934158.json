And then he stated an account between mrs. <em>Woodcock </em>and <em>Dunbar, </em>wherein he charged her with such sums for which she was supposed to be liable to <em>Dunbar, </em>and credited her with the aggregate amount of the interest appearing due on his executorial account, and thus shewed a large balance due to her at the close of the transactions in 1816, on account of interest which he ought to have paid her, which balance was to bear interest from that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b656-5\">There were <em>seven </em>exceptions taken by the plaintiff to the commissioner\u2019s state of the account between mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number><em>Woodcock </em>and <em>Dunhar. </em>But only the first and fifth of them involved questions of law, and these only need be stated; the others presented mere questions of fact.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AmTC\">The <em>first </em>exception was to a charge against mrs. <em>Woodcock </em>of 1424 dollars, on account of crops left by the testator <em>Woodcock </em>on hand at the time of his death, which she took and appropriated to her own use.\u2014The following was the state of facts touching the point: The testator left crops of grain on hand, much more than sufficient for consumption at home, and of course the greater part was intended for market. Of the crop of wheat 56 barrels of flour had been manufactured before his death, and were then on the way to market: they were sold, and the proceeds were received by mrs. <em>Woodcock, </em>amounting to 210 dollars. The rest of the crop of wheat was on the farm; there was a parcel of indian corn on hand, and a crop of it not yet severed ; and mrs. <em>Woodcock </em>took and enjoyed all. The commissioner deducted an ample supply, both of wheat and indian corn, for the consumption of mrs. <em>Woodcock's </em>family and on the farm, for the year ensuing the testator\u2019s death, which he allowed her, and charged her with the value of the residue amounting to 1214 dollars. The plaintiff claimed that his testatrix was entitled under the bequest in her husband\u2019s will, to an absolute interest in all the crops he left on hand, and that, therefore, her estate was improperly debited with those sums.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b657-5\">The <em>fifth </em>exception was to the omission of a credit claimed for mrs. <em>Woodcock's </em>estate, for the interest that accrued during her life on a debt due upon a bond of one <em>Richard Briarly </em>to the testator\u2019s estate for 4697 dollars, the principal and interest of which were collected by <em>Dunhar, </em>and applied to his own use.\u2014The plaintiff claimed the interest of this debt that accrued during the life of his testatrix, as profits of the property bequeathed to her for life by her husband\u2019s will. <em>Dunbar's </em>executors insisted, that his estate ought not to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>charged with the interest of this debt, on the following grounds: that the testator <em>John Woodcock </em>having declared and directed, on his deathbed, in the presence of mrs. <em>Woodcock, </em>that <em>Dunbar </em>should have the interest on <em>Briarly\u2019s </em>bond, and that that bond and the interest upon it should go to the <em>immediate use </em>of <em>Dunbar </em>and his family, mrs. <em>Woodcock </em>delivered the bond to <em>Dunbar, </em>with intent to comply with the wishes of her husband thus expressed, and to relinquish to him all her interest in the debt due by the bond. And, accordingly, she gave <em>Dunbar </em>a written declaration to that effect (though it was not a sealed instrument) in the following words: \u201cThis is to certify, that the day before mr. <em>WoodcocJc\u2019s </em>death, in my presence, in his directions to dr. <em>Dunbar, </em>as his appointed executor, he directed him to receive the interest of a bond of <em>Richard Briarly </em>due mr. <em>Woodcock </em>for <em>fourteen hundred and odd pounds, </em>with different credits on said <em>bond, </em>as <em>it </em>was <em>the desire </em>and direction of mr. <em>Woodcock, </em>that this bond and interest should be for the immediate use and benefit of dr. <em>Dunbar </em>and bis family: I, therefore, do relinquish and agree that the same shall be applied to that purpose, as being the desire of mr. <em>Woodcock. </em>Given under my hand this 7th February 1809. (Signed) <em>Frances Woodcock.\u201d </em>She afterwards signed, sealed and delivered to <em>Dunbar, </em>another instrument in the following words: \u201cThis is to certify, that in my husband\u2019s lifetime, among the various and complicated business in which he was engaged for himself and for others, I never knew of any transactions in which he was engaged but what were conducted with the utmost justness and uprightness, and that I am confident no bond, note or paper, evidencing any debt due to himself or others, was ever cancelled by any promise, or any paper tending to cancel the debt, or to do any act or acts that would tend to that import, so as to prevent the recovery of the principal and interest, rents or profits, due to himself or others. <em>And </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number><em>further, to save much trouble and to expedite the finishing of all the affairs relative to my husband's estate, I hereby relinquish all my right, title and interest, of all bonds, notes, and every paper evidencing any debt due my husband's estate, as having already received, debts due the estate in lieu thereof. </em>And I also further certify, that I never gave any paper or promise that would cancel any bond, note or paper, as before mentioned, so as to prevent the full recovery of every debt due my husband\u2019s estate or the estate of others. Given under my hand and seal this 22nd November 1810.\u201d On the other hand, the plaintiff adduced evidence to prove, that the recital in the instrument of the 7th February 1809, of <em>Woodcock\u2019s </em>directions to <em>Dunbar, on the day before his death, </em>that he was to take the bond of <em>Briarly, </em>and the interest to accrue upon it, to the immediate use of himself and his family, was and could not be true, because (according to this evidence) <em>Dunbar </em>was not at the testator\u2019s house and did not see him the day before, or for many days before, his death; and to prove further, that <em>Dunbar </em>had himself admitted in his lifetime, that the instrument of the 7lh February 1S09, and that of the 22nd November 1810, were executed and delivered by mrs. <em>Woodcock </em>to him, and intended by them both, to answer the sole purpose of enabling him to collect the debts without any interference on her part: that, therefore, so far as those instruments expressed any other purpose, the instruments (which were written by <em>Dunbar </em>himself) were fraudulent impositions upon her ignorance or overconfidence in him. And this being the state of the evidence upon the point, the executor of mrs. <em>Woodcock </em>contended, that the commissioner ought to have credited the estate of his testatrix, and charged the estate of <em>Dunbar, </em>with the interest on the debt due from <em>Briarly </em>that accrued during her lifetime: that the instrument of the 7th February 1809 was, like that of the 22d November 1810, intended as a mere power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>collect the debt; but if not, it was, at most, a <em>nude contract </em>ineffectual for want of consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Au-\">The cause coming on for hearing upon the report of the commissioner and the exceptions thereto, the plaintiff objected as for error apparent on the face of the J . 1 r accounts, that the commissioner had proceeded on the supposition, that mrs. <em>Woodcock </em>was entitled only to a life estate in the personal property bequeathed to her by her husband\u2019s will, whereas the plaintiff claimed and insisted, that the will gave her an absolute right to all the personalty bequeathed to her; a claim which had been nowise before asserted, and was thus for the first time set up at the hearing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-8\">The court declared, that the bequest in the will of the testator <em>John Woodcock </em>had not the effect contended for by the plaintiff, of giving mrs. <em>Woodcock </em>an absolute interest in all the personal property thereby bequeathed to her, and that the bequest of the remainder thereof to <em>Dunbar and </em>wife, after mrs. <em>Woodcock's </em>death, was good and valid. But the court further declared, that all articles, the use of which consisted in the consumption, such as corn, provisions, flour, hay, fatted hogs &amp;c. were excluded by law from the limitation over to the legatees in remainder: that though some articles which indeed could only be enjoyed in the use, such as money, stock in the funds, or the like, were nevertheless to be accounted for after the death of the legatee for life to the remaindermen, yet even of these the capital only was to be accounted for, not the annual profits-; and by parity of reasoning the crops of the estate devised to mrs. <em>Woodcock </em>for life were not to be accounted for: that though the crops in question were made at the time of the testator\u2019s death, yet they clearly passed by the bequest and devise of the <em>use </em>of all the rest of the testator\u2019s estate to his wife; and the court could not say that <em>her use of these crops </em>should be more restrained than her use of the crops of succeed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>ing years, for which it was obvious she was not to account: and but for this construction, mrs. <em>Woodcock </em>would have been without support until she could have made a crop herself. Therefore, the plaintiff\u2019s <em>first </em>exception to the commissioner\u2019s report (above stated) was sustained. The court also sustained the plaintiff\u2019s <em>fifth </em>exception, touching the interest which accrued on the bond of <em>Briarly </em>during mrs. <em>Woodcock\u2019s </em>life; holding, that there was no reason to consider the alleged gift of that bond by the testator to <em>Dunbar, </em>a <em>donatio causa mortis, </em>as .the counsel for <em>Dunbar\u2019s </em>executors had contended ; and a claim to it, as a gift or release from mrs. <em>Woodcock </em>to <em>Dunbar, </em>could not be supported. And the court, sustaining the plaintiff\u2019s <em>fourth </em>exception also, and overruling the <em>second, third, sixth </em>and <em>seventh, </em>(all of which, as has been stated, presented mere questions of fact,) proceeded to give the following general instructions to the commissioner as to the accounts: that as to such articles as horses, wagons, implements of husbandry, and the like, the enjoyment of which might or might not consume the subject in the lifetime of the legatee for life, the following principles should be observed in stating the accounts: 1. Such as were returned in specie, though worn and impaired, were to be handed over in their then state to the remaindermen; 2. such as had died, or were entirely worn out, were not to be charged to mrs. <em>Woodcock\u2019s </em>estate, though they were not forthcoming; 3. the principal (without interest) of what should appear to have been sold, was to be charged, unless it should appear that other property of the same kind had been substituted; and 4. such as from their nature, and from the circumstances, might reasonably be presumed to be dead or worn out, should not be charged. That as to flocks of sheep and the like, though they are principally enjoyed in the consumption, yet constituting a species of capital stock, they ought to be kept up in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>kind, unless it should appear that they have been dei \u2022 \u2022 i , i i,, stroyed or impaired by casualty; and that the same principle applied to brood mares kept as such by the testator, but not to mares kept principally for labour an^ 0,ber uses&gt; and only occasionally put to breeding, nor did it apply to milch cows, which the tenant for life would not be bound to restore in kind. And the court made an interlocutory decree, recommitting the accounts to the commissioner, to be reformed according to its opinions upon the several exceptions to the former report, and to the instructions above slated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b662-7\">At the next term, <em>Dunbar\u2019s </em>executors filed a petition for a rehearing, for several alleged errors in the interlocutory decree apparent on the face of it, and upon additional evidence taken since the decree, upon some of the points therein decided, particularly the question touching the bond of <em>Briarly, </em>without alleging that this additional evidence had been discovered since the decree, so that it had not been in the power of the petitioners to produce it before the decree was pronounced. The additional evidence on the subject of <em>Briarly\u2019s </em>bond, consisted in the deposition of a witness, proving that <em>Dunbar </em>was with the testator <em>Woodcock </em>at his house the day before he died : that the witness was present afterwards, when mrs. <em>Woodcock </em>delivered to <em>Dunbar </em>the bond of <em>Briarly </em>in question, along with other bonds, notes and evidences of debt; and that after <em>Dunbar\u2019s </em>departure, the witness asked her, what induced her to deliver the bonds &amp;c. to him; upon which she said, that he was to be put in possession of <em>Briarly\u2019s </em>bond, and to have it, at the request of her deceased husband, and she was desirous of complying with her husband\u2019s wishes, and that she did not wish to keep any of the papers or to be troubled with them. The court was of opinion, that the interlocutory decree of the former term should be opened fbr a rehearing as to any error apparent on the face of the decree ; but that as to al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>leged errors in point of fact, the case could only be reheard upon the evidence as it stood at the time the decree was pronounced, without regard to the addi- \u2022 tional evidence <em>taken and </em>fled, but not alleged to have been <em>discovered, </em>since the decree; which (the court held) was inadmissible, and could not be heard.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b663-5\">The commissioner having reformed the accounts, according to the general instructions of the court, and its opinions on the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions, contained in the interlocutory decree ; and the cause coming on for hearing before the circuit superior court of <em>Frederick, </em>on the report thus reformed ; the court so far altered its opinion on the first exception, as to direct that mrs. <em>Woodcock's </em>estate should be charged with the 210 dollars, the proceeds of the 66 barrels of flour which were on the way to market at the time of her husband\u2019s death; still exempting her estate from accountability for the residue of his crops of grain on hand at his death, even for the surplus thereof after allowing her a full supply for consumption in her family and upon the farm, for the year ensuing the testator\u2019s death ; the value of which surplus was (as before stated) 1214 dollars. And the commissioner being directed to remodel the accounts by charging mrs. <em>Woodcock </em>with the 210 dollars, it appeared by his final report, that the estate of <em>Dunbar </em>was indebted to that of mrs. <em>Woodcock </em>the sum of 3059 dollars, being a balance of the aggregate of interest on the annual balances found in his ex-ecutorial account, computed to the close of the accounts in September 1816; which balance, the commissioner reported, should bear interest from September 1816. And there being no exception to the report in this particular, the court decreed, that <em>Dunbar's </em>executors should pay the plaintiff the sum of 3059 dollars, with interest from September 1816.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b663-7\"><em>Dunbar's </em>executors presented a petition to this court, praying an appeal from the decree; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A0a4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>The cause was argued here, by <em>R.

Adverting to the language of the will, whereby the testator gave the use of all the residuum of his estate to bis wife for life, and after her death gave the same of every description, as wmll the land bought of <em>John Acre, </em>as <em>all the other property remaining at \u2022her decease, </em>to <em>Dunbar and wife; </em>they said, that the words \u201c remaining at her decease\u201d did not apply to the <em>land, </em>but did apply to <em>all the other property; </em>namely, to all the personal subject bequeathed. And they argued, that the testator intended to give the remaindermen only so much of <em>all the other property </em>as should remain at his wife\u2019s decease; meaning, so much as she should not <em>use </em>or <em>dispose of </em>during her life ; and if she had power to use or dispose of it, she took an absolute estate in the subject, and the bequest of the remainder after her death was nugatory. <em>Riddick </em>v. <em>Cohoon, </em>4 Rand. 547. <em>Grey </em>v. <em>Montagu, </em>3 Bro.

In all the cases cited for the appellee, the property was given to the first taker indefinitely or expressly in fee, with an absolute power of disposition \u25a0 expressed or plainly implied, and then only w'hat should remain undisposed of by the first taker was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>limited over to the remainderman. Here, an interest for life only (in express terms) was given to the testator\u2019s wife, and there were no words from which an ab- \u2022 \u00bb solute power of disposition could be implied for her, without the utmost .violence of construction. They cited <em>Upwell </em>v. <em>Halsey, </em>1 P. Wms. 651. <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Westcott, </em>13 Ves. 445. <em>Madden </em>v. <em>Madden's ex'ors, 2 </em>Leigh <em>377.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b665-5\">II. <em>The counsel for the appellants </em>maintained, that the opinion of the court of chancery sustaining the plaintiff\u2019s <em>first </em>exception to the commissioner\u2019s report, was erroneous. They said, mrs. <em>Woodcock's </em>estate was accountable to the remaindermen, for at least so much of the testator\u2019s crops of grain on hand and growing at his death, as exceeded the ample allowance made to her by the commissioner, for consumption in her family and on her farm during the ensuing year; in other words, for the surplus which was to be sent to market, and converted into money. The court of chancery held, upon this <em>residuary </em>bequest of articles <em>quce ipso mu consumuntur </em>along with articles of a different description, that the legacy to mts. <em>Woodcock </em>for her life gave her the whole property of all articles consumable in the use, and that all such articles were by law excluded from the limitation to the legatees in remainder ; and then it held, that the surplus of the crops of grain, destined not for consumption at home but to be sent to market and converted into money, was to be classed among articles consumable in the use. Now, they said, supposing the first proposition correct in point of law, (which, however, they denied,) yet the surplus of the crops of grain that was to be used by being converted into money, could no more be regarded as consumable in the use than money: money, as well as the surplus of these crops, could not be used without being parted with. Articles <em>quce ipso usu consumuntur, </em>in the true sense of that phrase, were ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>tides consumable by the legatee or donee for life in ihe use thereof <em>in kind: </em>but the surplus of the crops could only be used by the salq thereof and enjoyment ___ of the proceeds. The surplus of the crops could not regarded as consumable in the use, merely because the subject was, in its nature, consumable in food; that was not the way the testator intended the legatee for life should enjoy the use. The stock of corn of a corn merchant, the stock of wine of a vintner, the stock of cloths of a dothier, were intended, ultimately, to be eaten, or drunk, or worn; that is, to be sold to others who should so consume them ; and if the principle of this decree were properly applicable to the surplus crops of grain grown by a farmer for market, then, with as good reason, if a merchant dying with a stock of goods on hand, should leave them to his w'ife for life, with remainder to another, the legatee for life would take the whole property, and the bequest of the remainder would be nugatory. If, then, this had been a <em>specific </em>bequest of the testator\u2019s crops on hand to mrs. <em>Woodcock </em>for life, remainder to <em>Dunbar\u25a0 and wife, </em>her estate would have been accountable to the remaindermen for the proceeds or for the value of the marketable surplus. Indeed, the allowance made to her by the commissioner of an ample supply for consumption during the year ensuing the testator\u2019s death, was more than she was entitled to : for the testator died in September 1808, and by our statute of emblements, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 104. \u00a7 53. p. 3S8. she was entitled to demand, that the levies and taxes of the slaves, their tools, the expense of feeding them till the last of December following, and of then delivering them to her well clothed, should be deducted from the growing crop. And this was all that she was entitled to in absolute property. But this was not a <em>specific </em>bequest of the testator\u2019s crops on hand : it was a general <em>residua/ry </em>devise and bequest of all the residue of the testator\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>estate to his wife for life, remainder to <em>Dunbar and wife; </em>the residuum including lands, slaves, money, live stock, furniture, and farming utensils, as well as the crops on hand. In <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>3 Meriv. 193. sir <em>W. Grant, </em>after stating, that doubts had arisen on the <em>. \u00b0 . </em>question as to the nature of the interest which a widow, as tenant for life, takes in articles (such as corn and hay) of which the use consists in the consumption, said, that his own conception was, \u201c that a gift for life, if <em>specific, </em>of things <em>qua ipso usu consumuntur, </em>is a gift of the property, and that there cannot be a limitation over after a life interest in such articles: if included in a <em>residuary </em>bequest for life, then they are to be sold, and the <em>interest </em>enjoyed by the tenant for life.\u201d In <em>Madden </em>v. <em>Madden's ex'ors, 2 </em>Leigh 389. judge <em>Green, </em>adverting to <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>declared his own opinion, \u201c that even in the case of a <em>specific </em>bequest of such articles for life with a limitation over, the limitation is good: that the intention of the testator being in such case most obvious that the legatee in remainder should have the benefit of the subject after the death of the first taker, it ought to be carried into effect, if possible: and it may be effectuated by requiring the representative of the first taker to deliver articles of the same kind and quality, or to pay their value, to the remainderman.\u201d It was not necessary here to discuss the point of difference between these able jurists: it never had been doubted, that in the case of a <em>residuary </em>bequest to one for life with remainder to another, including articles consumable in the use with others of a different kind in the same disposition, the representative of the legatee for life was accountable to the remainderman for the value of the whole subject. And the reasou was quite obvious *. the intention of the testator, in such a <em>residuary </em>bequest, was to give the same interest, both to the legatee for life and to the remainderman, in the whole subject, without discrimination. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Then, even if the crops of grain which the testator in this case had on hand at the time of his death, could possibly be regarded as articles <em>quce ipso usu consumuntur, </em>yet the legatee for life was accountable for them t0 *'emaindermen. And her representative should have been held to account for the value, not only of the marketable surplus, but of the whole of the grain she received, except only so much of the crop growing at the testator\u2019s death as our statute of emblements gave her. But further, in the general instructions to the commissioner, touching the live stock of horses, cattle, sheep, the furniture, the farming utensils, and the like, the court of chancery departed from the settled law on the subject. The representative of the legatee should have been held to account to the remaindermen for all those articles in value as they existed at the testator\u2019s death and as she received them: he ought to have been required to deliver to the remaindermen other articles of like kind and quality, or to pay the value of them in money. <em>Covenhoven </em>v. <em>Shuler, 2 </em>Paige 122. 133. <em>Bracken </em>v. <em>Bentley, </em>1 Ch.

C. C. 274.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b668-5\"><em>The counsel for the appellee </em>did not controvert the general principles of law on which the counsel for the appellants rested their argument: they denied that they were justly applicable to the present case. The testator was a <em>Virginia </em>farmer, of moderate though competent estate, who had no offspring or any near relation <em>to </em>provide for but his wife. It was natural that he should leave his property to her to be enjoyed for the remainder of her days in the same manner as they had enjoyed it together during his life. As to his crops on hand, he would, if he had lived, have set apart a large portion of them for the consumption of his family: so much ought to be considered <em>as dead victuals, </em>intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>to be consumed during the year ensuing bis death ; and so much, therefore, without doubt, ought to have been allowed to his wife, for the maintenance of herself and family, until she could make another crop. And even as to the surplus of the crop of grain which he would have sent to market, he would, if he had lived, have laid out the proceeds in the purchase of other articles of subsistence of foreign growth, and of clothing, for his family. He could not have intended, in making provision for his wife, to subject her to the necessity of incurring a debt for necessaries, which 'would be a heavy burden on her, in order to preserve, for the benefit of the remaindermen who had no natural claim on his bounty, a fund which he himself would have used to avoid the incurring of a debt for the same purposes. In giving his wife the <em>use </em>of the crops in question, he meant that she should have the use of them in the manner which was necessary for her comfort, and to the purposes to which such means were ordinarily applied. As to the specific chattels, the furniture, the farming utensils, and the live stock; they said, no <em>Virginia </em>testator, having a house and furniture, and a farm with stock upon it, and giving to his wife for life, the house and farm, with the furniture and stock, ever had any other intention than that she should enjoy the furniture and stock, as well as the house and farm, <em>in land. </em>They appealed to the experience of the court, whether such testamentary provision for a wife, so common in this country, was not always so understood, and so carried into effect. And furniture, farming utensils and live stock, being in their nature consumable in the use, or more properly (in the language of our statute, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 104. ^ 47. p. 387.) being \u201c liable to perish, be consumed, or rendered worse by keeping,\u201d no <em>Virginia </em>testator making a bequest of such articles to his wife for life, to be enjoyed in kind, ever intended to make her debtor for the value of them at the time she re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>ceived them, however they should be impaired, worn out or destroyed, by time and use. No testator ever intended to impose such a burden upon his wife even for the sake of his own children; much less was it intended by this testator, for the benefit of remaindermen who were strangers to his blood. And he indicated very clearly, that he had no such intention, by directing that his estate should not be appraised; thereby preventing the use of the only means by which the value of the subject at the time of his death could be ascertained : a direction which could have had no other essential purpose, but to save his wife from the very accountability which the remaindermen were now seeking to impose upon her representative. And it afforded an argument, equally applicable and, forcible, of the justice of the opinion of the court of chancery on the first exception touching the crops, and of the correctness of its general instructions to the commissioner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b670-4\">III. <em>The counsel for the appellants </em>insisted, that the decree was erroneous in charging <em>Dunbar\u2019s </em>estate with the interest which accrued on <em>Briarly\u2019s </em>bond during the life of mrs. <em>Woodcock. </em>Upon the evidence as it stood when the cause was heard upon the commissioner\u2019s first report, and on the exception of the plaintiff to the omission of the credit for the interest on that debt, which he claimed for the estate of the testatrix, it might be doubtful, whether the recital, in mrs. <em>Woodcock\u2019s </em>instrument of February 1809, of the testator\u2019s deathbed direction that <em>Dunbar </em>and his family should have the immediate use of that bond and the interest that should accrue on it, was true; it might be doubtful, whether that instrument had been fairly obtained from her; and doubtful, whether the fact alleged by <em>Dunbar\u2019s </em>executors was true, that she had delivered the bond to him with intent to transfer to him, in his individual character, the interest she had in it as legatee. But the additional evidence on that point of the controversy, put the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>state of facts alleged by <em>Dunbar\u2019s </em>executors in regard to it beyond doubt. The court thought the additional evidence could not properly be heard. They insisted, that the court ought to have beard and weighed it. They said, that in our chancery practice, there was no necessity for a petition for a rehearing, or for a supplemental bill in the nature of a bill of review, for the correction of such errors of law or of fact in any interlocutory decree, as appeared upon the state of the case as presented by the pleadings and the evidence at the time the decree was pronounced. As it was within the court\u2019s power, so it was surely its duty, to correct errors in its interlocutory decrees, pointed out by the parties, or suggested by its own reflection, before or at the final hearing. The question was, whether the court ought to admit new evidence on points determined by an interlocutory decree, when it was not alleged that the new evidence offered had been discovered since the decree. It might be supposed, that new evidence ought not to be admitted under such circumstances, because upon a supplemental bill in the nature of a bill of review of a decree not final, if the review was asked upon the ground of new matter, it could not be allowed unless the new matter was discovered since the decree. But the supplemental bill in the nature of a bill of review was a proceeding proper in the case of a decree really final, in its nature and its terms, and only technically not final. Mitf. Plead. 81, 2. The interlocutory decree in this case could in no sense be regarded as final: it consisted, in truth, of mere instructions to the commissioner on contested items of account. And they said, in our practice, there wTas no decree merely interlocutory, which might not be corrected upon new evidence adduced before the final hearing, whether the new evidence was discovered before or after the interlocutory decree was pronounced. Formerly, by statutory regulation, after the commission for taking de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>positions was closed, and the cause set for hearing, new evidence might be introduced, in any stage of it, under a special order of the court, but not without such a special order. 1 Rev. Code, ch. 66. \u00a7 103. p. 216. And in the practice of the superior courts of chancery, handed down from the high court of chancery in chancellor <em>Wythe\u2019s </em>time, the special order for taking new evidence was always made upon motion, if the evidence was material, unless it appeared to have been kept back for purposes of delay or chicane. The leave to take new evidence was almost a matter of course, when it was asked ; and it was more frequent <em>after </em>than <em>lfore </em>an interlocutory decree. And it was only necessary to reflect upon the loose and unadvised manner in which depositions in chancery were taken, generally by the parties themselves in the country, to understand why the strictness of the english chancery practice bad never prevailed, and how the liberal indulgence of our practice became indispensable to the ends of truth and justice. \"With knowledge of the existence of this practice, and aware that the opening of the cause for new evidence, upon motion for the purpose, had become matter of course, the legislature, by the statute of March 1826, dispensed with the necessity of the motion and the special leave of court, by providing, \u201c that from the filing of the bill until the final hearing of any case, either party may, without any order of court, obtain general commissions and take depositions to be read therein.\u201d Supp. to Rev. Code, ch. 103. \u00a7 9. p. 132. The new evidence, therefore, upon the controverted question in regard to <em>Briarly\u2019s </em>bond, ought to have been received and weighed upon the final hearing. And taking up the question upon the state of facts which that evidence made indubitable, they thought there could hardly be a doubt, that mrs. <em>Woodcock\u2019s </em>executor had no right to claim a credit for the interest which accrued on <em>Briarly\u2019s </em>bond during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>her life. If she had held that bond in her own right, and had transferred it by delivery to <em>Dunbar, </em>with intent to give him the debt thereby due, such transfer and delivery of the bond would have passed the property in the debt to <em>Dunbar. </em>And the question was, whether, holding the bond as executrix of the obligee, and being entitled as legatee to the interest which should accrue upon it during her life, the actual delivery of the bond by her to <em>Dunbar, </em>with intent to transfer to him all her right in it as legatee, and this intent declared by a written instrument, was a valid gift to him of her life estate in the debt due by the bond ? To shew that it was a valid gift, a contract of gift executed and perfected, they cited the case of <em>Elam </em>v. <em>Keen, </em>4 Leigh 333. If it should be objected, that there was no consideration to support the alleged gift, that was no objection to the validity of a gift of a chattel interest, or of a gift of an interest in a bond more than any other chattel, perfected by actual transfer of possession with intent to transfer the right. There was at least as much reason to hold the contract in <em>Elam </em>v. <em>Keen </em>an executory one as the contract in this case. But, they said, even if this was only an executory contract on mrs. <em>Woodcock's </em>part, yet it was founded on a consideration sufficient to support it. In consideration of the wish and purpose of her husband, declared on his deathbed in her presence, and acquiesced in by her at the time, she agreed, after his death, to release to <em>Dunbar </em>for the immediate use and benefit of bimself and his family, the interest bequeathed to her by her husband\u2019s will in this bond of <em>Briarly: </em>and this, though not a valuable, was a sufficient moral consideration to support the agreement. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Muggeridge, </em>5 Taunt. 37. 1 Eng. C. L. R. 10. And if the instrument of February 1809, being a simple contract, was not binding on her for want of consideration, her deed of No<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>vember 1810 was a complete release of her interest in this bond of <em>Briarly.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APo\"><em>The counsel for the appellee </em>answered, that the release contained in mrs. <em>Woodcock's </em>deed of November 1810, was inserted in it for the declared purpose of \u201c saving trouble and expediting the finishing of the affairs of her husband\u2019s estateand, in equity, the release, however general in its terms, should be limited to the accomplishment of its purpose. With regard to the instrument of February 1809, they insisted, that it was, upon its face, a mere agreement of mrs. <em>Woodcock </em>to release to <em>Dunbar </em>her interest in the debt due from <em>Briarly. </em>And as there was no pretence of any valuable consideration, so there was no moral obligation on her part to release her rights, which could raise a consideration to support the agreement. The moral duty to do any thing which would afford a consideration to support an agreement to do it, must be a duty growing out of some act or omission of the party to be bound, importing benefit to the promiser or detriment to the promisee. Then, as to mrs. <em>Woodcock's </em>actual delivery of the bond of <em>Briarly </em>to <em>Dunbar; </em>if the facts on which the executors of <em>Dunbar </em>rest their claim were proved, yet considering the double character which the parties sustained towards each <em>other and </em>in regard <em>to </em>the subject, each having a beneficial interest in the bond as legatee, and each an equal right to the possession of it as executor, the delivery was at the most an equivocal act, equally referable to the transfer of the possession from one co-executor to the other, as to a gift by the legatee for life of her interest to the legatee in remainder. And thus, this case was distinguishable from <em>Elam </em>v. <em>Keen; </em>there, the delivery of possession could only be attributed to the purpose of giving the bond; here, the <em>legal </em>rights of the parties remained exactly the same, after the transfer of the possession of the bond from the one coexecutor to the other, as before the transfer, and the transfer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>of the possession was not necessarily referable to the purpose of giving the interest of the one legatee to the other. But, they said, the state of facts on which <em>Bun-bar's </em>executors rested their pretensions, was not proved by any evidence which the court could or ought to regard. The evidence offered upon this point of the controversy, after the cause had been regularly brought to hearing, and the point had been determined by the court, without any pretence that this evidence had been discovered since the interlocutory decree, ought not to have been admitted. They said, it was the practice of our courts of chancery, formerly, before the statute of March 1S26, when the general commission to take depositions had been closed, to open the commission by special order, on motion, at any time before the hearing ; but after the hearing, and an interlocutory decree deciding the questions of fact, the court never gave leave to take new depositions on a point decided, unless upon affidavit that the new evidence had been discovered since the decree. This was, perhaps, sometimes done informally, upon motion, and sometimes, regularly, upon supplemental bill in the nature of a bill of review of the interlocutory decree; but in whichever way it was done, the principle on which the new evidence was received was the same; namely, that it had been newly discovered. And it was necessary, that this principle should be observed; for otherwise, the litigation of questions of fact, however solemnly decided by the court on a full hearing, would have been perpetually renewed, and there would have been no end of it; and the admission of new evidence, under such circumstances, would have been a temptation to carelessness and neglect, if not to subornation of evidence. The statute of March 1826 was designed to dispense with the motion for leave to take depositions and the special order for that purpose, in cases in which the former practice required them, but only in such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>cases; not to render the interlocutory decision of questions of fact nugatory, or to dispense with the supplemental bill in the nature of a bill of review of interlocutory decrees, or to abrogate the principle on which aione such bills of review could be allowed. Though the w\u2019ords of this statute were general, that from <em>the filing of the bill until the final hearing of any </em>case, depositions may be taken to be read therein, without any order of <em>court; </em>yet the <em>final hearing </em>there meant, was such final hearing as had formerly concluded the questions of fact; and formerly, the questions of fact might have been settled by an interlocutory decree as well as by a final one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b676-4\">IV. <em>The counsel for the appellants </em>objected, that it was erroneous to give interest on the balance found against - <em>Dunbar's </em>estate from the close of the accounts in 1816. That balance consisted entirely of interest; and of interest on balances of principal in his executorial accounts, which balances had never been ascertained during his life; nor could he have known what he was bound to pay mrs. <em>Woodcock, </em>until the accounts between him and her were settled, and the moneys received by her, and with which she was chargeable, had been ascertained. The decree was a decree for interest upon a balance of interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b676-5\"><em>The counsel for the appellee </em>said, the interest on the balances due on <em>Dunbar's </em>executorial accounts, was part of the annual revenue given to mrs. <em>Woodcock </em>by her husband\u2019s will for her support, and <em>Dunbar </em>ought to have paid it to her as it accrued.' The commissioner\u2019s report gave interest on the balance found due from <em>Dunbar's </em>estate to <em>that </em>of mrs. <em>Woodcock </em>with interest from September 1816, and there was no exception to the report in that particular: it was too late to take the exception in the appellate court. <em>Foreman </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>7 Leigh 412.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b677-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number><em>In the reply, </em>it was said, that <em>Foreman </em>v. <em>Murray </em>was the case of a guardian\u2019s account, in which the guardian was charged with moneys as for interest received by him from an executor, though it did not appear by positive proof that he had received it; and this charge was incorporated in the guardian\u2019s account, and no exception was taken to it. Here, the balance consisted of interest, and the interest upon the interest was nowise incorporated in the account; the commissioner only suggested, that the balance of interest should bear interest.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b677-4\">Scott, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AjoR\">delivered the opinion of the court\u2014That the rule which gives to a legatee for life, the absolute property in articles consumable in the use, is applicable only to such as the testator intended for consumption, not to such as in the ordinary course of business are for sale. That the commissioner in his first report; properly allowed to mrs. <em>Woodcock </em>so much of the crops left by the testator on hand as was necessary for consumption in her family and on the farm, and properly charged her with the proceeds and value of the sur_plus; and, therefore, the first exception of the appellee to that report ought to have been overruled. And that the general instructions of the court of chancery to the commissioner, in regard to such articles as horses, wagons, implements of husbandry, and the like, the enjoyment of which might or might not have consumed the subject during the life of the legatee for life, and in regard to flocks of sheep and such like, were, <em>in this case, </em>proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">That mrs. <em>Woodcock's </em>gift of <em>Briarly's </em>bond, or of her interest in it, to <em>Dunbar, </em>was valid; and, therefore, the interest which accrued on that bond during her life, ought not to have been charged to his estate.

That the court, without intending to say what would be a <em>final decree, </em>which would preclude a party from taking new evidence wdthout having obtained a review or rehearing, was of opinion, that an opinion given, in the progress of an account, upon exceptions to a report, or instructions to a commissioner, as to the propriety of allowing items of debit or credit, was not such a final decree; and therefore the new evidence in this case ought to have been received and considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">That the court of chancery erred, in sustaining the appellee\u2019s <em>fourth </em>exception to the commissioner\u2019s first report, and properly overruled his <em>second, third, sixth, </em>and <em>seventh </em>exceptions thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">A.nd that the court of chancery erred, in decreeing interest on the balance reported against <em>Dunbar\u2019s </em>estate, from September 1816.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Therefore, the decree was reversed with costs, and the cause remanded to the circuit superior court of <em>Frederick, </em>for further proceedings to be had therein according to the principles declared in this decree, with instructions to allow interest on the balance which may be found due from the date of the final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Decree reversed, .and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
