Should it be contrary to the laws of the country to emancipate slaves at my death, and such leave cannot be obtained, or should any of the slaves I may depart this life owner of, choose to remain slaves at or before the expiration of twelve months from my death, such as choose to remain slaves to be sold in families, and to be allowed to choose their masters so far as practicable ; for this object, my estate to remain together twelve months after my death, except the perishable parts thereof.\u201416, It is my will and desire, that the balance of my estate, real and personal, be used by my executors for the purpose of erecting three seminaries of learning; <em>one on my tract of land called Belle Air; </em>one on my tract of land around the town of <em>Milton, </em>my lots in said town to be taken as part; one in the county of <em>Nelson, </em>as near the graveyard in this will mentioned as a proper site can be procured : <em>said tracts of land, </em>as also the one to be procured, <em>to remain forever for the use and benefit of the seminaries of </em>learning.\u201417. Should my executors fail to carry into effect said 16th devise for seminaries of learning (which I hope and trust they will not) then the real and personal estate <em>devised for said objects, </em>to be used by my executors in constituting a part of <em>The Literary Fund </em>of the state of <em>Virginia; </em>and <em>two thirds </em>of the <em>interest </em>on it to be used by the school commissioners for the county of <em>Albemarle, </em>in the same way the school fund allotted for the said county is used; the other <em>third </em>of the <em>interest </em>on it to be appropriated and used by the school commissioners for the county of <em>Nelso7i </em>in the same way : and from time to time, as the legislature may think advisable, the <em>priiicipal </em>may be used for like objects, for the benefit of the said counties, in the same proportions as the interest is directed to be used.

Rives, Harris </em>and <em>Dawson, </em>qualified ; but the powers of the two former were revoked before this suit was set for hearing in the circuit superior court, so that <em>Dawson </em>remained the only acting executor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b628-5\">The bill was exhibited by the heirs and next of kin of the testator, against his executors, his nephew <em>Benjamin Dawson </em>mentioned in the codicil, and all the devisees and legatees named in the will, particularly <em>the president and directors of the literary fund: </em>and one of the objects of the bill was, to ascertain which of the testator\u2019s slaves would choose to remain slaves and be sold in <em>Virginia </em>rather than be sent to another country <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>where slavery is not tolerated ; and another and main object.was, to have the devises and bequests contained in the 16th and 17th clauses, for the three seminaries of learning, or for the benefit of <em>The Literary Fund, </em>dedared void,'and, consequently, to have the real and personal subjects of those devises and bequests divided among the testator\u2019s heirs and next of kin, as if he <em>werg pro tanto </em>intestate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b629-4\">The defendant <em>Benjamin Dawson, </em>in bis answer, insisted, that the <em>codicil </em>giving him \u201c the <em>Belle Air </em>estate for the equitable support and maintenance of the slave population thereon,\u201d was a revocation of the devise of the <em>Belle Air </em>estate contained in the 16th dause of the will, and of so much of the 2nd dause as emancipated the slaves who were on that estate; and a devise and bequest to him, in fee and absolute property, of that land and of those slaves; a provision which, he said, the testator had, in several former wills, always made for him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b629-5\">The circuit superior court, in an interlocutory decree for settling the rights of the parties, declared and decreed, among other things, that the codicil gave the defendant <em>Benjamin Dawson </em>no absolute interest in the <em>Belle Air </em>estate, either in the lands, or in the slaves thereon, or in the stock thereto belonging, but only the use thereof, in trust for the benefit of the slaves, for their support and maintenance, during the interval of twelve months or longer, which might elapse between the death of the testator and the election of the slaves; but that, nevertheless, as the slaves were not yet freedmen, and would not be until they so elected, they, therefore, had no capacity to enforce against <em>Dawson </em>the trustee any accountability over and above their maintenance, and he was entitled to all the profits beyond, discharged of the trust, namely, the use of the <em>Belle Air </em>estate until the slaves thereon should make their election. From this part of the decree, the defendant <em>Benjamin Dawson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>applied by petition to this court for an appeal; which ,, . . \u00bb was allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A6D\">The cause was argued here, by <em>R. C. Stanard </em>and <em>Lyons </em>for the appellant, and by the <em>attorney general </em>and <em>Johnson </em>for the appellees. The counsel for the appellant contended, that the effect of the codicil was, not to create a trust for the support and maintenance of the slaves thereon, but to give the <em>Belle Air estate </em>to <em>Benjamin </em>Dawson, charged with the support and maintenance of the slaves thereon ; and as the charge of supporting and maintaining them might far exceed the profits, and as the word <em>estate </em>was alone sufficient to describe the whole interest, and the statute 1 Rev. Code, ch. 99. \u00a7 27. p. 369. dispensed with words of inheritance, therefore the devisee took the fee simple, <em>for </em>(meaning <em>in consideration of) </em>his support and maintenance of the slaves. And thus understood, the codicil revoked the devise of the <em>Belle Air </em>land contained in the sixteenth clause of the will.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b630-8\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AxD\">The only question upon this appeal, is as to the construction of the codicil to the will of <em>Martin Dawson; </em>and that question seems to me to be without difficulty. It cannot be denied, that so far as the codicil contains a disposition of the testator\u2019s property, different from the will, or modifying its provisions, the will must yield, although the codicil contains no clause of revocation. But, I take it, the codicil is to be considered a revocation to that extent only; for a codicil (so expressed to be upon its face) is designed to be a part of the will already made, and not a new and independent instrument. It may add to, take from, or modify and restrain, the dispositions of the will, but so far as the will can stand consistently with the codicil, so far is it unrevoked by it, unless there be an express revocation. <em>Willet </em>v. <em>Sandford, </em>1 Ves. sen. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>178. 186. <em>Ld. Carrington </em>v. <em>Payne, 5 </em>Ves. jun. 404. <em>Beckett </em>v. <em>Harden, </em>4 Mau. &amp; Selw. 1. With this simpie proposition premised, let us proceed to consider the Case.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">By the <em>second </em>clause of the will, the testator\u2019s slaves are directed to be emancipated, and twelve months are given for them to elect to be sold or to be free ; and for that object the estate is directed to remain together for twelve months. By the <em>sixteenth </em>and <em>seventeenth </em>clauses, the balance of the testator\u2019s estate, after certain bequests, is directed to be used by the executors in the erection of three seminaries of learning, and if that object cannot be effected, then the whole is to be used for the benefit of <em>The Literary Fund; </em>and by the <em>last </em>clause of the will, the executors are invested with a complete authority to sell. The <em>Belle Air </em>estate is a part of the properly thus disposed of. Two years after the will was made, the testator added the codicil. It is declared to be a codicil, and begins as if continuing the dispositions of the will, thus: \u201c And my <em>Belle Air </em>estate I give to my nephew <em>Benjamin Dawson </em>for the equitable support and maintenance of the slave papulation thereon.\u201d It is to my mind very clear, that the testator, by this devise, designed no benefit to, or charge upon, <em>Benjamin Dawson. </em>The words are loo plain to admit of doubt. He devises the <em>estate </em>to <em>Daw</em>son\u2014for his own benefit ? By no means; but \u201c for the equitable support of the slaves thereon,\u201d which were the very slaves he bad directed to be emancipated. It was a trust for their support, until the time when their emancipation, or sale, was to take place, which was to be within twelve months. There is nothing from which any provision in favour of <em>Dawson </em>can be implied. The purpose and object of the gift have no reference to him; they refer to the slaves alone : and if he failed to fulfil the trust, it might have been enforced, if not by the slaves, by the executor, since unless sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>ported by <em>Dawson, </em>according to the will, tbe burden would fall upon him. It is said, that the testator, in former wills, had made provision for <em>Dawson; </em>but the inference from that fact is more than balanced by the pretermission of him in the will of 1833, which remained two years without alteration. It is said, too, that the word <em>for </em>often signifies <em>in consideration of, </em>and so the codicil gives the <em>Belle Air </em>estate to <em>Dawson, </em>in consideration of his support and maintenance of the slaves: but, in this connexion, the word <em>for </em>clearly expresses nothing more than the purpose of the gift, and that purpose was to provide for the slaves. It does not imply a gift of the absolute property in a fine estate, for the paltry consideration of supporting the slaves upon it for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><em>Dawson </em>then took no beneficial interest in the property. Being only a trustee, what estate did he take ? Was it a fee, or a less estate <em>? I </em>am <em>clearly </em>of opinion that the title he acquired was only commensurate with the purpose of the trust, <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Simpson, 5 </em>East 162. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Nicholls, </em>1 Barn. &amp; Cress. 336. 8 Eng. C. L. R. 92. the purpose, namely, of maintaining the slaves for the year within which they were to be emancipated or sold. This purpose limits the quantity of estate which he took, and controls the construction which would otherwise have given him a fee, either from the effect of the word <em>estate, </em>or from the operation of our statute dispensing with words of inheritance, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 99. \u00a7 27. p. 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Upon the whole, I am of opinion, that the construction of the circuit superior court as to the meaning and effect of the codicil, is substantially right, and that the decree should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Brooke and Cabell, <em>J. </em>concurred. Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
