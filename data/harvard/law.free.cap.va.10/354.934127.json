Clarice, </em>on the 11th of December 1834, transferred his interest in this deed to <em>Findlay Sf Mitchell. </em>On the same 11th of December 1834, <em>Jones </em>made another deed, conveying to <em>Adam Hiclcman </em>the same negro <em>Allen </em>and some articles of personal property, in trust for the purpose of securing the payment, on or before the 11th of June 1835, of 600 dollars, with interest from the date, to <em>Findlay Of Mitchell.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>On the 7th of March 1835, sale was made of the negro man <em>Allen </em>to <em>Peter Hickman </em>for 900 dollars. <em>Hickman, </em>at the time of the sale, paid to <em>Wallis Sf Gibson </em>their r <em>J </em>debt of 172 dollars 34 cents, and executed to <em>Findlay Sf Mitchell </em>his obligation for 724 dollars 47 cents, payable on the first of September 1835, with interest from the date. <em>Jones </em>at the same time executed a bill of sale, purporting, that for and in consideration of the sum of 900 dollars, he had bargained and sold unto <em>Hickman </em>the negro boy <em>Allen, </em>who was a slave, and that he warranted and defended the title to him against the claims of all persons <em>whatsoever; </em>which bill of sale was witnessed by <em>Alexander Findlay.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-9\">It afterwards appeared that <em>Allen </em>was entitled to his freedom.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-10\"><em>Findlay Sf Mitchell </em>having recovered a judgment against <em>Hickman </em>upon his obligation, <em>Hickman </em>obtained an injunction to the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-11\">In <em>Hickman\u2019s </em>suit (which was in the circuit court of <em>Washington) </em>the bill, after stating the purchase of <em>Allen </em>from <em>Jones </em>at the price of 900 dollars, and mentioning the creditors provided for in the deeds of trust, proceeds to set forth the case more particularly, as follows : \u201c In making the purchase of said negro, it was necessary to consult the said creditors of said <em>Jones, </em>and to remove the liens created by said deeds of trust upon said negro. Or in other words, it is substantially true that your orator made the purchase of said negro from said creditors and said <em>Jones </em>jointly. It is true that the bill of sale of said boy to your orator was executed by said <em>Jones </em>only, and was witnessed by said <em>Findlay, </em>which will appear by said bill of sale. It will also appear by said bill of sale, that said negro was sold for a slave, and his title warranted.' At the time of the purchase, it was agreed amongst said creditors, <em>Jones, </em>and your orator, that if your orator would pay the said debt due to <em>Wallis Sf Gibson, </em>and execute his note to <em>Findlay Sf Mitchell </em>for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>the balance of the price of the said negro, they the said creditors would release and surrender to your orator liens created by said deeds of trust upon said negro. Your orator, in order to obtain a good and complete title t0 sa{\u00bf negro, did pay to <em>Wallis Sp Gibson </em>their said debt, and execute his note to said <em>Findlay Sp Mitchell </em>for the balance of the price of said negro.\u201d The complainant avers that the only consideration that induced him to execute said note to <em>Findlay Sp Mitchell </em>was to obtain a complete and perfect title to the said negro boy as a slave; that he has received no advantage, directly or indirectly, by the said <em>Findlay Sp Mitchell </em>and <em>Wallis Sp Gibson's </em>surrendering and releasing their said liens; and that the said <em>Findlay Sp Mitchell </em>have suffered no inconvenience or injury, nor have their debts been made less secure, by the said release and surrender. And he insists that both the payment made to <em>Wallis Sp Gibson, </em>and the note executed to <em>Findlay Sp Mitchell, </em>are without any consideration whatever. He contends further, that every man who sells or disposes of a right or claim to personal property will be considered as warranting the title which he so sells. <em>Findlay Sp Mitchell </em>having represented that they had a lien upon the negro as a slave, and a right thereby to sell him as such, and having agreed to surrender, relinquish and transfer to the complainant the said lien, they are bound, he insists, to make the same good, and to shew that they had such a lien on the negro as a slave, as they represented.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-4\">The only defendants to the bill were <em>Findlay Sp Mitchell </em>and <em>Jones.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-5\">The answer of <em>Findlay Sp </em>Mitchell,' after mentioning that, <em>Clarice </em>having a prior incumbrance on the property, they paid his debt in order to extinguish his title, and making some other statements not very material, proceeds as follows : \u201c These respondents give a most express and explicit denial to the statement of the bill, that the sale of the negro was a joint one by <em>Jones </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>his creditors to the complainant. On the contrary, the purchase was made by the said <em>Hickman </em>directly from <em>Jones. </em>These respondents were no parties to the sale, i \u2022 . . \u2022 . ,i were not consulted as to the price at which the negro was sold, and gave no express warranty of the title of the property. And they are advised and contend that there is nothing in the character of the contract, or the circumstances attending it, which can imply a warranty by them.\u201d The answer states further, that \u201cwhilst the complainant was treating with <em>Jones </em>for the purchase of the negro, he came to the respondent <em>Findlay, </em>and stated that he was about to buy the negro, and asked how long he could have to pay <em>Jones\u2019s </em>debt, saying at the same time that he could and would, if required, pay the money down, but asking a credit until his return from a trip to <em>Mississippi, </em>which he proposed making in a short time. . This respondent agreed, according to his request, to postpone the payment until the first of September ensuing. In the evening of the same day, the said <em>Jones </em>made his bill of sale to the complainant, who at the same time executed his note to these respondents for the residue of the purchase money after deducting the sum due <em>Wallis &amp;f Gibson. </em>Farther than this, these respondents had no agency whatever in the transaction. The sale was made by <em>Jones </em>alone, these respondents -being only consulted to ascertain how long they would wait for their money. They assumed no control over the property, incurred no responsibility for the goodness of the title, or its soundness, and expressly assert that no such responsibility on their part was in the contemplation of any of the parties. Upon receiving <em>Hickman\u2019s </em>note, these respondents at once gave <em>Jones </em>a credit on his notes for the amount of <em>Hickman\u2019s </em>bond. The consideration of that bond, as between <em>Hickman </em>and these respondents, was not a sale by them of the negro to him, but a release of their debt against <em>Jones </em>to that extent. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>release was absolute and unqualified. It was a change of the debtor. If <em>Hickman </em>had become insolvent after-wards, instead of <em>Jones, </em>the debt of these respondents would have been lost. These respondents agreed to run pa2arc[ 0f <em>Hickman's solvency\u2014Hickman, </em>by taking <em>Jones's </em>warranty, to run the hazard of <em>Jones's </em>solvency; and upon what principle, either of law or equity, a responsibility which they never directly or indirectly assumed, is to be fastened upon them for the benefit of one who, by his own contract, consented to incur that risk, these respondents are at a loss to conceive.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-4\">The argument was continued in the answer as follows : \u201c If the complainant\u2019s view be the true one, then these respondents are the insurers of the solvency both of <em>Jones </em>and <em>Hickman, </em>and lose their debt in the event of the failure of either\u2014a sort of liability which they never for a moment conceived to rest upon them, and which certainly was not contemplated by the parties at the time. That <em>Jones </em>was intended to be entirely discharged, to the extent of <em>Hickman's </em>responsibility, is evident from the manner in which <em>Hickman's </em>note was taken. If <em>Jones </em>had been intended to be held further liable, the note would have been made payable to <em>Jones, </em>and assigned by him to these respondents\u2014a mode of transacting business familiar to these respondents, and always adopted by them where a perfect release of one party is not intended. This view is confirmed by the \u2022 fact, that the complainant has admitted to the respondent <em>Findlay </em>that if he <em>(Hickman) </em>had failed, the debt would have been lost to these respondents, as <em>Jones </em>had been entirely released from that amount according to the contract. <em>Jones </em>taking the same view, considering himself released as to these respondents, and that his warranty of the title to the negro made him responsible to <em>Hickman, </em>at once went to <em>Hickman </em>to secure him from loss, transferring to him his recourse on <em>Joseph </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number><em>Vance, </em>of whom he purchased the negro aforesaid for 450 dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-4\"><em>Jones, </em>by his answer, referred to that of <em>Findlay Mitchell, </em>and adopted it as a part of his own. This respondent says, \u201cthat the contract for the sale of said negro was exclusively between himself and complainant, and that he considered his codefendants <em>Findlay Ilf Mitchell </em>as having nothing to do with it, farther than to receive the money which complainant and your respondent agreed should be paid to them. And farther, when respondent went to the house of complainant in order to secure him as far as possible against loss, complainant told this respondent that he supposed he would have the money to pay, and said he wished <em>Findlay Sf Mitchell </em>to hold on to the property on which they had a lien, in order to secure him. And your respondent on that occasion transferred to complainant his claim on <em>Joseph Vance, </em>of whom respondent had purchased the negro aforesaid. Respondent believes that all parties understood the contract to be a sale from this respondent alone to complainant, and complainant required this respondent to give him a bill of sale, which he did.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-5\">The depositions taken in the cause proved most clearly that <em>Allen </em>was a free man. <em>John Apperson </em>emancipated his mother on the 19th of February 1806, and <em>Allen </em>was born afterwards. <em>Polly, </em>the daughter of <em>John Apperson, </em>married <em>Joseph Vance </em>in 1818, and <em>Allen </em>seems to have been in the family until after that marriage. He was then bound to <em>Joseph Vance </em>by the overseers of the poor for <em>Washington </em>county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-6\"><em>Vance </em>proved, that two or three years before the sale of <em>Allen </em>to <em>Hickman, </em>he <em>Vance </em>sold <em>Allen </em>to <em>Jones </em>as a slave, at the price of 450 dollars. \u201c After it was ascertained that the boy <em>Allen </em>was free, deponent executed his note, at the instance of <em>John H. Fulton, </em>to the complainant <em>Peter Hickman </em>for the sum of 450 dollars. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>At the time deponent executed his note, the complainant <em>Peter Hiclcman </em>was not present, and had not any concern with it, known to deponent. Deponent was \u2022 sued upon his note, and has paid 500 dollars of it, leavjng a balance of 40 or 45 dollars which he has not yet paid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-4\">This payment was also proved by <em>Charles C. Gibson, </em>the deputy sheriff who had the execution against <em>Vance. </em>It issued on a judgment on a forthcoming bond, taken under a <em>ft. fa. </em>for 450 dollars with interest from the 9th of October 1835. <em>Gibson </em>deposed that he received 500 dollars, and paid over 490 dollars 95 cents to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, leaving a balance due on the execution of about 50 dollars. The sum of 490 dollars 95 cents, he said, was, at the time of payment, supposed to be the principal and interest up to the 21st of April 1837.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-5\">The other depositions were taken to prove the insolvency of <em>Jones </em>at the time of the contract and subsequently thereto\u2014a fact alleged in the bill, and relied upon by the complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-6\">The cause came on to be heard the 25th of October 1837, and the circuit court decreed that the injunction be made perpetual; that the contract for the sale of the negro be rescinded; that the complainant, out of the money recovered by him of <em>Vance, </em>retain the amount paid to <em>Wallis Sf Gibson </em>for the extinguishment of the trust on the said negro, and interest thereon to the 21st of April 1837, and also retain his costs expended in this suit, and pay the residue of the said money to <em>Findlay Mitchell; </em>and that <em>Findlay f Mitchell </em>apply the same, or so much thereof as might be necessary, to the extinguishment of the trust transferred to them by <em>Jacob Clarice, </em>and apply the remainder to themselves.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-7\">On the petition of <em>Findlay Sf Mitchell, </em>an appeal was allowed them from this decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b384-8\"><em>B.

Jones, a debtor, possessing a slave incumbered to more than his value, and no doubt desirous, by private sale, to get as much as possible for him in order to extinguish so much of his debt, sells him to <em>Hickman </em>for 900 dollars, and gives him a bill of sale with warranty of title. <em>Hickman, </em>however, pays him not a cent, because the purchase money was to go of course to pay off the incumbrances : and inasmuch as <em>Hickman </em>could not take off the slave without discharging them, it was necessary to make an arrangement with the creditors, which was done cotemporaneously. Indeed, from the fact that <em>Hickman </em>required an extension of the credit from June till September, it seems probable that this credit was agreed upon beforehand, as one of the terms on which he was to make the purchase and become paymaster to the creditors. He accordingly pays off <em>Wallis if Gibson, </em>and gives his bond to <em>Findlay if Mitchell </em>payable in September. It turned out, however, that the negro was free,- and <em>Hickman </em>now contends that he should not pay off his bond, because the lien of <em>Findlay if Mitchell </em>was worth nothing. His counsel argues that the transaction was a <em>purchase </em>from them of their incumbrance, and that upon that purchase there was an implied warranty of its goodness.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The allegations of the plaintiff\u2019s bill, the responsive statements in the answer, and the facts appearing in the cause, all contradict this position of the counsel. The plaintiff himself says, \u201c At the time of the purchase, it was agreed amongst the said creditors, <em>Jones, </em>and your orator, that if your orator would pay the debt to <em>Wallis if Gibson, </em>and execute his note to <em>Findlay if Mitchell </em>for the balance of the price of the negro, they the said creditors would <em>release and surrender their liens </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>upon the negro.\u201d Here then it appears that there was no <em>sale </em>of their lien, from which a warranty is supposed to have been implied, but a mere <em>release, </em>from which no warranty ever can be implied. If, on the one hand, a saje implies a right to sell, a <em>release, </em>on the other, implies nothing more than a surrender or quitclaim of that right which the party has or may have. And though a consideration be given for the release, and it eventually turn out that the right is good for nothing, yet if there be no fraud, there can be no reclamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">The account of the transaction given in the answer corresponds with that extracted from the bill. The respondents, after stating that they paid <em>Clarice's </em>debt in order to extinguish his prior incumbrance, deny most explicitly a statement made in the bill, that the sale was a joint one by <em>Jones </em>and his creditors. They aver that the consideration of the bond was not a sale by them, but the release of their debt against <em>Jones </em>to that extent; that that release was absolute and unqualified; that it was a change of the debtor, for, upon receiving <em>Hickman's </em>bond, they gave <em>Jones </em>a credit on his note for the amount of that bond. All this is responsive to the matter of the bill, and, it seems to me, is conclusive of the question. <em>Hickman, </em>purchasing from <em>Jones, </em>becomes paymaster to the appellants and <em>Wallis Sf Gibson, </em>paying the latter in cash, giving his bond to the former for their debt, and thereby discharging the negro from the lien, and <em>Jones </em>from his responsibility; who, having parted absolutely with his property, had a right to a discharge, and was in fact discharged, <em>pro tanto.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">\u25a0All the circumstances in the case concur in sustaining this view of it. <em>Jones, </em>and <em>Jones </em>alone, makes the bill of sale, and he gives an express warranty. If the transaction was joint, then this express warranty by one of the three vendors is a negative of an implied warranty by the others. Again, <em>Hickman, </em>instead of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>giving his bond to <em>Jones, </em>gives it to <em>Findlay &amp;f Mitchell. </em>Why ? Because <em>Jones </em>having paid the debt by selling his property, it was unreasonable he should be longer bound, which he would have been, had the bond been given to and assigned by him. On the other hand, <em>Findlay 8f Mitchell, </em>in releasing their lien on the slave, preferred, I presume, the direct responsibility of <em>Hickman, </em>which bound him absolutely, to the indirect course of taking his bond by assignment from <em>Jones, </em>and thus leaving them exposed to possible equities between <em>Hickman </em>and <em>Jones. </em>This bond constituted a new contract, like the draft in <em>Corbin\u2019s adm'r </em>v. <em>Southgate, </em>3 Hen. &amp; Munf. 319. It was a new contract between <em>Findlay &amp; Mitchell </em>and <em>Hickman, </em>by which <em>Hickman </em>paid his own debt to <em>Jones, </em>and <em>Jones\u201ds </em>debt to them. It was a contract, too, on valuable consideration, since, in consideration of it, they released a lien on property which was at that time regarded as liable, and also actually credited, or were at least bound to credit, <em>Jones </em>for the amount. And this was all fair. It was perfectly reasonable that they should be irresponsible for the title. For if a sale had been made under the deed of trust, and <em>Hickman </em>had purchased at that sale, they would not have been liable, though the mortgaged subject proved not to be chargeable, or turned out to be the property of a stranger. <em>Petermans </em>v. <em>Laws, </em>6 Leigh 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Upon the whole, I am of opinion that there is error-in the decree, and that it should be reversed with costs, the injunction dissolved, and the bill dismissed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b387-6\">Parker and Cabell, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ANj\">concurring, decree reversed with costs, injunction dissolved, and bill dismissed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
