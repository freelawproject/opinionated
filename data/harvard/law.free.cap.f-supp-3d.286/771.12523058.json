Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 30, 2016, Tiffanie Branch (\"Branch\") filed a Class Action Complaint on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated, alleging that Government Employees Insurance Company (\"GEICO\") violated Section 1681b (b) (3) (A) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\"FCRA\"). ECF No. 1. Branch then filed an Amended Class Action Complaint on April 11, 2017, which is the operative complaint here. ECF No. 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The parties' initial briefing on GEICO's motion concerned the class that Branch originally proposed, composed of individuals who were assigned a \"Fail\" grade by GEICO because of any deficiency in their background reports.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56. However, at oral argument, Branch's counsel indicated that Branch would narrow the class to those individuals who were assigned a \"Fail\" grade by GEICO specifically because of the criminal history in their background reports. October 3, 2017 Transcript (ECF No. 60) at 42:16-20; September 27, 2017 Transcript (ECF No. 56) at 5:21-6:5. As a result, the parties filed supplemental briefs addressing the summary judgment issues in the context of the narrowed class, ECF No. 65, and this opinion addresses only that class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Branch's Application to GEICO\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Branch applied for employment with GEICO, and, on August 26, 2016, Branch accepted GEICO's offer to join the company as a Liability Claims Representative, which was contingent on a background check. Around the same time, Branch also completed GEICO's Supplemental Information Form for use in connection with the background check. On that form, Branch listed, as her only criminal conviction a December 2015 conviction for petit larceny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 2, GEICO requested a background check on Branch from a consumer reporting agency, General Information Services (\"GIS\"). GIS completed Branch's background report (\"the Report\") and sent it to GEICO on September 21. The Report indicated that Branch had two criminal convictions on her record: the December 2015 misdemeanor petit larceny conviction, as well as, inaccurately, a 2011\n   felony petit larceny conviction. Camacho Decl. (ECF No. 40-4), Ex. 2 at 10. On September 21, after reviewing the Report, a GEICO employee, Brit Collins, assigned it a preliminary grade of \"Fail.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Later that day, another GEICO employee, Latoria Parker (\"Parker\"), called Branch regarding the contents of the Report. The exact details of the conversation are disputed. Branch said that Parker told her that GEICO's job offer was rescinded because of the 2011 felony conviction in the Report. Parker, on the other hand, testified that she informed Branch that she would receive a letter from GIS about the Report because GEICO had concluded that Branch's criminal history would preclude her from employment at GEICO, and that she could dispute the accuracy of the Report. The parties agree, however, that Branch told Parker that the 2011 conviction was a misdemeanor petit larceny conviction, not a felony. That night, Branch e-mailed Parker, further explaining that she had been charged with felony grand larceny but that she had pled guilty to a reduced misdemeanor charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On September 22, 2016, on GEICO's behalf, GIS sent Branch a letter containing the Report and a summary of Branch's FCRA rights (\"the Pre-Adverse Action Letter\"). Branch could not recall whether she ever initiated a dispute with GIS about the accuracy of her Report. But, the record is that, by October 3, neither GIS nor GEICO had heard from Branch, so GIS sent Branch a letter stating that GEICO would not be hiring her based on the contents of the Report (\"the Adverse Action Letter\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    2. GEICO's Job Application Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   GEICO's background check process is described in its Adjudication Process for Background Checks (\"the Adjudication Process\"), Camacho Decl., Ex. 1, which was GEICO's official policy for the use of background reports during the class period, Camacho Decl. \u00b6 4. Once GEICO extends a conditional job offer to an applicant, the applicant must complete a Supplemental Information Form, which contains information that a GEICO employee enters into GIS's system. Adjudication Process at 3-5. GIS then generates a background report and marks each portion of the report as either \"Pass\" or \"Review,\" depending on whether that part satisfies GEICO's employment eligibility requirements. Once GIS completes the background report, a GEICO employee reviews it and assigns it a grade of \"Pass\" or \"Fail,\" based on whether the report meets GEICO's eligibility requirements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Adjudication Process at 6. This review occurs in all cases, even if GIS has given the report a notation of \"Pass.\" GEICO's \"Fail\" grade may be appropriate if the report contains felony\n   convictions or certain misdemeanor convictions, or if the report shows a conviction that was not disclosed on the Supplemental Information Form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As in Branch's case, after GEICO assigns a \"Fail\" grade, GIS sends the Pre-Adverse Action Letter, initiating a seven-business-day \"cure period\" during which the applicant can address the deficiency in the report that led to the \"Fail\" grade. When the \"Fail\" grade relates to the report's criminal history, the applicant must contact GIS directly to dispute the report's accuracy. Nonetheless, a GEICO employee must review the GIS system throughout the cure period to see if the applicant has addressed with GIS the deficiency leading to the \"Fail\" grade. If the applicant has done so, that employee is required to change the grade from \"Fail\" to \"Pass.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   GIS then mails an Adverse Action Letter to any applicant whose background report still has a \"Fail\" grade at the end of the cure period, either because the applicant could not, or failed to, cure the inaccuracy. After GIS sends that letter, a GEICO employee informs the applicant that GEICO has rescinded the offer. The Adjudication Process precludes informing the applicant of the rescission before that point.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   During the class period, GEICO assigned a \"Fail\" grade based on criminal history to the background reports of 426 applicants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The final grades for the reports of 96 individuals were eventually changed to \"Pass.\" In addition, the final grades for the reports of 14 applicants were eventually changed to \"No Grade.\" Suppl. Camacho Decl. (ECF No. 68-1) \u00b6 8.a-.b. This change would have occurred because the applicant did not proceed with the application process for reasons unrelated to the background report, such as failing the drug screening or withdrawing from consideration for a position. Adjudication Process at 8. Finally, the final grades for the reports of 316 applicants from the putative class remained \"Fail\" at the end of the cure period. Suppl. Camacho Decl. \u00b6 8.b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Rule 56 limits the type of evidence that can be considered on a motion for summary judgment. Under that rule, \"[a] party asserting that a fact cannot be ... genuinely disputed must support the assertion by ... citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations ..., admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials.\" Fed.

Parties' Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In paragraphs 25-30 of its Statement of Material Undisputed Facts, GEICO presented information from a spreadsheet that it produced to Branch, which contained details about all individuals whose background reports were assigned a \"Fail\" grade at any time during the hiring process between December 29, 2014 and January 15, 2017. GEICO did not include the spreadsheet as an exhibit, but a GEICO employee, Karen Camacho (\"Camacho\"), provided a declaration with details from the spreadsheet. Camacho Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 11-12. Camacho has given similar information for the individuals in the narrowed class in a supplemental declaration, and the corresponding spreadsheet is attached thereto. Suppl. Camacho Decl. \u00b6 8. GEICO relies on this evidence to show that applicants assigned a \"Fail\" grade have a meaningful opportunity to change that grade during the subsequent cure period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Branch contends that the spreadsheet is hearsay that the Court cannot consider here. Camacho's statements based on the spreadsheet are therefore also hearsay. GEICO concedes that the spreadsheet is hearsay, but asserts that it can be presented in an admissible form at trial through Fed. R. Evid. 803(6) or 1006, thereby satisfying Rule 56(c) (2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the relevant\n   question is whether the spreadsheet could be admitted under either provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Each listing contains data recorded at or near the time by someone with knowledge, either manually or by automated action, and that recording is a regular practice of GIS, which maintains the information on behalf of GEICO; the data are maintained in the course of GEICO's routine background check process; and either Camacho or a GIS employee, such as Christopher Truesdale (\"Truesdale\"), can testify to these conditions. Branch makes three assertions in response: (1) the underlying records are GIS's business records, not GEICO's; (2) this case is different than those cited above because Truesdale used \"specialized queries to gather the information,\" rather than printing it out; and (3) Camacho is not an appropriate custodian witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   All three arguments fail. First, the evidence shows that the underlying records belong to GEICO. It is true that the information that GEICO seeks to introduce is \"resident in GIS's database.\" Truesdale Decl. (ECF No. 40-6) \u00b6 4. But GIS maintains this database on GEICO's behalf. Suppl. Camacho Decl. \u00b6 5. In addition, both GEICO and GIS employees access the database on a regular basis, and several categories of information in the spreadsheet are entered solely by GEICO employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. Branch cites no cases holding that information accessible to, and entered by, one company's employees becomes another company's business records simply because the database in which that\n   information is entered resides on the second company's servers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Moreover, whether the records are GEICO's or GIS's makes no difference, because Rule 803(6) does not require \" 'that the records be prepared by the party who has custody of the documents and seeks to introduce them into evidence.' \"\n   <em>\n    Phoenix Assocs.

Under this approach, certain summaries would not qualify as business records if they are compiled through \"selective extraction.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (spreadsheets were not business records because they \"combine[d] data from at least three different ... databases and ha[d] been edited to remove redundancies\").

Even if Camacho did not qualify to testify about the compilation of the underlying data, Truesdale likely would-a point that Branch does not dispute. Truesdale Decl. \u00b6 2. Accordingly, GEICO has identified two witnesses who can testify that: (1) the information for each applicant was entered into GIS's system at or near the time that information was generated; (2) the persons who entered the information had knowledge of the data they entered; and (3) the information was kept in the course of GEICO's regularly conducted business activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U-Haul Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4039138\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/576/1040/#p1043\">\n    576 F.3d at 1044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The records in GEICO's spreadsheet are admissible under Rule 803(6), as discussed above. Thus, the sole remaining question is whether GEICO has made those records available to Branch, or is capable of doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   GEICO argues that it met this requirement by offering, during a July 20, 2017 telephonic meet-and-confer conference, to give Branch a written explanation for how the spreadsheet was compiled, and to make class members' background report information available electronically at Branch's request. Branch's counsel agreed to respond to this offer if he determined that Branch needed any information beyond what was in the spreadsheet, but never did so. Branch contends that the offer did not satisfy Rule 1006 because an explanation of how the spreadsheet was put together is not the same as the original data itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   This record demonstrates that GEICO has made the information underlying the spreadsheet available in the manner contemplated by Rule 1006. During the July 20 call, GEICO's counsel stated that he would provide an explanation of how the spreadsheet was compiled so that Branch's counsel could \"evaluate it and then ... tell me if you need to know more to assess whether you intend to take a position that\n   [the spreadsheet]'s inauthentic or insufficient.\" ECF No. 68-5 at 56:20-24. Branch correctly points out that an explanation of the summarized data's compilation is not equivalent to the \"original[ ]\" data itself, which is what must be provided. Fed. R. Evid. 1006. After all, the purpose of the availability requirement is \"to afford a process to test the accuracy of the chart's summarization.\"\n   <em>\n    Janati\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9232881\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/263/#p272\">\n    374 F.3d at 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It would be impossible for Branch to do so if she only had an explanation about the summary's compilation, and not the underlying data. Even if printing out the relevant information from GIS's database would be unduly burdensome, GEICO could conceivably produce a copy of the database to Branch,\n   <em>\n    Gen. Refractories Co. v. First State Ins.

Pa. May 29, 2015), or designate a place and time for Branch's counsel to inspect the database. It has done neither.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   However, that failure is not dispositive because the discovery record shows that Branch had all the information needed to ensure the accuracy of the spreadsheet. GEICO objected to Branch's document request for \"[a]ll records for all applicants\" assigned a \"Fail\" grade during the class period as unduly burdensome, given the quantity of that information, and produced the spreadsheet instead. ECF No. 49-3 at 35. But GEICO also produced all of the data from GIS's database for Branch before the July 20 call. And GEICO's counsel made clear-both before and during that call-that GEICO would provide additional information from the database for other class members as necessary to assist Branch's counsel in reviewing the spreadsheet. Branch never responded to these repeated proposals; in fact, Branch's counsel stated during the July 20 call that Branch did not want other class members' information. ECF No. 68-5 at 51:12-15. This failure by Branch's counsel to take up the offers for additional information from the database shows that Branch has received all the information she needs to review the spreadsheet as a summary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

GEICO can therefore satisfy Rule 1006. To hold otherwise would be an exercise in formalism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, GEICO has shown that it could put the spreadsheet in admissible form under Rules 803(6) and 1006.

GEICO characterizes the issue here as a matter of statutory interpretation, which is a question of law that the Court can resolve at the summary judgment stage. And Section 1681b (b) (3) (A)'s language is straightforward: an employer must provide notice to a consumer who will be subject to adverse action based on the contents of a background report only where the employer \"intend[s] to take such adverse action.\" In other words, notice is not required unless the employer has already decided to take adverse action based on a report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   GEICO relies primarily on two cases,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Manuel\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Costa\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   , which involved facts that were very similar to those presented in this action, yet reached opposite conclusions on motions for summary judgment. In\n   <em>\n    Manuel\n   </em>\n   , defendant reviewed criminal background reports generated by a third party, First Advantage, to determine if current or prospective employees were eligible for positions. 123 F.Supp.3d at 814. If an employee was deemed ineligible, defendant entered a code noting that, causing First Advantage to send a \"Pre-Adverse Action Notice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 815. If the employee did not dispute the background report during a five-day cure period, First Advantage then sent an \"Adverse Action Notice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Court observed that coding the employee as ineligible was not a final decision affecting the employee, but rather a \"pending\" decision not to hire, which the employee had a \"meaningful opportunity to dispute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 823. Moreover, the evidence indicated that the defendant \"was willing to investigate any background checks ... that a consumer believed were incorrect or unfair.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nonetheless, the Court denied summary judgment because it concluded that there was a disputed issue of fact as to when the defendant actually took adverse action against plaintiffs and that \"[a] reasonable jury could find that [defendant]'s adverse hiring decision was final when it was first relayed to First Advantage because [defendant] was comfortable adhering to that decision without reviewing it if the individual did not file a dispute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Costa\n   </em>\n   , First Advantage assigned a code to applicants' background reports based on defendant's hiring criteria.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174443\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/841/#p844\">\n    195 F.Supp.3d at 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Indeed, says GEICO, under the Adjudication Process, GEICO\n   <em>\n    cannot\n   </em>\n   rescind a conditional offer unless the applicant has failed to dispute or has failed to cure the report's defects after receiving the Pre-Adverse Action Letter. Furthermore, says GEICO, the dispute process works effectively, as more than 20% of all applicants whose reports were initially assigned a \"Fail\" grade because of criminal history ultimately received a \"Pass\" grade. Therefore, according to GEICO, the assignment of the \"Fail\" grade and the sending of the Pre-Adverse Action Letter have the precise effect that the FCRA intended-that is, to \"slow[ ] down the [hiring] process to allow consumers to dispute or discuss potentially harmful information.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174443\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/841/#p844\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174443\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/841/#p844\">\n    at 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In response, Branch asserts that GEICO's assignment of the \"Fail\" grade is effectively a final decision to withdraw a conditional offer. Branch makes three main points in support of this argument. First, she contends that the cases cited by GEICO regarding internal decisions not being adverse actions do not apply here, because GEICO's communication of the \"Fail\" grade to GIS has an actual effect: starting the automatic process of sending the notices, which an applicant cannot stop without a successful dispute with GIS. Second, under\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Manuel\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   , whether GEICO's assignment of a \"Fail\" grade is an adverse action is a fact question. Given the factual similarity between this case and\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Manuel\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   , Branch argues, the Court necessarily must reach the same conclusion about the existence of a dispute of material fact. Finally, Branch asserts that there is no meaningful dispute process for applicants to resolve inaccuracies in their criminal histories after they receive the Pre-Adverse Action Letter. Indeed, says Branch, the fact that Parker, a GEICO employee, characterized the cure period as allowing applicants to \"have a chance to change GEICO's mind\" permits an inference that GEICO has already reached a final decision when it assigns a \"Fail\" grade, and that inference must be drawn in Branch's favor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The issue here is whether GEICO took an adverse action against Branch and other class members when it assigned a \"Fail\" grade. This Court and others have consistently recognized that an employer's formation of intent to take adverse action and the adverse action itself are distinct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manuel\n   </em>\n   , 123 F.Supp.3d at 822 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Costa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174443\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/841/#p844\">\n    195 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   844-45 ;\n   <em>\n    Moore v.

If, as in\n   <em>\n    Manuel\n   </em>\n   , the process is structured so that an applicant will necessarily suffer adverse action after his report is given a particular grade, then what is apparently an internal decision may actually be a final decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 823 ;\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325449\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/33/569/#p574\">\n    33 F.Supp.3d at 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"An employer cannot satisfy \u00a7 1681b(b) (3) by formally designating some future point in time as the moment of 'final decision' if, in fact, that decision already has been made.\"). Moreover, summary judgment is improper if there is a genuine dispute of fact as to how the background check process works, since a jury would need to determine whether, based on the facts, the employer's action was an internal decision or a final one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manuel\n   </em>\n   , 123 F.Supp.3d at 823.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In contrast, where it is undisputed that an applicant has a legitimate opportunity to cure inaccuracies in a report before receiving an adverse employment decision, assigning a \"Fail\" grade does not necessarily cause any adverse effect, and summary judgment could be appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Costa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174443\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/841/#p844\">\n    195 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   846 ;\n   <em>\n    Ramos v.

Accordingly, GEICO must show that there is no genuine dispute of fact concerning applicants' ability to cure the defects in their reports after receiving the Pre-Adverse Action Letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The record has evidence that supports both parties on this issue. The Pre-Adverse Action Letter contains tentative language, stating that \"GEICO has or will be completing their review of your application within the next few days, and may take action based on the enclosed report.\" Camacho Decl., Ex. 2 at 1. The Adjudication Process also allows seven business days for applicants to cure deficiencies, a longer time than the five-day period in\n   <em>\n    Costa\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Manuel\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   . Adjudication Process at 3. Moreover, the Process explicitly prohibits GEICO employees from rescinding the conditional offer to the applicant at any point before the cure period has expired,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, indicating that GEICO must give the applicant that time to cure. In Branch's case, Parker even reached out to Branch after GEICO assigned her a \"Fail\" grade, which is inconsistent with Branch's contention that GEICO made a final decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4225322\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/141/341/#p348\">\n    141 F.Supp.3d at 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The legitimacy of GEICO's cure process is further demonstrated by applicants' success in correcting inaccuracies. 96 of 426 individuals with an initial \"Fail\" grade because\n   of their criminal histories-more than 20% of the class-were able to change their grades to \"Pass\" through this dispute process. Suppl. Camacho Decl. \u00b6 8.a-.b. This evidence shows that GEICO's cure period is not just a \"\n   <em>\n    pro forma\n   </em>\n   \" one, and that applicants instead have a \"real\" chance \"to change [GEICO]'s mind.\"\n   <em>\n    Magallon v. Robert Half Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4005340\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/311/625/#p633\">\n    311 F.R.D. 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 633 (D. Or. 2015). Indeed, the presence of a similarly effective cure process in\n   <em>\n    Costa\n   </em>\n   was a factor in the court's finding that defendant's coding was not adverse action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174443\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/841/#p844\">\n    195 F.Supp.3d at 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Most of Branch's responses to these points either lack evidentiary support\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   or are otherwise unconvincing. Branch's assertion that GEICO's internal decision is transformed into a final one merely because GEICO communicates the \"Fail\" grade to GIS is unavailing because GIS is acting in this case as GEICO's agent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Costa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174443\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/841/#p844\">\n    195 F.Supp.3d at 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (for purposes of determining when adverse action occurs, \"[i]t matters not that [defendant] ... outsources parts of its process to [a third party]\"). Similarly, Branch does not explain how the cure process for criminal background inaccuracies is insufficient. GEICO is \"not the producer [ ] of the report and the information that's contained [t]here,\" GEICO 30(b)(6) Dep. (ECF No. 40-2) at 82:4-5. Thus, it is unclear why Branch would expect GEICO to correct GIS's mistakes, particularly when GEICO has already delegated other tasks in the hiring process to GIS. Moreover, the Adjudication Process\n   <em>\n    requires\n   </em>\n   GEICO employees to review GIS's system on a regular basis during the cure period to see if the applicant addresses the deficiencies leading to the \"Fail\" grade, and to change the grade from \"Fail\" to \"Pass\" if the applicant does so. Adjudication Process at 7. Thus, there is no substantive difference between having applicants go through GIS or GEICO to correct inaccuracies in their criminal histories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Finally, that the purpose of GEICO's dispute process is to convince GEICO to change its mind is not evidence of a final decision, but rather the very manner in which dispute processes are supposed to operate under the FCRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Magallon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4005340\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/311/625/#p633\">\n    311 F.R.D. at 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]o comply with the [FCRA], an employer who intends to take adverse action must give the applicant an opportunity to change the employer's mind.\"). Branch cites no cases recognizing the supposed distinction between \"changing an employer's mind before the decision process starts\" and \"changing an adverse-action decision after the employer has made it.\" Pl. Suppl. Brief (ECF No. 70) at 9-10. And, even though the Adjudication Process refers to the initial grade for a background report as GEICO's \"final\" hiring decision, the evidence of GEICO's cure process shows that label to be nominal in practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Despite those facts in GEICO's favor, Branch's testimony that Parker told her, before the Adverse Action Letter was even sent, that GEICO was rescinding her offer creates a genuine dispute about the finality of GEICO's decision when it assigns a \"Fail\" grade. This evidence shows only that a GEICO employee deviated from the Adjudication Process-which requires waiting until the end of the cure period to inform an applicant of the rescission of an offer-in one instance. Yet, even if GEICO is right (and it likely is) that a single\n   deviation is not material to whether GEICO has taken adverse action as to\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   class member, this factual dispute is material to the question whether GEICO took adverse action as to Branch in particular. From the disputed evidence, a jury could infer that GEICO already had reached a final decision to rescind Branch's offer when it assigned her a \"Fail\" grade, thereby making the ensuing cure period meaningless in Branch's case. Furthermore, there is no evidence that any GEICO employee contacted Branch after her call with Parker or internally discussed the concerns Branch expressed during the call, so GEICO cannot be said to have \"remain[ed] involved in addressing [Branch]'s challenge\" after that point.\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4225322\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/141/341/#p348\">\n    141 F.Supp.3d at 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   GEICO has presented substantial evidence to show that assigning a \"Fail\" grade is a tentative rather than final decision. The Pre-Adverse Action Letter contained tentative language about an applicant's employment, the Adjudication Process gave applicants a \"meaningful opportunity to dispute\" the background reports, and GEICO \"was willing to investigate any background checks ... that a[n applicant] believed were incorrect\": these are all factors weighing in favor of summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manuel\n   </em>\n   , 123 F.Supp.3d at 823. At the same time, unlike in\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Costa\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   , there is a genuine dispute as to the finality of GEICO's decisionmaking process at the grading stage and GEICO's subsequent involvement with applicants, given the possibility that Parker might have deviated from the Adjudication Process and informed Branch of her offer being rescinded immediately after GEICO assigned her a \"Fail\" grade. As a result, \"[a] reasonable jury could find that [GEICO]'s adverse hiring decision was final when it was first relayed to [GIS]\" because this evidence shows that GEICO had made up its mind to rescind Branch's offer notwithstanding any cure period.\n   <em>\n    Manuel\n   </em>\n   , 123 F.Supp.3d at 823. Accordingly, the Court cannot resolve the adverse action issue at the summary judgment stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Given the factors discussed above, a jury could, at least in Branch's case, consider GEICO's assignment of a \"Fail\" grade a final decision rather than an internal one, such that it could not be reversed following appropriate dispute by Branch. As a result, there is a genuine material dispute about whether GEICO took adverse action against Branch when it assigned her a \"Fail\" grade, making summary judgment on Branch's claim inappropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, GEICO'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT (ECF No. 39) will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   It is so ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    The basis for the \"Fail\" grade is disputed but immaterial here, as that fact does not affect whether assigning the \"Fail\" grade was an adverse action.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Branch disputes that these employees do \"anything more than audit[ ] or confirm[ ] that GIS correctly followed the existing criminal records matrix in adjudicating the applicant.\" Pl. Opp. (ECF No. 45) at 4. But the cited testimony does not use the term \"matrix.\" The Adjudication Process says that GEICO employees use a Criminal Matrix to decide whether to assign a background report a grade of \"Pass\" or \"Fail.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Adjudication Process at 6. GEICO employees' testimony suggests that this is the \"matrix\" that Branch is referencing.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Parker Dep. (ECF No. 40-3) at 76:14-77:9, 78:12-19; Collins Dep. (ECF No. 40-5) at 44:15-45:8, 45:24-47:15. However, neither the Adjudication Process nor that testimony supports Branch's statement that\n    <em>\n     GIS\n    </em>\n    uses the Criminal Matrix, and no evidence indicates that GIS even has possession of the Matrix. Therefore, even assuming that this fact is material, there is no genuine dispute about which entity grades the report.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Matherly v.
