(together, \"Ark\"), and Lynn Tilton (\"Tilton\") move to dismiss Plaintiffs Zohar CDO 2003-1, Ltd. (\"Zohar I\"), Zohar II 2005-1 Ltd. (\"Zohar II\"), and Zohar III, Ltd.'s (\"Zohar III\") (together, \"Zohar\") complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Zohar asserts a dozen claims against Defendants predicated on a massive racketeering conspiracy involving the investment and management of Zohar's assets. The remedies that Zohar seeks through its common law claims include compensatory damages, declaratory relief, an accounting,\n   and restitution. But all such relief is eclipsed by Zohar's request for treble damages under the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (\"RICO\") Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201964\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Defendants seek dismissal of this action in its entirety, both for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) and lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1). For the reasons that follow, Defendants' motion to dismiss is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This civil RICO action arises from an alleged fraudulent investment scheme orchestrated by Tilton and her firms. At bottom, Zohar alleges that Defendants engaged in a wide-ranging conspiracy to enrich themselves by pillaging Zohar's funds and impairing its assets, ultimately rendering it unable to repay investors. Over the course of five years, Defendants created three special purpose vehicles-Zohar I, Zohar II, and Zohar III-that raised and invested more than $2.5 billion dollars in an assortment of distressed companies. Imbued with the authority to act on Zohar's behalf, Defendants made virtually every investment decision-they chose the companies to whom Zohar would lend, monitored the collateral underlying the loans, and provided the companies with consulting and management services. But instead of acting in Zohar's interest-to maximize repayment to noteholders-Defendants exploited their fiduciary status to expropriate Zohar's equity in its portfolio companies, pay themselves dividends, and deceive Zohar and its investors into paying exorbitant fees by misreporting the value of Zohar's collateral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Because Zohar's complaint (the \"Complaint\") focuses on the predicate acts alleged in support of its civil RICO claim, the threshold issue in Defendants' motion to dismiss is whether the alleged scheme is actionable as fraud in the purchase or sale of securities. Indeed, if any one of the predicate acts involves the purchase or sale of securities, the entire claim is foreclosed by the securities fraud bar codified in the RICO statute. Resolving this question requires a more detailed recitation of the Complaint's allegations, which are presumed true on a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Zohar's Creation and Purpose\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Zohar-three special purpose vehicles created by Tilton-raised over $2.5 billion dollars\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   from the sale of collateralized loan obligations (\"CLOs\"), which are essentially investment notes backed by a pool of loans. Zohar used the offering proceeds to make loans to dozens of distressed companies with the aim of rehabilitating their businesses and maximizing profits. (Complaint (\"Compl.\"), ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 40-41.) Zohar loaned money under various arrangements. Some involved standard repayment of principal and interest while others included equity investments in portfolio companies. The latter arrangement-obtaining equity in exchange for a loan-was of paramount importance to Zohar because it offset losses arising from a defaulted loan and offered enormous upside if a portfolio company turned profitable. (Compl. \u00b6 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Defendants' Roles\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Tilton's role in the CLO transactions extended well beyond creating Zohar. She and her investment companies-namely, Patriarch-assumed a panoply of roles in overseeing Zohar's investments. Patriarch's\n   chief task was to manage Zohar's collateral. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.) As collateral manager, Patriarch selected loans and other investments making up the collateral pool. (Compl. \u00b6 28.) Patriarch also assigned some of its affiliates to oversee Zohar's assets-Patriarch Partners Agency Services collected and processed loan payments, and Patriarch Partners Management Group provided management and consulting services to the portfolio companies. (Compl. \u00b6 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Tilton's other entities played pivotal roles in perpetrating the fraudulent scheme. Ark assumed debt or equity positions in portfolio companies alongside Zohar, and Octaluna held preference share rights or interests in Zohar's assets. (Compl. \u00b6 38.) As the conspiracy unfolded, Ark and Octaluna were instrumental in expropriating and obscuring Zohar's ownership interests in portfolio companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Despite the amalgam of entities involved, Tilton exercised unchecked authority and control over all of them as sole director or managing member. As a practical matter, Tilton made virtually every single investment decision for Zohar. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-20, 37-38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Collateral Management\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As with most secured transactions, the parties' activities were governed by a key set of operative documents: the (i) Indenture governed the rights and obligations of the Zohar Fund vis-\u00e0-vis the noteholders, credit enhancer, and controlling party; and (ii) the Collateral Administration Agreement memorialized an agreement between Zohar, Patriarch, and a national bank, as collateral administrator, to provide administrative services concerning the collateral. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 31;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Declaration of Akiva Shapiro in Support of Motion to Dismiss (\"Shapiro Decl.\"), ECF No. 55, Exs. 1, 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A third document-the Collateral Management Agreement-enumerated Patriarch's duties, responsibilities, and privileges as collateral manager. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 31-33.) Chief among Patriarch's duties was the covenant \"not [to] take any action which [it] knows or should be reasonably expected to know in accordance with prevailing market practices [that] would ... adversely affect the interests\" of the noteholders. (Compl. \u00b6 33 (internal citation omitted).) And like all investment advisors, Patriarch owed a number of implied fiduciary duties to Zohar, including the duties of care and loyalty. (Compl. \u00b6 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   One of Patriarch's most important duties as collateral manager was to report Zohar's financial condition and performance through monthly reports and quarterly note valuation reports (\"Monthly Reports\") to stakeholders, including rating agencies and Zohar's noteholders. (Compl. \u00b6 36.) The purpose of these communications, prepared by the collateral administrator, was to apprise noteholders about the condition of the collateral underlying the CLOs. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 36, 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   To ascertain this information, Patriarch performed an Overcollateralization Test (\"OC Test\"), which was designed to calculate the ratio between the outstanding amounts due on the loans in Zohar's portfolio and the principal balances on the senior notes. (Compl. \u00b6 56.) The OC Test results were a barometer of Zohar's ability to collect sufficient amounts on outstanding loans to meet its obligations to senior noteholders. (Compl. \u00b6 56.) Thus, a passing OC Test signaled that the value of the underlying collateral exceeded the balance of the outstanding senior notes, and could be used to satisfy those notes if one of Zohar's loans defaulted. Conversely, a failing OC Test triggered a number of consequences designed to conserve funds, such as suspending payments to certain classes\n   of noteholders and reducing the collateral management fee. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 56-57.) The OC Test results constituted a key component of the Monthly Reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As a collateral manager, Patriarch charged a fee to select and monitor the collateral, and replace any deficient assets. Under the operative Indenture agreements, Patriarch charged a senior management fee and a subordinated management fee, each calculated as 1% of the outstanding principal amount of assets held by Zohar. (Compl. \u00b6 57.) Thus, Patriarch received a 2% management fee, which could be halved if the OC Test produced failing results. (Compl. \u00b6 57.) A severe failure of the OC Test, which the Indenture categorized as an \"Event of Default,\" resulted in even more devastating consequences to Patriarch-the controlling parties\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   were entitled to terminate Patriarch and step in to control Zohar's assets, thus jeopardizing Patriarch's lucrative position to collect \"hundreds of millions of dollars in management fees and preference share distributions.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 57, 65-66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Beginning in 2009, Zohar alleges that the OC Test should have produced failing results in view of the \"significant deterioration\" of the loans in its portfolio. (Compl. \u00b6 58.) Rather than reporting those dismal results, Patriarch and Tilton manipulated the OC Test to yield passing results in the Monthly Reports. (Compl. \u00b6 58.) Patriarch inflated the value of the collateral in two ways. First, based on Tilton's subjective and biased judgment, Patriarch routinely misclassified certain portfolio companies as posing a low credit risk when, in reality, many were on the verge of default. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 59-60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Second, Patriarch fraudulently valued Zohar's debt at par even though Zohar had previously purchased the debt at a significant discount. (Compl. \u00b6 63.) For example, Zohar once purchased a portfolio company's debt originally valued at $29 million for only $5.3 million, reflecting an 82% discount. (Compl. \u00b6 64.) But when calculating the OC Test, Patriarch valued the company's debt at the full $29 million while also rating the distressed company as a low credit risk. (Compl. \u00b6 64.) Patriarch also gave that company a more favorable credit risk rating after restructuring its loans despite the company's inability to make interest payments. Unsurprisingly, that company defaulted seven months after restructuring its debt. (Compl. \u00b6 64.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Zohar alleges that Patriarch manipulated the results of the OC Test to facilitate the payment of more than $700 million in fees over the life of the Zohar funds and to preserve its position as collateral manager. (Compl. \u00b6 65.) To that end, a successful OC Test kept other stakeholders-namely the Controlling Party and Controlling Class-at bay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    Equity Interests and Equity Distributions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The second component of Defendants' alleged scheme involved misappropriating Zohar's equity in its portfolio companies to reap the benefits of equity ownership, such as receiving \"tens of millions of dollars or more\" in dividend and equity distributions. (Compl. \u00b6 50.) Because of their fiduciary position, Defendants played both sides of Zohar's investment decisions-they selected the company which Zohar invested in and then installed Tilton as the company's officer or director to facilitate the exchange of equity for Defendants' benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Capitalizing on a ploy rife with self-dealing, Defendants executed their equity\n   misappropriation scheme in four different ways. First, Defendants used Zohar's funds to obtain equity positions in their name. (Compl. \u00b6 49.) In other words, instead of giving Zohar the equity it should have received in exchange for its loan, Defendants took a slice of the equity for themselves \"without making any contributions, or with only disproportionate or minimal contributions.\" (Compl. \u00b6 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Second, as their equity holdings grew, Defendants siphoned dividends and other distributions that the companies made to their shareholders instead of re-directing those funds to Zohar \"for ultimate distribution to the Zohar Funds' noteholders.\" (Compl. \u00b6 50.) As a result, Defendants reaped an unearned profit estimated in the tens of millions of dollars. (Compl. \u00b6 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Third, in some instances, Defendants simply re-assigned Zohar's equity holdings to themselves. By way of example, in 2009, Patriarch reported that Zohar owned 100% of a certain portfolio company. Three years later, however, after the company was sold for $199 million, Zohar was left empty-handed. To justify this outcome, Patriarch disavowed its previous representations that Zohar ever had an interest in the company and maintained that Defendants were its rightful owners all along. (Compl. \u00b6 51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, Defendants stole voting and other rights associated with Zohar's equity interests. (Compl. \u00b6 52.) Although they kept the equity in Zohar's name, Defendants essentially deprived Zohar of its ability to control its companies by agreeing to contract provisions, on Zohar's behalf, that gave Defendants \"control over the Zohar Funds' assets without any apparent benefit provided to the Zohar Funds.\" (Compl. \u00b6 70.) For example, Defendants required Zohar to obtain the consent of Patriarch Partners Agency Services-Zohar's agent under its loan agreements-before making any loan assignments, a condition that effectively robbed Zohar of the ability to unilaterally sell its loans. (Compl. \u00b6 70.) Patriarch also amended dozens of loan agreements between Zohar and its portfolio companies which had adverse consequences for Zohar, like subordinating its loans to Ark's loans and reducing the interest that borrowers paid on Zohar's loans. (Compl. \u00b6 73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Beginning in September 2015, Tilton executed a series of legal documents transferring Zohar's voting and other rights in its equity to Tilton's entities. These valuable rights were transferred by way of irrevocable proxies or amendments to the LLC or stockholder agreements. Thus, Zohar was forced to relinquish a bevy of rights normally conferred through ownership-the right to change directors or managing members, the right to effect a sale of a company, or the right to veto another party's attempt to exercise equity rights. (Compl. \u00b6 74.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In November 2015, Tilton entered into another round of amendments depriving Zohar of its ability to declare an event of default against a portfolio company, and instead conferred that privilege on herself and her companies. (Compl. \u00b6 75.) And in February 2016, Tilton, by way of amendments to the operative agreements, conferred discretion on Ark to make revolving credit loans and reduced commitment fees that portfolio companies were obligated to pay Zohar. (Compl. \u00b6 76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   After resigning its post as collateral manager in February 2016, Patriarch aggressively laid claim to Zohar's assets. Rather than stealing equity outright, Patriarch began obscuring and concealing the true extent of Zohar's ownership in its companies. When the replacement collateral manager requested Zohar's books and records, Patriarch produced an incomplete set of documents that muddled Zohar's claim over its assets. When the replacement\n   collateral manager confronted Patriarch about these issues, Patriarch continued to obfuscate Zohar's equity holdings. And once the replacement collateral manager commenced a lawsuit to obtain the relevant books and records, Patriarch and Tilton steadfastly maintained that they owned the companies, further clouding Zohar's title. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 81-83.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   V.\n   <em>\n    SEC Enforcement Action\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In March 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") commenced an enforcement action against Tilton and Patriarch, alleging violations of the Investment Advisers Act (\"IAA\"). In essence, the SEC's action presaged many of the allegations in this action, but focused principally on the \"categorization\" issue-namely, Patriarch's misrepresentations concerning the value and quality of Zohar's collateral. Under the SEC's theory of liability, although Defendants were required to provide \"valuation categorizations of [Zohar's] assets and financial statements purportedly reflecting the financial position of each\" of Zohar's funds, they instead \"directed that nearly all valuations of these assets be reported as unchanged from their valuations at the time the assets were originated.\" (\n   <em>\n    In re Lynn Tilton, et al.\n   </em>\n   , Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 203(e), 203(f), and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Section 9(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, and Notice of Hearing, Release No. 4053, dated Mar. 30, 2015 (\"SEC Order\"), at \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.) By miscategorizing Zohar's investments, flouting the categorization methodology set forth in Zohar's governing documents, and misleading investors, the SEC alleges that Defendants reaped \"almost $200 million\" in management fees and retained their control over Zohar's activities. (SEC Order at \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On a motion to dismiss, a court must take \"factual allegations [in the complaint] to be true and draw[ ] all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

According to Defendants, Zohar's sale of CLOs and Defendants' misrepresentations regarding the OC Test results constitute securities fraud. To bolster this argument, Defendants assert that the Complaint imports many of the allegations from the SEC's enforcement action, which involved miscategorizing loan performance, manipulating OC Test results, and misleading investors. Defendants argue that Zohar's pleading \"expressly relies on the same fraud allegations made by the SEC ... so, of course, it could have been actionable as securities fraud.\" (Mot. at 12.) And despite the SEC's decision to bring a claim under the IAA-instead of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act-Defendants contend that the IAA \"expressly regulates conduct that 'relate[s] to the purchase and sale of securities,' including the issuance of 'reports' to investors on which they rely in making investment decisions.\" (Defendants' Reply in Support of Motion to Dismiss (\"Reply\"), ECF No. 60, at 3-4 (internal alteration and citation omitted).) Thus, Defendants claim that because the SEC and investors \"\n   <em>\n    could have\n   </em>\n   brought a securities fraud action based on the conduct alleged in the Complaint, the RICO claim is barred.\" (Reply at 3 (emphasis original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendants are correct that the RICO Amendment extends to allegations supporting\n   any claim brought by any person, but the claim must involve an actionable fraud in the\n   <em>\n    purchase or sale\n   </em>\n   of securities. Equally true is that a civil RICO claim derived from the same allegations as an SEC enforcement action is vulnerable to dismissal under the RICO Amendment since the SEC is the regulatory agency principally tasked with rooting out securities fraud.\n   <em>\n    Bald Eagle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1733445\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/189/321/#p327\">\n    189 F.3d at 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (SEC's complaint alleged the same scheme which \"is at the heart of this RICO action\");\n   <em>\n    Eagletech Comm'cns Inc. v.

But that overlooks the substance of the SEC's claims, which allege that Tilton and Patriarch's misrepresentations to investors about the value of Zohar's assets and their decision to enter into fundamentally conflicted positions to enrich themselves violated their fiduciary duties.

Rather, the Complaint depicts a situation in which this particular aspect of the fraud was perpetrated to retain Defendants' ability to collect management fees in their capacity as collateral manager. (Compl. \u00b6 56.) Defendants' misrepresentations in the Monthly Reports bear an attenuated nexus to the purchase or sale of Zohar's notes because such reports were issued only to investors who had purchased the CLOs long ago.

Zohar sets forth a series of detailed allegations to make out what appears to be a veritable scheme to defraud, but that scheme existed independent of the securities transactions.

Memo. of Law in Opposition to Motion to Dismiss (\"Opp.\"), ECF No. 58, at 10; Compl. \u00b6 58.) The incentive to fraudulently inflate collateral value appears only to have arisen when things went awry-with the collateral underperforming and in danger of failing the OC Test, Defendants were in danger of losing their fees and control over Zohar's assets. But that fraud occurred separate and apart from the sale of Zohar's CLOs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leykin v.

Plaintiffs counter that the notes did \"not trade in a public market\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the [Monthly] Reports are disseminated only to existing investors, unlike reports filed with the SEC by corporate issuers of publicly traded securities.\" (Opp. at 11 (internal quotation marks omitted).)

Nor does the Complaint suggest that the original investors purchased or sold CLOs in a secondary market after Defendants' scheme to defraud had been hatched. Even if CLOs were traded during the life of Zohar's funds, \"incidental purchases and sales\" of the notes, without more, would \"not implicate the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws.\"\n   <em>\n    SEC v.

(\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 176 (\"Defendants \"engage[d] in a common scheme of fraudulent misrepresentations, self-dealing, breaches of trust and fiduciary duty, and outright theft or attempted theft for [a] common purpose.\").) While the OC Test and Monthly Report allegations escape the RICO bar, the allegations relating to Defendants' theft of Zohar's equity interests and distributions are fatal to the RICO claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Zohar characterizes the alleged scheme as a \"classic example of a case of post-investment looting and the concealment thereof that is not actionable under the securities laws,\" but that overlooks the granular mechanics of executing the fraud. (Opp. at 12 (internal quotation marks omitted).) While the sale of the CLO notes may have been incidental to the fraudulent scheme, other securities-namely portfolio company equity-were acquired in connection with the underlying fraud. Indeed, as Zohar alleges, one of Tilton's key objectives in managing the funds was \"loan-to-own or [ ] own-to-loan\" because, according to her, \"the only way to get beyond the face value of the loan is to have that equity upside.\" (Compl. \u00b6 46.) Despite Tilton's apparent confusion over her own investment strategy, Zohar's aim was not only to extend loans to repay its noteholders, but to secure interests in portfolio companies whose equity could later be monetized at a substantial profit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Zohar authorized Defendants to loan and invest its funds in portfolio companies, knowing full well that Defendants were bound by express and implied fiduciary duties to utilize the money in Zohar's interests. Zohar was \"sometimes provided\n   with equity interests in the company in recognition of the distressed nature of loans,\" or in \"connection with restructurings of existing loans to Portfolio Companies.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 43-45, 49.) That equity came in the form of common stock, preferred stock, or LLC membership interests. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 43-45.) As a result, Zohar (along with Defendants) at one point in 2007 held a majority interest in 23 portfolio companies, including 100% in seven of those companies. (Compl. \u00b6 46.) And in 2009, Patriarch boasted equity ownership by Zohar in 43 portfolio companies, of which 14 were completely owned by Zohar. (Compl. \u00b6 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   But instead of using Zohar's funds to transfer all equity interests to Zohar, Defendants often misused the money to acquire equity for themselves. This is a clear example in which a breach of fiduciary duty and a securities transaction coincide. Tilton and Patriarch, authorized to act on Zohar's behalf, were bound to express and implied fiduciary duties. Most sacred of those duties is the duty of loyalty-Zohar trusted Tilton and Patriarch to invest its funds for its benefit and entirely in its own interests. Defendants ignored that duty, instead entering into many transactions involving the extension of a loan and the transfer of equity that were \"made to further [Defendants'] fraudulent scheme; each [transaction] was deceptive because it was neither authorized by, nor disclosed to\" Zohar.\n   <em>\n    Zandford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"352191\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/813/\">\n    535 U.S. at 820-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"352191\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/813/\">\n    122 S.Ct. 1899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

While the\n   <em>\n    Mezzonen\n   </em>\n   defendants sought dismissal under the RICO Amendment by advancing what was in essence a holder claim, the court found that the securities laws \"do [ ] not afford relief to those who forego ... a sale and instead merely hold in reliance of a nondisclosure or misrepresentation.\"\n   <em>\n    Mezzonen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%201037866\">\n    1999 WL 1037866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (internal citations omitted).

Today, however, a single securities transaction that coincides with the fraudulent scheme can be the death knell of a RICO claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Further, Zohar cites\n   <em>\n    Leykin\n   </em>\n   , for the proposition that \"an otherwise legitimate stock transaction that is antecedent, but not integral, to the alleged fraud does not meet the 'in connection with' requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    Leykin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2794883\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/423/229/#p242\">\n    423 F.Supp.2d at 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That may hold true for Zohar's CLO note offerings to its investors, which this Court has already concluded were legitimate stock transactions antecedent to Defendants' fraud. But the other predicate acts giving rise to Zohar's RICO claim existed part and parcel of the purchase or sale of securities-the acquisition of equity (in the form of common stock, preferred stock, or LLC interests) in portfolio companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Zohar takes pains to avoid using the term \"securities\" in the Complaint, and to the extent securities are involved, paints a picture in which they are tangentially involved in the scheme to defraud.

During the pendency of the motion to dismiss, Zohar apparently\n   filed a \"new, and entirely duplicative, omnibus action in Delaware involving 11 of the same portfolio companies that [Zohar] long ago put at issue here,\" (the \"November 2017 Delaware Action\") and designated that action as \"related\" to a case Zohar filed in November 2016 before the Delaware Chancery Court regarding Zohar's control over three other portfolio companies (the \"November 2016 Delaware Action\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Defendants' Ltr. dated Nov. 16, 2017 (\"Def. Nov. 16 Ltr.\"), ECF No. 78, at 2.) Defendants characterize the move as \"blatant forum shopping\" that seeks \"verbatim the relief\" sought in this action. (Def. Nov. 16 Ltr. at 1, 2.) Thus, to prevent the \"procedural gamesmanship\" that Zohar has ostensibly engaged in, Defendants withdrew their initial request for this Court to decline supplemental jurisdiction so that \"the issues already raised in this case concerning ownership and control of all of these portfolio companies can be litigated and resolved here.\" (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 1, 25 n.20,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Def. Nov. 16 Ltr., at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   But the simple fact that Zohar filed an action in Delaware Chancery Court similar to the one here does not militate in favor of this Court's exercise of supplemental jurisdiction. If anything, permitting the state law claims here to proceed in a Delaware state court would uphold values of comity and fairness. The Delaware Chancery Court seems best positioned to adjudicate the remaining state law claims since an action predating this case-the November 2016 Delaware Action-already raised issues pertaining to Zohar's ownership and control over three portfolio companies,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the latest November 2017 Delaware Action implicates \"purported ownership and control of 11 of the portfolio companies.\" (Def. Nov. 16 Ltr. at 2.) The Delaware court is an ideal forum to resolve these equity-related questions because Defendants filed counterclaims in the November 2016 Delaware Action concerning \"the equity ownership of several other companies-including companies that are the subject of Plaintiffs' [November 2017 Delaware Action] complaint and Defendants' new state-court complaints\" in three other states. (Plaintiffs' Dec. 2 Ltr. at 4.) There is substantial overlap between the factual and legal questions invoked by each of the parties' claims in the November 2016 and November 2017 Delaware Actions. And all such claims are pending before the same judge in the Delaware Chancery Court, who is eminently qualified to resolve them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Also relevant here, and worth noting, is the irony behind Defendants' contention that Zohar has engaged in \"gamesmanship\" when, a few days before Zohar filed the November 2017 Delaware Action, Defendants filed three separate state court actions in Michigan, Arizona, and California, respectively, seeking declaratory relief concerning their ownership and control of certain assets. That they would stymie Zohar's efforts to litigate these corporate control cases elsewhere, yet at the same\n   time file their own claims in far-flung state forums, underscores this Court's determination that absent a valid RICO claim, the remaining common law claims should be resolved by state courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Supplemental jurisdiction \"is a doctrine of discretion, not of plaintiff's right. Its justification lies in considerations of judicial economy, convenience, and fairness to litigants; if these are not present a federal court should hesitate to exercise jurisdiction over state claims.\"\n   <em>\n    United Mine Workers v.
