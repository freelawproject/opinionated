Bank of New York Mellon (\"Defendant\"), as trustee for the Certificateholders of CWABS, Inc., Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2005-17 (\"CWABS\"), conducted a foreclosure sale on the Property on February 6, 2017 (\"2017 Foreclosure\") after Defendant was assigned the rights and interests in the mortgage on the Property (the \"Mortgage\") by MERS. The nonjudicial foreclosure was conducted pursuant to the statutory power of sale provided in the Mortgage. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 183 \u00a7 21. Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant did not have the authority to conduct the 2017 Foreclosure and has brought the instant action. I find that the pleadings fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and must be dismissed. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Facts Alleged\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 22, 2005, Daniel and Tammy Lyons (\"Borrowers\") gave the Mortgage and promissory note (the \"Promissory Note\") on the Property to Countrywide Home Loans, Inc.

The PSA provided a cut-off date for assignments for December 1, 2005.

For any Mortgage held through the MERS(R) System, the Mortgage is recorded in the name of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., or MERS(R), as nominee for the owner of the Mortgage Loan, and subsequent assignments of the Mortgage were, or in the future may be, at the discretion of the Master Servicer, registered electronically through the MERS(R) System.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (Docket No. 6, \u00b6 29)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In October 2009, MERS conducted a foreclosure sale on the Property pursuant to the statutory power of sale in the Mortgage.
