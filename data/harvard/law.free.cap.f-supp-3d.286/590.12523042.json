Fischer and defendants Stephen T. Forrest, Jr., Sandra F. Forrest, Shane R. Gebauer, and Brushy Mountain Bee Farm, Inc. (\"Brushy\" and collectively, \"Defendants\"). Fischer alleges that the Defendants used his likeness and proprietary text and images to promote their own competing knock-off version of his product, Bee-Quick, a honey harvesting aid.

Termination of the Fischer-Brushy Relationship\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Around 2010, Brushy allegedly began having trouble obtaining Bee-Quick and decided to sell its own version of the product, Natural Honey Harvester, which it obtains from a third-party vendor. Gebauer Dep. at 54-56, 71; Stephen Forrest Dep. 2 at 36. As a result, on December 10, 2010, a Brushy employee sent Fischer an email stating that Brushy would not be selling Bee-Quick in its 2011 catalogue and asking for an address to which it could ship back its remaining Bee-Quick supply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC 04 Ex. 3b (December 10, 2010 Email).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Fischer asserts that, as a result of the December 10, 2010 email, \"Defendants immediately lost any right, license, or permission to use any of [his] intellectual property, as all such use was permitted solely in the selling of Plaintiff's product.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC 04 \u00b6 35; TAC 07 \u00b6 47. Defendants accept this proposition in their motions for summary judgment. On the bases of the parties' common attestations, the Court, for purposes of this lawsuit, assumes that as of December 10, 2010, Brushy no longer had any \"right,\" \"license,\" or \"permission\" to use Fischer's intellectual property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Fischer did not, however, communicate to Brushy that it no longer had such permission to use his intellectual property until April 2011, when Fischer sent a cease and desist letter, alleging,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that Brushy was engaged in \"copyright infringement.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gebauer Decl. Ex. D. In a letter dated April 14, 2011, Gebauer replied that \"there [did] not seem to be grounds for [Fischer's] request,\" and that Brushy would \"review\" Fischer's concerns if he was more \"specific.\" Gebauer Decl. Ex. E. Fischer does not appear to have responded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   After Brushy's December 10, 2010 email, Brushy did not immediately remove Bee-Quick from its website.

As to the photographs, Fischer claims that Defendants removed metadata from a Bee-Quick photo he provided them, Fischer Dep. at 137, and put their own watermark over his photo, TAC \u00b6 141. With respect to non-photographic materials, although Fischer's claims as to the precise source of the CMI at issue are elusive,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fischer alleges that when Defendants began selling Natural Honey Harvester, they altered their online and print advertisements by replacing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the term \"Fischer's Bee-Quick\" with \"Natural Honey Harvester\" in a sentence describing the product.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fischer Dep. at 131-33, 137; Fischer Aff. at 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fischer v.

Obj. at 2-4. In fact, the Twete affidavit was properly admitted and considered in the Report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Twete attests that she works \"as the Mailroom Supervisor for Midstates Group,\" Twete Aff. \u00b6 2, that Midstates shipped Brushy's 2011 catalogue,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3, that it did so on January 21, 2011,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4, and that she \"would expect\" some, if not all, of Brushy's 2011 catalogues to have been received \"within 7-14 days from the shipment date of January 21, 2011,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. Twete's affidavit attaches two exhibits.

Obj. Ex. B. Fischer argues that the page is Twete's and that it establishes that Twete lacked \"direct knowledge\" of the facts to which she attested because it indicates that Twete joined the company in 2014-after the events at issue. He argues that the Twete affidavit should be excluded as not based on personal knowledge. Obj. at 3 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(1) ). Fischer further argues that the Twete affidavit is contradicted by its attached exhibits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Obj. at 3. Fischer explains that he did not object earlier to receipt of Twete affidavit because he \"felt all the affidavits [submitted] were ...\n   <em>\n    clearly\n   </em>\n   excludable under FRE 806,\" Pl. Obj. Reply at 3 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   These objections fail. Fischer's objection rests almost entirely on the LinkedIn page. Fischer, however, never adduced that page in evidence in connection with briefing on summary judgment, despite being aware that Defendants had offered Twete's affidavit into evidence. (Indeed, Fischer did not take Twete's deposition or object to receipt of her affidavit until after Judge Peck's Report had issued.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   It is, however, well settled that \"[c]ourts generally do not consider new evidence raised in objections to a magistrate judge's report and recommendation.\"\n   <em>\n    Tavares\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%205877548\">\n    2011 WL 5877548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2.

Here, Fischer has not offered any such justification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Moreover, on its face, Twete's affidavit provides an adequate basis on which she is qualified to testify as to the shipment and expected receipt dates of Brushy's 2011 catalogues. She attests that she serves as mailroom supervisor for Brushy, a position that by its nature would tend to imply experience which such matters. She further attests that the statements to which her affidavit is attesting are known to her to be true. Fischer was at liberty to test in a deposition her competence to so attest, whether based on her personal experience or as a custodian familiar with and qualified to testify about Brushy's mailroom records. He did not do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the LinkedIn page that Fischer now presents, based on an Internet download, is plainly inadmissible for any purpose-it has not been authenticated; and the statements in it are inadmissible hearsay. The Court therefore declines to receive Fischer's new evidence or to rule that Twete's unobjected-to affidavit is inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In any event, the affidavit is not the only record evidence that Brushy's acts of alleged infringement date to December 2010. Fischer's own SAC attached as Exhibit 7 a screenshot of a webpage that shows alleged infringement of just such a nature on December 26, 2010, and this exhibit was referenced in Fischer's Third Amended Complaint. TAC \u00b6 52.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fischer's own evidence thus supports the Report's assessment of the date of Defendants' first infringing act.

Statutory Damages for Pre-Registration Infringement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Fischer also objects to the Report's determination that he cannot obtain statutory damages on the ground that Defendants' first infringing act in a series predated Fischer's copyright registration.

On\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, the Court finds, with the Report, that Fischer cannot recover statutory damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Judge Peck reasoned as follows. He noted that Fischer had repeatedly alleged that Defendants lost all right and license to use his intellectual property on December 10, 2010. R &amp; R 2 at 4 n.4. Judge Peck therefore, without objection, used December 10, 2010 as the date after which any use of Fischer's intellectual property by Brushy would constitute copyright infringement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4171721\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/977/268/#p273\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Judge Peck next found\n   that Brushy had kept Bee-Quick on its website until at least December 26, 2010 and had shipped its catalogue containing the allegedly infringing phrases on January 21, 2011. That meant that Brushy had infringed Fischer's copyright in both December 2010 and January 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-26. Judge Peck further found that Fischer had not registered his copyright until February 7, 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On these facts, he held, statutory damages are unavailable, based on uniform case law in this District that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20412\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   imposes a bright-line rule under which such damages (as opposed to actual damages) are unavailable where a defendant's first infringing act occurs before a plaintiff has registered his copyright.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20412\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20412\">\n    at 24-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Judge Peck also rejected Fischer's theory that each republication of his intellectual property constituted a new infringing act. Rather, he held, Brushy's post-registration uses of Fisher's intellectual property were part of a pattern of similar ongoing infringements dating to Brushy's first pre-registration infringement. As Judge Peck explained, Brushy's post-registration uses of Fischer's phrases were largely identical to its pre-registration uses and no appreciable amount of time had passed between the publications.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20412\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20412\">\n    at 25-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In objecting to this aspect of the report, Fischer makes several arguments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Obj. at 4-5; Pl.

Reply at 5 (\"The Complaint ... was wrong on contract law, on copyright law, and factually.\").

In effect, Fischer characterizes this letter to convey that rescission of Brushy's license would first occur in 2012.

It is black letter law that a plaintiff may not alter his pleadings through a brief.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wright v.

Here, Fischer has attempted to do just that, and his repudiation of his pleadings comes late in the litigation, no less.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Obj.

In particular, were Brushy treated as having a valid license through 2012, the issue would then arise whether Defendants' use of Fischer's copyright prior to the date of Fischer's copyright registration had been within or outside the scope of the license he granted them, \"It is black-letter law that a claim for copyright infringement lies when a party's use of copyrighted material exceeds the scope of its license.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. v.

Nov. 9, 2009) ) (collecting cases). Thus, to defeat the defense to statutory damages that Brushy's infringement predated registration of Fischer's copyright, Fischer would have to show that Brushy's use of Fischer's copyrighted material to promote Natural Honey Harvester-by shipping its catalogue with Natural Honey Harvester and the infringing phrases on January 21, 2011, and by advertising Natural Honey Harvester on its website by January 28, 2011-was within Brushy's license. Only if those 2011 acts were within Brushy's license would they not give rise to a claim for copyright infringement. To so establish would require Fischer to repudiate his pleadings, in which he consistently contended that these acts by Brushy were unauthorized.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , TAC 07 \u00b6 26 (\"[N]o permission was granted to use [his] copyrighted works in any way except specifically in the sale of [his] product.\");\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47, 72. And these pleadings were plausible: As the Court noted in denying the motion to dismiss, \"that Fischer['s license] [would] allow[ ] a competitor to repurpose original works he had created, copyrighted, and continued to use to promote and sell his own product-is highly improbable.\"\n   <em>\n    Fischer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20195822\">\n    2015 WL 195822\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Court therefore adopts this aspect of the Report, which rightly held that, as a matter of law, Fischer cannot recover the statutory damages he elected to pursue. Given Fischer's claim that Brushy's license to use Fischer's intellectual property ceased on December 10, 2010, Brushy's uses of that property in December 2010 and January 2011 were acts of infringement that predated Fischer's February 2011 copyright registration, precluding recovery of statutory damages under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20412\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Solid Oak Sketches\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204126543\">\n    2016 WL 4126543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *2 (collecting cases).

Fischer attached images embodying this alleged infringement.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , SAC 07 Exs. 21-22. Fischer did not join these vendors; he instead sought to hold Brushy alone liable for their acts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC 07 \u00b6\u00b6 95, 102, 109, 116. Fischer alleged that Brushy's actions caused the vendors to infringe, for which Brushy is secondarily liable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , TAC 07 at \u00b6\u00b6 51, 83-89, 95, 102, 109, 116; Pl. Obj. Reply at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Report recommended granting Brushy's summary judgment motions as to Fischer's secondary infringement claims, substantially because the vendors' infringements were \"part of a series of related infringements by defendants and the [third parties] of the same copyrighted work\" that predated Fischer's registration of his copyright,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R &amp; R 2 at 29, thereby disentitling Fischer to statutory damages. Fischer objects to that recommendation, arguing that Judge Peck overlooked that these two consolidated cases include \"a distinct and separate action (14cv1307) for secondary infringement,\" Obj. at 5-6, and that Fischer's \"sole reason for filing\n   14cv1307 as a separate action was to seek a separate award of statutory damages for the indirect infringement over and above that for direct infringement,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Fischer's basis for objecting to this aspect of the Report is not entirely clear, but he appears to contend that his filing of two separate lawsuits, rather than consolidating his claims against Brushy into a single lawsuit, entitles him to two statutory damage awards, one for Brushy's direct infringement and another for Brushy's having caused its vendors to infringe on its behalf. Fischer appears to rely on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which allows a copyright owner to elect, in lieu of actual damages, an award of statutory damages \"\n   <em>\n    for all infringements involved in the action\n   </em>\n   with respect to any one work, for which any one infringer is liable individually, or for which any two or more infringers are liable jointly and severally[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Fischer's critique is not responsive to the Report's basis for recommending against an award of statutory damages from Brushy based on the vendors' alleged infringement. Judge Peck acknowledged-and did not overlook-the fact that Fischer had filed two separate suits, including one pursuing a theory of secondary liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R &amp; R 2 at 27-30;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n    at 1, 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But he reasoned that Fischer's claim for separate statutory damages failed as a matter of substantive copyright law, irrespective of the number of lawsuits into which Fischer segmented his claims. Judge Peck found that Brushy's vendors' infringement was part of the series of infringing acts performed or assisted by Brushy that had commenced on December 10, 2010 before Fischer registered his copyright, and, relying primarily on\n   <em>\n    Bouchat v.

He focuses on the fact that he bifurcated his claims into separate lawsuits. He does not, however, respond to the Report's substantive explanation why Brushy does not owe statutory damages. He does not, for example, take issue with the doctrine that disentitles a copyright owner to statutory damages where a series of related infringements began before the owner registered a copyright, or with the Report s conclusion that the vendors' acts of infringement formed part of a series with Brushy's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Because Fischer has not made a specific objection to the Magistrate Judge's findings, Fischer's objection does not trigger\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review.\n   <em>\n    Pinkney v.

Applying that standard, the Court has reviewed the Report's findings on secondary liability for clear error and has found none. For avoidance of doubt, however, even had\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review been warranted, the Court would find no error in Judge Peck's articulation of why statutory damages are unavailable based\n   on Brushy's facilitation of its vendors infringement of Fischer's copyrights.

Fischer argues that Brushy removed CMI in violation of \u00a7 1202 when, in revising its online and print advertisements from promoting Bee-Quick to promoting Natural Honey Harvester, it substituted, in a sentence, the term \"Natural Honey Harvester\" for the term \"Fischer's Bee-Quick.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Pl.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Although Fischer has oscillated in his theories under the DMCA,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   , note 3, the Court, drawing on Fischer's various filings, has identified four items that could serve as an original \"work\" of Fischer's from which Brushy allegedly removed CMI: (1) the website and/or brochure Fischer submitted in conjunction with his copyright registration; (2) the \"description text\" Fischer sent to Brushy; (3) the four copyrighted phrases used in the allegedly offending advertisement; and (4) the phrase to which \"Fischer's\" is attached in the advertisement altered by Brushy: \"Fischer's Bee-Quick is a safe, gentle, and pleasant way to harvest your honey.\" The Court considers these in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Fischer's Brochure and Website\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Fischer testified in his deposition that Brushy removed four sentences from his brochure, Fischer Dep. at 137. Fischer further attested in his affidavit opposing summary judgment that the epigrams relating to his product could also be \"found on various web pages.\" Fischer Aff. at 4. However, even assuming that Fischer's brochure and website are \"works\" covered by the DMCA, the Report correctly found that Fischer cannot maintain a claim based on removal of CMI from either source. That is because no CMI was removed from his original brochure, his website, or a copy or display of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Aside from the four phrases noted above, Brushy's advertisement bears no resemblance whatsoever to Fischer's brochure or website. In those cases where claims of removal of CMI have been held viable, the underlying work has been substantially or entirely reproduced.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bounce Exch.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%208579023\">\n    2015 WL 8579023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-4 (CMI removal claim viable where defendants removed \"shorthand forms\" of plaintiff's name from plaintiff's source code and inserted \"portions of [plaintiff's] code, structure, sequence, and organization\" into its defendants' own code such that the \"[defendant] was selling software source code that was 'substantially similar' to [plaintiff's] proprietary code\");\n   <em>\n    Associated Press v.

Fischer's brochure and website are not, however, copied here. Aside from four discrete phrases among the many used on Fischer's brochure and website, there is no similarity between Fischer's original works and Brushy's advertisement. Brushy cannot be said to have removed CMI from these of Fischer's \"works.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Fischer's \"Description Text\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The \"description text\" that Fischer sent Brushy could, in theory, constitute\n   a \"work\" under the DMCA, because, as noted, the material at issue in a DMCA claim need not be a subject of a registered copyright.\n   <em>\n    Playboy Enterprises Int'l Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201023321\">\n    2016 WL 1023321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5.

This description, and descriptions that Fischer furnished later in this litigation, do not suggest that Fischer sent Brushy\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   singular work; rather, they suggest multiple materials from which Brushy was to construct its own advertisement.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Fischer Aff. at 1 (\"The difference between the print catalog [text] and the website [text] prior to 2008, and the poor artistry in the line art sketch of the Bee-Quick product as compared to those for other products was the primary reason why I kept mailing CDs to the Forrests each fall with camera-ready artwork, photos of the products,\n   <em>\n    and point-of-sales materials\n   </em>\n   .\") (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   TAC 07 \u00b6 71 (\"In all of the above [versions of the online description text], Defendants' had access to and full knowledge of Plaintiff's copyrighted Works, providing them the source material with which to infringe.\").

Fischer's claim instead sounds, if at all, in copyright infringement, but, for the separate reasons noted in the Report relating to the unavailability of the statutory damages that Fisher elected, he cannot prevail on that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Fischer's Four Phrases\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The four phrases originally relating to Fischer's product that Brushy used in modified form in its advertisements are of a different character, but they, too, cannot form the basis of a DMCA claim based on the removal of CMI. CMI exists to\n   inform the public that a work is copyrighted and by whom.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pers. Keepsakes, Inc. v. Personaliziationmall.com, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-CV-5177,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20414803\">\n    2012 WL 414803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 8, 2012) (\"[T]he point of CMI is to inform the public that something is copyrighted and to prevent infringement.\") The DMCA exists, in part, to protect that notice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20414803\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The four phrases of Fischer's that Brushy modified and used, however, are not of such character. Only one even refers to Fischer. No reader would find that the \"Fischer's\" as used in the phrase \"Fischer's Bee-Quick is a safe, gentle, and pleasant way to harvest your honey\" speaks to copyright ownership. No reader would find that this product descriptor signals that a \"James H. Fischer\" or even someone named \"Fischer\" is the copyright holder of the phrase to which it is attached and those surrounding it. The sentence instead advertises Fischer's\n   <em>\n    product\n   </em>\n   , and fairly conveys that Fischer is the owner and/or producer of that product. But that phrase-and the other three phrases at issue-do no convey Fischer's authorship or copyright ownership of these expressions. Although Fischer's name is not part of the trademarked name of Fischer s product, his name frequently appears alongside \"Bee-Quick\" in the product's marketing.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   SAC 04 Ex. 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   An analogy illustrates the point. Imagine that the back cover of the Ian Fleming novel\n   <em>\n    Dr. No.\n   </em>\n   contained the following encomium: \"In Ian Fleming's\n   <em>\n    Dr. No\n   </em>\n   , Fleming shows his mastery of Cold War spycraft.\" Imagine then that a person lifted language from that review to promote a different thriller, writing: \"In John Le Carr\u00e9's\n   <em>\n    Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\n   </em>\n   , Le Carr\u00e9 shows his mastery of Cold War spycraft.\" Whatever the other legal implications of such conduct might be, it is inconceivable that a DMCA claim would lie from the elimination of Fleming's name. The expression at issue does not connote Fleming's copyright ownership of anything, much less the language common to the two book-promoting blurbs. Fischer's name-whose deletion Fischer's DMCA claim challenges-similarly has no CMI relevance as used in Defendants' advertisement. It neither informs the reader that Fischer wrote either the phrase to which \"Fischer's\" is attached or the surrounding text. As the Report recognized, Fischer cannot prevail on a DMCA claim based on the claim that the modified four phrases are the \"work\" from which CMI was removed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    d. \"Fischer's Bee-Quick is a safe, gentle, and pleasant way to harvest your honey.\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   For the same reasons as above, Defendant's having replaced the word \"Fischer's\" with \"Natural Honey Harvester\" is not an act of CMI removal. \"Fischer's\" has no CMI significance as used in the advertisement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

As ostensible proof of such confusion, Fischer relies on the following evidence: a single review that he claims is from Brushy's website; an observation that Google displays Natural Honey Harvester when asked to search for Fischer's Bee-Quick; and the claim that the use of his name in certain of Brushy's URLs constituted initial interest confusion. The Court considers each item in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   As to the review: Fischer attached a single review which he claims he drew from Brushy's website.

Indeed, far from showing that customers were led astray, Fischer's Google evidence appears to indicate the opposite, that is, that his own product overwhelmingly appears when his name is searched. As important, this evidence does not show that Natural Honey Harvester appears instead-it does not indicate that the few search results for sites other than Fischer's product are for Brushy's website. Fischer's evidence further fails to show that, to the limited extent that non-Fischer websites came up as a result of the Google search, these websites presented as a result of the inclusion of his name in Brushy's post-domain URL.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   As to \"initial interest\" confusion: Although Fischer only obliquely mentioned this item in opposing summary judgment, he alleged in his Complaint that Brushy sought to create \"initial interest\" confusion by including Fischer's name in the URL for Natural Honey Harvester, and he returns to this point in his objections to the Report. Obj. at 12 (\"the initial diversion ... is the 'actual confusion' here.\"). Initial interest confusion \"arises when a consumer who searches for the plaintiff's website with the aid of a search engine is directed instead to the defendant's site because of a similarity in the parties' website addresses.\"\n   <em>\n    Savin Corp. v.

He has not come forward with any evidence that consumers were diverted to Brushy's website when searching for Fischer's product online, let alone that such diversion resulted from the inclusion of Fischer's name in the post-domain path of the URL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Fischer thus has not demonstrated any actual confusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Evidence That the Imitative Mark Was Adopted in Bad Faith\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Fischer argues that Brushy's use of Fischer's name in the post-domain URL was adopted in bad faith because \"continuing use of a mark knowing that it is wrongful\" demonstrates bad faith. Obj. at 11 (quoting\n   <em>\n    First Savings Bank, F.S.B. v. U.S. Bancorp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11227501\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/117/1078/#p1088\">\n    117 F.Supp.2d 1078\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1088 (D. Kan. 2000) ). But Fischer has not substantiated his claim that the inclusion of his name in the post-domain URL was done knowingly. There is no evidence direct or circumstantial-whether in the form of testimony, emails and other records, or conduct-so indicating. On the contrary, Gebauer has explained this circumstance as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   When Brushy Mountain switched from the Bee-Quick to the Natural Honey Harvester product, the ad created by Brushy Mountain for the Bee-Quick product was changed, but the URL was mistakenly not changed. Once I learned the URLs contained the words 'Fischers' and 'Fischer's Bee-Quick' I had the URLs changed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Gebauer Decl. \u00b6 9. In his deposition, Fischer gave testimony consistent with this benign explanation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fischer Dep. at 153 (\"Q: [D]id Brushy Mountain, on their website, use the same URL that they sold Bee-Quick as they did when they switched over and started selling Natural Honey Harvester? A: Yes. They continued to use the same URL.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   With the evidence indicating that Brushy's initial maintenance of the earlier URL was an inadvertent error, Fischer is forced to argue that Brushy's failure to remove his name from the URL's was an act of bad faith. But the evidence Fischer adduces does not bear this out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   First, Fischer claims that, based on his \"read[ing] the manuals, stud[ying] the training videos, and sp[eaking] with tech staff at Dyacomp,\" the software used by Gebauer does not now operate as Gebauer claims it does. Fischer Aff. at 8. Fischer's lay conclusion to this effect does not suffice to substantiate this claim as to the\n   operation of his competitor's software. He has not, for example, deposed a Dyacomp employee or, for that matter, come forward with documentary or testimonial evidence that the website functions other than as Gebauer has stated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Second, Fischer notes that Brushy's website retains two links, archived in its web server, that contain Fischer's name. Pl. Obj. Reply at 7. At argument before Judge Peck, however, Brushy's lawyer emphasized that the links do not appear on any page advertising Defendants' products, and explained that the two links were not removed from the website archives out of a concern that such removal \"could be perceived as spoliation of evidence.\" R &amp; R 2 at 46 n.30. Fischer has not come forward with contrary evidence as to the operation of, or the reason for the retention of, these two links.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   These slender threads are insufficient to establish this important\n   <em>\n    Polaroid\n   </em>\n   factor. \"[T]o show bad faith, a plaintiff must show that the defendant intended to create confusion between the products or marks at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Crye Precision LLC v.

Fischer, however, has not shown any action by Defendants undertaken with intent to confuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Sophistication of the Consumers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Fischer argues that \"the sophistication of the consumer here actually makes it more likely that they were confused as they would know that Fischer's name was synonymous with quality bee-keeping products.\" Pl. Br. at 21. However, Judge Peck persuasively refuted that argument, emphasizing the context in which Fischer's name appears on Defendants' website: \"Whether defined as the typical consumer of beekeeping products, or Internet users writ large, no ordinary consumer is likely to see Fischer's name in the post-domain path of the URL and wonder if that signified his endorsement of a completely different product in the accompanying web page.\" R &amp; R 2 at 49 n.34. This factor, too, as Judge Peck found, does not assist Fischer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Other Considerations and Overall Assessment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The Court considers two other aspects of Judge Peck's analysis with which Fischer takes issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   First, Fischer objects that the Report, in analyzing the likelihood of consumer confusion, cited a case that dealt with \"domain squatting,\" a situation not present here. Obj. at 10 (citing R &amp; R 2 at 46). But Judge Peck's Report cited\n   <em>\n    Interactive Products Corp. v. a2z Mobile Office Sols., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9314682\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/326/687/#p692\">\n    326 F.3d 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 692 (6th Cir. 2003), not as controlling precedent but because that case \"provid[es] a helpful discussion of the mechanics of website URLs,\" R &amp; R 2 at 48 n.32; that decision, however, as Judge Peck emphasized, \"d[id] not guide the [Report's] consumer confusion analysis,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9314682\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/326/687/#p692\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And, on its review, the Court agrees that\n   <em>\n    Interactive Products Corp.\n   </em>\n   is useful as a guide to the concept of post-domain paths. The Sixth Circuit helpfully explained that while trademark names used in domain names often give rise to trademark infringement claims because domain names \"usually signify source,\" post-domain paths usually do not do so.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9314682\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/326/687/#p692\">\n    326 F.3d at 696-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the Sixth Circuit explained: \"Typically, web pages containing post-domain paths are not reached by entering the full URL into a browser; instead, these secondary pages are usually reached via a link from the website's homepage, which does not contain a post-domain path.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9314682\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/326/687/#p692\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9314682\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/326/687/#p692\">\n    at 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"A post-domain path ... merely shows how a website's data is organized within the host computer's files.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9314682\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/326/687/#p692\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9314682\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/326/687/#p692\">\n    at 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Sixth Circuit's discussion reasonably informed Judge Peck's assessment that, in considering the likelihood of consumer confusion, it\n   is important to distinguish between a domain name and a post-domain path.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   To be sure, that a competitor's trademark was situated in a post-domain path does not preclude a finding of likely confusion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    H-D U.S.A., LLC v. SunFrog, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-CV-711-JPS,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203261709\">\n    2017 WL 3261709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-5 (E.D. Wis. July 31, 2017) (issuing preliminary injunction based in part on evidence that placement of a trademark in a post-domain path was done with intent to confuse and that the post-domain path led to a website selling counterfeit products). But Judge Peck did not hold otherwise, and, for the reasons noted above, the factors yielding the finding of likely confusion in\n   <em>\n    H-D U.S.A.\n   </em>\n   , are not present here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Second, Fischer objects that, in the likelihood of confusion inquiry, the continued use of a mark after the termination of a licensing agreement should be a factor in his favor. Obj. at 11. Courts in this district have indeed held that \" '[w]hen an ex-licensee continues to use a mark after its license expires, likelihood of confusion is established as a matter of law.' \"\n   <em>\n    Microban Prod. Co. v. API Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 14 CIV. 41 KPF,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201856471\">\n    2014 WL 1856471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (S.D.N.Y. May 8, 2014) (quoting\n   <em>\n    L &amp; L Wings, Inc. v. Marco-Destin, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690991\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/676/179/#p188\">\n    676 F.Supp.2d 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 188 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) ). Here, however, as Judge Peck recognized, Brushy has not used Fischer's name as a mark. Fischer does not, for example, allege-let alone establish-that, after termination of its license, Brushy continued to sell its products with Fischer's logo attached to them or to use Fischer's name in the domain name of its website. Fischer's claim instead is that consumers are likely to be confused as to whether he sponsors or endorses Natural Honey Harvester merely because his name appears in the post-domain path of some of Brushy's URLs. The cases on which Fischer relies, applying a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   rule to use of a mark by former licensees, are not applicable to this circumstance, in which the fact-intensive\n   <em>\n    Polaroid\n   </em>\n   test properly applies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kelly-Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3574932\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/295/#p307\">\n    717 F.3d at 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   In the end, the decisive question is whether, \"looking at the [marks] in their totality, consumers are likely to be confused.\"\n   <em>\n    Starbucks Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3494843\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/97/#p115\">\n    588 F.3d at 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation omitted). \"Likelihood of confusion means a probability of confusion; it is not sufficient if confusion is merely possible.\"\n   <em>\n    Estee Lauder Inc. v.

Here, although there are factors that favor Fischer, those the Court finds most decisive disfavor Fischer's claim. He has not shown actual confusion or bad faith. And the sole use of his name is not as a mark. Fischer's name is instead tucked away in the post-domain path of Brushy's URL. The Court concludes, with Judge Peck, that, as a matter of law, Fischer \" 'cannot possibly show confusion as to source or sponsorship.' \"\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269292\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/229/240/#p251\">\n    229 F.Supp.3d at 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pirone\n   </em>\n   , 894 F.2d at 585 ). On the evidence adduced, consumers are not at all likely to be confused as to whether Fischer endorses or sponsors Natural Honey Harvester based on the fact that his name appears in the post-domain path of Brushy's URLs. The Court therefore agrees that Brushy's motions for summary judgment on Fischer's false endorsement claims are property granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Fischer's Unfair Competition Claim Under New York Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Fischer next objects to the Report's recommendation that the Court grant summary judgment in favor of Brushy on Fischer's common law unfair competition claim, brought under New York law. Obj. at 10-12. Fischer argues that, in so recommending, Judge Peck improperly resolved\n   an issue of fact as to whether there was actual confusion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   The Court's discussion above controls as to this point. The elements of an unfair competition claim under New York law are identical to the elements of an unfair competition claim under the Lanham Act, save that the plaintiff must also show \"bad faith by the infringing party.\"\n   <em>\n    Int'l Diamond Importers, Inc. v.

Here, for the reasons above, Fischer has not made out a viable Lanham Act claim, and has not adduced evidence sufficient to support a finding of bad faith on Brushy's part. Brushy's summary judgment motion on this claim is, therefore, granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <strong>\n    G.
