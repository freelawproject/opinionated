Plaintiffs alleged that conditions placed on HRH's liquor license-which barred Scahill from entering HRH's pub, the Alibi-violated their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and freedom of association, and that the Board brought enforcement actions against HRH in retaliation for plaintiffs' lawsuits against the Board. Plaintiffs also claimed that the order violated their Fifth Amendment rights to liberty, due process, and freedom of movement and violated the unconstitutional conditions doctrine. Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants filed a motion to dismiss under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), arguing that plaintiffs lacked standing and failed to state a claim. The Court granted the motion, finding that a prior D.C. Court of Appeals decision precluded HRH from claiming it had standing on its claims related to the Board's order and that plaintiffs did not state plausible claims to relief. Mem. Op. at 33;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Order (\"September 25 Order\") [ECF No. 13].

Plaintiffs then voluntarily dismissed their claims against the John Doe defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response to Order to Show Cause [ECF No. 17]. However, HRH also filed a motion to: (1) reconsider the Court's decision regarding HRH's standing, thereby seeking to revive HRH's First and Fifth Amendment and unconstitutional conditions claims; and (2) amend plaintiffs' complaint to provide more detailed facts, in order to revive their retaliation claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.

Court of Appeals decision precluded later courts from finding that HRH has standing. HRH asserts that it was fined by the Board after briefing closed on the motion to dismiss, and that this factual change triggers the curable defect exception to issue preclusion. HRH Mot. at 3-5. HRH also claims that issue preclusion should not have applied in the first place, because standing under the D.C. Administrative Procedure Act (DCAPA) is not the same issue as Article III standing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 5-6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before the Court can reach the merits of HRH's reconsideration motion, it\n   must first resolve a dispute over the applicable standard of review. HRH argues that its motion is properly brought under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) because the September 25 Order was not a final order. HRH Mot. at 2 n.2; Reply Br. in Supp. of Pl. HRH's Mot. for Reconsideration and for Leave to Amend the Compl. (\"Reply\") [ECF No. 23] at 1, 5-6. Under this Rule, a court may revise its decisions \"at any time before the entry of a judgment adjudicating all the claims and all the parties' rights and liabilities.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). The District, on the other hand, claims that plaintiffs' voluntary dismissal of the John Does eliminated the final claims in the case, thus transforming the September 25 Order into a final order that may be reconsidered only under Rule 59(e).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 4-5. That Rule allows a party to move to \"alter or amend a judgment\" already entered. Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e). The Court must therefore determine whether plaintiffs' voluntary dismissal of the John Doe plaintiffs transformed the September 25 Order into a final one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"A decision is final only if it 'ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.' \"\n   <em>\n    Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. All Plumbing, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086265,12310010\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/153/\">\n    812 F.3d 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 156 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (citation omitted). Therefore, a court must resolve all claims against all defendants before an order may be deemed final. This is a procedure that the parties themselves can only rarely control. \"The judge, not the parties, is meant to be the dispatcher who controls the circumstances and timing of the entry of final judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Blue v. D.C. Pub. Sch.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183803,4110299\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/764/11/\">\n    764 F.3d 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 18 (D.C. Cir. 2014). Thus, a court can render a prior order final by involuntarily dismissing remaining claims or parties, even without prejudice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183803,4110299\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/764/11/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the D.C. Circuit \"treats voluntary but non-prejudicial dismissals of remaining claims [by plaintiffs themselves] as generally insufficient to render final and appealable a prior order disposing of only part of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183803,4110299\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/764/11/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183803,4110299\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/764/11/\">\n    at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, plaintiffs dismissed their claims against the John Doe defendants on their own initiative, and did not indicate that they were doing so with prejudice. Response to Order to Show Cause at 1;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(B) (\"Unless the notice or stipulation [of dismissal] states otherwise, the dismissal is without prejudice.\"). Hence, the September 25 Order cannot be retroactively declared final based on their voluntary dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Moreover, the Court granted defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiffs' amended complaint as against the Board and the District.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   September 25 Order. The September 25 Order did not dismiss the\n   <em>\n    action\n   </em>\n   in its entirety. Nor did the Court dismiss the complaint with prejudice. \"In evaluating the finality of district court rulings on motions to dismiss, [the D.C. Circuit has] distinguished between orders dismissing the\n   <em>\n    action\n   </em>\n   , which are final, ... and orders dismissing the\n   <em>\n    complaint\n   </em>\n   , which, if rendered 'without prejudice,' are 'typically' not final ....\"\n   <em>\n    Attias v. Carefirst, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275635\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/620/#p623\">\n    865 F.3d 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 623 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (citations omitted). As this Court neither dismissed the action nor was involved in dismissing the claims against the John Doe defendants, the Court's prior order was not final.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Thus, HRH is correct that its reconsideration motion must be treated as a Rule 54(b) motion, not a Rule 59(e) motion. Unlike Rule 59(e), which \"sets a high threshold for parties to raise a new argument for the first time after judgment,\"\n   <em>\n    Cobell v.

RECONSIDERATION OF ISSUE PRECLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   HRH has moved for reconsideration on only one issue: the preclusive effect of the D.C. Court of Appeals' prior decision on HRH's standing to challenge the Board's order. Particularly because the parties did not have the opportunity to brief this issue prior to the September 25 Order, the Court takes seriously its obligation to reexamine the preclusion holding. Ultimately, however, HRH's two attacks on that holding are unconvincing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The Curable Defect Exception\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   HRH first argues that the Board's decision on July 20, 2017 to fine HRH $4,000 for violating the terms of its liquor license, and HRH's payment of that fine, cured any jurisdictional defect identified by the D.C. Court of Appeals. HRH Mot. at 4-5. HRH thereby invokes the curable defect exception to issue preclusion, which \"allows relitigation of jurisdictional dismissals when a precondition requisite to the court's proceeding with the original suit was not alleged or proven, and is supplied in the second suit.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Ass'n of Home Builders v. EPA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222328,4192095\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/786/34/\">\n    786 F.3d 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 41 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). To break the shield of issue preclusion under this exception, a plaintiff must show that \"a material change following dismissal cured the original jurisdictional deficiency.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222328,4192095\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/786/34/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Here, the factual change-the Board's decision to fine HRH-\"follow[ed] dismissal\": it occurred in July 2017, about nine months after the D.C. Court of Appeals dismissed HRH's original appeal. The Board's decision was also a material change, although the District seeks to claim otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 8-10. To work a material change, \"[t]he new fact or occurrence must be separate and distinct from the past transaction that formed the basis for the original cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    Newdow v. Bush\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9027945\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/355/265/#p275\">\n    355 F.Supp.2d 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 275 (D.D.C. 2005). The District claims that the fine was simply a result of the Board's order, so the fine cannot be an injury if-as the D.C. Court of Appeals found-the order itself was not. Opp'n at 9. This is not quite true. The fine was indeed a result of the Board's order, but that does not mean that it did not create a new injury. The D.C. Court of Appeals found that HRH had not been injured by the order, which it characterized as granting HRH a liquor license on condition that it \"enforce the barring notice it had issued against Martin Scahill, a person not affiliated with the business according to [HRH's] own statements below.\"\n   <em>\n    HRH Servs., LLC v. D.C. Alcoholic Beverage Control Bd.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-AA-758 (D.C. Oct. 13, 2016) (Ex. C, Mot. to Dismiss [ECF 10-3] ). In other words, the court appeared to believe that it did HRH no harm to codify its own barring notice, when the person barred was no more critical to HRH's business than was any other person. When the Board fined HRH, on the other hand, it caused HRH direct economic harm. The fine thus\n   \"cause[d] a different type of injury\" than did the order itself.\n   <em>\n    Newdow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9027945\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/355/265/#p275\">\n    355 F.Supp.2d at 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   However, the fine does not ultimately trigger the curable defect exception, because it was imposed too late to make a difference. The standing inquiry is \"focused on whether the party invoking jurisdiction had the requisite stake in the outcome\n   <em>\n    when the suit was filed\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Davis v. FEC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677135\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/724/#p734\">\n    554 U.S. 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 734,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677135\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/724/#p734\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677135\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/724/#p734\">\n    171 L.Ed.2d 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008) (emphasis added). Plaintiffs filed this suit in October 2016, nine months before the Board fined HRH.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. [ECF No. 1]. Thus, HRH had no greater injury at the time at which standing must be assessed for this case than it did at the time the D.C. Court of Appeals determined that it had suffered no injury-in-fact. Indeed, the complaint in this suit was filed a mere five days after the D.C. Court of Appeals' standing decision. \"The question for issue preclusion purposes is not whether that court was right or whether [HRH] actually does have standing, but rather whether [the proffered factual change] makes a difference for standing and thus comes within the curable defect exception.\"\n   <em>\n    Newdow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9027945\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/355/265/#p275\">\n    355 F.Supp.2d at 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Board's fine of HRH did not injure HRH during the period of time when it would have made a difference. Hence, it could not cure the jurisdictional defect that the D.C. Court of Appeals found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The \"Same Issue\" Requirement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   For its second gambit, HRH claims that DCAPA standing and Article III standing do not constitute the \"same issue,\" and that therefore the D.C. Court of Appeals' decision on the former does not preclude HRH from arguing the latter. HRH Mot. at 5-6. Because HRH's claim, in the main, relies on \"arguments that [the Court] has already rejected on the merits,\"\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201750248\">\n    2017 WL 1750248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3, less ink need be spilled in disposing of it. It is true that DCAPA standing incorporates the prudential standing doctrines the Supreme Court has developed for cases under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, so that DCAPA standing requires more than does Article III standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mallof v. D.C. Bd. of Elections &amp; Ethics\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7286540\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/1/383/\">\n    1 A.3d 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 394 &amp; n.51 (D.C. 2010) ;\n   <em>\n    Dupont Circle Citizens Ass'n v.

However, the issue that the D.C. Court of Appeals decided, and the issue that was therefore precluded, was whether HRH had suffered an injury-in-fact-a requirement that\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   identical under both standing doctrines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. Op. at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   HRH responds that the D.C. Court of Appeals' order did not state the grounds on which it determined that HRH lacked DCAPA standing. HRH Mot. at 6; Reply at 4. But the D.C. Court of Appeals' order cannot be interpreted as resting on anything other than the injury-in-fact requirement. As this Court has previously noted, the D.C. Court of Appeals described the Board's order as making HRH \"enforce the barring notice it had issued against Martin Scahill,\" who was \"\n   <em>\n    not affiliated with the business\n   </em>\n   .\" Mem. Op. at 7-8 (quoting\n   <em>\n    HRH Servs.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-AA-758). The\n   court also cited a prior D.C. Court of Appeals decision as authority for dismissing the case, with a parenthetical quoting that decision's holding that \"[a] party has not been ... aggrieved by agency action unless [there is] some actual or threatened 'injury in fact' from the challenged agency action.\"\n   <em>\n    HRH Servs.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-AA-758 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Dist.

Op. at 8. The court cited no authority regarding the other prongs of DCAPA standing. The only reasonable way to read the court's admittedly terse order is that it did not believe the conditions imposed on HRH's liquor license constituted an injury-in-fact. Because the injury-in-fact requirement is the same under Article III as it is under the DCAPA, there is no basis for reconsidering the Court's preclusion holding. HRH's motion for reconsideration will be denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C. AMENDING THE COMPLAINT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In addition to its request for reconsideration, HRH moves to amend plaintiffs' complaint to add more details in support of plaintiffs' First Amendment retaliation claims.

Within the complaint itself, HRH alleges that the Board's main investigator, Mark Brashears, indicated a causal connection between HRH's First Amendment activity and his investigations when he \"stated that Mr. Scahill 'did this to himself.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56 (\"On June 10, 2016, Investigator Brashears rationalized the heightened scrutiny and harassment by stating that Mr. Scahill 'did this to himself.' \"). But this allegation actually undermines HRH's claim, because it shows that Brashears was, if anything, preoccupied by\n   <em>\n    Scahill's\n   </em>\n   past actions rather than by HRH's activity. Scahill was not the party who engaged in the protected conduct, nor is he alleged to be the one against whom the Board retaliated. Within the complaint itself, then, there is evidence that something other than HRH's motion for reconsideration was the but-for cause of the Board's inspections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   HRH's position becomes far more tenuous once one takes into account the evidence later presented at the Board's show cause hearing.

Moreover, a court may take \" 'judicial notice of facts on the public record,' \" such as the facts evidenced at the Board's hearing that became part of the July 19 Board Order.\n   <em>\n    Covad Commc'ns Co. v.

The July 19 Board Order, therefore, is properly before the Court even on a motion to dismiss. And the facts displayed in that order make it irrational to infer retaliation from the Board's investigations of the Alibi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The July 19 Board Order contradicts or tempers many of the factual allegations made in the SAC. For instance, the order states that Cullings testified that she was \"not familiar with Mr. Scahill and could not definitively identify Mr. Scahill ... even with the photograph she was given.\" July 19 Board Order \u00b6 14. But Cullings also testified that \"she has no 'reasonable basis to doubt' [Brashears'] identification of Mr. Scahill.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4293816\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/85/13/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Combined with Brashears' own testimony that he saw Scahill speaking with the Alibi's owner, Rachel Traverso; that Scahill was working at the Alibi while Brashears was investigating; and that Traverso responded to Brashears' questioning about Scahill being there by saying to Scahill \"you're not supposed to be here. If you don't leave, I'm going to call the police,\" the Board had sufficient evidence to find HRH in violation of its license conditions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-16. That the Board charged HRH with violating its license conditions and fined HRH despite Cullings' equivocal statements is thus far more plausibly attributed to the totality of evidence available to the Board than to the retaliatory motive HRH ascribes to the Board.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HRH Mot. at 8; SAC \u00b6 63. The Board order also contradicts the SAC's claim that Brashears came to the Alibi \"to harass the staff and management.\" SAC \u00b6 56. This claim clashes with testimony that Brashears visited the Alibi to investigate potential violations of its liquor license, and that any rudeness on Brashears' part was a side-effect of his attempts to prevent Alibi staff from stonewalling his investigative efforts. July 19 Board Order \u00b6\u00b6 12, 15-17, 19, 22-23. Giving proper weight to HRH's contradicted factual allegations, there is little beyond temporal proximity to suggest that HRH's reconsideration motion was the but-for cause of the Board's investigations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Most importantly, the Board order shows that Brashears began investigating the Alibi on June 10, 2016 not because HRH had filed its reconsideration motion, but rather because he \"became aware that [the Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration] had received a complaint that Martin Scahill was at [the] Alibi.\" July 19 Board Order \u00b6 12. Similarly, Brashears testified that his July inspections were\n   spurred by another complaint to the agency that Scahill was at the Alibi.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. Rachel Traverso was present at the show cause hearing and able to testify, and HRH's attorneys were free to put forward an alternative rationale.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. Yet there is no indication that any party gave any other explanation for Brashears' activities. This direct explanation for the Board's inspections is far more persuasive than any inference of retaliatory intent that might be drawn from their temporal proximity to HRH's reconsideration motion. \"This is thus not a case in which the plaintiff and defendant each present plausible explanations for the facts alleged.\"\n   <em>\n    Arpaio v.

Court of Appeals decision that created the possibility of preclusion. However, given the flexibility of the Rule 54(b) analysis, and the fact that the Court brought up the question of issue preclusion\n    <em>\n     sua sponte\n    </em>\n    , plaintiffs' failure to alert the Court to the fine earlier will not be held against them.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    It should also be noted that the Court already considered most of plaintiffs' claims on the merits because it found that Scahill had standing. Mem. Op. at 17. HRH's alleged rights and injuries are nearly identical to Scahill's, and are thus very similar to those the Court already found wanting with respect to Scahill's speech, association, freedom of movement, and liberty claims.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 20-23, 28-30; Second Am.

And, without reaching the merits of the unconstitutional conditions claim, the Court notes that the constitutional rights HRH alleges were given up as conditions for receiving a liquor license appear to be the same rights the Court has already adjudicated as to the other claims.\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    Mem.
