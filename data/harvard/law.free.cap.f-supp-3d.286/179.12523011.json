DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The plaintiff raises several claims against her employer, including employment discrimination on the basis of race, gender, and disability, in violation of Title VII, the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and the DCHRA; retaliation, in violation of Title VII, the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and the DCHRA; hostile work environment, in violation of Title VII, the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and the DCHRA; and failure to accommodate, in violation of the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and the DCHRA.

The Plaintiff's DCHRA Claims Are Procedurally Barred\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The defendant first argued that the plaintiff's DCHRA claims are procedurally barred in its reply supporting its partial motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. Dismiss Reply at 2. Accordingly, that argument was rejected given the \"well established\" principle \"that district courts need not-and indeed, generally should not-consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief\" so as to afford the opposing party ample time to respond to the arguments against it. Mot. Dismiss Order at 3. In the pending motion, the defendant renews this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Under District of Columbia law, \"[a]ny person claiming to be aggrieved by an unlawful discriminatory practice shall have a cause of action in any court of competent jurisdiction for damages and such other remedies as may be appropriate, unless such person has filed a complaint\" with the District's Office of Human Rights. D.C. Code. Ann. \u00a7 2-1403.16(a). Thus, individuals bringing DCHRA claims are \"offered two possible paths to redress:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   they may file a complaint either in court or with OHR.

The plaintiff nevertheless maintains that the defendant has forfeited any challenge to the DCHRA claims as procedurally barred because according to the plaintiff, this challenge amounts to \"an assertion that Plaintiff has brought forth a claim upon which the Court cannot grant her a relief,\" which, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(h)(2), was required to be raised in a motion to dismiss. Pl.'s Opp'n at 64. The plaintiff is mistaken, for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   First, the plaintiff is incorrect that the defendant's challenge is one that needed to be raised in a motion to dismiss. Instead, this challenge addresses the Court's power to consider the plaintiff's DCHRA claims, and was initially raised as such. Def.'s Reply Mot. Dismiss at 3. Such claims may be raised at any time during the litigation, and \"[i]f the court determines at any time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 12(h)(3). Given the undisputed facts that the plaintiff elected to file an OHR complaint and that OHR issued a final determination on that complaint, the plaintiff cannot now seek to pursue those same claims in federal district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Moreover, the plaintiff's argument ignores the fact that any concern about the timing of raising this challenge during briefing on the defendant's Motion to Dismiss is no longer present. This jurisdictional argument was previously rejected in order to give the plaintiff time to consider and respond to the defendant's position, raised for the first time in a reply brief. The cases cited by the Court expressly reference the concern that arguments raised for the first time in reply briefs deprive the opposing party of adequate time to consider all the arguments raised against it.

The history of plaintiff's requests for accommodations and the defendant's various responses, as described\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   in Part I.A-C, is lengthy. That saga, while protracted, does not show that the defendant \"fail[ed] to participate in good faith\" or failed \"to make reasonable efforts to help [the plaintiff] determine what specific accommodations are necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4178994,4110651\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/762/24/\">\n    762 F.3d at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

The defendant evidently attempted to assist the plaintiff throughout her lengthy attempt to get accommodations, both by advising her and by providing her with the necessary forms. While there were gaps in the chain of events and several delays, the defendant at no point ended the interactive process and, indeed, worked with the plaintiff until she received her requested equipment and was approved for telecommuting. On this record, MPD did not fail to provide a reasonable accommodation for the plaintiff's disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
