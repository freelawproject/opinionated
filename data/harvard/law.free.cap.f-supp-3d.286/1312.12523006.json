The parties have consented to the exercise of jurisdiction by the Magistrate Judge, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), for all proceedings in this Court.

R. Civ. P. 73, the parties in this case consent to have a United States magistrate judge conduct any and all proceedings in this case, including the trial, order the entry of a final judgment, and conduct all post-judgment proceedings.\")). Upon consideration of the briefs of the parties and the record and those argument presented at oral argument, the undersigned has determined Defendant AGCR's motion for summary judgment is due to be granted and Plaintiff Turner's motion to strike exhibits is due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 12, 2017, Plaintiff Turner's current attorney filed a notice of appearance following the withdrawal of a former attorney. (Doc. 38). The parties previously attempted to negotiate settlement, and following Plaintiff Turner's counsel's appearance, the parties continued to attempt settlement; however, the negotiations were unsuccessful. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 26, 39, &amp; 42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 12, 2017, the parties jointly motioned the Court for a telephonic status conference to reset deadlines to complete discovery. (Doc. 42, at 1). On the same day, this Court denied the motion, stating that the parties had not indicated what needs remained and how much time would be necessary. (Doc. 43). Defendant AGCR subsequently filed a more specific motion with the Court in which Defendant AGCR motion the Court to allow Defendant AGCR until August 15, 2017, to depose Plaintiff Turner. (Doc. 44). Despite the Court's previous order, and Defendant AGCR's limited motion to take only the deposition of the Plaintiff Turner, Plaintiff Turner did not file a similar motion for leave to depose any defense witness. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Sheet). Rather, Plaintiff emailed opposing counsel, seeking to conduct depositions following the close of discovery and without an order from this Court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc 53-1, at 2-4; Doc. 53-2, at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Pursuant to this Court's Rule 16(b) Scheduling Order, (Doc. 35), as amended, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docs. 45 &amp; 47), Defendant AGCR filed its motion for summary judgment on September 20, 2017, (Doc. 48). Pursuant to the Court's submission order for Defendant AGCR's motion for summary judgment, (Doc. 51), Plaintiff Turner filed his response to Defendant AGCR's motion for summary judgment on October 13, 2017, (Doc. 52), and Defendant AGCR filed its reply on October 20, 2017, (Doc. 55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 13, 2017, Plaintiff Turner contemporaneously filed his motion to strike exhibits, (Doc. 53), and pursuant to the Court's submission order for Plaintiff Turner's motion to strike exhibits, Defendants AGRC filed its response on October 24, 2017, (Doc. 56). The Court set this matter for oral argument on November 7, 2017, on Defendant AGCR's motion for summary judgment and Plaintiff Turner's motion to strike, (Docs. 54, 58, &amp; 57), and the parties telephonically appeared before the undersigned on said date, (Doc. 60).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     SUMMARY OF FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant AGCR is a railroad, which operates from Pensacola, Florida, export terminals, through Alabama and Columbus, Mississippi. (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 2). On April 15, 2013, Defendant AGCR hired Plaintiff Turner, as a conductor. (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 4). Plaintiff Turner was assigned to a terminal in Magnolia, Alabama, which was designated his \"home terminal.\" (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 4; Doc. 50-2, at 9). As a conductor, Plaintiff Turner's job assignments and location were governed by the seniority provisions of the collective bargaining agreement between\n   Defendant AGCR and its operating employees, who are represented by the United Transportation Union. (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 5; Doc. 50-2, at 20-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant AGCR, also, maintains an extra board at some terminal locations. (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 7). The extra board is a roster of employees who are available to cover assignments at various locations for regular employees. (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 7). Thus, employees who work the extra board may be assigned additional work in other terminals. (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 7; Doc. 50-2, at 10). Defendant AGCR pays conductors mileage to work at a terminal outside of the conductor's home terminal. (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In January 2014, Plaintiff Turner was assigned to the Demopolis, Alabama, terminal and consistently worked the Demopolis terminal from February 26, 2014, to October 2, 2014. (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 9). In August of 2014, Plaintiff Turner's father became ill. (Doc. 50-2, at 12-13). As a result, Plaintiff Turner sought and was approved for leave, which was effective September 16, 2014, under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (\"FMLA\"), (Doc. 50-2, at 13-15; Doc. 50-3, \u00b6 3). In or about late September 2014, Plaintiff Turner sought and was approved for intermittent FMLA leave, which became effective on September 29, 2014. (Doc. 50-2, at 12-17; Doc. 50-3, \u00b6 3). Plaintiff Turner took intermittent FMLA leave for approximately one year and did not return to work until August 2015. (Doc. 50-2, at 12-16; Doc. 50-3, at 25). Following Plaintiff Turner's intermittent FMLA leave, he took bereavement leave from June 12, 2015, to June 16, 2015, as well as additional vacation time following his bereavement leave. (Doc. 50-3, \u00b6 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff Turner contends, while he was on intermittent FMLA leave, he received between five (5) and ten (10) phone calls from Operations Manager Timothy Wallender; Train Master Michael Grice; and Human Resources Director Cynthia Strawn or \"Pam\" in HR in regard to Plaintiff Turner returning to work. (Doc. 50-2, at 6-7 &amp; 46-47). Plaintiff Turner alleges Wallender and Grice made the following statements to Plaintiff Turner: (1) \"Willie, we hired you to do a job, we didn't hire you to sit at home,\" (Doc. 50-2, at 47-48); (2) \"Willie, we need you to come on back to work, we'll work with you,\" (Doc. 50-2, at 37); (3) \"You scratch my back and I'll scratch your back,\" (Doc. 50-3, at 56-57); (4) \"[Plaintiff Turner] better enjoy the time he was off,\" (Doc. 50-3, at 57-58); (5) \"[I]f [Plaintiff Turner] was going to play that game, to stay at home ... [he] would be buried on the job that [he] was on, the Demopolis job,\" (Doc. 50-3, at 59); and (6) \"[I]f Plaintiff Turner [was not] willing to work with them, they [would not] be willing to work with [him],\" (Doc. 50-2, at 51). Plaintiff Turner concedes he took several additional months of FMLA leave after the communications. (Doc. 50-2, at 52). Moreover, Plaintiff Turner admits he was permitted to take all the FMLA leave that he wanted. (Doc. 50-2, at 44 &amp; 45; Doc. 50-3, at 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Upon Plaintiff Turner's return to work for periods during his intermittent FMLA leave, and after his FMLA leave, he was returned to the same job as a conductor and assigned the same job responsibilities at the same rate of pay. (Doc. 50-2, at 19, 20-21, 27, 31, &amp; 45-46; Doc. 50-3, at 25). Plaintiff Turner, also, received mileage reimbursements prior to, and following, returns from his intermittent FMLA leave. (Doc. 50-3, at 8-11; Doc. 50-4, at 5-18). Plaintiff Turner received mileage in July 2014 and August 2014, while he was assigned to the Demopolis terminal; in September 2014 and October 2014, while he was assigned to the Magnolia, Alabama, terminal; and in November 2014 and December 2014, while he was assigned to the Fountain, Alabama, terminal. (Doc. 50-3, at 19-22; Doc. 50-4, at 5-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Prior to Plaintiff Turner's intermittent FMLA leave, and following his return, he was assigned to a home terminal at the Demopolis terminal. (Doc. 50-2, at 19 &amp; 30). Plaintiff Turner was assigned to the Demopolis terminal until October 2, 2014. (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 9). Plaintiff Turner admits his assignment to the Demopolis terminal was proper and pursuant to his seniority under the collective bargaining agreement. (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 9; Doc. 50-2, at 19, 25-30, 31, 32-33, 35-36, &amp; 37-38). The Demopolis terminal had no extra board or overtime work. (Doc. 50-2, at 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff Turner's pay was reduced after his Demopolis terminal assignment because he was unable to work the extra board or overtime work. (Doc. 50-2, at 24-25). Plaintiff Turner desired to return to a prior terminal at which he had worked in Magnolia, Alabama; however, under the collective bargaining agreement, he was unable to transfer to the Magnolia terminal unless a job became available at that location and he was the most senior bidder for that job. (Doc. 50-2, at 22, 49, 52-53). Following Plaintiff Turner's return from FMLA leave, he contends he wrote a letter to Defendant AGCR management in which he complained Grice would not let him exercise his seniority to return to the Magnolia terminal. (Doc. 50-2, at 32-34 &amp; 57-60; Doc. 50-3, at 6-8). The collective bargaining agreement between Defendant AGCR and union employees states temporary \"vacancies known to be at least five (5) scheduled days but less than thirty (30) days can be filled by the senior applicant for such position.\" (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 6; Doc. 50-1, at 17). Permanent vacancies are assigned to the senior qualified bidder. (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 6; Doc. 50-1, at 17). \"Employees can move from their bid position only by bidding another vacant position, by exercising their seniority if their job is abolished, or if they are displaced by a senior employee exercising his/her seniority.\" (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 6; Doc. 50-1, at 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As a result of Plaintiff Turner's discontent with his Demopolis terminal assignment, Grice created a position for Plaintiff Turner in Fountain, Alabama. (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 12; Doc. 50-2, at 43 &amp; 65; Doc. 50-3, at 1). The Fountain terminal had extra board work, and Plaintiff Turner was able to add his name to the extra board. (Doc. 50-2, at 42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   During Plaintiff Turner's intermittent FMLA leave, he was required to submit to drug testing following a leave of thirty (30) or more days. (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 14; Doc. 50-2, at 6). After thirty (30) or more days out of work, all employees of Defendant AGCR are required to submit to drug testing to return to work. (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 14). Accordingly, Plaintiff Turner was required to take a drug test after a return from a thirty-day (30) leave. (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 14). Plaintiff Turner was required to drive to different test locations based on the testing centers' hours of operation, scheduling, and availability. (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After an absence, employees of Defendant AGCR who are not on extended leave are required to update their availability status within twenty-four (24) hours of the absence using the \"Crew Callers\" telephone line. (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 15). Plaintiff Turner was out sick on April 6, 2015; however, he failed to update his availability on the following day, April 7, 2015. (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 15). On April 8, 2015, Plaintiff Turner provided only twenty-six (26) minutes notice he would not be at work before his scheduled start time. (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Prior to Plaintiff Turner's FMLA leave, Wallender counseled Plaintiff Turner about Plaintiff Turner's late arrival to work. (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 16). On April 9, 2015, Wallender stood at Plaintiff Turner's depot and observed Plaintiff Turner arrive to work ten (10) minutes late at 7:10 a.m. (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 16). Wallender told Plaintiff Turner he was late, and Plaintiff Turner\n   stated his \"brakes on his truck got stuck.\" (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 16). Later that day, Plaintiff Turner submitted his Federal Hours of Service Timeslip that showed he arrived on duty at 7:00 a.m. (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 16). Wallender, later, learned Plaintiff Turner used the Unicorn pay system to clock in via his personal telephone prior to arriving at work. (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Wallender, also, reviewed Plaintiff Turner's clock in history and observed Plaintiff Turner clocked in at 6:40 a.m. on several occasions, though employees are not permitted to clock in more than fifteen minutes before the employee's on duty time. (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As a result of the above disciplinary issues, a formal investigation was initiated in regard to whether Plaintiff Turner: (1) failed to update his availability status within 24 hours with crew callers on April 7, 2015; (2) failed to give proper notice before taking off sick on April 8, 2015; (3) submitted a false Federal Hours of Service Time sheet on April 9, 2015; and (4) called into the Unicorn pay system via his personal telephone showing himself on duty at 7:00 a.m. before arriving to work on April 9, 2015 at 7:10 a.m. (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 17; Doc. 50-3, at 28-30). Plaintiff Turner waived any right to contest the charges alleged in the Notice of Investigation and pled guilty to the charges. (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 17; Doc. 50-3, at 30-35; Doc. 50-4, at 23-24). As a result of Plaintiff Turner's guilty plea, he was suspended for a period of thirty (30) days. (Doc. 50-3, at 31; Doc. 50-4, at 23-24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff Turner remains employed with Defendant AGCR. (Doc. 50-2, at 39). Plaintiff Turner admits his seniority has improved and he has been assigned extra board work. (Doc. 50-2, at 39). Defendant AGCR, also, sent Plaintiff Turner to engineer training school, which is a progression that may only occur after completing conductor training. (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 19; Doc. 50-2, at 39). Plaintiff Turner concedes his current location allows him to work the extra board and receive mileage if he works an assignment out of town. (Doc. 50-2, at 39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiff's Rule 56(d) Motion to Strike Exhibits\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On October 13, 2017, Plaintiff Turner filed his motion to strike exhibits, (Doc. 53), in which he motions the Court to strike certain exhibits submitted by Defendant AGCR in support of its motion for summary judgment, including the Declaration of Operations Manager Timothy Wallender and the Declaration of Human Resources Director Cynthia Strawn. (Doc. 53, at 1). Plaintiff Turner, also, argues he is unable to adequately respond to Defendant AGCR's motion for summary judgment because he needs to obtain additional information, and alternatively motions the Court to grant him relief pursuant to Rule 56(d), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, (hereinafter \"FRCP\" followed by the Rule number). (Doc. 53, at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   To begin, FRCP 12(f) states, \"The court may strike from a pleading any insufficient defenses or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f). Plaintiff Turner's motion to strike exhibits is improperly styled and should be styled as an objection pursuant to FRCP 56(c)(4) and the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   However, Plaintiff Turner does challenge the declaration of Wallender based on FRCP 56(c)(4). (Doc. 53, at 6-7). FRCP 56(c)(4) states, \"An affidavit or declaration used to support or oppose a motion must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated.\" FED. R. C. P. 56(c)(4). Plaintiff Turner argues Wallender does not provide a basis on which he is competent to testify in regard to the content and application of the collective bargaining agreement. (Doc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   53, at 7). Wallender states in his declaration his statements are based on his \"personal knowledge, as well as knowledge that [he] gained from [his] review of business records of [Defendant AGCR], which were made at or about the time of the events recorded, and which are prepared and maintained in the ordinary course of [Defendant AGCR's] business.\" (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 1). Further, Wallender states he was the Operations Manager for Defendant AGCR from May 2013 to January 2016, which spanned the period of time in which Plaintiff Turner was hired and the events of this lawsuit took place, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 1), and supervised the conductors, which was a position held by Plaintiff Turner during the events of this lawsuit, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc., \u00b6 3). A review of the content of Wallender's declaration and the record of this action as a whole convinces the undersigned Wallender's declaration satisfies the requirements of FRCP 56(c)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As to Plaintiff Turner's motion in the alternative for relief pursuant to FRCP 56(d), if a party opposing summary judgment demonstrates \"by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition, the court may: (1) defer considering the motion or deny it; (2) allow time to obtain affidavits or declarations or to take discovery; or (3) issue any other appropriate order.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 56(d).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   To obtain [an FRCP] 56(d) continuance, the party must \"set[ ] forth with particularity the facts the moving party expects to discover and how those facts would create a genuine issue of material fact precluding summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Harbert Int'l, Inc. v.

Ala. Feb. 12, 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Here, Plaintiff Turner has failed to establish he is entitled to the protections of FRCP 56(d). As to the facts that Plaintiff Turner expects to discover and how those facts would create a genuine issue of material fact precluding summary judgment, he fails to put forth such information. As to Plaintiff Turner's diligence in pursuing the evidence he seeks through permitted methods of discovery, the parties initially sought to extend scheduling deadlines in\n   this matter on July 12, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 42). On the same day, this Court denied the motion, and found the parties had not indicated what needs remained and how much time would be necessary. (Doc. 43). Defendant AGCR, then, filed a more specific motion to extend the deadline to take Plaintiff Turner's deposition. (Doc. 44). Plaintiff Turner could and should have filed, before the close of discovery, a similar motion that sought an order from the Court to extend any deadlines to complete the depositions of defense witnesses.

[he] would be buried on the job that [he] was on, the Demopolis job,\" (Doc. 50-3, at 59); and (6) \"[I]f Plaintiff Turner [was not] willing to work with them, they [would not] be willing to work with [him],\" (Doc. 50-2, at 51). While those statements could indicate their intent to retaliate, Plaintiff Turner did not suffer an adverse employment action, which the Court will discuss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   To the extent Plaintiff Turner contends his assignment to the Demopolis terminal constituted an adverse action, it is undisputed his job assignments and locations were governed by the seniority provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. (Doc. 50-2, at 20-22). Additionally, the evidence in the record demonstrates Plaintiff Turner was assigned to the Demopolis\n   terminal prior to his FMLA leave, (Doc. 50-2, at 19 &amp; 30), and Plaintiff Turner conceded in his deposition the Demopolis terminal assignment was based on his lack of seniority under the Union contract. (Doc. 50-2, at 19, 30, 31, 32-33, 35-36, 37-38, 53, &amp; 56). Accordingly, Plaintiff Turner has not established the Demopolis terminal assignment constituted an adverse employment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   To the extent Plaintiff Turner contends he was unable to work the extra board and receive overtime during his assignment at the Demopolis terminal, the record shows Plaintiff Turner was unable to work the extra board or receive overtime because the Demopolis terminal did not offer overtime or extra board work. (Doc. 50-2, at 31). The fact that the Demopolis terminal did not offer overtime or extra board work for Plaintiff Turner, therefore, does not constitute an adverse employment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   To the extent Plaintiff Turner contends he was precluded from obtaining mileage, Plaintiff Turner, also, alleges Grice told him he would never work any job where he was paid mileage if he left the Demopolis terminal job. (Doc. 50-2, at 60). Plaintiff Turner was only entitled to mileage to work at a terminal outside of his home terminal, (Doc. 50-2, at 9 &amp; 10), and he received mileage during his FMLA leave, (Doc. 50-2, at 61; Doc. 50-3, at 8-11; Doc. 50-4, at 5-18). In his deposition, Plaintiff Turner could not recall the periods in which he claims to have not received mileage, but the evidence establishes Plaintiff Turner received mileage in September 2014 and October 2014 while he was placed in Magnolia, Alabama, and in November 2014 and December 2014 while he was placed in Fountain, Alabama. (Doc. 50-3, at 19-22; Doc. 50-4, at 5-18). Moreover, Plaintiff Turner concedes his current location allows him to receive mileage and meals if he works an assignment out of town. (Doc. 50-2, at 63-64).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   To the extent Plaintiff Turner contends he was not allowed to exercise his seniority rights during his assignment to the Demopolis terminal, Plaintiff Turner alleges Defendant AGCR employed three conductors who had less seniority than he: \"Todd Rowelf,\" \"Wesley Lynam,\" and \"BJ Gates,\" (Doc. 50-2, at 22-24 &amp; 49-51; Doc. 50-3, at 15-16 &amp; 51-52), who, once they qualified, Plaintiff Turner should have been able to \"make them take\" his job at the Demopolis terminal, (Doc. 50-2, at 22-23). However, the record establishes Defendant AGCR took no adverse action against Plaintiff Turner with regard to his seniority rights. The collective bargaining agreement expressly provides \"[e]mployees can move from their bid position only by bidding another vacant position, by exercising their seniority if their job is abolished, or if they are displaced by a senior employee exercising his/her seniority.\" (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 6; Doc. 50-1, at 18). Plaintiff Turner does not allege his job assignment at the Demopolis terminal was abolished or was displaced by a senior employee. Accordingly, the only way Plaintiff Turner could have transitioned to a different terminal was if a job assignment became available and he was the most senior bidder for that position. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 6; Doc. 50-1, at 18). Plaintiff Turner has not presented evidence that any such job opening became available at another terminal nor that he bid on a job at another terminal and was the most senior bidder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The only evidence that Plaintiff Turner adduced in regard to his seniority is the name of one individual that Defendant AGCR had no record of employing, \"BJ Gates,\" (Doc. 50-3, at 51-52), and two individuals, Todd Rowell and Wesley Lynam, who were assigned to the Magnolia terminal and never transferred from there during\n   their employments, (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 13). Therefore, Plaintiff Turner could not have replaced either at the Magnolia terminal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Finally, to the extent Plaintiff Turner alleges he was required to take drug tests at various testing facilities during his FMLA leave, the record establishes Plaintiff Turner took FMLA leave at times up to or exceeding thirty (30) days. (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 14). Defendant AGCR's drug testing policy required any employee who is absent for thirty (30) days or more to take a drug test prior to returning to work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 14). Thus, when Plaintiff Turner indicated a desire to return to work after an absence of thirty (30) days or more, Defendant AGCR required him to take a drug test. (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 14). Moreover, the record establishes the appropriate drug testing facility was assigned based on hours of operation, scheduling, and availability. (Doc. 50-1, \u00b6 14). Because Defendant AGCR followed standard company procedures when it required Plaintiff Turner to take a drug test prior to his return from a thirty-day (30) absence, he cannot establish the conduct constituted an adverse action. Therefore, Plaintiff Turner cannot prove his retaliation claim because he has not shown he suffered an adverse employment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Accordingly, Defendant AGCR's motion for summary judgment, (Doc. 53), is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court finds Defendant AGCR's motion for summary judgment, (Doc. 48), is due to be and hereby is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , and Plaintiff Turner's claims are\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.\n   </strong>\n   Additionally, Plaintiff Turner's motion to strike exhibits, (Doc. 53), is due to be and hereby is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In accordance with this Order and Rule 58, FED.
