The Court reserved decision and requested that Plaintiff's counsel provide a supplemental submission detailing the nature of the work performed, counsel's experience level, and contemporaneous time records, if they were available.

The parties ask this Court to find the Agreement to be fair and reasonable, and that the proposed attorney's fees incorporated therein are reasonable. (Dkt. 32-1).

On August 21, 2017, a mediation certification was filed indicating that the parties had reached a settlement prior to the scheduling of the first mediation session. (Dkt. 27). The Agreement provides Plaintiff with a total settlement amount of $20,000.00. (Dkt. 32-1 at 3).
