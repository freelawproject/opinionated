When Marathon Petroleum established its employee-retirement plan, the defendants-plan administrator Rodney Nichols, the plan's investment committee, and members of that committee-allegedly placed $88 million in plan assets into a fund holding only Marathon Oil common stock. Participants could then hold the stock or sell it and invest the proceeds in a different fund, but they could not purchase additional Marathon Oil stock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the time of the plan's creation, Marathon Oil stock traded at $33.28 per share. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6 54). Within months of the spin-off, shares had dropped below $20; by mid-June, 2017, Marathon Oil's stock was worth less than $13 per share. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Jefferey Yates, a former Marathon Petroleum employee and plan participant, brought this suit in June, 2017, on behalf of himself, the Marathon Petroleum Thrift Plan, and all similarly situated plan participants. He raises essentially three claims for breaches of the defendants' fiduciary duties and a claim of co-fiduciary liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   First, plaintiff alleges that defendants breached their duty to offer only prudent investments by allowing participants to hold Marathon Oil stock, which Yates characterizes as excessively risky.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Second, plaintiff claims that defendants failed to conduct an adequate investigation before permitting participants to hold Marathon Oil stock. According to plaintiff, defendants authorized this investment option because they: 1) wanted to \"mirror\" the investment options in Marathon Oil's employee-retirement plan; and 2) wrongly assumed that the stock was an \"employer security,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201107\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1), that was exempt from the duty to diversify plan assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Third, plaintiff alleges that defendants breached their duty to diversify the plan's assets by placing $88 million, or 6.5% of the plan's total assets, into a fund holding only Marathon Oil stock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Jurisdiction is proper under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Pending is the defendants' motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). (Doc. 18). For the following reasons, I grant the motion to dismiss with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Before the spin-off, Marathon Oil engaged in \"upstream\" and \"downstream\" energy operations: the former entailed oil-and-gas exploration and production, and the latter refining, marketing, and transportation. (Doc. 18-1 at 4). On June 30, 2011, Marathon Petroleum separated from Marathon Oil. It assumed responsibility for the downstream operations, and Marathon Oil managed the upstream operations. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6 8; Doc. 18-1 at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Plan\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Marathon Petroleum established its employee-benefit plan on July 1, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The plan is a defined-contribution, 401(k) plan that is open to \"all employees of Marathon Petroleum that meet certain eligibility requirements.\" (Doc. 1 at \u00b6 20; Doc. 18-2 at 56-57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Participants had the option of investing in four \"tiers\" of funds. Tier 1 included twenty-one index or mutual funds; Tier 2 included 12 \"lifecycle\" funds aimed at participants' varying retirement dates; Tier 3 offered thousands of mutual-fund options through Fidelity Brokerage; and Tier 4 included the common stock of both Marathon Petroleum and Marathon Oil. (Doc. 18-2 at 56-57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The plan authorized defendants to \"add, modify, or delete any investment option as they may deem appropriate\" and to do so at any time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20; Doc. 1 at \u00b6 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Nevertheless, plaintiff alleges, defendants exercised essentially no independent judgment when they selected the plan's investment options. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 34). Rather, defendants decided simply to \"mirror\" the investment options that Marathon Oil had offered to its employees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3). The two plans' investment options thus overlapped entirely, with the exception that only participants in Marathon Petroleum's plan could purchase Marathon Petroleum stock. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 36-38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Marathon Oil Stock\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After the spin-off, many Marathon Oil employees became employees of Marathon Petroleum. And many of those employees, by virtue of their participation in Marathon Oil's employee-retirement plan, owned Marathon Oil stock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Accordingly, when defendants established the plan, they permitted participants\n   who held Marathon Oil stock to retain that stock or sell it and move the proceeds to a different investment option.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the defendants also designated the Marathon Oil stock fund as a \"frozen\" investment option, meaning that participants could not purchase additional Marathon Oil stock. (Doc. 18-2 at 19-20, 57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At the beginning of the class period (July 1, 2011,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1 at \u00b6 74), the plan held $88 million of Marathon Oil stock. As already noted, this amounted to roughly 6.5% of the plan's $1.5 billion in assets. According to plaintiff, the Marathon Oil stock \"represented the third largest investment in the plan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Marathon Oil \"is in the oil and gas industry, a very volatile, high-risk sector of the economy subject to frequent boom-and-bust cycles.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   According to plaintiff, Marathon Oil has admitted that \"its stock price and earnings are highly dependent on the prices of liquid hydrocarbons (oil) and natural gas, which 'fluctuate widely,' 'have been volatile,' and 'may continue to be volatile.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47). Plaintiff alleges that, during the class period, \"Marathon Oil stock experienced precisely the volatility and poor performance that might be expected\" of a single-stock investment within a volatile sector of the economy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As examples, plaintiff notes that, in mid-2014, \"Marathon Oil's price per share declined by over 30%.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56). Contemporaneous market information also indicated that \"energy prices would remain low in the future-warning signs that the Defendants should have recognized would cause the price of Marathon Oil stock to drop further.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Finally, a series of market forecasts from December, 2014, through December, 2015, predicted \"high uncertainty in the price of oil\" and a likelihood of lower oil prices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   For these reasons, plaintiff maintains, \"there should have been heightened cause for concern\" when it came to holding the Marathon Oil stock. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46). Nevertheless, defendants permitted participants to retain or invest in Marathon Oil stock and took no steps to divest, even after the negative market conditions emerged in late 2014 and the stock's price plummeted in 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   According to plaintiff, the defendants' alleged breaches of their fiduciary caused the plan and its participants to lose roughly $58 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 54).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   A complaint must contain a \"short and plain statement of the claim showing the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed.

Regarding the Marathon Oil stock specifically, plaintiff points to Marathon Oil's admission that its earnings and stock price depend heavily on oil and gas prices, which \"fluctuate widely.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47). He also relies on stock market bulletins and analyses forecasting uncertainty in the energy market and probable declines in oil prices.

Plaintiff's Claim Is Not Plausible\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Having considered the parties' arguments and reviewed the relatively sparse case law on this question, I agree with the defendants that plaintiff has not stated a plausible diversification claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   First, while the defendants were able to muster only one unpublished case-\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   -to support their position, that case is squarely on point and persuasive. As the Second Circuit explained in that case, because ERISA requires that fiduciaries diversify \"the investments of the plan,\" the statute \"contemplates a failure to diversify claim when a plan is undiversified as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=325%20Fed.%20Appx.%2031\">\n    325 Fed.Appx. at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In contrast,\n   <em>\n    Spano\n   </em>\n   , on which plaintiff relies, did not even address a claim for breach of the duty to diversify. Rather, it addressed a duty-of-prudence claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065170\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/125/848/\">\n    125 F.Supp.3d at 869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Plaintiffs contend that Boeing offered\n   <em>\n    an imprudently risky\n   </em>\n   concentrated sector fund for the purpose of benefitting a corporate relationship, rather than for the sole benefit of the Participants[.]\") (emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Second, evaluating the plan as a whole makes good sense when the plan at issue is, like the Marathon Petroleum plan, a defined-contribution plan where each participant has his or her own account. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In these cases, the plan participants themselves-rather than the plan's trustees or its investment committee-decide how to allocate their contributions among the plan's investment options. The trustees and the investment committee, in other words, have no ability to enforce the diversification requirement on the participants. All they can do, it would seem, is offer a diversified menu of investment options. What seems most critical, then, at least in terms of the trustees' diversification duty, is the range of investment options available to the participants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Here, there is no question that the Marathon Petroleum plan, taken as a whole, offered diverse options. (Doc. 18-2 at 56-57) (list of investment options). Moreover, 93.5% of the plan's assets were in funds that plaintiff has not challenged as imprudent, undiversified, or otherwise improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Third, as the Fourth Circuit has observed, ERISA's \"legislative history and federal regulations clarify that the diversification and prudence duties do not prohibit a plan trustee from holding single-stock investments as an option in a plan that includes a portfolio of diversified funds.\"\n   <em>\n    Tatum v. RJR Pension Inv. Comm.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4152310\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/346/#p356\">\n    761 F.3d 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 356 (4th Cir. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   But the logical endpoint of plaintiff's argument seems to be that offering a single-stock investment option within a defined-contribution plan always violates the duty of prudence. After all, a single-stock investment option will always be risky, given that the value of the investment depends exclusively on the success of the issuing company. Furthermore, plaintiff has not explained why it is that placing a mere 6.5% of the plan assets-as opposed to some other amount-in Marathon Oil stock breached the defendants' diversification duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Finally, and putting all of the foregoing to one side, there are certainly cases where focusing on a single investment within a plan's investment options- - without regard to the plan's overall menu-can plausibly show a lack of diversification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   For example, courts have found a lack of diversification where: 1) 70% of a fund's assets were in United States 30-year Treasury Bonds,\n   <em>\n    GIW Indus., Inc. v.

Absent such a claim, plaintiff's claim for co-fiduciary liability fails as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   It is, therefore,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   ORDERED THAT the defendants' motion to dismiss (Doc. 18) be, and the same hereby is, granted with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   So ordered.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    The parties offer slightly different characterizations of the defendants' actions in permitting plan participants to hold Marathon Oil stock after the spin-off. Plaintiff implies that defendants allowed the participants to make, in essence, a new investment by purchasing Marathon Oil stock. Defendants, in contrast, emphasize that they merely allowed participants who already held Marathon Oil stock to continue to do so. The proper characterization of defendants' decision is not material to the adjudication of the motion to dismiss.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     dicta\n    </em>\n    , the Circuit has suggested that \"the only way to plead 'special circumstances' [is] to show that [the security] traded on an inefficient market.\"\n    <em>\n     Saumer v.
