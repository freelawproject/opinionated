TIGAR, United States District Judge\n   Now before the Court is the Defendants' motion to dismiss.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This action centers on the MOVA Contour Reality Capture Program (\"MOVA Contour\" or \"MOVA\"), which-as the name suggests-is a program for capturing the motion of the human face to create images used in motion pictures. Unlike previous motion capture technologies, the MOVA Contour Program \"precisely captures and tracks the 3D shape and motion of a human face to sub-millimeter precision.\" ECF No. 1 (Compl.) \u00b6 19. The MOVA Contour system captures \"an actor's performance frame-by-frame, and then creates original Contour Program output files based on the performance, frame-by-frame.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. The output files can be used for many different applications, such as \"retargeting\" the actor's face onto another real or fictional face.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In many ways, this case is the successor to an earlier litigation. Beginning in February 2015, Rearden LLC engaged in a dispute with Shenzhenshi Haitiecheng Science and Technology Company (\"SHST\") over the ownership of the physical equipment and intellectual property associated with the MOVA technology.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shenzhenshi, et al. v. Rearden, et al.\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-CV-00797 JST, ECF No. 1 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 20, 2015). SHST is a Chinese entity associated with Digital Domain 3.0 Inc. (\"DD3\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shenzhenshi, et al. v. Rearden, et al.\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-CV-00797 JST, ECF No. 427 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 11, 2017). On August 11, 2017, this Court found that \"VGH does not own the Mova Assets because Rearden owns them.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Now, Plaintiffs Rearden LLC and Rearden Mova LLC (collectively, \"Rearden\") bring suit against Defendants Crystal Dynamics and Square Enix. Rearden alleges that Crystal Dynamic's Rise of the Tomb Raider videogame was released and distributed in the United States by Square Enix. Compl. \u00b6 1. Rearden contends that Crystal used the \"MOVA Contour systems and methods and Contour Program output, made derivative works, and with Square Enix reproduced and distributed, and authorized performance and display of,\n   <em>\n    Rise of the Tomb Raider\n   </em>\n   in knowing or willfully blind violation of Rearden Mova LLC's intellectual property rights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. RELATED CASE ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Rearden also brought suit against movie studios who allegedly contracted with DD3 to use The MOVA contour technology in three related cases. On February 21, 2018, this Court issued an order granting in part and denying in part motions to dismiss these cases. See\n   <em>\n    Rearden LLC et al. v.

Defendants argue that Rearden has not alleged a copyright claim because the copyright in the software does not include the output files. ECF No. 20 at 5.
