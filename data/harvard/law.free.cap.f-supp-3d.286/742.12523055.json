(Doc. 48.) In substance, the court held that Plaintiffs' complaint could not be sustained solely on its claim that the tipped servers and bartenders were tasked with performing non-tippable duties more than twenty percent of their time of employment. The court stated that Plaintiffs' complaint lumped all non-tippable work together with tippable work such that it was impossible for the court to determine whether Plaintiffs set forth sufficient facts to allege that a \"dual occupation\" claim on the grounds they were performing the work of a different, non-tippable occupation during pre-shift and post-shift work pursuant to \u00a7 531.56(e) and the Department of Labor's guidance regarding it. Thus, the court granted Plaintiffs leave to file a second amended complaint to articulate the dual occupation claim they say they intended to pursue that is supported by the FLSA, its regulations, and the DOL guidance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The court has reviewed the allegations of the second amended complaint. Taken in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, they allege that Hickory Tavern required its tipped servers and bartender employees to perform general preparation, maintenance, cleaning, food preparatory work, stocking, washing dishes, rolling silverware, and other non-tip-generating duties and tasks (which Plaintiffs call \"sidework\") during discrete times before and after their work shifts serving customers. (Doc. 49 \u00b6\u00b6 23-67.) Plaintiffs allege that these duties take a \"substantial amount of time to complete and are not related to the service of customers\" and were compensated at only $2.13 an hour. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2-3.) Such duties were alleged to typically take one hour at the beginning of a lunch shift, 30 minutes at the end of the lunch shift, 15 minutes at the beginning of a dinner shift, and one to\n   one and one-half hours at the end of a dinner shift. (Id. \u00b6 46-49.) Plaintiffs allege that such duties constituted \"well over thirty percent (30%) of their workweek. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants argue two main points. First, they contend that any non-tippable work that was nevertheless \"related\" to the employees' jobs cannot be considered another occupation for purposes of the dual occupation regulations. (Doc. 52 at 5-17.) Second, Defendants contend that as long as the employees nevertheless earn more than minimum wage for a 40-hour workweek, they have no claim under the FLSA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The court has previously engaged in an extensive examination of the FLSA, its regulations, and DOL's interpretative guidance, and it will not repeat that here. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 48.) As noted by the court, those authorities (including in particular DOL's 1985 opinion letter (Doc. 29-2)) provide support for the proposition that employers may be liable for paying minimum wage to dual occupation employees \"whose duties are ... non-tippable, related to the tippable occupation, and take place before or after tippable duties for 'a substantial amount of time.' \" (Doc. 48 at 23.) The extent of qualifying activities and their duration are questions of fact, ill-suited to dismissal at this pleading stage. Here, Defendants rely principally on classifications of job duties from the Occupational Information Network (\"O*NET\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which is extrinsic evidence, outside the pleadings. (Doc. 52 at 10-15.) In light of the above, the court concludes that, at this preliminary stage, it cannot say that the allegations of the second amended complaint fail to state a plausible claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants argue, secondly, that Plaintiffs fail to state a cognizable claim because no Plaintiff alleges he or she was paid less than minimum wage over the course of a 40-hour workweek. As Plaintiffs note, this argument was not raised as to the previous complaint, and the court observed as much. (Doc. 48 at 14 n.8.) Apparently taking a cue from that footnote, Hickory Tavern now argues that Plaintiffs have failed to state a minimum wage claim because they fail to allege that they were paid less than minimum wage for any workweek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Of course, to adopt Defendants' argument on this issue would read the DOL's dual occupation rule out of the regulations. This argument is not sufficiently advanced in these briefs to permit the court to resolve it on such thin consideration. For example, Defendants do not address recent authority as to this argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Romero v.
