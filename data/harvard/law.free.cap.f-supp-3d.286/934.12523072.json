(\"Speedy Check\"), initiated this action against defendant United States Postal Service (the \"Postal Service\") in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, alleging state law violations relating to a dishonored payroll check. The Postal Service removed the case to federal court and moved to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim, which I granted in part and denied in part. The Postal Service now moves to dismiss Speedy Check's remaining holder-in-due-course claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), and, in the alternative, it moves for summary judgment on the basis of federal preemption. For the reasons set forth below, I deny both motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Because \"[s]ubject-matter jurisdiction is so central to the district court's power to issue any orders whatsoever[,] it may be inquired into at any time, with or without a motion, by any party or by the court itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Craig v.

Enacted in 2003, the Check 21 Act seeks to \"improve the overall efficiency of the Nation's payments system\" by authorizing the use of substitute checks, which are paper reproductions of original checks.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%205001\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3), 5002(16).

Specifically, the Postal Service argues that the warranty remedies contained in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205004\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 5004\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \"supplant relief via the holder-in-due-course theory.\" Def's Memo. at 5. But, as Speedy Check points out, the Check 21 Act's substitute check warranties do not actually protect a party who, like Speedy Check, takes an original check for value and in good faith after a substitute check has been created by another entity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205004\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 5004\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (warranties flow from a bank that presents a substitute check to the \"transferee, any subsequent collecting or returning bank, the depositary bank, the drawee, the drawer, the payee, the depositor, and any endorser\").

But Speedy Check, as the transferee of a non-substitute check, is not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Check 21 Act\n   therefore does not supplant the relief Speedy Check seeks under state law. Because the provisions of the Illinois Commercial Code upon which Speedy Check relies for its holder-in-due-course claim- 810 ILCS \u00a7\u00a7 5/3-301, 5/3-302, 5/3-412 -are not inconsistent with the Check 21 Act in this context, and because these state-law provisions do not otherwise stand in the way of the Check 21 Act's objectives, Speedy Check's remaining claim is not preempted.
