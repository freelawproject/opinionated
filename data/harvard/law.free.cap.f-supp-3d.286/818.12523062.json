Psychiatric Disorders\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff began treatment with Edward Fallick, D.O., (\"Dr. Fallick\") in 2000 for psychiatric disorders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   At an appointment four months prior to the alleged onset date, Plaintiff reported that she was feeling much better since starting Abilify,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   stating that it \"[r]eally changed [her] life\" and that her mood was a lot lighter and she was \"less snappish.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the relevant time, Plaintiff continued to see Dr. Fallick for medication management until January 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that last appointment, Plaintiff stated that she was \"[d]oing fairly well (all things considered).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Plaintiff's mood reports varied from increased depression to improved, the mental status examination results were consistently within normal limits, and the Global Assessment of Functioning\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"GAF\") score, when included, remained at sixty, a score at the highest functioning end of moderate symptoms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Fallick diagnosed Plaintiff with mood disorder, not otherwise specified, and regularly adjusted Plaintiff's medications based on Plaintiff's reports of the effects on her mood.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   None of Dr. Fallick's treatment notes from this time period reflected a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (\"ADHD\") or recorded any cognitive side effects from medication.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   They also provided no indication of Plaintiff's residual functional capacity or her limitations of daily living, other than the mention that Plaintiff lacked motivation and that she was not going out of the house for certain periods.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In March 2014, Plaintiff began receiving treatment through the Harris Health System for both medication management and psychotherapy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cristin Aoshima-Kilroy, M.D., (\"Dr. Aoshima-Kilroy\") performed the initial psychiatric evaluation on March 4, 2014, and found Plaintiff's mental status examination to be within normal limits with \"ok\" mood and \"full range-dysthymic\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   affect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Aoshima-Kilroy expressed her concern with the number of psychotropic medications that Plaintiff was taking and her opinion that Plaintiff's self-reported cognitive blunting and headaches could be a result of the medications.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   The doctor discussed these points with Plaintiff, who said that she wanted to remain on all of the medications.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Diagnosing Plaintiff with mood disorder, not otherwise specified, Dr. Aoshima-Kilroy stated, \"I do not see enough evidence to agree with diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Borderline personality disorder appears to be better suited diagnosis and will continue to monitor for this.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Aoshima-Kilroy added cluster B traits to Plaintiff's diagnosis, reflecting the opinion that Plaintiff could have a personality disorder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Over the course of the subsequent seventeen months, Plaintiff attended eleven medication management appointments with Dr. Aoshima-Kilroy, who consistently recorded that the mental status examinations were within normals limits with changes in mood that ranged in description from depressed to anxious to \"better\" to \"accepting\" and affect that mostly remained dysthymic.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Aoshima-Kilroy continued the diagnosis of mood disorder and cluster B traits throughout treatment during the relevant time but added the diagnosis of anxiety disorder, not otherwise specified, in August 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   A year later, she changed the mood disorder diagnosis to unspecified bipolar disorder and added neuro-cognitive disorder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Dr. Aoshima-Kilroy variously rated Plaintiff's GAF score as fifty-five or sixty, both reflecting moderate symptoms, throughout treatment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   At various times, Plaintiff reported making jewelry, refinishing furnishing, having friends over to visit frequently, visiting a friend out of town, washing clothes and dishes, driving others around town, and attending support groups.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff reported memory difficulties more than once and, at one appointment, could not remember any of five objects until given a hint on one, after which she was able to name them all.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In addition to medication management, Plaintiff received psychotherapy for anxiety and depression prior to the alleged onset date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   The therapy sessions through Harris Health System were the only time-relevant psychotherapy in the record. From March 2014 to August 2015, Plaintiff received psychotherapy more than thirty times.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Plaintiff saw at least three therapists during that time, her mental status exam results were always within normal limits; her diagnosis remained mood disorder, not otherwise specified; and her GAF score remained at fifty-five.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On occasion at non-psychiatric medical appointments, the treatment provider addressed Plaintiff's mental health.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, on August 25, 2015, at an appointment for diabetes management, Plaintiff told the nurse practitioner that her mental \"fog\" had resolved and the stressors in her life had minimized.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   The practitioner recorded that Plaintiff's mood, affect, behavior, and thought content were all normal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In October 2015, two months after issuance of the ALJ's decision, Brittany Grabois Schuman, Psy.D., (\"Dr. Schuman\"), conducted an outpatient psychology evaluation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   The evaluation included clinical and neuropsychiatric interviews; intelligence and cognitive functioning tests; personal, psychiatric, and neuropsychological assessments and inventories, and review of health records and a self-report questionnaire.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff's mood was depressed with congruent affect without suicidal or homicidal thoughts, intent, means, or any plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the evaluation summary, Dr. Schuman opined that Plaintiff experienced \"mild difficulty with delayed memory for auditory tasks\" but was \"fully oriented,\" possessed intact \"abilities for naming, visuospatial/constructional tasks, attention, and abstraction,\" tested in the high average range for nonverbal intelligence, and suffered \"minor difficulties with language and processing speed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   The doctor further opined that the deficits in Plaintiff's ability to participate in activities of daily living were minor and her cognitive deficits were likely attributable to depression, not to a sharp decline in mental abilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Schuman diagnosed Plaintiff with unspecified bipolar and related disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder and assessed Plaintiff a GAF score of fifty-five.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Diabetes\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff's diabetes diagnosis predated the alleged disability period but medication and disease management continued throughout the relevant time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   The notes from multiple encounters stated that Plaintiff maintained seventy-five percent compliance with diabetes medication; however, her compliance with proper diet was recorded as anywhere from twenty-five to seventy-five percent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   In those treatment notes, the providers often also indicated that Plaintiff's home blood tests generally reflected high glucose levels.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Although Plaintiff had abnormal results on diabetes-related laboratory tests on more than one occasion, Plaintiff showed no other physical manifestations of unmanaged diabetes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   More specifically, the treatment providers routinely recorded that Plaintiff had no numbness or tingling, no gait disturbance, no muscular weakness, and no impaired coordination/balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   The only contrary notation in the record was Plaintiff's report at a psychiatric appointment in June 2015 that she had fallen a few times and was experiencing hand numbness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, a podiatry appointment in July 2015 produced normal results with no report of falls or numbness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   In August and September of 2015, Plaintiff reported walking for exercise four times a week.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Application to SSA\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On September 24, 2014, Plaintiff filed an application for disability insurance benefits,\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   claiming an inability to work since May 14, 2013, due to bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety, and depression.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a later disability report, Plaintiff added diabetes to the list of disabling conditions and omitted obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In November 2013, Plaintiff underwent two consultative examinations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the psychological evaluation, Plaintiff exhibited a dysphoric mood at times and a euthymic mood at times.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   The contents of her thoughts, her orientation, her ability to perform calculations were normal, but she exhibited difficulty with certain memory assessments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   The psychologist opined that Plaintiff's social life was stable and that she was able to manage her money, was independent with all personal hygiene and self care, and was able to drive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on Plaintiff's self-reports during the interview, the psychologist diagnosed Plaintiff with bipolar disorder and hoarding disorder and found her prognosis to be fair with psychotherapy, medication compliance, and anxiety-management education.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   At the medical examination, Plaintiff reported that she was experiencing numbness and tingling in her toes and hands and that she felt the sensation of burning in her left great toe.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff also told the doctor that she walked one mile at a time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   The doctor observed Plaintiff's gait to be normal and her ability to walk on her toes and heels to be normal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   The doctor diagnosed Plaintiff with diabetes with peripheral neuropathy, as well as restless leg syndrome, bipolar disorder, and incontinence and assessed her prognosis to be \"very good.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On December 20, 2013, the SSA found Plaintiff not disabled at the initial level of review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   On April 11, 2014, the SSA again found Plaintiff not disabled upon reconsideration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In October 2014, Dr. Fallick completed a mental residual functional capacity (\"RFC\") evaluation on Plaintiff's behalf.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   He listed mood disorder, not otherwise specified, and ADHD, predominantly inattentive subtype, as Plaintiff's psychiatric diagnoses and assessed her prognosis to be guarded.\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   With regard to Plaintiff's response to treatment, Dr. Fallick stated that it varied but that Plaintiff \"continuously struggle[d] with distract[i]bility and motivation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   Regarding side effects, the doctor stated vaguely that \"Topamax\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   may cause cognitive dulling.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Dr. Fallick's RFC assessment rated Plaintiff as \"[u]nable to meet competitive standards\" on nine mental abilities and aptitudes necessary for the performance of unskilled work: (1) \"[m]aintain attention for two[-]hour segment;\" (2) \"[s]ustain an ordinary routine without special supervision;\" (3) \"[w]ork in coordination with or proximity to others without being unduly distracted;\" (4) \"[p]erform at a consistent pace without an unreasonable number and length of rest periods;\" (5) \"[r]espond appropriately to changes in a routine work setting;\" (6) \"[d]eal with normal work stress;\" (7) \"[u]nderstand and remember detailed instructions;\" (8) \"[c]arry out detailed instructions;\" and (9) \"[d]eal with stress of semiskilled and skilled work.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   He opined that Plaintiff was seriously limited but not precluded on six mental abilities and aptitudes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   Of the remaining ten mental abilities and aptitudes listed on the form, Dr. Fallick answered five, finding Plaintiff limited but satisfactory in those areas, and left five blank.\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Dr. Fallick's projection, Plaintiff would be absent from work more than four days a month due to her impairments or treatment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff requested a hearing before an ALJ.\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n   The ALJ granted Plaintiff's request and scheduled the hearing on June 11, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Hearing\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   At the hearing, Plaintiff, two medical experts, and a vocational expert testified.\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under questioning by the ALJ, Plaintiff confirmed her age and described her past relevant work as a court reporter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff answered questions by her attorney about her psychiatric history.\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff stated that Dr. Fallick had been her psychiatrist since 2000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   She said that she was hospitalized in 2005 because she was suicidal but had not received inpatient treatment since then.\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   She also reported a history of alcohol and drug dependence but became sober in 1990.\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff described\n   in detail how much difficulty she had meeting the demands of her job in 2010 due to lack of concentration and distractibility and explained that this poor performance ultimately led to her termination in May 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n   A month later, Plaintiff began to receive insurance payments for long-term disability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    80\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Relevant to her condition since her termination, which coincides to the day with her alleged onset date, Plaintiff reported that she was unable to concentrate, heard voices saying her name, saw nonexistent people running in halls of her house, and compulsively hoarded\n   <footnotemark>\n    81\n   </footnotemark>\n   furniture.\n   <footnotemark>\n    82\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff said that she did not sleep much at night but slept a lot during the day, staying in bed most of the time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    83\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff described a \"bad day,\" which she said occurred one or two days a week, as including her skin crawling, her head hurting, and her body shaking.\n   <footnotemark>\n    84\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time of the hearing, Plaintiff said, she was taking \"seven types of psych meds.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    85\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff's attorney asked about diabetes, with which, Plaintiff testified, she had been diagnosed in 1998.\n   <footnotemark>\n    86\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff reported, that as a result of diabetes, she recently had begun experiencing tingling in her hands and numbness in her toes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    87\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff reported being able to drive, to watch television shows on her computer, to attend Narcotics Anonymous meetings, to grocery shop, and to care for three dogs but being unable to read or to date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    88\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Ashok Khushalani, M.D., (\"Dr. Khushalani\"), a psychiatric expert, testified next and provided an overview of Plaintiff's mental-health treatment based on his review of Plaintiff's medical records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    89\n   </footnotemark>\n   In particular, he pointed out that Plaintiff described Abilify as changing her life.\n   <footnotemark>\n    90\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Khushalani noted a discrepancy between Dr. Fallick's RFC assessment in October 2014 indicating Plaintiff had several significant limitations and one of his treatment notes in January 2015 stating that Plaintiff was \"well.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    91\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further addressing contradictions between Dr. Fallick's RFC assessment and his treatment notes, Dr. Khushalani stated that Dr. Fallick rated Plaintiff as having marked limitations but had rated her as sixty on the GAF scale, which, he said, was considered comparable to moderate to marked limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    92\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Dr. Khushalani opined that Plaintiff did not meet or equal any of the mental disorders

In deciding, the ALJ must consider all medical opinions in the record, must explain the weight given each, and, when not according controlling weight to a treating physician, must evaluate the treating physician's opinion in light of the treatment relationship, medical evidence in support, and consistency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Here, the ALJ discussed the medical opinions of both Drs. Khushalani and Fallick and explained the weight given to each. With regard to Dr. Khushalani, the ALJ determined that his opinion was entitled to substantial weight because he reviewed the entire record, observed Plaintiff, and offered opinions that were supported by a preponderance of record evidence. In contrast, the ALJ determined that Dr. Fallick's opinion regarding the nature and severity of Plaintiff's mental impairments was entitled to little weight because it was \"not well-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and [was] inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in the case record.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    133\n   </footnotemark>\n   The ALJ did not stop with that generalized statement but, rather, pointed in particular to two aspects of Dr. Fallick's RFC opinion that the ALJ found were not supported Dr. Fallick's treatment notes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    134\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   First, the ALJ noted that the diagnosis of ADHD listed in the RFC assessment was inconsistent with the treatment notes from the relevant time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    135\n   </footnotemark>\n   The only psychiatric diagnosis recorded in Dr. Fallick's\n   notes during Plaintiff's alleged disability period was mood disorder, not otherwise specified.\n   <footnotemark>\n    136\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, the ALJ found the degree of limitation reflected in the RFC assessment was not supported by the consistent, treatment-time GAF assessment of sixty, a score at the highest functioning end of moderate symptoms. The ALJ explained that a GAF score of sixty was indicative of only moderate symptomology, not an inability to meet competitive standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The court finds the reasons offered by ALJ for giving less weight to Dr. Fallick's RFC opinion to be well reasoned. It is indisputable that Plaintiff did not carry a diagnosis of ADHD during the relevant period. Moreover, Dr. Fallick's notes were brief and focused on the medication adjustments with very little information about Plaintiff's RFC or activities of daily living. Based solely on the treatment notes, it would be impossible to reach the conclusion, as did Dr. Fallick, that Plaintiff was unable to meet competitive standards with regard to the identified nine mental abilities and aptitudes or that Plaintiff was seriously limited with regard to six others. Although his statement that Plaintiff struggled with distractibility and motivation is supported by a few treatment notations, the degree of limitation in his RFC has absolutely no clinical support in his records. Additionally, two other physicians expressed concern that Plaintiff was over-medicated during treatment with Dr. Fallick, a basis not cited by the ALJ but arguably a relevant factor in deciding what weight to grant his opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The ALJ's decision cited\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and several Social Security Rulings, stating that the ALJ considered opinion evidence in accordance with the requirements therein.\n   <footnotemark>\n    137\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court has no reason to doubt the ALJ, and, as discussed above, he is not required to discuss in his decision all of the factors outlined in the regulations when giving a treating physician's opinion some weight but less than controlling weight.\n   <footnotemark>\n    138\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Plaintiff also contends that, in addition to the limitations identified in Dr. Fallick's RFC opinion, Plaintiff's termination from her past relevant work \"so strongly indicate[s]\" that her mental impairments would prevent her from being able to sustain employment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    139\n   </footnotemark>\n   Having already addressed the limited value of Dr. Fallick's RFC opinion, the court finds Plaintiff's termination irrelevant. The ALJ agreed that Plaintiff could not perform her past relevant work. The ALJ's RFC determination included limitations that, according to the vocational expert, would prevent Plaintiff from returning to court reporting. Therefore, her termination and the reasons\n   for it provide no insight into Plaintiff's ability to sustain employment in the unskilled jobs identified by the vocational expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Moreover, this is not a case where the ALJ needed to articulate a specific finding that Plaintiff could maintain the cited jobs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perez v.

In this case, the ALJ did not find Dr. Fallick's opinion that Plaintiff would miss four or more days a month to be supported and did not include it in his RFC determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The court also finds the opinion that Plaintiff would miss more than four days of work per month unsupported. Plaintiff's appointments with Dr. Fallick were every few months, at which time he made minor adjustments to her medication. Plaintiff also attended psychotherapy approximately twice a month. These appointments did not require a full day off of work even if they could not be scheduled outside of work hours. Nothing in the record suggested that a more intensive treatment plan was necessary to treat Plaintiff's mental disorders or that they could cause Plaintiff to be absent from work once a week or more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The ALJ complied with all SSA requirements and cited substantial evidence to support his conclusion that Dr. Fallick's opinion was entitled to little weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Failure to Properly Assess Limitations Due to Diabetes\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   A claimant's RFC is her utmost remaining ability to work despite all of her limitations resulting from her impairment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Villa v.

In order to serve as substantial evidence, the vocational expert's testimony must be based on a hypothetical question that incorporates all of the limitations recognized by the ALJ and must be subject to the claimant's cross-examination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Masterson v.

She also contends that the ALJ improperly\n   relied on Dr. Oguejiofor's hearing testimony that the record contained \"no evidence of neuropathy or difficulty with ambulation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    140\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Taking the second issue first, the ALJ interpreted Dr. Oguejiofor's testimony to mean that the record included no evidence of neuropathy or difficulty with ambulation. However, their colloquy was not so straight forward. Dr. Oguejiofor appeared to be saying that Plaintiff's diabetes did not meet Listings 11.14 and 11.04 because Plaintiff did not meet the requirements of \"peripheral neuropathy with muscle atrophy, loss of power and positions resulting in an inability to ambulate effectively.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    141\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court cannot determine whether the ALJ read more into Dr. Oguejiofor's testimony by taking it to mean that the record contained no evidence of neuropathy or difficulty with ambulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Regardless, the record contains substantial evidence to support the ALJ's exclusion of additional walking and handling limitations based on numbness and tingling. Plaintiff cites three pages in the administrative record as \"multiple diagnosis [sic] of peripheral neuropathy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    142\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two of these were appointment records from June 23, 2011, and April 19, 2012, both well before the alleged onset of disability. Each of these records merely listed diabetes \"with neurological manifestations\" as one of Plaintiff's diagnoses without any indication that Plaintiff was functionally limited in any way.\n   <footnotemark>\n    143\n   </footnotemark>\n   The other record cited was a consultative examination, not a treatment record. At the consultative examination, Plaintiff reported numbness and tingling in the toes and hands and a burning sensation in her left great toe, but she also reported that she walked one mile at a time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The fact is that many treatment records from the relevant period routinely noted that Plaintiff had no numbness or tingling, no gait disturbance, no muscular weakness, and no impaired coordination/balance. The only exception was Plaintiff's disclosure that she was experiencing hand numbness, which she made to her psychiatrist in June 2015. At that meeting she also reported having fallen. That same month, Plaintiff testified at the administrative hearing that she recently had begun experiencing tingling in her hands and numbness in her toes. However, at a July 2015 podiatry appointment, Plaintiff reported no numbness, and the examination produced normal results. In August and September of 2015, Plaintiff reported walking for exercise four times a week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The number of examinations during the relevant period that noted no neuropathy and no difficulty ambulating overwhelm the few occasions on which Plaintiff reported neuropathic symptoms and falls. More importantly, the record contains no evidence of functional limitations resulting from numbness and tingling, not even her own testimony. To the contrary, Plaintiff's ability to walk long distances undermines her assertion that the RFC should have included walking limitations. Even if Plaintiff suffered limitations as a result of periodic numbness and tingling, they were concentrated in November 2013 and June 2015, not ongoing limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Even without Dr. Oguejiofor's testimony, substantial evidence supports the ALJ's decision not to include walking and handling limitations in the RFC determination. Because the hypothetical question presented to the vocational expert included all limitations reasonably supported by the\n   record, the ALJ did not err by relying on the testimony that Plaintiff could perform the jobs of shredder, laundry sorter, and garment sorter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Albeit an interesting argument, the court disagrees. The question raised by Plaintiff really is whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ's decision to include ADHD and bipolar disorder as severe impairments. That looks to be a rather close call.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"137\">\n   <p id=\"p-240\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tr. 211.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"138\">\n   <p id=\"p-241\">\n    The court finds it prudent to address one other argument by footnote. Plaintiff argues that her hospitalization in 2005 serves as evidence of decompensation and that the diagnoses she carried at that time explain Dr. Fallick's inclusion of ADHD in his RFC assessment. This is nonsense. Plaintiff's condition eight years prior to her alleged onset date, while she was still working, has no bearing on the disability analysis for the period May 14, 2013, to August 7, 2015. Obviously, Dr. Fallick's RFC assessment is pertinent only if he was addressing Plaintiff's condition in October 2014 when he completed it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"139\">\n   <p id=\"p-242\">\n    Doc. 10, Pl.'s Mot. for Summ.
