BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Lurking beneath this city's streets lies a purported scourge of our sewer system: nonwoven disposable wipes. While unwitting consumers might blithely flush baby or facial wipes down the toilet, little do they know, those wipes may bind together in the subterranean realm, creating plumbing clogs of substantial proportions. And when they do, Defendants District of Columbia and the D.C. Water &amp; Sewer Authority must clean up the mess. The District has thus understandably embarked on a \"Protect Your Pipes\" campaign, encouraging consumers to rethink their flushing habits. The question in this case is how far\n   it can go in enlisting wipes manufacturers to help fight that battle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Specifically, the city recently enacted a law that limits when a manufacturer can market its wipes as flushable. The Act includes a three-part standard for \"flushability\"; if a company's wipes flunk that test, it must clearly and conspicuously label that the product \"should not be flushed.\" D.C. Law 21-220 \u00a7 3(b). The problem? Plaintiff Kimberly-Clark Corporation has allegedly engineered certain of its wipes to be flushable and currently markets them as such. It fears the Act may compel it to say otherwise and has moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent enforcement thereof. Because the Court agrees that the Act likely treads impermissibly on Plaintiff's First Amendment rights, it will grant the injunction. As the District is still in the process of promulgating regulations to implement the Act, the Court will subsequently reassess whether the injunction remains appropriate once those regulations become final.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Nonwoven Disposable Products Act\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 24, 2017, the District of Columbia enacted the Nonwoven Disposable Products Act of 2016. The Act targeted a hobgoblin of D.C. pipes-\n   <em>\n    viz.\n   </em>\n   , nonwoven disposable wipes, which include \"wet wipes used for personal hygiene, baby wipes, facial tissues ....\" District Opp., Exh. B, Committee Report, Bill 21-833 (Nov. 7, 2016) at 2. These wipes \"are popular for both child and adult use\" and, when flushed, \"cause serious problems in the [District's] sewer system.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Committee Report, in fact, estimated that D.C. Water \"pays approximately $50,000 each year to combat issues caused by wipes,\" and that \"[c]logs also pose risks for utility workers, who can suffer physical injuries when cutting and pulling wipes out of mechanical equipment and illness due to exposure to raw sewage.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Act addressed two types of products plaguing the District's sewers. First, it set its sights on wipes that were never intended to be flushable. As Kimberly-Clark agrees, \"[M]any adult customers were using-and then flushing\" these wipes, which \"were not designed for flushing [and] were not labeled safe for flushing.\" ECF No. 15 (Memorandum for PI Mot.) at 3. The wipes, which Plaintiff describe[s] as \"indestructible squares of plastic,\" \"can increase the incidence of plumbing clogs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although some manufacturers labeled that their products \"should not be flushed,\" the District determined that \"there [was] no standard way to communicate this message across the industry.\" Committee Report at 3. The D.C. Council also heard testimony that manufacturers often obfuscated labels advising consumers not to flush their products.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   District Opp., Exh. A, Hearing Record (October 24, 2016) at 14. As an example, one witness presented baby wipes whose \"do not flush\" label appeared in small print on the back of the package and was partially obscured by a flap.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The District sought to impose new guidelines on those manufacturers, compelling them to label their products \"clearly and conspicuously.\" D.C. Law 21-220 \u00a7 3(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Second, the city targeted \"flushable\" wipes, or those that are ostensibly \"designed to pass safely through household plumbing and municipal wastewater systems.\" PI Memo. at 3. These products, which constitute about 7% of wipes on the market, are currently labeled and marketed to consumers as \"flushable.\" Committee Report at 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Hearing Record at 9. Despite the reassuring labels, the District worried that \" 'flushable' wipes are contributing to clogs in U.S. sewer systems.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Committee Report at 3. Although estimates vary as to the toll that these items take on plumbing, testing in other municipalities shows that a \"non-negligible amount of material recovered from sewage systems consisted of flushable wipes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   To wit, wipes labeled as flushable compose an estimated 2% to 8% of the debris in water systems; at the extreme, one study found that they made up 35% of total wipes in the pipes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   To the District, \"any wipe labeled 'flushable' that can be found in a clog after going through the sewer system is inaccurately labeled.\" Committee Report at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As to this second category, therefore, the District sought to provide more rigorous standards regarding flushability. Before the legislation, there was little consensus over the term \"flushable.\" For example, an industry trade association, the International Nonwovens and Disposables Association (INDA), promulgated voluntary guidelines, which required a product to pass seven different tests before being labeled \"flushable.\" Hearing Record at 10. Yet the Council also heard testimony from the National Association of Clean Water Agencies (NACWA), an organization representing 300 public wastewater utilities, that INDA's guidance was inadequate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. NACWA promotes the use of a more stringent three-part test, which would require flushable wipes to: 1) break into small pieces quickly; 2) not be buoyant; and 3) not contain plastic or regenerated cellulose and only contain material that will readily degrade in a range of natural environments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to NACWA, other countries adhere to these guidelines, but current U.S. products fall far short of its standards.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. In a field test, only one product marketed as flushable (a Kimberly-Clark wipe, as it happens) met NACWA's guidelines.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After evaluating testimony on those competing standards, the District ultimately hewed closely to NACWA's approach. The final Act defined \"flushable\" as a nonwoven disposable product that: (1) \"[d]isperses in a short period of time after flushing in the low-force conditions of a sewer system\"; (2) \"[i]s not buoyant\"; and 3) \"[d]oes not contain plastic or any other material that does not readily degrade in a range of natural environments.\" D.C. Law 21-220 \u00a7 2(1). It then prohibited \"a manufacturer of a nonwoven disposable product for sale in the District [from] label[ing] the nonwoven disposable product as safe to flush, safe for sewer systems, or safe for septic systems,\" unless its product met the District's definition of flushable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 3(a). The Act also required manufacturers of products that are \"not flushable [to] clearly and conspicuously label the ... product to communicate that [it] should not be flushed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 3(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Act empowers the Mayor to \"impose civil fines and penalties as sanctions for violations of [its] provisions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 4(a). It also authorized the Department of Energy &amp; Environment to issue rules implementing the terms of the Act, in consultation with D.C. Water.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 5. Although the Act goes into effect on January 1, 2018, DOEE has not yet promulgated regulations for its implementation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 34 (Stipulation by District Defendants), which task is expected to take at least a few more months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   District Opp., Exh. D (Declaration of Marc A. Nielson), \u00b6\u00b6 4-10 (describing DOEE's regulatory process). Notably, the Act punishes only\n   <em>\n    manufacturers\n   </em>\n   , regardless of their location in or outside of the city, but not any retailer who sells the wipes in the District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Kimberly-Clark is a multinational corporation that creates products for personal\n   care and hygiene. Its brands include such familiar names as Cottonelle\u00ae, Scott\u00ae, Huggies\u00ae, and Kleenex\u00ae.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6 5. Over the past twenty years, it has allegedly invested \"millions of dollars\" in engineering flushable nonwoven wipes and now has more than 30 patents for such products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 44. These wipes, it says, are unique: \"Unlike baby wipes, which are made from plastics or other synthetic fibers, Kimberly-Clark's wipes are made only from wood pulp-the same substance that is the primary ingredient in toilet tissue.\" PI Memo. at 4 (citing Compl., \u00b6 45). It also uses sodium chloride (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , salt) to bind the wood pulp together.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It markets those of its wipes using that technology as \"flushable,\" in accordance with INDA's guidelines on the term.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 48-50. Plaintiff manufactures all of its wipes outside the District and then sells them to middlemen, who in turn sell them to retailers located in the city.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On September 15, 2017, Kimberly-Clark filed a Complaint seeking injunctive and declaratory relief to prevent Defendants from enforcing the Nonwoven Disposable Products Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 1. Shortly thereafter, it also moved for a preliminary injunction on the same ground. The Court held several conference calls with the parties to assess whether the District might stay enforcement of the Act pending the issuance of its regulations. When this effort bore no fruit, the Court held oral argument on the PI Motion on December 13, 2017, and this Opinion follows on an expedited basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the Court briefly addresses whether all Defendants are properly before it. The Complaint names the District and various city personnel in their official capacities as Defendants, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, Attorney General Karl A. Racine, and DOEE Director Tommy Wells. It also tacks on a more curious party, D.C. Water, which has no authority to implement, enforce, or rescind the Act. Although it is not clear whether this entity belongs in such a suit, no motion to dismiss has been filed. The Court, for the timing being, thus treats the PI Motion as brought against all named Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The District argues the negative, noting that it has stipulated that it \"will take no action to enforce\" the Act until the \"implementing regulations are promulgated and any 'compliance' period offered by [DOEE]\" expires.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stipulation by District Defendants.

In other words, the statute attaches liability to any non-complying wipes\n   <em>\n    manufactured\n   </em>\n   after January 1, 2018. At oral argument, the District made clear that its \"grace period\" does not change that trigger date for liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg. Tr. 35:3-15. Kimberly-Clark could thus still face fines for any wipes manufactured after January 1, 2018, so long as they happened to be sold in the District once the compliance period ends. The company believes it cannot risk manufacturing any non-complying wipes in 2018 because once wipes enter the stream of commerce, it has no control over how long they stay on retailers' shelves.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl, \u00b6 7.

The case, as a result, fits squarely within\n   <em>\n    Abbott Laboratories\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court's seminal opinion on ripeness. That case, too, dealt with a pre-enforcement challenge to a labeling requirement-namely,\n   that manufacturers of prescription drugs print the \"established name\" of the drug prominently on its packaging.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335008\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/136/#p149\">\n    387 U.S. at 138-139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335008\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/136/#p149\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court nevertheless determined that the petitioners' challenge was ripe for review, relying principally on the fact that the existence of the regulation-even before it had been enforced-placed the petitioners in an untenable position: \"Either they must comply with the [ ] requirement and incur the costs of changing over their promotional material and labeling or they must follow their present course and risk prosecution.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335008\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/136/#p149\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335008\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/136/#p149\">\n    at 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335008\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/136/#p149\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Abbott Labs. v.

Come January 1, 2018, Kimberly-Clark will face the same dilemma: comply with the labeling requirement, at substantial expense and at the expense of their First Amendment rights, or continue marketing their wipes as flushable, at the risk of civil liability. In such a scenario, the Court can properly reach the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Preliminary-Injunction Factors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Although Plaintiff enumerates five separate counts, it need only satisfy the preliminary-injunction factors on one to prevail. The Court concludes that Kimberly-Clark's First Amendment argument checks all the boxes in that respect, and it therefore declines to reach Plaintiff's positions on the Commerce Clause and Due Process Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    1. Likelihood of Success on Merits\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court begins, naturally enough, with the first prong, which asks whether Kimberly-Clark can establish a likelihood of success on its First Amendment challenge. To refresh, the Act includes two key components: section 3(b) requires the company to disclose that its wipes sold in the District \"\n   <em>\n    should not\n   </em>\n   be flushed\"; as a corollary, section 3(a) forbids Kimberly-Clark from advertising that those wipes\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   be flushed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.C. Law 21-220 \u00a7 3 (emphasis added). To prevail, Plaintiff must show that this sort of labeling requirement is likely to violate its free-speech rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   a. Scope of Challenge\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   At the outset, the Court must define the scope of that First Amendment claim: Does Kimberly-Clark challenge the Act on its face or as applied? D.C. Water categorizes the Complaint as a \"facial challenge,\" which would immediately halt all enforcement of the Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.C. Water Resp. at 22. To mount such an offensive, the company would need to establish \"that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that the law is unconstitutional in all of its applications.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Tr. 11:4-7 (agreeing Kimberly-Clark had \"no objection\" to proceeding \"on an as-applied basis that covered [its] products\").

In other words, Plaintiff recognizes that other non-woven disposable products, such as baby wipes, were never intended to be flushable, and it does not question whether the District can require manufacturers of those wipes, including Kimberly-Clark, to say as much. Following suit, the Court considers only this narrow question: is the Act constitutional as applied to wipes that Kimberly-Clark engineered to be flushable?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   b.

Kimberly-Clark \"vehemently disagrees\" that its wipes \"should not be flushed.\" PI Mot. at 37. Indeed, that is what this suit is fundamentally about. The company designed its wipes to be flushable and \"strongly believes\" it did so successfully.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Yet the Act would suppress that view, while simultaneously compelling Plaintiff to announce that its wipes \"should not be flushed.\" D.C. Law 21-220 \u00a7 3(b). That requirement is hardly a \"disclosure\" of undisputed facts; rather, whether the wipes can be flushed-and the harms they might cause to sewers-is subject to serious debate. True, terms like \"environmentally sustainable\" or \"fair trade\" may leap out as more controversial to the layperson. As it turns out, however, the term \"flushable\" carries its own baggage. Surprising as it may be, \"flushability\" is a lightning rod for those in the know, and the District itself pitches this case as involving a long-running \"dispute over the proper definition of 'flushable.' \" District Opp. at 2-4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (highlighting \"debate on [the] divergent standards\" of flushability between industry and environmental groups). On the one hand, corporations like Kimberly-Clark favor INDA's approach, which treats wipes as flushable even if they do not fully disperse underground. On the other, NACWA espouses a more rigorous definition, requiring wipes to dissolve within thirty minutes. While the District is free to pick sides in that battle, it cannot force Kimberly-Clark to be the messenger for its position, at least without surviving intermediate scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Admittedly, the city has not yet promulgated regulations implementing the Act, and it is therefore not entirely clear what Kimberly-Clark's label must include. Some requirements, of course, might be harder to swallow than others. For instance, DOEE might mandate that Kimberly-Clark disclose: \"The District has found these wipes do not comply with the NACWA definition of flushable.\" Or it might simply require a warning that flushing the wipes \"contributes in non-negligible amounts to clogs in sewer systems.\" Either fact-based warning could well avoid the above questions about accuracy and, therefore, might be appropriate for review under\n   <em>\n    Zauderer\n   </em>\n   . At this stage, however, the Court can look only to the statute for guidance. That Act provides that companies must affix a \"clear[ ] and conspicuous[ ]\" label that the product \"should be not be flushed.\" D.C. Law 21-220 \u00a7 3(b). On its face, the statute thus seems to\n   require Kimberly-Clark to warn consumers, without qualification, not to flush its wipes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The legislative history supports that interpretation. Originally, the Act would have required manufacturers to employ a \"Do Not Flush\" label.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Committee Report at 4. The final version allowed \"additional flexibility to use logos or other images\" that communicate the same message.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Such a logo might appear as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Hearing Record at 14 (witness approvingly citing this emblem). Those type of warnings or logos do not present \"facts\"; they simply advise the consumer about what to do with a product. Such an unqualified stance against flushing would run headlong into Kimberly-Clark's views on how its product can be disposed. It is therefore inappropriate for the\n   <em>\n    Zauderer\n   </em>\n   framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The District resists that conclusion, but its arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. First, it contends that the phrase \"should not be flushed\" is factual, at least when backed by a statutory definition. That is, it believes that so long as the statute supplies a standard for flushability, it does not matter whether Plaintiff disputes the underlying methodology.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 29 (citing\n   <em>\n    Mass.

In that case, the company would face no disclosure requirement, and no \"controversy\" would exist about the District's definition of flushable. While that happy ending may yet come to pass, nothing in the statute\n   <em>\n    requires\n   </em>\n   it to be so. Under the Act's terms, Kimberly-Clark might need to advise its consumers that its wipes \"should not be flushed,\" no matter how reasonable its belief to the contrary. Indeed, the D.C.

Misleading Speech\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Before turning to that scheme, the Court pauses to discuss a variant argument offered by the District. At times, the city seems to suggest that Kimberly-Clark's use of the word \"flushable\" might be misleading, at least insofar as those wipes do not satisfy the District's definition of that term. In such a scenario, it says, it could ban the word \"flushable\" without infringing any First Amendment interests. While it is true that the First Amendment does not cover \"inherently\" or \"actually\" misleading commercial speech,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pearson v. Shalala\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1381145,3668070\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/650/\">\n    164 F.3d 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 655 (D.C. Cir. 1999), the District does not seriously argue that the word \"flushable\" is misleading in those ways. Just as it is controversial whether Kimberly-Clark's wipes \"should not be flushed,\" it is debatable\n   whether they are \"flushable.\" That controversy, however, does not render the label misleading. Should consumers share Kimberly-Clark's definition of flushable, the advertising is spot on. At most, then, the word \"flushable\" is \"potentially misleading\" for consumers who share the District's conception of the term.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1381145,3668070\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/650/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But \"potentially misleading\" speech, like other commercial speech, is still subject to\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1381145,3668070\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/650/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1381145,3668070\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/650/\">\n    at 655-656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   iii.\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The appropriate standard now determined, the Court can analyze the interests at stake. Under\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson\n   </em>\n   , the government must show 1) a substantial interest that 2) its restriction directly and material advances and 3) that the regulation is not \"more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186683\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/557/#p561\">\n    447 U.S. at 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186683\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/557/#p561\">\n    100 S.Ct. 2343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As to the first prong, the District posits that \"nonwoven disposable products-including wet wipes-cause serious problems in [its] sewer system.\" Opp. at 31. Its substantial interest thus lies in \"combatting consumer deception and decreasing the amount of non-flushable materials found in the District's sewer system, which may result in serious health and safety risks for utility workers and costly repairs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32. It also maintains that its labeling requirements \"directly advance\" that interest, as wipes labeled as \"flushable\" were found in appreciable quantities in its sewers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33. Changing the label, it believes, could effectively deter consumers from such behavior.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Kimberly-Clark assails each of those arguments. First, it questions whether the financial toll from wet wipes, which the District variously estimates as between $50,000-$500,000, could constitute a \"substantial interest,\" particularly in relation to D.C. Water's $535.8 million budget.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PI Memo. at 11. Second, it claims that the District has failed to supply evidence that restrictions on \"flushable\" wipes would serve its ends. Indeed, Kimberly-Clark contends that the Act might be counter-productive, as it would leave consumers unable to distinguish between wipes designed to be flushable and those that are not. Left with fewer \"flushable\" options, consumers might just throw out the baby with the bath water and flush all wipes without discriminating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court need not resolve either debate. Even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the District is correct on those prongs, it would still trip on the final hurdle: its regulation is not narrowly tailored to its ends. To explain why, the Court must decouple the Act's two labeling requirements, each of which must survive intermediate scrutiny. First, the District required manufacturers to disclose that their wipes \"should not be flushed,\" unless those wipes satisfied a three-part test for flushability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.C. Law 220-21 \u00a7 3(b). Second, as a corollary, it prohibited manufacturers from labeling those wipes as flushable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3(a). Perhaps inadvertently, the city argues only that the latter requirement passes intermediate scrutiny. It makes no case that section 3(b)'s disclosure requirement could satisfy\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson\n   </em>\n   's final prong. In any event, the Court discusses each restriction, determining that neither passes muster.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   SECTION 3(B): DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Although the government need not choose the \"least restrictive means\" of achieving its goals, there must be a \"reasonable fit\" between means and ends.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Trustees of St. Univ. of New York v.

The city might have published a centralized list of products considered flushable and promoted that list in conjunction with its ongoing \"Protect Your Pipes\" outreach campaign. Or it might have chosen an alternative, less restrictive disclosure requirement, such as one that expressly tied the \"Do Not Flush\" warning to the District's factual findings (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \"The District has found these products cannot be safely flushed.\") or one that provided a more nuanced view on the product's flushability (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \"Flushing this wipe contributes to clogs in the sewer system.\"). Plaintiff agrees that it would be less restrictive, for example, if the District required it to carry a \"Protect Your Pipes\" logo and encouraged consumers to learn more at a District website. Of course, the city was not required to employ any of those alternatives, nor must it select the least restrictive means to achieve its goal, but it needed to at least\n   <em>\n    consider\n   </em>\n   whether some alternative might suffice.

That is, the D.C. Council concluded that \"for a disclosure regarding 'non-flushable' products to be effective[,] ... a concomitant restriction on labeling those same products as 'flushable' is needed; otherwise the two terms will work at\n   cross-purposes ... and the Act will accomplish nothing.\" Dist. Opp. at 35;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg. 44:1-8 (\"assuming ... that the disclosure ... is appropriate,\" it would not \"accomplish much at all\" without \"a restriction on [the] use of the term 'flushable.' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The District's arguments might find traction were its disclosure requirement constitutional.

In other words, if the District could require manufacturers to advise that their products should\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be flushed, it could also prevent them from labeling those products as flushable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350530\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/500/#p505\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But, as explained above, the District gave little thought to whether it needed that disclosure requirement in the first place. Had it so considered, perhaps the city would have found an alternative to the disclosure requirement, and perhaps then use of the term \"flushable\" would not be so counterproductive to its scheme. Perhaps not. The important point, again, is that the District made no such effort.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In its briefing on this question, the District offers little in the way of counter-argument. It claims that the Act is narrowly tailored because it does not \"ban claims of 'flushability\" when a product complies with its statutory definition, nor does it prohibit manufacturers from providing supplemental information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   District Opp. at 35-36. That may be so. But the fact that the Act is not the\n   <em>\n    most\n   </em>\n   restrictive means possible does not absolve the District from considering\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   restrictive means.

That is not to say, however, that the District's \"Protect Your Pipes\" campaign is a pipe dream. As noted above, the Court's holding is limited to a certain subset of Kimberly-Clark wipes, which it designed and believes to be flushable. The city may thus continue to regulate other wipes, such as baby wipes, which disintegrate less readily. The D.C. Council heard testimony that\n   <em>\n    those\n   </em>\n   wipes constitute 93% of all nonwoven disposable products,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Hearing Record at 9, and even NACWA conceded that these \"non-flushable\" products were the main source of the District's sewer woes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Court also acknowledges the possibility that the regulations, whenever promulgated, might change the game, particularly if the District tailored its disclosure requirement to satisfy the \"factual and uncontroversial\" prong of\n   <em>\n    Zauderer\n   </em>\n   . The D.C. Council, moreover, might consider alternatives to its current labeling requirement; if it were to collect evidence that those efforts would be less effective, it could impose the same restrictions and stand a better chance of surviving\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson\n   </em>\n   scrutiny. All the Court holds today is that the statute, in its current form, is likely unconstitutional as applied to Kimberly-Clark's flushable wipes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    2.

That Hobson's choice impinges on Plaintiff's First Amendment freedoms and therefore constitutes irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The remaining two factors follow along the same lines. When a court \"see[s] likely success\" in a First Amendment challenge, it should \"view more favorably [the plaintiff's] arguments regarding ... the balance of the equities[ ] and the public interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Pursuing America's Greatness\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350530\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/500/#p505\">\n    831 F.3d at 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As to the first, the Court must weigh the harm to Kimberly-Clark if there is no injunction against the harm to the District if there is.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"And in this case, the [District's] harm and the public interest are one and the same, because the government's interest\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   the public interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nken v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p435\">\n    556 U.S. 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 435,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p435\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p435\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) (holding that, in the context of stay, the balance-of-equity and public-interest prongs \"merge when the Government is the opposing party\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The District contends that a preliminary injunction will undermine its (and the public's) interest in \"preventing consumer deception and the costly deterioration of its sewer system.\" Dist. Opp. at 43. At this stage, however, an injunction is not particularly disruptive. The District has yet to enact regulations and has stipulated that it will not enforce the Act until, at the earliest, those regulations are issued. Indeed, it expects to provide companies with an additional 18-24 months' grace period. In the interim, it professes an interest only in preserving retroactive liability for any wipe manufactured after January 1, 2018. Those wipes might still remain on the shelves in two years, and the District anticipates logistical hurdles in distinguishing between wipes based on manufacture date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg. Tr. 37: 17-19. The problem with that theory is that the District\n   <em>\n    already\n   </em>\n   must make that distinction, as the Act only applies to wipes manufactured after January 1, 2018. So the city's regulators must still check to see if a wipe was manufactured on, say, December 28, 2017. The marginal costs imposed by checking for wipes manufactured on, for example, January 2, 2018, is not so steep as to tip the equities in its favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Remedy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Last but not least: the question of remedy. In its Motion, Kimberly-Clark requests a \"preliminary injunction enjoining defendants from implementing or enforcing the Act pending the entry of final judgment on Kimberly-Clark's constitutional claims.\" PI Memo. at 45. At oral argument, however, Plaintiff agreed that it\n   would receive sufficient relief if the Court enjoined the District from enforcing the Act as to\n   <em>\n    its\n   </em>\n   \"flushable\" wipes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg. Tr. 11:4-7;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:16-20;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 55:5-18. Because the Court considers Kimberly-Clark's suit an as-applied challenge, it will impose the injunction only as to wipes that Kimberly-Clark engineered and believes to be flushable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   True, that remedy stops short of \"all the relief\" Plaintiff requested and might receive, for instance, from its Commerce Clause challenge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nw. Austin. Mun. Utility Dist. No. One v. Holde\n   </em>\n   r,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657859\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/193/#p205\">\n    557 U.S. 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 205-206,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657859\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/193/#p205\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657859\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/193/#p205\">\n    174 L.Ed.2d 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). A win on that ground could invalidate the statute as applied to all manufacturers outside the District (and all their wipes, whether flushable or not)\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   But as Kimberly-Clark recognized at oral argument, it cares little about whether the statute remains intact, so long as its own flushable wipes are safe from civil liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg. Tr. 12:16-20. Ever wary of needlessly deciding constitutional questions, the Court thus rules solely on First Amendment grounds, without reaching Plaintiff's positions on the Commerce Clause or Due Process.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NW. Austin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657859\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/193/#p205\">\n    557 U.S. at 205-206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657859\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/193/#p205\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (declining to reach constitutional issues when plaintiff's counsel indicated during oral argument that relief on statutory grounds would suffice).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Plaintiff also agreed that the Court might revisit whether an injunction is necessary after the District issues regulations implementing the Act, so long as it gives notice before dissolving any injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg. Tr. 56:12-24 (indicating that Kimberly-Clark would be \"satisfied\" with that relief). In other words, for the time being, Kimberly-Clark may safely manufacture flushable wipes without fear of any retroactive liability. Finally, the Court will hold a status hearing promptly after issuance of the regulations and may reconsider the injunction (and Plaintiff's other constitutional challenges) at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that a preliminary injunction as applied to Kimberly-Clark's flushable wipes is appropriate here. The injunction will remain in effect until further Order of the Court. A separate Order consistent with this Opinion will be issued this day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
