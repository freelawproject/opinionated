The primary issues are: (i) whether the procedural requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"APA\"), apply to the Motion for an injunction; (ii) whether the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-1 (\"RFRA\"), claim of the Plaintiffs' O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao Do Vegetal in the United States (called \"UDV\" by its members and the Court), Jose Carlos Garcia, Danielle Hounsell Silva Garcia, and J.H.S.G. (collectively \"the Plaintiffs\") has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (iii) whether the Plaintiffs are likely to suffer irreparable injury absent a preliminary injunction; (iv) whether the threatened injury to the Plaintiffs outweighs the injury an injunction could cause the Defendants Elaine Duke, L. Francis Cissna, Kathy Baran, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the United States of America (collectively \"the Defendants\"); (v) whether the injunction would be adverse to the public interest; and (vi) whether the Plaintiffs have met a disfavored preliminary injunction's heightened requirements. The Court concludes that: (i) the APA's procedural requirements do not apply to this Motion, because the Motion seeks injunctive relief under RFRA, and not under the APA; (ii) the Plaintiffs' RFRA claim has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (iii) the Plaintiffs are likely to suffer irreparable injury absent a preliminary injunction; (iv) the threatened injury to the Plaintiffs outweighs the injury an injunction could cause the Defendants; (v) the injunction would not be adverse to the public interest; and (vi) the Plaintiffs have met a disfavored preliminary injunction's heightened requirements. Because the Court concludes that narrower relief is appropriate than that requested, the Court will grant the Motion in part and deny it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FINDINGS OF FACT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pursuant to rule 52(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court makes findings of fact and conclusions of law to support its disposition of the Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

An important aspect of UDV's theology, however, is non-compensation of its ministers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 2; Plaintiffs' Exhibit A1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   23. USCIS granted at least one of these R-1 petitions despite its regulations by giving J. Garcia an exemption under RFRA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-1(a) - (b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' Exhibits A5-A6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   24.

USCIS stated in its notice of intent to deny that it intends to deny this I-360 petition because J. Garcia is not a compensated minister.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' Exhibit D2 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   27. If granted, the I-360 petition would not give J.

On July 7, 2017, UDV filed a third R-1 petition on J.

USCIS also denied D. Garcia and J.H.S.G.'s accompanying applications, because their legal statuses are wholly tied to J. Garcia's.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 10.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   8 C.F.R. 214.2(r)(4)(ii) (\"The spouse and unmarried children under the age of 21 of an R-1 alien may be accompanying or following to join the R-1 alien ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   32.

The Court will also describe important aspects of the hearings. The Court will then make conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Court will summarize the case's progress and discuss the parties' arguments for and against the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     The Complaint\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   1. The Plaintiffs assert several claims against the Defendants. First, the Plaintiffs argue that the Defendants have made \"a clear governmental directive to this particular Church to change what they believe in order to obtain an R-1 visa,\" which the Plaintiffs assert violates the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America. Complaint \u00b6 28, at 10-11. Next, the Plaintiffs contend that the Defendants erroneously denied J. Garcia's R-1 petition, and that the Court should issue a declaratory judgment saying that the petition should be approved.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 52, at 17. The Plaintiffs next allege several APA violations, including that the denial of the R-1 petition is arbitrary and capricious,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 57, at 17, and that the regulation used to deny the petition is ultra vires,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 56 at 17. The Plaintiffs also allege that the Defendants have \"unreasonably delayed adjudication of Plaintiffs' I-360 petition.\" Complaint \u00b6 58, at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   2. The Plaintiffs next request relief under the Mandamus Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201361\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Plaintiffs contend that \"Defendants have failed to properly adjudicate Plaintiffs' petitions in conformity with RFRA,\" thereby entitling the Plaintiffs to mandamus relief. Complaint \u00b6 60, at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   3. Finally, the Plaintiffs allege that \"the United States is judicially estopped from taking diametrically opposed positions in relation to Plaintiff UDV. An order of the court estopping the United States and its agents from holding a contrary position than their previous position is therefore warranted.\" Complaint \u00b6 2, at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The Motion\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   4. The Plaintiffs move the Court to grant a temporary restraining order and/or a preliminary injunction ordering the Defendants to grant the most recent R-1 petition and to adjudicate the pending I-360 petition within fourteen days of the Court's order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 15. The Plaintiffs first argue that they are likely to prevail on the merits of their claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 12. They contend that the Defendants misunderstand RFRA's application to this case and that the compensation regulation,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20214.2\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (r)(11)(i)-(ii), is ultra vires.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 12-13. The Plaintiffs further argue: \"Even if the regulation [is] not ultra vires, there still is no compelling interest in advancing the regulation as to this Church when application of this regulation directly impinges on a firmly held belief of the organization.\" Motion at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   5. The Plaintiffs next assert that they will suffer irreparable injury if the Court does not grant injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 13. According to the Plaintiffs, if they \"accrue more than 180 days of unlawful presence, even if the pending I-360 petition is approved, they will not be able to adjust status in the United States and become permanent residents. They will be forced to leave the United States.\" Motion at 13. Accordingly, the Plaintiffs argue, UDV would \"be left without a minister and the entire United States congregation will be left without a trusted overseer duly appointed by the highest authority of the church.\" Motion at 13. The Plaintiffs add that, without legal status, they cannot renew their Florida driver's licenses. Motion at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   6. The Plaintiffs continue that the balance of harms favors them. Motion at 14. They argue that the \"irreparable injury mentioned above demonstrates that the injury to Plaintiffs far outweighs any administrative harm that an injunction will cause Defendants.\" Motion at 14. They add that the \"only potential interest they could advance by their decision is to adhere strictly to a regulation that has no support in the statute.\" Motion at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   7. Finally, the Plaintiffs contend that granting injunctive relief serves the public interest, because \"it restores the public's faith in government officials doing their job properly and in a timely manner and not arbitrarily and capriciously changing long standing positions.\" Motion at 14. The Plaintiffs briefly add that the Court should waive injunctive relief's bond requirement, and conclude that the Court should order the Defendants to reverse their decision on the R-1 petition and grant it, along with the applications for J. Garcia's family, and order the Defendants to \"adjudicate the pending I-360 application within 14 days of the Court's order.\" Motion at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     The First Hearing\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   8. The Court held a hearing on November 21, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Draft Transcript of Motion Proceeding (taken November 21, 2017)(\"First Tr.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Plaintiffs did not request a full hearing on the Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Tr. at 11:4-5 (Vrapi). Rather, the Plaintiffs requested that the Defendants re-open J. Garcia's case, saying that if the Defendants did so, it would \"solve[ ] a lot of TRO type issues.\" First Tr. at 11:23-24 (Vrapi). The Court asked: \"What if I give the Government [un]til the end of the day to figure out what they're going to do?\" First Tr. at 19:4-6 (Court). The Plaintiffs replied that such an arrangement was acceptable, and that if the Defendants did not re-open J. Garcia's case, the Plaintiffs\n   would want a full Motion hearing the following week.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Tr. at 21:12-25 (Vrapi). The Plaintiffs and the Court agreed that the Court would issue an order giving the Defendants until noon the following day to give notice as to whether they would re-open J. Garcia's R-1 case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Tr. at 29:8-12 (Court, Vrapi). The Court issued such an order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Interim Order on Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and/or Preliminary Injunctive Relief at 1, filed November 21, 2017 (Doc. 7). The Defendants gave notice that they would not re-open J.

Between the two hearings, the Defendants filed their response.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 1. The Defendants first contend that the Plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief is moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 8. Specifically, the Defendants argue that Garcia's most recent R-1 petition requested only an extension of his legal status until November 27, 2017, and that date has passed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 8. The Defendants thus conclude that there is no live case regarding the R-1 petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   10. The Defendants next argue that the \"plaintiffs seek relief that the Court may not award under the APA.\" Response at 8. The Defendants assert that the APA allows a court to compel agency action only \" 'to perform a ministerial or non-discretionary act,' \" or \" 'to take action upon a matter without directing how it shall act.' \" Response at 8 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Norton v. S. Utah Wilderness All.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5858295\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/55/#p64\">\n    542 U.S. 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 64,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5858295\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/55/#p64\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5858295\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/55/#p64\">\n    159 L.Ed.2d 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004) ). The Defendants accordingly conclude that the Plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief \"contravenes the APA's statutory grant of limited powers of review to federal courts.\" Response at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   11. Additionally, the Defendants assert that \"the Plaintiffs cannot satisfy the Heightened Standard for a Preliminary Injunction.\" Response at 10. They argue that, \"because the Plaintiffs request a disfavored preliminary injunction, this Court must closely examine their claims to ensure that they have clearly and unequivocally shown that a preliminary injunction is indeed necessary.\" Response at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   12. Finally, the Defendants posit that the Plaintiffs cannot meet any of the preliminary injunction requirements. Response at 12. First, they contend that the Plaintiffs will suffer no immediate irreparable harm absent injunctive relief, because \"the only future harm alleged is that, if Mr. Garcia and his family remain in the country without legal status for 180 days, they will be barred from reentering the country for 3 years.\" Response at 13 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(9)(B)(i)(I) ). Second, the Defendants contend that the Plaintiffs \"lack a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits, as [the Plaintiffs'] request for R-1 relief is moot, [and] this Court cannot compel a particular agency action.\" Response at 13. Third, the Defendants contend that \"the Plaintiffs have not shown that their potential injury outweighs the government's.\" Response at 16 (citing\n   <em>\n    Lopez v.

Finally, the Defendants assert that \"the public interest in the uniform enforcement of immigration policies also outweighs Plaintiffs' asserted public interest in saving taxpayers attorney's fees.\" Response at 16. The Defendants therefore conclude that the Court should deny the Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    5.\n    <em>\n     The Second Hearing\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   13. The Court held the second hearing on December 1, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Draft Transcript of Motion Proceeding (taken December 1, 2017)(\"Second Tr.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Plaintiffs began by calling Ty Bixby, a UDV member, to testify.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Tr. at 2:8-9 (Vrapi). The Defendants objected to any witnesses testifying, arguing that review of this case should be limited to the administrative record under the APA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Tr. at 2:12-15 (Chen). The Court decided that it would hear the evidence, but in issuing its decision and opinion, it would review the APA's applicability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Tr. at 5:20-25 (Court). Bixby then testified that he held both religious and administrative positions within UDV.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Tr. at 9:16-21 (Bixby). Bixby explained that UDV does not believe in compensating its clergy, and that \"everything we do for the center is all only [on a] volunteer basis.\" Second Tr. at 19:8-9 (Bixby). Bixby continued that much of UDV's liturgy is transmitted orally,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Second Tr. at 26:15-16 (Bixby), and that J. Garcia is a key religious figure in teaching this oral tradition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Tr. at 29:15-18 (Bixby). Bixby added that J. Garcia is the \"most experienced\" UDV member in the United States, Second Tr. at 31:9 (Bixby), and that J. Garcia \"has this knowledge of these teachings that we're acquiring but still need to learn from him,\" Second Tr at 33:18-20 (Bixby). Bixby continued that the only other people who are J. Garcia's equivalent live in Brazil \"and most of them have jobs that require their presence in Brazil in order to [sustain] their families because like I said we don't pay our people so everyone has to work.\" Second Tr. at 34:14-17 (Bixby). According to Bixby, if J. Garcia had to leave the United States it would break the chain of UDV's oral tradition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Tr. at 35:1-4 (Vrapi, Bixby).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   14. The Plaintiffs then called Gary Lombardo, another UDV member, over the Defendants' objections, to the stand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Tr. 39:3-13 (Vrapi, Chen). Lombardo explained that he has both administrative and religious positions in UDV.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Tr. at 39:22-25 (Lombardo). He testified that \"all of the religious positions [in UDV] are fulfilled on a volunteer basis.\" Second Tr. at 48:20-21 (Lombardo).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   15. The Court asked the Plaintiffs about irreparable harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Tr. at 58:5-6 (Court). The Plaintiffs responded that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   Mr. Garcia is out of [status;] he could be literally placed in deportation proceedings at any moment. The second thing is even though he technically can remain here without further penalties until April of 2018, the fact is that he can't travel outside the United States. He can't fulfill his religious duties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Second Tr. at 58:9-15 (Vrapi). According to the Plaintiffs, \"if the I-360 petition continues to remain un-adjudicated by January 6 of 2018, Mr. Garcia loses his option to adjust [status in] the United States.\" Second Tr. at 60:8-10 (Vrapi).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   16. The Defendants began their argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Tr. at 77:19 (Genova). The Defendants first contended that the R-1 claim is moot, because the Plaintiffs requested R-1 status until only November 27, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Tr. at 78:17-20 (Genova). Second, the Defendants asserted that the pending I-360 petition is not a reason to grant injunctive relief, because an I-360 petition is \"one step removed\" from J. Garcia receiving legal status. Second\n   Tr. at 80:10-13 (Genova). The Defendants then added that \"any claims that plaintiffs are making regarding harm because of removal proceedings ... [are] unripe until such proceedings are actually initiated.\" Second Tr. at 83:9-12 (Genova). Regarding injunctive relief, the Defendants argued that \"the Ninth Circuit has recognized that the Government does have this compelling interest in preventing fraud in the immigration system ... [and] there is a significant public interest in the enforcement of immigration law.\" Second Tr. at 84:19-25 (Genova). The Defendants added that, \"if granted, the I-360 would only permit him to apply for a green card, and that is what would grant him status.\" Second Tr. at 97:3-5 (Chen).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    6.\n    <em>\n     The Reply\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   17.

Next, the Plaintiffs argue that they meet injunctive relief's requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 3. First, they contend that \"a plaintiff satisfies the irreparable harm analysis by alleging a violation of RFRA.\" Reply at 3. The Plaintiffs then briefly argue that the balancing of injuries and public interest requirements favor them, before delving into the substantial likelihood of success on the merits requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 5-6. On that point, the Plaintiffs contend that the Defendants are \"imposing on the church the impossible choice of giving up what it believes in or giving up who leads it.\" Reply at 8. According to the Plaintiffs, \"the government has made no attempts at showing it has a compelling interest or that it is employing the least restrictive means in protecting that interest.\" Reply at 8.

The Court heard Bixby's testimony, who explained that much of UDV's liturgy is transmitted orally,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Second Tr. at 26:15-16 (Bixby); FOF \u00b6 3, and that J.

The Defendants protest that \"any harm from the pending adjudication of the Form I-360 currently is speculative, because the Form I-360 does not in itself grant lawful status.

RFRA clarifies, however, that agency action that burdens the exercise of religion gives rise to a claim for relief and not an administrative appeal.\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-1(c) (\"A person whose religious exercise has been burdened in violation of this section may assert that violation as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government.\"); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-2(1) (stating that, for RFRA's purposes, \"the term 'government' includes a[n] ... agency ... of the United States\")\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Olenhouse v. Commodity Credit Corp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7418537\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/42/1560/#p1580\">\n     42 F.3d at 1580\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Reviews of agency action in the district courts must be processed\n    <em>\n     as appeals\n    </em>\n    .\" (emphasis in original)).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-190\">\n    To the extent that RFRA's declaration that someone whose exercise of religion is substantially burdened by agency action has a claim-and not an administrative appeal-effectively modifies the APA, such a modification is permissible. The APA states that \"Subsequent statute[s] may not be held to supersede or modify [the APA] except to the extent that it does so expressly,\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20559\">\n     5 U.S.C. \u00a7 559\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . RFRA, however, satisfies that requirement with its statement that it applies to all Federal law, and the implementation of that law, whether statutory or otherwise, and whether adopted before or after November 16, 1993,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000b-3. That statement does not mention APA explicitly, but if Congress wanted to require APA modifications to explicitly reference the APA, it knows how to draft such a statute.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    42 U.S.C. sec. 2000bb-3(b) (\"Federal statutory law adopted after November 16, 1993, is subject to this chapter unless such law explicitly excludes such application\n    <em>\n     by reference to this chapter\n    </em>\n    .\" (emphasis added)). The distinction between RFRA claims and administrative appeals provides a potential rationale for other courts' pronouncements that \"RFRA and the APA provide two distinct causes of action with different standards of review, and therefore this Court rejects the argument that the record rule applies to Plaintiffs' RFRA claims.\"\n    <em>\n     Northern Arapaho Tribe v. Ashe\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4329637\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/925/1206/#p1211\">\n     925 F.Supp.2d at 1211\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Finally, the Court notes that although, in the context of preliminary injunctions, the Tenth Circuit \"analogizes RFRA to a constitutional right,\"\n    <em>\n     Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v.
