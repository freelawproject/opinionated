(\"Uber\" or \"defendant\") and two of its founders, Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp (the \"individual defendants\") competed unlawfully in the on-demand, ride-hail ground transportation market in and around Boston, Massachusetts. Plaintiffs in all seven actions allege that Uber competed unfairly in violation of the common law and the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act. Certain plaintiffs also allege that Uber violated state and federal antitrust law, interfered with advantageous business relationships, engaged in a civil conspiracy and aided and abetted unfair competition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Before the Court are 1) a motion to dismiss of individual defendants Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp (Docket No. 70) and 2) defendants' consolidated motion to dismiss plaintiffs' complaints (Docket No. 72).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The City of Boston has traditionally regulated taxis under a set of municipal rules, ordinances and regulations collectively\n   known as \"Taxi Rules\". The Police Commissioner for the City of Boston (\"the Commissioner\") is authorized by statute to regulate all vehicles that fall under those rules. Boston Police Department Rule 403 (\"Rule 403\") requires that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [i]n the City of Boston, no person, firm, or corporation driving or having charge of a taxicab or other private vehicle shall offer the vehicle for hire for the purpose of transporting, soliciting and/or picking up a passenger or passengers unless said person is licensed as a hackney driver and said vehicle is licensed as a hackney carriage by the Police Commissioner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   City of Boston Code 16-15.05: Vehicle for Hire Ordinance (Appendix I to Rule 403).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Rule 403 applies to all vehicles \"used or designed to be used for the conveyance of persons for hire from place to place\" within the city of Boston.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Taxi Rules impose certain regulations on taxi cabs, such as requiring possession of a taxi medallion, maintaining a properly equipped taxicab and belonging to an approved dispatch service or radio association.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Uber entered the Boston market for private transportation services in 2011 and launched its UberX service in 2013. The company provides a digital tool for requesting private vehicles-for-hire by users who download Uber's free \"smart phone application\" (\"the Uber app\"). Users who open the Uber app on their mobile phones are shown a map of their location or designated pick-up point and the available Uber-affiliated vehicles in that vicinity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In August, 2016, Massachusetts enacted the Transportation Network Companies Act (\"the TNC Act\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.G.L. c. 159A \u00bd. The statute defines a TNC as an \"entity that uses a digital network to connect riders to drivers to pre-arrange and provide transportation.\" M.G.L. c. 159A \u00bd \u00a7 1. The law preempts municipalities from regulating TNCs through local Taxi Rules. M.G.L. c. 159A \u00bd \u00a7 10 (\"[N]o municipality or other local or state entity, ... may subject a [TNC]\" to requirements besides the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities and the Massachusetts Port Authority.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the \"Taxi Maintenance\" action plaintiffs assert claims against Travis Kalanick, Uber's co-founder and former CEO, and Garrett Camp, an Uber co-founder and a current director. The complaint names both individuals as defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The present litigation involves seven different groups of plaintiffs that represent over 700 holders of taxi medallions in the Greater Boston area. The various complaints were filed in this district between December, 2016, and April, 2017. The Court consolidated the cases pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a)(2) on October 5, 2017. On November 13, 2017, this Court entered an order explaining in detail how the cases were to proceed consistent with judicial economy and due process for all parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Before the Court are two omnibus motions to dismiss filed by defendants: one with respect to Uber and the other with respect to the individual defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Motion to Dismiss of Defendants Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Only the Taxi Maintenance plaintiffs pursue a claim against the individual defendants.

In such a case, the Court explained, no explicit statement from the municipal regulator would be necessary. Because the Court found that the regulatory scheme in the\n   <em>\n    Dial a Car\n   </em>\n   case was, \"at the very least, ambiguous with regard to the legality\" of the defendants' conduct, the regulation was found insufficiently clear for Lanham Act purposes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7641546,3693236\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/82/484/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In sharp distinction, the regulatory scheme in this case is \"so clear on its face that no good faith doubt concerning its interpretation\" is possible.

A response from Uber that it did not \"hav[e] charge\" of the vehicles is underwhelming. If this Court were to find that Uber did not have control over its drivers, then its business model would consist of aiding and abetting the \"private vehicle[s]\" of those drivers, none of which was licensed as a hackney carriage by the Police Commissioner. Under either reading, there is \"no good faith doubt\" that Uber was (during the subject interlude and if the facts alleged are proved) engaged in unlawful behavior.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7641546,3693236\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/82/484/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 489 n. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   For all of these reasons, the\n   <em>\n    Dial a Car\n   </em>\n   doctrine does not compel this Court to dismiss plaintiffs' unfair competition claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    iv.

Drawing all inferences in favor of the plaintiffs, as the Court must do at this stage, they have plausibly alleged that Rule 403 or its equivalent in other municipalities was, at least occasionally, enforced against Uber drivers. Even if that were not the case, regulatory forbearance is insufficient to prompt exemption under \u00a7 3.

In Count I of their complaint they allege that Uber controls and manages its drivers, such that Uber is directly liable for violating Chapter 93A. Their claims of civil conspiracy and aiding and abetting, (Counts III and IV), however, resort to Plan B. They allege that if Uber did not violate the Taxi Rules, they facilitated the violation of those rules by assisting Uber drivers in an unlawful business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Plaintiffs have pled facts sufficient to establish that Uber gave substantial assistance to its drivers to violate the Taxi Rules. Both Uber and the plaintiffs agree that Uber classifies its drivers as \"independent third-party drivers\". Both parties agree that Uber connects the drivers to passengers through its smart phone application and that Uber collects the fares for its drivers. The parties disagree on the issue of whether Uber's drivers were subject to the Taxi Rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   This Court finds that the text of Rule 403 clearly applies to Uber drivers.
