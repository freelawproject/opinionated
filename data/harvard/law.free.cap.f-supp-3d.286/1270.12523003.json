Hammons begins that argument-perplexingly-by stating that \"[i]n his Motion ...

Reply at 3. It follows, according to Hammons, that Oregon first-degree robbery is not an ACCA violent felony under the Elements Clause, because one commits Oregon first-degree robbery by committing Oregon third-degree robbery, and: (i) being armed with a deadly weapon; (ii) using or attempting to use a dangerous weapon; or (iii) causing or attempting to cause serious physical injury to any person.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 3-4. Hammons contends that those three aggravators do not satisfy the Elements Clause, so first-degree robbery, like third-degree robbery, is not an ACCA violent felony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Turning to his New Mexico conviction, Hammons recognizes that \"the Court may consider itself at least guided by the circuit court's ruling\" in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Magistrate Judge Martinez acknowledges Hammons' contention that\n   <em>\n    Johnson Or.\n   </em>\n   \"held that a conviction for Oregon third degree robbery requires only minimal force,\" but she observes that the \"Defendant fails to note that in\n   <em>\n    State of Oregon v.

Magistrate Judge Martinez accordingly concludes that, notwithstanding the Court of Appeals of Oregon's\n   <em>\n    Johnson Or.\n   </em>\n   opinion, \"Oregon's third degree robbery\n   statute satisfies\n   <em>\n    Johnson 2010's\n   </em>\n   definition of physical force,\" such that Oregon third-degree robbery-and, hence, Oregon first-degree robbery-qualifies as an ACCA violent felony.

Hammons acknowledges the Supreme Court of Oregon's statement that actual or threatened violence turns theft into robbery, but \"respectfully submit[s] that, absent the application of actual force, or alternatively evidence of the effect of any threats or intimidation upon the victim, this is insufficient to rise to\" an ACCA violent felony. PFRD Objections at 2-3. As to New Mexico aggravated assault against a household member with a deadly weapon, Hammons admits that, in light of\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Hammons \"would respectfully submit that ... the dissent authored by Judge Harris Hartz [in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Sweazea, United States Magistrate Judge,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Notice, filed May 3, 2017 (CIV Doc. 29), and the Court ordered Magistrate Judge Sweazea to \"submit an analysis, including findings of fact, if necessary, and recommended disposition,\" Order of Reference Relating to Prisoner Cases at 1, filed May 8, 2017 (CIV Doc 30)(\"Reference Order\"). Magistrate Judge Sweazea, \"[a]cting under [his] inherent authority to reconsider previous rulings\" and pursuant to the Reference Order, issued the Amended PFRD, which recommends \"Hammons' motion be granted and he be resentenced.\" Amended PFRD at 1. Magistrate Judge Sweazea agrees with Magistrate Judge Martinez' determination that \"the crime of aggravated assault against a household member includes the use or threatened use of violent force and was properly used to enhance Hammons' sentence under the ACCA.\" Amended PFRD at 11. Magistrate Judge Sweazea does not, however, agree with Magistrate Judge Martinez' determination regarding Oregon third-degree robbery, and he instead agrees with Hammons' contention \"that third-degree robbery under Oregon law ... does not entail the type of violent, physical force sufficient to meet\n   <em>\n    Johnson 2010.\n   </em>\n   \" Amended PFRD at 12. Magistrate Judge Sweazea reasons that the Court of Appeals of Oregon's determination that \"a tug was sufficient [for a third-degree robbery conviction] so long as it overcame the resistance of the victim\" means that \"third-degree robbery does not meet\n   <em>\n    Johnson 2010\n   </em>\n   's\n   <em>\n    violent\n   </em>\n   -force requirement because only slight force is necessary to sustain a conviction.\" Amended PRRD at 14-15 (emphasis in original)(citing\n   <em>\n    Johnson Or.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3283816,3284186\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/168/312/\">\n    168 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   314-15 ). Unlike Magistrate Judge\n   Martinez, who reads the Supreme Court of Oregon's statements in\n   <em>\n    State v. Hamilton\n   </em>\n   to dictate a contrary result,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   PFRD at 7, Magistrate Judge Sweazea explains away those statements as dicta, because \"\n   <em>\n    Hamilton\n   </em>\n   turned on the definition of 'victim' under the robbery statute, not the degree of force necessary to sustain a conviction,\" so \"[t]he Oregon Supreme Court therefore did not overrule\n   <em>\n    State v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   expressly or by implication.\" Amended PFRD at 14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   According to Magistrate Judge Sweazea, that Oregon third-degree robbery is not an ACCA violent felony means that Oregon first-degree robbery is, likewise, not an ACCA violent felony, because third-degree robbery can become first-degree robbery just because the perpetrator possesses-but does not use or make representations about-a gun.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended PFRD at 16-17.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21 (\"Hammons' convictions do not withstand scrutiny under the ACCA's force clause because first-degree robbery may be based on mere possession of a firearm while using minimal force to deprive a victim of personal property.\"). Magistrate Judge Sweazea consequently concludes that \"Hammons has only one qualifying conviction under the ACCA, aggravated assault against a household member under New Mexico law.\" Amended PFRD at 21. Magistrate Judge Sweazea therefore recommends that the Court resentence Hammons.

It would not be sound to think that a conviction changed just because, years or decades after the conviction's entry, the state legislature amended the state statute defining the relevant offense. Likewise, when a decision from a state's highest court avowedly changes the law-such as by applying a narrowing construction to a statute to save it from invalidation for First Amendment overbreadth-that change in the law does not alter earlier convictions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Shuttlesworth v.
