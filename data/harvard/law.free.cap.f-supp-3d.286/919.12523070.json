Because the answer to that question is central to resolution of this case and has not been definitively answered by the Tennessee courts, and because the answer could affect thousands of policy-holders in this state, the Court will grant Plaintiffs' Motion to Certify Question to the Tennessee Supreme Court. (Doc. No. 46). The Court will also deny without prejudice the remaining pending Motions (Doc. Nos. 27, 32 &amp; 35) because they all hinge to a greater or lesser extent on the answer to the certified question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Allegations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The named Plaintiffs in this putative class action are two married couples: Gregory and Jamie Lammert, and Larry and Susan Reasons. Both couples had property insurance through Auto-Owners. Both also sustained covered losses to their property and received (or were offered) payments for those loses that depreciated not only materials, but also labor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Gregory and Jamie Lammert\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Lammerts own a dwelling and other structures in Nashville, Tennessee Those properties are insured under a standard form \"Dwelling Insurance Policy\" issued by Auto-Owners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Hail damaged some of the Lammerts' residential buildings on May 10, 2016, and they filed a claim. Auto-Owners determined that coverage existed, and informed the Lammerts that the claim would be settled on an actual cash value basis. The policy at issue defined actual cash value as \"the cost to replace damaged property with new property of similar quality and features reduced by the amount of depreciation applicable to the damaged property immediately prior to the loss.\" (Doc. No. 28-3 at 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Auto-Owners calculated its obligation to the Lammerts to be $9,986.36. It did so by first estimating the cost to repair or replace the damage with new materials ($12,146.55) and then subtracting for depreciation ($2,160.19). Both labor and materials were depreciated for certain line items.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After receipt of the calculation, Cornerstone Public Adjusting contacted Auto-Owners on behalf of the Lammerts, and questioned the depreciation. Cornerstone was advised\n   <em>\n    via\n   </em>\n   email that \"Auto-Owners standard operating procedure is to apply depreciation to the replacement of the damaged item, which would include labor and materials.\" (Doc. No. 28-6 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Larry and Susan Reasons\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Reasons own a home and other structures (including a pool house) in Jackson, Tennessee. Those structure were insured under Auto-Owners' standard form \"Homeowners Insurance Policy.\" That policy, however, did not contain the same language as the Lammerts' policy defining actual cash value, but did provide: \"If you do not repair or replace the damaged covered property, we shall pay the actual cash value of the property at the time of loss. Actual cash value includes a deduction for depreciation.\" (Doc. No. 24-3 at 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 18, 2016, some of the structures on Reasons' property suffered\n   wind damage. The Reasons also suffered losses on March 9, 2017, as a result of a hail storm that damaged their residence and four other structures. Auto-Owners accepted both claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   With regard to the November 2016 claim, Auto-Owners calculated the cost to replace the wind-damaged roofs and then deducted an amount to account for pre-loss depreciation. In response to the Reasons' complaint about depreciation for labor costs, Auto-Owners wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   As to our applying depreciation to the full cost of repair to reach the actual cash value loss amount, we have always done this and know of no Tennessee law that would prohibit this from being done. It is a common practice with insurance carriers and complies with policy language to arrive at an actual cash value loss amount to be paid initially with recoverable depreciation to be paid once repairs have been completed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (Doc. No. 28-9 at 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   With regard to the March 2017 claim, the Reasons' policy provided for full replacement cost coverage, but the Reasons opted for the actual cash value under the policy. Accordingly, Auto-Owners again calculated the costs to repair or replace the damage property, and then deducted pre-loss depreciation, including labor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Other Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, many insurers licensed to do business in Tennessee pay full labor costs to both remove and reinstall damaged building material when making an actual cash value payment. This would include Farm Bureau Insurance-Tennessee, the state's largest domestic property insurance company. Other insurers do not. In fact, Auto-Owners' standard operating procedure is to depreciate labor cost when calculating actual cash value, and this is accomplished through Xactimate\u00ae, a claims estimating software utilized by most insurance companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When using Xactimate\u00ae, the adjuster has the option to calculate deductions by changing the programs' default settings. With the click of a mouse, the adjuster can check boxes to depreciate for \"material,\" \"non-material,\" \"removal,\" \"overhead and profit,\" \"sales tax,\" and any combination of these items. Thus, by clicking the box \"depreciate removal\" the adjustor depreciates the cost of removal labor; clicking the box \"depreciate non-material\" results in the labor for reinstallation being depreciated. The ensuing payments vary markedly, depending upon which boxes are checked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   To illustrate the point, Plaintiffs rely on a hypothetical claim for indemnity involving laminate flooring that was damaged by a sewer backup when two-thirds of its useful life remained. Under this hypothetical, and without depreciation for either removal of the old floor or reinstallation of the new floor, the actual cash value is $6,640.58. If, however, the cost of reinstallation labor is depreciated, the actual cash value becomes $4,414,83. If both reinstallation and removal labor are depreciated, the value drops $3,757.83. (Doc. No. 28 at 7-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Motion to Certify Question\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Where a state supreme court has a certification process available, the decision of whether to certify a question to that court \"rests in the sound discretion of the federal court.\"\n   <em>\n    Lehman Bros. v.

In this regard, Rule 23 of the Rules of the Tennessee Supreme Court provides, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"history\" id=\"p-32\">\n   The Tennessee Supreme Court may, at its discretion, answer questions of law certified to it by the Supreme Court of the United States, a Court of Appeals of the United States, a District Court of the United States in Tennessee, or a United States Bankruptcy Court in Tennessee. This rule may be invoked when the certifying court determines that, in a proceeding before it, there are questions of law of this state which will be determinative of the cause and as to which it appears to the certifying court there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of the Supreme Court of Tennessee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 23 \u00a7 1. Thus, for certification to be proper, (1) resolution of the question at hand must be \"determinative of the cause\" and (2) there must be \"no controlling precedent\" from the Tennessee Supreme Court. Both prongs are satisfied in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    A. \"Determinative of the Cause\n   </strong>\n   \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Auto-Owners concedes that \"if (as Plaintiffs contend) the question of whether Tennessee law prohibits labor-cost depreciation is unsettled and 'dispositive' of class-wide 'liability'...then that question should be certified to the Tennessee Supreme Court so that it may be answered most efficiently.\" (Doc. No. 43 at 4). Nevertheless, it opposes certification because \"even if the Tennessee Supreme Court held that labor-cost depreciation should not be considered when estimating ACV [actual cash value], Plaintiff could not establish liability unless they also proved that (1) the pre-loss ACV of their properties was in fact more than what Auto-Owners estimated; and that (2) the entire insurance claim was in fact underpaid in light of the other facts affecting the claim.\" (Doc. No. 53 at 7). Thus, in Auto-Owner's view, any answer provided by the Tennessee Supreme Court would not be \"determinative of the case\" within the meaning of Rule 23. This Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"Rule 23 permits consideration of questions of law only, not questions of fact or controversies as a whole,\"\n   <em>\n    Seals\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7297652\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/301/237/\">\n    301 S.W.3d at 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tenn. 2010), and \"a question of law is 'determinative of the cause' if it is claim-dispositive.\"\n   <em>\n    Lindenberg v.

No. 25, Amended Complaint \u00b6 90). Perhaps most telling as to the determinative nature of the issue is Auto-Owner's Motion to Dismiss and accompanying Memorandum (Doc.

Instead, in both cases the underlying issue was whether it was proper for the jury to consider depreciation in determining the actual cash value of a loss covered by an insurance policy. It is one thing for the jury to consider depreciation as a factor in determining indemnity.

No. 46 at 1). In response, Auto-Owners proposes the following question:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n    Is an insurer prohibited by Tennessee law from deducting the estimated pre-loss depreciation in a structural property's economic value from the estimated cost of labor to repair or replace the property when estimating the property's pre-loss \"actual cash value\" under an insurance policy that does not define ACV, explains that ACV \"includes a deduction for depreciation,\" or provides that ACV is calculated as the cost of repair or replacement less \"the amount of depreciation applicable to the damaged property immediately prior to loss\"?\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    (Doc. No. 53 at 8).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Of the two, Plaintiffs' proposal has virtue in its simplicity, although a little more detail as suggested by Auto-Owners is appropriate to account for the specific language at issue. Having considered the parties' submissions, the Court will certify the question as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n    Under Tennessee law, may an insurer in making an actual cash value payment withhold a portion of repair labor as depreciation when the policy (1) defines actual cash value as \"the cost to replace damaged property with new property of similar quality and features reduced by the amount of depreciation applicable to the damaged property immediately prior to the loss,\" or (2) states that \"actual cash value includes a deduction for depreciation\"?\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Obviously, the Tennessee Supreme Court is free to \"exercise [its] discretion to reframe the Rule 23 certified question before [it] so as to provide the guidance actually sought.\"\n    <em>\n     Shorts v.

No. 35), arguing that the Complaint fails to state a claim because, \"[u]nder well-established in Tennessee and elsewhere...the cost approach to calculating ACV is widely accepted and consistent with Tennessee's adoption of the broad evidence rule,\" and \"because Plaintiffs\n    claim relies on a purported labor-depreciation prohibition that does not exist in Tennessee law[.]\" (Doc. No. 36 at 2 &amp; 10). These grounds are inextricably linked to the question to be certified and, as such, the Motion will be denied without prejudice to refiling after the certification process has concluded.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification (Doc. No. 27) is also connected to the question to be certified because Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of insured who received actual cash value payment that depreciated labor cost. That motion, too, will be denied without prejudice.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    This leaves Plaintiffs' Motion to Resolve Class Certification Issue Before or at Least Simultaneously With, a Ruling Any of the Dispositive Legal Issues Presented (Doc. No. 32). At this point, the Court is simply reserving ruling on Auto-Owner's Motion to Dismiss pending a decision by the Tennessee Supreme Court should it accept certification. Regardless, the Sixth Circuit has \"consistently held that a district court is not required to rule on a motion for class certification before ruling on the merits of the case.\"\n    <em>\n     Miami Univ. Wrestling Club v.

Whether that is true, the Court has no way of knowing, particularly because the potential statewide ramifications of the question are made abundantly clear in both this decision and the Order Certifying Question. Further, Plaintiffs' argument neglects to consider that the \"rigorous analysis\" required by Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \"often overlaps with the merits of the plaintiff's underlying claim\" because it \"generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff's cause of action.\"\n    <em>\n     Comcast Corp. v.

That rigorous analysis cannot be conducted without considering how Tennessee law would treat Plaintiffs' theory that labor costs cannot be depreciated.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Finally, and as Auto-Owners points out, Plaintiffs do not \"explain why it would be most efficient for the Court to decide class certification based on its prediction of what the Tennessee Supreme Court would hold on the labor-depreciation question, when the Supreme Court could answer that question itself. That would resolve the question definitively, not just for the putative class, but for all Tennessee policyholders and insurers with policies like those here.\" (Doc.

Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    On the basis of the foregoing, Plaintiffs' Motion for Certification of Question to the Tennessee Supreme Court (Doc. No. 46) will be granted, but their Motion to Resolve Their Pending Motion for Class Certification Before, or at Least Simultaneously with, a Ruling on any Dispositive Legal Issues (Doc.
