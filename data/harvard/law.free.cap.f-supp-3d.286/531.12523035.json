Offense Level, Category, and Sentencing Guidelines Range\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The government, Probation, and the defense disagreed about the applicable Guidelines.

The level was increased by seven points because a firearm was discharged during the robbery. PSR at \u00b6 15; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(A). It was decreased by four points for defendant's minimal role in the offense, by two points for defendant's acceptance of responsibility, and by one point for defendant's timely notification of his intention to plead guilty. PSR at \u00b6\u00b6 17, 21, 22; U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3B1.2(a), 3E1.1(a), 3E1.1(b). Two points were added because he committed the offense while under a criminal sentence. PSR at \u00b6 57; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(d). His total criminal history score is 22, which places him in criminal history category VI. PSR at \u00b6 58.
