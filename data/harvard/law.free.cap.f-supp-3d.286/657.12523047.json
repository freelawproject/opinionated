David Newsome, Jr. (\"Plaintiff\") is the liquidating trustee and successor-in-interest to the claims of the reorganized debtor Mahalo Energy (USA), Inc. (\"Mahalo USA\"). (D.I.115). Plaintiff has asserted various claims against Defendants Jeff G. Lawson and Grant A. MacKenzie (collectively, the \"Defendants\") based on their role as attorneys for both Mahalo USA and its parent Mahalo Energy Ltd. (\"Mahalo Canada\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9, 84). The parties are currently engaged in jurisdictional discovery, which has led to the present dispute. A magistrate judge denied Plaintiff's motion to compel certain documents Defendants withheld as privileged. (D.I. 128). Presently before the court are Plaintiff's objections to the magistrate judge's rulings. (D.I. 129). For the reasons stated below, the court affirms in part and reverses in part the magistrate judge's rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mahalo USA was a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Mahalo Canada, a Canadian corporation headquartered in Calgary, Alberta. (D.I. 115 \u00b6\u00b6 27, 80). On May 21, 2009, Mahalo USA filed for bankruptcy and Mahalo Canada filed for the Canadian equivalent of bankruptcy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 26, 28). Defendants are corporate lawyers at Burnett, Duckworth &amp; Palmer, LLP, a Canadian law firm, and had an attorney-client relationship with both Mahalo USA and Mahalo Canada. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9, 84). Defendants also served as officers or directors of the companies. Specifically, MacKenzie was the corporate secretary of both Mahalo USA and Mahalo Canada, and Lawson was a director of Mahalo Canada. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 84).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff sued Defendants alleging breach of attorney fiduciary duty, attorney malpractice, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duties, and aiding and abetting illegal distributions in violation of 8\n   <em>\n    Del. C.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 174. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 115-82). On August 28, 2014, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, asserting lack of personal jurisdiction. (D.I. 11). After briefing and oral argument, the court entered an order granting Plaintiff leave to conduct jurisdictional discovery. (D.I. 35). Plaintiff thereafter issued discovery requests which led to several discovery disputes. (D.I. 47, D.I. 49, D.I. 50).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 12, 2015, the court referred the determination of all discovery disputes to a magistrate judge. (D.I. 68). A ruling on the parties' discovery disputes was held in abeyance pending, among other things, disposition of Plaintiff's motion to amend, which the court granted. (D.I. 20, D.I. 59, D.I. 85). After Plaintiff filed his first amended complaint, Defendants filed their second motion to dismiss. (D.I. 115, D.I. 116). The second motion to dismiss, like the first motion to dismiss, argued that the court lacked personal jurisdiction. (D.I. 116 at 5-8). Accordingly, the parties requested that the court rule on the outstanding discovery disputes. (D.I. 117).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Magistrate Judge's Rulings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The only portion of the discovery disputes currently before the court is whether Defendants have improperly asserted privilege to withhold certain documents from production. Plaintiff moved to compel production of the documents based on two exceptions to the attorney-client privilege: the adverse-litigation exception recognized by the Third Circuit in\n   <em>\n    In re Teleglobe Communications Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1091072,3510189\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/493/345/\">\n    493 F.3d 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2007), and the breach of duty exception codified at Del. R. Evid. 502(d)(3). (D.I. 128 at 18:15-20, 21:24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 9, 2016, the magistrate judge held a discovery conference, and the transcript of that conference served as the order of the court. (D.I. 126, D.I. 128). In general, the magistrate judge found that the adverse-litigation exception was inapplicable, because Plaintiff was suing the joint attorney and not the other joint client. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 128 at 19:13-20:19). In addition, the breach of duty exception was inapplicable, because it \"has nothing to do with joint representations.\" (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 32:12-19). More specifically, the magistrate judge made the following six rulings to which Plaintiff objects:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   THE COURT: [U]nder the\n   <em>\n    Teleglobe\n   </em>\n   case, the Court specifically stated, and I quote, the great caveat of the joint client privilege is that it only protects communications from compelled disclosures to parties outside the joint representation. When former co-clients sue one another ... the default rule is that all communications made in the course of the joint representation are discoverable. The\n   <em>\n    Teleglobe\n   </em>\n   case differs from this case because in that case, the subsidiary sued the parent. And there had been a joint representation involved between the parent and the sub. Here [it is] not joint clients suing one another, ... it's one client ... suing the attorney for both clients. A waiver cannot occur for the client who is not the party to the suit..... In other words, if your argument is we have a parent and a sub, the sub is now suing counsel who allegedly represented both the parent and the sub, that parent [doesn't] lose attorney/client privilege just because the sub has sued the attorney. That is a completely different circumstance. And that's what I understand we have here and what we didn't have in the\n   <em>\n    Teleglobe\n   </em>\n   case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (D.I. 128 at 19:13-20:19).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   THE COURT: [Y]ou're suggesting to me that the parent has given up ... any\n   claim of attorney/client privilege in any document that has any reference to [Mahalo USA] because of the joint representation and [Mahalo USA is] now suing through the trustee ... the attorneys that represented it [and] the parent. I don't see how ...\n   <em>\n    Teleglobe\n   </em>\n   ... fits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   MR. MOJDEHI: Let me address that question which was the second point. So\n   <em>\n    Teleglobe\n   </em>\n   gives us the general rule, and then the question is does this fall within that general rule?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   THE COURT: And the answer is no.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21:4-21).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   THE COURT: Then [\n   <em>\n    Teleglobe\n   </em>\n   ] says when co-clients and their common attorneys communicate with one another both communications are in confidence for privilege purposes. Moreover, the waiving of attorney/client privilege requires a consent. That consent [is in] regards to a client. Under the statements there are other laws governing lawyers. And a client ... may unilaterally waive the privilege as to its own communications with a joint attorney so long as those communications concern only the waiving client. It may not, however, unilaterally waive the privilege as to any other joint client communication or to any of its communications that relate to the joint clients. And that was the finding by the Third Circuit. That was the finding of the law that was applicable by the Third Circuit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24:2-19).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   THE COURT: You may have a case in the Delaware statutes, but I am saying to you I am going to follow the\n   <em>\n    Teleglobe\n   </em>\n   case on this, because the\n   <em>\n    Teleglobe\n   </em>\n   case also considered that Delaware statute in its applications and findings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   MR. MOJDEHI: But it wasn't dealing with-for the reasons you have stated, so we have got to take the general rule in\n   <em>\n    Teleglobe\n   </em>\n   and apply it to what we have here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   THE COURT: But it has pointed out, you cannot-just because I decide to sue my attorney who is jointly representing somebody else, I cannot say-I mean, this would put attorney/client privilege on its head. And I don't agree with the California case [\n   <em>\n    Anten v. Super. Ct.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4219298\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/233/1254/\">\n    233 Cal.App.4th 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=183%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20422\">\n    183 Cal.Rptr.3d 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 423 (2015) ]. And I don't think the Third Circuit would, either.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25:8-26:4;\n   <em>\n    see also Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22:1-9).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   THE COURT: I think when we're talking about breach of a duty by a lawyer or a client, I think that has nothing to do with joint representation by a lawyer to two clients or by two lawyers to the same two clients. I think that has to do with single lawyer or lawyer to that one client. It has nothing to do with joint representation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32:12-19).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   THE COURT: Well, Delaware has a similar statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   I also think that part of ... the reason why this exception was made was the fact that when, for example, ... a client sues a lawyer, the client cannot make the argument that the lawyer cannot use in his or her defense any confidential information that was provided by the lawyer to the client.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   That's part of what happens under this breach of duty by the lawyer or client aspect of it. But I could go back, the\n   <em>\n    Teleglobe\n   </em>\n   case speaks volumes on this, and the\n   <em>\n    Teleglobe\n   </em>\n   case also addressed these points more directly than certainly this case did as far as the issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   It was a thorough analysis and I'm standing by that. I understand what was said by the Court of Appeals in California [in\n   <em>\n    Anten\n   </em>\n   ], and that's fine, that's\n   their own interpretation. And you think that when it comes to the joint clients common interest that that's a different situation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   MR. MOJDEHI: So, Your Honor-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   THE COURT: Because otherwise you just basically eviscerate the attorney/client privilege for that one party who has nothing to do with the action, who has not waived its rights, who has not waived anything at all, who is not involved in the lawsuit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 113:5-114:13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In addition, there is nothing in the rule itself that suggests such a limitation. More important, a narrow interpretation of the exception could lead to a situation where a joint lawyer could breach the duty owed to all of his joint clients, and those joint clients could not compel disclosure of privileged communications from the joint representation.

Sup. Sept. 16, 2005). In\n   <em>\n    Bolton\n   </em>\n   , a law firm represented a musician along with a music publishing company, a record company, and a songwriter in defending against a claim of copyright infringement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. The law firm's fees were paid by the insurer for the music publishing company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The copyright infringement action resulted in a jury verdict against all of the defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The adverse judgment allowed the music publishing company and the record company to recover from the musician under an indemnity agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In a second action, the musician sued the law firm, alleging that it breached its fiduciary duties owed to him by pushing the copyright\n   infringement action to trial instead of settlement, which favored his co-clients' interests over his.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. In the fiduciary duty action, the law firm withheld, as privileged, communications from the joint representation in the copyright infringement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. The court compelled disclosure on the grounds that: (1) the documents reflected communications between the law firm and the co-clients in the copyright infringement action, (2) the documents \"were relevant to the common interest of the joint clients,\" and (3) the documents were relevant to the issues in the fiduciary duty action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. The court added that, to the extent the musician and his co-clients \"are alleged to have had conflicting interests in the [copyright infringement action], any such purported conflict does not render their individual communications with their joint attorneys confidential,\" because the co-clients had no reasonable expectations of confidentiality with respect to communications relevant to the matter of common interest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Taking\n   <em>\n    Eureka\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Bolton\n   </em>\n   together, the touchstone for compelling disclosure is whether the communications are relevant to the matter of common interest that is the subject of the joint representation. The Defendants cannot maintain a claim of privilege over communications relevant to the matter of common interest for which they were retained as joint attorneys by claiming that they had a conflict of interest within that joint representation. Instead, Defendants must demonstrate that the communications are related to an individual matter for which they were separately retained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
