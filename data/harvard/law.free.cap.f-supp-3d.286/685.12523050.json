Woodbury also alleges that her employer violated her right to privacy by taking a picture of her when she was unconscious, violated her freedom of speech by forcing her to vote in the 2012 presidential election, and subjected her to a hostile work environment after she threatened to notify authorities about suspected illegal activity. Pending before the Court are Defendants' Motion to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment, and Woodbury's Motion for Leave to File a Surreply. Having reviewed the pleadings, briefs, and other submitted materials, the Court finds that no hearing is necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. Md. Local R. 105.6. For the reasons set forth below, Defendants' Motion is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. Woodbury's Motion is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are presented in the light most favorable to Woodbury, the nonmoving party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Discrimination Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Woodbury worked as a relocation specialist for Victory, a moving company, from March 2012 until she was terminated on April 4, 2014. Woodbury is a woman, born in North America, who suffers from a neurological disorder that causes seizures and epilepsy. She alleges that Victory discriminated against her based on these traits by subjecting her to unequal terms of employment and by terminating her employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Woodbury's job was to sell Victory's moving services. For every booking she made, she received a three percent commission based on the booking's estimated price. Her male colleague, who performed the same job, received a commission based on the actual cost of the moving services he booked, a price that was almost always higher than the estimate. Thus, from March 2012 to March 2013, she was paid less than her male counterpart for the same work. She also alleges that Victory forced her to use a separate entrance to the Victory office because she is a woman, but she does not provide a timeframe for this behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 15, 2014, Woodbury told Defendant Yanuzov, Victory's owner and her immediate supervisor, that she would be resigning that December to start her own moving business. Four other Victory employees, one of whom was Woodbury's husband, had started their own moving businesses without any adverse action by Victory. In fact, Yanuzov had hosted a going-away part for Woodbury's husband.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Less than two weeks after Woodbury gave her notice, on March 26, 2014, Woodbury had a seizure in the Victory offices. She had a second seizure, again at work, on March 31, 2014. Following the second seizure, Yanuzov reached out to Woodbury by text message to schedule a meeting between them. At the ensuing April 4, 2014 meeting, Yanuzov fired Woodbury and explained that he was doing so because she planned to start her own moving business. When Woodbury protested that her husband had done the same thing and had not been terminated, Yanuzov replied, \"[W]ell, you're not [him].\" Compl. at 9, \u00b6 17, ECF No. 1. Woodbury contends that of the several employees who had branched out to start their own businesses, she alone was fired, because she has a disability and because she, unlike the other employees, is of North American origin. Yanuzov is Bulgarian, and the other employees who left to start their own businesses were either Bulgarian or of a national origin that is not North American.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Additional Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In her Amended Complaint, Woodbury adds several causes of action. First, she asserts an invasion of privacy claim. During Woodbury's March 26, 2014 seizure, Yanuzov took a picture of her while she was unconscious. In that picture, \"[h]er eyes were rolled back, she was wet, and her shirt was somewhat lifted.\" Compl. at 9, \u00b6 13. Yanuzov showed the image to Woodbury, her husband, and several of Woodbury's coworkers. By doing so, Woodbury argues, Yanuzov \"publicized\" the image and \"place[d] her in a false light.\" Pl's Resp. Mot. Dismiss (\"Resp.\") at 4-5, ECF No. 38. She also alleges that Yanuzov's actions were so upsetting that it caused her to suffer the second seizure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Second, Woodbury alleges that Yanuzov made her pay raise contingent on voting for President Barack Obama during the 2012 election. When she went to vote, Woodbury was accompanied by a witness so that she could prove that she had selected the correct candidate. As she was not planning to vote, Woodbury argues that this conduct violated her right to freedom of speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Finally, Woodbury alleges that she was subjected to \"a very hostile work environment\" and the \"threat of termination\" after Yanuzov learned that she planned to report to United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") that his marriage to a U.S. citizen was a sham in that it was entered into for the purpose of securing immigration benefits. Am. Compl. at 2, ECF No. 22. She asserts that she \"was going to whistleblow\" on this illegal activity and seeks $250,000 in damages \"for this violation of her rights as ... an American who only was keeping the law first.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2012112\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On June 13, 2014, Woodbury filed a charge of discrimination with the Montgomery County Office of Human Rights (\"MCOHR\"), which dual-filed her charge with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"). The MCOHR closed the case on June 23, 2015. The EEOC then adopted the MCOHR's findings and issued a right-to-sue letter on August 5, 2015. According to Woodbury, she did not receive this letter until April 14, 2016, when the EEOC responded to her inquiry about the status of her case. She filed suit in this Court 88 days later, on July 11, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Because Woodbury failed to serve Defendants in a timely manner, the case was dismissed on November 29, 2016. On December 2, 2016, Woodbury moved to reopen, explaining that her ex-husband had withheld her mail and that she had not received this Court's orders regarding service. The case was reopened on December 5, 2016, and service was timely effected. Woodbury filed her Amended Complaint on February 27, 2017. The present causes of action are: sex and national origin discrimination in violation of Title VII; disability discrimination in violation of the ADA; invasion of privacy; a violation of Woodbury's First Amendment right to freedom of speech; and retaliation for reporting unlawful conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In their Motion, Defendants assert the following grounds for dismissal: (1) Title VII and the ADA do not give rise to claims against individual supervisors such as Yanuzov; (2) neither Title VII nor the ADA apply to Victory because Victory did not have at least 15 employees at the time of the alleged misconduct; (3) Woodbury has failed to state a claim for invasion of privacy under Maryland law; (4) Woodbury cannot assert a free speech claim against Defendants because they are not state actors; and (5) her whistleblower claim alleges a\n   right not recognized by federal or state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Motion for Leave to File a Surreply\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Woodbury moved for leave to file a surreply on October 30, 2017, over three months after the briefing on Defendants' Motion was otherwise completed. Her Motion provides no explanation for why additional briefing is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Local Rule 105.2(a) provides that surreply memoranda are not permitted unless otherwise ordered by the Court. Surreply briefs are generally disfavored in this District,\n   <em>\n    Chubb &amp; Son v. C &amp; C Complete Servs., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4306384\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/919/666/#p679\">\n    919 F.Supp.2d 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 679 (D. Md. 2013), but they may be permitted \"when the moving party would be unable to contest matters presented to the Court for the first time in the opposing party's reply,\"\n   <em>\n    TECH USA, Inc. v. Evans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699240\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/592/852/#p861\">\n    592 F.Supp.2d 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 861 (D. Md. 2009). A review of Defendants' reply memorandum reveals only one new argument: that Woodbury may not use her memorandum in opposition to the Motion to amend the Complaint. The Court finds it unnecessary to grant additional briefing to hear from Woodbury on this axiomatic standard. Woodbury's Motion is therefore denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Motion to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Legal Standards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For all but one of Woodbury's claims, Defendants seek dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). To defeat a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the complaint must allege enough facts to state a plausible claim for relief.\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v. Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 678,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).

The Court must examine the complaint as a whole, consider the factual allegations in the complaint as true, and construe the factual allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Albright v.

Generally, when deciding a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court considers only the complaint. Documents attached to the complaint or motion may be considered if \"they are integral to the complaint and authentic.\"\n   <em>\n    Sec'y of State for Defence v. Trimble Navigation Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5732593\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/484/700/#p705\">\n    484 F.3d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 705 (4th Cir. 2007).

Should a court consider exhibits that do not fall into these categories, it must treat the motion as a motion for summary judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d). A court may convert a motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment, and thus consider exhibits and evidence outside the pleadings, only if the nonmoving party has had \"a reasonable opportunity to present all the material that is pertinent to the motion.\"\n   <em>\n    Gay v.

Typically, to show that a reasonable opportunity for discovery has not been afforded, the nonmoving party must file an affidavit or declaration under Rule 56(d) explaining why \"for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harrods Ltd. v.

Even in the absence of a Rule 56(d) affidavit, however, \"a district judge has 'complete discretion to determine whether or not to accept the submission of any material beyond the pleadings that is offered in conjunction with a Rule 12(b)(6) motion and rely on it, thereby converting the motion, or to reject it or simply not consider it.' \"\n   <em>\n    Sager v.

Title VII's definition of \"employer,\" which provides the basis for the statute's reach and for the unavailability of individual liability, is nearly identical to that of the ADA.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(b)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012111\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5)(A).

Accordingly, the Court will decline to consider the attached exhibits and treat the motion as one for summary judgment.

Even if the Complaint were to be amended to add these facts, they would not be sufficient to state a plausible claim. Even if her workplace had a key and door code restricting access, Woodbury did not allege that Yanuzov and the other coworkers lacked access to the work space generally or the room in which the seizure occurred.

Such a cause of action protects \"the interest of the individual in not being made to appear before the public in an objectionable false light or false position, or in other words, otherwise than as [s]he is.\" Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 652E cmt. b. Woodbury has asserted in a conclusory fashion that the photograph \"place[d] her in a false light,\" Resp. at 5, but has not asserted facts showing how the image \"attribute[d] to [her] characteristics, conduct or beliefs that are false,\" as is required to maintain this claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"677600\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/517/128/#p132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Woodbury's invasion of privacy claim will therefore be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    D. First Amendment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In her Amended Complaint, Woodbury alleges that Yanuzov pressured her, using a financial incentive, to vote for President Barack Obama during the 2012 presidential election. She seeks damages for violation of her \"freedom of speech\" because she did not want to vote at all. Am. Compl. at 2. Defendants argue that this claim should be dismissed because they are not state actors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \"[M]ost rights secured by the Constitution are protected only against infringement by governments.\"\n   <em>\n    Flagg Bros., Inc. v.

None of these situations apply here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   To the extent that Woodbury was attempting to assert a claim of employment discrimination based on political beliefs, that claim, too, is unavailable. While \"Congress has extended numerous constitutionally inspired protections to members of the private workplace,\" it \"notably has refrained from extending free speech rights to the private work force.\"\n   <em>\n    Dixon v.

Specifically, Title VII has no proscription against private employers making the terms and conditions of employment contingent on political beliefs or behavior.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a).

Whistleblower Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Finally, Woodbury has asserted that she is entitled to damages because, when Yanuzov learned that she intended to tell ICE that he had entered into a sham marriage for immigration purposes, he threatened to fire her and otherwise established a \"hostile work environment\" at Victory. Am. Compl. at 2. Defendants argue that this is not a colorable claim and should be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   It is unclear what statute, if any, Woodbury relies on for this claim. The term \"hostile work environment\" arises out of employment discrimination law, but Woodbury has not alleged in the Amended Complaint that this hostile work environment was due to Woodbury's membership in a protected class recognized under Title VII. Alerting the authorities about immigration law violations does not qualify as \"protected activity\" shielded by Title VII's anti-retaliation provisions, because such activity consists of complaining of violations of Title VII, not opposing immigration fraud.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a) ;\n   <em>\n    Boyer-Liberto v.

As for state law, Maryland has a tort of wrongful discharge for at-will employees who have been terminated because they \"\n   <em>\n    reported a suspected crime\n   </em>\n   to the appropriate law enforcement or judicial officer.\"\n   <em>\n    Wholey v.

Woodbury, however, has never alleged that she was fired because she reported her suspicions to ICE. Therefore, this claim will be dismissed as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.
