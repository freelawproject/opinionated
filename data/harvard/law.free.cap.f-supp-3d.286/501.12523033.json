(Compl., Docket Entry No. 1.) Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint on October 12, 2015, (Am. Compl., Docket Entry No. 26-1), alleging claims for retaliation under the Family and Medical Leave Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n    29 USC \u00a7 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"FMLA\"), and disability discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 USC \u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et. seq\n   </em>\n   . (\"ADA\"), and the New York City Human Rights Law, N.Y.C. Admin. Code \u00a7 8-101,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"NYCHRL\"). Defendant moves for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Def. Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Def. Mot.\"), Docket Entry No. 63; Def. Mem. in Supp. of Def. Mot. (\"Def. Mem.\"), Docket Entry No. 63-6.) For the reasons discussed below, the Court grants in part and denies in part Defendant's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are undisputed except as otherwise noted. Plaintiff Nola Smith is a registered nurse who was hired to work at Forest Hills Hospital (the \"Hospital\") on September 22, 2008. (Def. Statement\n   of Material Facts Pursuant to Local R. 56.1 (\"Def. 56.1\") \u00b6 6, Docket Entry No. 63-1.) Defendant North Shore-Long Island Health System (\"Defendant\"), is a large hospital system comprised of sixteen affiliate hospitals including the Hospital. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Until her termination on August 23, 2013, Smith served as a nurse in the Ventilation Unit of the Hospital's Medical Surgical Department as part of Unit 4N. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6; Pl. Response to Def. 56.1 (\"Pl. 56.1\") \u00b6 14, Docket Entry No. 66.) During the course of her employment, Rhonnie Jackson, the Hospital's Director of Patient Care Services, among others, supervised Smith. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 8.) Jackson oversaw the Hospital's Critical Care, Intensive Care (\"ICU\"), and Medical Surgical Units. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Beginning in 2012, Jackson became Smith's direct supervisor, replacing Rose Clarke, a nurse manager who had begun a series of intermittent leaves of absence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Jackson, in turn, reported to Doreen O'Grady, the Hospital's Chief Nursing Officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Work schedule and absences from work\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Throughout her employment, Smith suffered from various disabilities including generalized anxiety disorder and panic attacks for which doctors have prescribed her a number of medications over the years. (Def. Response to Pl. 56.1 (\"Def. 56.1 Resp.\") \u00b6 2, Docket Entry No. 64-1.) Due to these disabilities, the Hospital has accommodated Smith with a lighter work schedule compared to other nurses. All other nurses in Unit 4N worked a \"flex\" schedule, defined as five thirty-six hour work weeks, consisting of three twelve hour days, followed by one forty-eight hour work week, consisting of four twelve hour days. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 7.) In contrast, Smith worked, at most, thirty-five hours per week and the Hospital gave her at least a temporary reprieve from having to work the longer-hour weeks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Def. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In addition, Smith was granted a three-month leave of absence from June 1, 2012 to September 4, 2012 pursuant to the FMLA for a nervous breakdown she suffered allegedly as a result of harassment by Clarke. (Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 17; Def. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 4.) During the course of her employment, the Hospital granted Smith at least eight separate leave accommodations for various ailments, including her disabilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 11.) According to Defendant, its insurer Hartford administers FMLA leave, while the Hospital's Human Resources (\"HR\") department administers disability accommodations. (Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 2; Deposition of Angela Fisher (\"Fisher Dep.\") 46:21-47:8, Docket Entry No. 68-7.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Hospital has a sick leave guideline that automatically flags for discipline any nurse that has called in more than three times in a quarter. (Def. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 11; Deposition of Doreen O'Grady (\"O'Grady Dep.\") 32:20-24; 36:13-37:14, Docket Entry No. 68-6.) Although FMLA and other approved leaves are exempt from the policy, the Hospital generates a spreadsheet of nurses who fall within the guideline based solely on the total number of absences, regardless of the reason for absence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (Def. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 11; O'Grady Dep. 37:9-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Disciplines and other actions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   According to Smith, after she returned from her FMLA leave in the summer of 2012, Jackson immediately began chastising her for taking leave. Because the spreadsheet includes both protected and unprotected leave, O'Grady instructed Jackson to check to ensure Smith's absences were not approved FMLA leave, (O'Grady Dep. 33:8-22), but she did not instruct Jackson to check whether Smith's absences were accommodations for a disability, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 33:19-22). Pursuant to this policy, in October of 2012, Jackson appeared to have issued Smith a verbal warning-the first step in the Hospital's three-step Progressive Discipline Policy-for excessive leave. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   October 13, 2012 Email, annexed to Pl. Opp'n to Def. Mot. (\"Pl. Opp'n\"), Docket Entry No. 68, as Ex. 18, Docket Entry No. 68-18; October 1, 2012 Email, annexed to Pl. Opp'n as Ex. 19, Docket Entry No. 68-19; Deposition of Rhonnie Jackson Dep. (\"Jackson Dep.\") 55:3-56:17, Docket Entry No. 68-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 26, 2012, O'Grady also instructed Jackson to discipline Smith again for calling in sick for a fourth time in the quarter. (December 26, 2012 Email, annexed to Pl. Opp'n as Ex. 20, Docket Entry No. 68-20.) Accordingly, Jackson drafted a written warning-the second step of the Progressive Discipline Policy-and scheduled a meeting with Smith for December 28, 2012. (Jackson Dep. 62:10-15; Disciplinary Warning Notice, annexed to Pl. Opp'n as Ex. 21, Docket Entry No. 68-21.) At the meeting, before Jackson could issue the Disciplinary Warning Notice, Smith complained that several of the absences listed as problematic were approved leave. (Def. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 10.) As a result, Jackson did not officially issue the written warning to Smith. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Disciplinary Warning Notice noted that on September 13, 2012, the Hospital had issued Smith a verbal warning to improve her sick time. (Disciplinary Warning Notice.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In addition to the formal discipline discussed above, Smith contends that her leaves of absence had been a continuing source of conflict with Jackson and others at the Hospital. Between July 6, 2012 and June 26, 2013, the Hospital denied Smith transfers to the ER or ICU units on five separate occasions. According to Smith, Jackson told her that her transfer requests were being denied because of excessive leave. (Deposition of Nola Smith (\"Smith Dep.\") 122:24-125:3; 178:24-179:16, Docket Entry No. 68-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Smith also contends that she had a much more difficult time getting approved for job-related conferences. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 138:7-24.) Smith and other nurses who work twelve-hour shifts are entitled to twenty-eight hours of paid conference leave per year. (Fisher Dep. 23:19-22.) Typically, nurses or their union pay for conferences upfront and then apply for reimbursement by submitting a certificate of attendance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Jackson Dep. 92:9-93:5; CBA, annexed to Pl. Opp'n as Ex. 26, Docket Entry No. 68-26.) If the Hospital chose to front expenses and wages for each day of attendance, and the nurse fails to attend the conference, the practice has been to \"reverse the pay\" or to use the employee's \"accrued paid time\n   off.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Jackson Dep. 40:14-25; O'Grady Dep. 27:9-14; CBA at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As early as November of 2012, Smith complained to Jackson about this perceived differing treatment, telling him that she felt \"singled out.\" (November 5, 2012 Email, annexed to Pl. Opp'n as Ex. 24, Docket Entry No. 68-24.) In particular, in early 2013, Jackson initially denied Smith's request to attend a two-day EKG conference to be held on February 7 and 14, 2013 (\"February Conference\"). (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 15.) Although the Hospital had approved at least one other nurse from Unit 4N to attend the conference, Jackson denied Smith's request to attend the February Conference because the EKG conference involved subjects unrelated to Smith's \"day-to-day nursing duties and [Smith's] patients did not involve or require EKGs.\" (Jackson Aff. in Supp. of Def. Mot. (\"Jackson Aff.\") \u00b6 9, annexed to Def. Mot. as Ex. I, Docket Entry. No. 63-3; Jackson Dep. 81:6-10.) After discussing the matter further with the union for nurses, Jackson subsequently approved Smith's request. (Jackson Dep. 80:17-81:4.) However, Smith was scheduled to work the night shift from 7 PM to 7 AM the morning of the first day of the conference set to begin at 9 AM, two hours after the end of the shift. (Smith Dep. 136:19-22; Smith Aff. in Supp. of Pl. Opp'n (\"Smith Aff.\") \u00b6 5, annexed to Pl. Opp'n as Ex. Ex. 2, Docket Entry No. 68-2.) Because of the short turnaround between the end of her shift and the scheduled start time of the conference, Smith requested that Jackson remove her from the shift because she could not otherwise attend the conference. (Jackson Dep. 81:20-22; Jackson Aff. \u00b6 10.) Jackson told Smith that she needed to switch her schedule with someone else. (Jackson Aff. \u00b6 10.) Smith was unable to find anyone willing to switch schedules with her and therefore worked her scheduled shift and did not attend the conference. (Jackson Aff. \u00b6 10; Smith Aff. \u00b6 8.) Although Smith never submitted a certificate of attendance for the February Conference, (Jackson Aff. \u00b6 11), the Hospital paid for the conference days as if she had attended. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Smith assumed that the pay was for accrued paid time off. (Smith Dep. 149:22-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On July 1, 2013, Smith submitted another request to attend a conference in October of 2013. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 18; July 1, 2013 Conference Request Form, annexed to Pl. Opp'n as Ex. 28, Docket Entry No. 68-28.) Jackson denied the request and explained to Smith that she had already attended the February Conference earlier in the year. (Jackson Dep. 84:4-9; Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 18.) Smith responded that she had not attended the February Conference and that Jackson and Benson Matthews, Smith's union representative, already knew that to be the case. (Jackson Dep. 85:7-24; Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 18.) Jackson denied having such prior knowledge and told Smith he would be reporting the incident to HR. (Jackson Dep. 86:9-17.) According to Smith, at the end of the conversation, Jackson stated: \"I know what you did last time. You caused me to become short staffed. No one crosses me and gets away with it.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Smith Dep. 168:7-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Subsequently, Jackson emailed Anthony Lumia, a HR representative, and requested\n   to speak with him regarding Smith and \"theft of time.\" (July 31, 2013 Email, annexed to Pl. Opp'n as Ex. 29, Docket Entry No. 68-29.) Following this email exchange, Lumia conducted an investigation, consisting almost exclusively of conversations with Smith and Jackson. (Deposition of Anthony Lumia (\"Lumia Dep.\") 25:17-21.) During his conversation with Lumia, Jackson stated that Smith had accepted pay for a conference she did not attend and had failed to report her nonattendance. (Jackson Dep. 99:2-4.) Jackson also had a similar conversation with O'Grady. (O'Grady Dep. 58:3-15.) The Hospital terminated Smith on August 23, 2013. (Jackson Aff. \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

While Jackson did not necessarily specify the nature of the leave involved, Smith testified that she understood him to be referring to her disability based leave. (Smith Dep. 58:11-19.)

Circumstantial evidence of causal connection\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Smith also provides circumstantial evidence of retaliatory animus based on the disciplinary action taken against her pursuant to the Hospital's policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In order to ameliorate staffing issues, Defendant employs a \"guideline\" or policy that automatically flags for discipline any nurses who call out of work more than three times in a quarter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (O'Grady Dep. 37:4-14.) The spreadsheet generated pursuant to this policy does not differentiate between protected and unprotected leave. Therefore, the sick days must be manually reviewed to ensure nurses are not disciplined for taking FMLA or disability based leave. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   O'Grady Dep. 33:4-22.) Once identified for discipline, nurses are typically subject to a three-step Progressive Discipline Policy. Because short staffing due to sick leave has been a \"big program at the [H]ospital,\" O'Grady directed Jackson to discipline several nurses, including Smith. (O'Grady Dep. 32:22-24, 36:13-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Pursuant to this policy, on September 13, 2012, Smith appears to have been given a verbal warning-the first step in the Hospital's three-step Progressive Discipline Policy-to \"improve [her] sick time.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Disciplinary Warning Notice.) Defendant did not provide any evidence of any unapproved leave by Smith between September 4, 2012, the date she returned to work after FMLA leave, and September 13, 2012, the date of the written warning. Based on this record, a reasonable juror could conclude that the Hospital disciplined Smith on September 13, 2012 for her three-month FMLA leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Hospital may have also given Smith another verbal warning in October of 2012 for excessive leave. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   October 13, 2012 Email; October 1, 2012 Email.) Defendant contends that any discipline in October could not have been for FMLA leave because Smith had already used up all of the FMLA leave she was entitled to between June 1, 2012 and September 4, 2012. (Def. 56.1 Resp. at 8-9.) Defendant appears to cite to a list of accommodations that it provided to Smith over the years in support of this argument. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def 56.1 \u00b6 11.) However, Defendant does not represent the list to be exhaustive as to intermittent leave. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10539050\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/934/405/#p410\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"[U]pon return from her three month leave of absence, [Smith] requested and was granted numerous intermittent FMLA leaves ...,\n   <em>\n    including\n   </em>\n   intermittent leaves on ...\" (emphasis added).) Without additional evidentiary support, the Court cannot conclude that Smith did not have any FMLA leave available to her in October to further conclude that Smith could not have been disciplined in October for taking FMLA leave.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Further, in December of 2012, Defendant attempted to discipline Smith for excessive leave. On December 26, 2012, O'Grady summarily instructed Jackson by email to \"[p]lease discipline\" Smith for calling out sick for the fourth time in the quarter-without any accompanying request to review the absences for any approved leave. (December 26, 2012 Email;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   June 25, 2013 Email, annexed to Pl. Opp'n as Ex. 39, Docket Entry No. 68-39.) Based on this instruction, Jackson prepared a Disciplinary Warning Notice-the second step of the Progressive Discipline Policy-and scheduled a disciplinary meeting with Smith for December 28, 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Jackson Dep. 62:10-15.) At the meeting, Jackson attempted to give Smith the Disciplinary Warning Notice until Smith objected and pointed out to Jackson that at least\n   a few of the absences listed in the warning had been for FMLA approved leave.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At the very least, based on Defendant's blanket policy of flagging nurses for discipline solely because of the number of absences, and Jackson's attempt to discipline Smith for taking FMLA leave, a reasonable juror could conclude that key decisionmakers had a tendency to view and treat all leave in the same manner-failing to distinguish between protected and unprotected leave unless expressly challenged to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Donnelly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3508778\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/691/134/#p151\">\n    691 F.3d at 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding negative evaluations based on excessive absences, including those taken pursuant to FMLA leave, to be sufficient basis to allow a jury to determine retaliatory intent);\n   <em>\n    Millea\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836256\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/154/#p164\">\n    658 F.3d at 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"There is no dispute that a company may discipline an employee for violating its internal leave policy as long as that policy is\n   <em>\n    consistent\n   </em>\n   with the [FMLA].\" (emphasis added) ). Had Smith not objected to the FMLA approved leave included in the Disciplinary Warning Notice, she would have been punished for taking protected FMLA leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In addition to formal discipline, Smith also asserts that Defendant punished her for taking leave by making it more difficult for her to attend various job-related conferences. As early as November 4, 2012, Smith complained that she felt she had been \"singled out\" and required to fulfill a much more \"elaborate\" approval process as part of her request to attend a conference in mid-November. (November 5, 2012 Email.) Subsequent to this complaint, Jackson denied Smith's request to attend the February Conference. (Jackson Aff. \u00b6 9.) Jackson denied the request stating that the conference was unrelated to Smith's \"day-to-day nursing duties and patients did not involve or require EKGs,\" (Jackson Dep. 80:17-81:4), but at least one other nurse in Smith's unit had been approved to attend the conference, and Defendant has not provided any information to show that that nurse had different job duties or patients with different needs from Smith, despite being in the same unit,\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 81:6-10). Based on the Hospital's approval for another nurse in Unit 4N to attend the conference, a reasonable jury could find that the Hospital denied Smith conference days because of excess leave as Smith claims, rather than her day-to-day nursing duties or patients as argued by Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    C. History of prior punishment supports Smith's account of Jackson's statements and actions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The above history of prior punishment also lends credence to Smith's testimony about Jackson and the statements he purportedly made. In addition to direct evidence of statements reflecting animus, Smith has provided circumstantial evidence of prior formal and informal punishment because of taking protected leave. While Jackson's statements are uncorroborated,\n   Smith has provided evidentiary support suggestive of Defendant's general distaste for leave\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   an inability or unwillingness to distinguish between protected and unprotected leave on occasion. In particular, Defendant's disciplinary policy for sick leave based solely on the number of absences, O'Grady's email to Jackson to punish Smith without any accompanying instruction to ensure her absences were not protected, and Jackson's attempt to discipline Smith for FMLA leave on December 28, 2012, suggest an often too eager willingness or desire to punish employees for any and all leave-potentially leading to resentment and punishment, even if unintentional, for protected leave.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Esser v. Rainbow Advert. Sales Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5598659\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/448/574/#p582\">\n    448 F.Supp.2d 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 582 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (denying summary judgment of retaliation claim where parties disputed the reason for defendant's \"irritation\" at plaintiff). Furthermore, the final dispute leading to Smith's discharge also arose from her desire to attend a conference-a prior source of conflict stemming allegedly from disagreements over leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Under these circumstances, a reasonable factfinder could find Smith's termination to be \"a disingenuous overreaction to justify dismissal of an annoying employee who asserted [her] rights under the [FMLA].\"\n   <em>\n    Kelley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3536847\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/707/108/#p117\">\n    707 F.3d at 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

Smith has demonstrated that the proffered rationale for termination is pretextual\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to Smith, she has demonstrated that Defendant's proffered rationale for her termination is pretextual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   According to Defendant, Smith committed time theft because she waited five months before informing anyone that she had not attended the February Conference. (Jackson Aff. \u00b6 5.) However, Smith provides evidence that Jackson was aware of her nonattendance from the very beginning. Before the start of the first day of the conference, Smith was scheduled to work a twelve-hour shift starting at 7 PM the night before and ending at 7 AM the morning of the scheduled conference. (Smith Dep. 136:19-22; Jackson Aff. \u00b6 10.) Because the conference started at 9 AM, Smith requested that Jackson change her shift since she otherwise would not be able to attend the conference. (Jackson Aff. \u00b6 10.) Jackson refused and told Smith that she needed to switch her shift with another nurse. Smith was unable to switch, worked the night shift, and did not attend the conference. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Jackson acknowledges that it is his responsibility to inform payroll of switches and therefore should have at least been aware of any switch or lack thereof. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jackson Dep. 31:17-25.) Based on these facts, a reasonable juror could infer that Jackson was aware that Smith failed to attend the first day of the February Conference as early as February 6 or February 7. Furthermore, in an email dated February 19, 2013, Jackson appears to acknowledge some concern that Smith may not have attended the conference. (February 19, 2013 Email, annexed to Pl. Opp'n as Ex. 25, Docket Entry No. 68-25 (\"I am going to ask [Smith] for confirmation that she attended the conference or I will reverse the pay.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Jackson Aff. \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Moreover, the manner in which nurses are normally paid for attending conferences also supports an inference that the termination is pretext. Under the CBA,\n   <em>\n    reimbursement\n   </em>\n   for conference attendance is subject to the \"submission of appropriate documentation including receipts.\" (CBA at 53.) According to Jackson, nurses or their union usually pay for conference expenses in advance, and then apply for reimbursement of the costs incurred through the submission of a certificate of attendance. (Jackson Dep. 92:9-93:5.) Failure to submit the necessary documentation within thirty days of attending the conference could result in the waiver of any rights to obtain reimbursement. (Jackson Dep. 96:4-10.) If Defendant pays the nurses wages in advance, and the nurse fails to attend the conference, the practice has been to reverse the payment or to use the employee's accrued paid time off.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Jackson Dep. 40:14-22.) Smith never submitted a certificate of attendance. (Jackson Aff. \u00b6 11.) Jackson states in his affidavit in support of Defendant's summary judgment motion that Smith declined to provide a certificate of attendance for the conference, despite his numerous requests for her to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In contrast, during his deposition, Jackson stated that he did not recall whether he had a conversation with\n   Smith about her nonattendance at the February conference prior to the July of 2013 meeting. (Jackson Dep. 86:21-87:3.) However, even crediting Jackson's statement in his affidavit, Jackson fails to explain why he neither reversed the pay nor reported Smith to HR much earlier than August of 2013, more than five months after the conference. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   February 19, 2013 Email; Jackson Dep. 97:8-21 (explaining that nurses should inform him of failure to attend a conference within a week or so and that he would report to HR a failure to do so).) In light of these discrepancies, a reasonable jury could find that Smith did not engage in any misconduct, and Defendant's stated rationale for termination implausible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Smith fails to demonstrate pretext as to four of five denials of her transfer requests\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Smith requested transfers from Medical Surgical Department to the ER or ICU units on five separate occasions: (1) July 6, 2012; (2) October 12, 2012; (3) January 4, 2013; (4) June 21, 2013; and (5) June 26, 2013. As discussed below, Smith fails to establish pretext for four of the denials of her transfer requests. However, she has sufficiently demonstrated pretext for the January 4, 2013 denial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Smith has failed to establish pretext as to four of the transfers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Smith submitted her July 6, 2012 transfer request by email without a completed application and, as a result, the Hospital denied the application. (July 6, 2012 Email, annexed to Def. Mot. as Ex. U, Docket Entry No. 63-4.) In addition, Smith failed to include the required position numbers in the October 12, 2012 and June 26, 2013 applications and the Hospital denied those applications. (October 12, 2012 Application, annexed to Def. Mot. as Ex. V, Docket Entry No. 63-4; June 26, 2013 Application, annexed to Pl. Mot. as Ex. 23, Docket Entry No. 68-23.) Although there is no requirement in the CBA that an application be filled out completely, as to the October 12, 2012 request, Smith was notified by email that the application could not be processed due to the lack of a position number and was also informed that there was no position available.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   October 12, 2012 Email, annexed to Def. Mot. as Ex. V, Docket Entry No. 63-4; Article VI(A): Posting of Positions, annexed to Pl. Mot. as Ex. 13, Docket Entry No. 68-13.) Despite being on notice that she needed to provide a position number based on the October 12, 2012 denial, Smith failed to complete the June 26, 2013 application. Finally, the Hospital filled the June 21, 2013 position with an employee with seniority, consistent with the CBA requirements. (June 21, 2013 Application, annexed to Def. Mot. as Ex. W, Docket Entry No. 63-4.) Smith offers no evidence to suggest that the she had an \"appreciable difference in experience and preparation for the position\" that would allow for Defendant awarding the position to her instead of the individual with seniority. (Article VI(A): Posting of Positions.) Nor does Smith provide any other evidence of\n   pretext as to the denial of these transfer requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Indeed, the evidence supports the conclusion that retaliation played no role in the denials of these transfer requests. Although Smith argues that Jackson denied her transfer requests because of excessive leave, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Smith Dep. 178:24-179:16 (complaining to Kapochunas, an HR representative, that Jackson had been denying her transfers because of excessive leave) ), the record indicates that Jackson never even reviewed three of the four transfer requests. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   July 6, 2012 Application; October 12, 2012 Application;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   June 26, 2013 Application (having the same procedural issues that led Kapochunas to summarily deny the October 12, 2012 Application).) Instead, Kapochunas, the HR representative to whom Smith complained, appears to have been the individual who effectively denied her requests for various inadequacies. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   July 6, 2012 Application; October 12, 2012 Application; June 26, 2013.) ) Further, the Hospital filled the position that Smith sought in her July 21, 2013 Application, the only transfer request that Jackson admits to reviewing, with a nurse with seniority as required by the CBA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   July 21, 2013 Application.) The record establishes as a matter of law that retaliation did not play any role in the Hospital's denials as to these four requests to transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Smith has shown pretext as to the denial of the January 4, 2013 application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   On January 4, 2013, Smith applied for a transfer to the ICU. (January 4, 2013 Application, annexed to Pl. Mot. as Ex. 22, Docket Entry No. 68-22.) The Hospital denied Smith's request but offers no reason for the denial of this application other than the fact that the \"Employee Information\" section was not fully completed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Reply 5.) This rationale, however, may be contradicted by the October 12, 2012 transfer application that was completed in a similar manner but was denied for a different reason, without any mention of incomplete \"Employee Information.\" (October 12, 2012 Application.) In denying the October 12, 2012 transfer application, Defendant did not object to the fact that that application did not include a complete \"Employee Information\" section. (October 12, 2012 Email.) The Hospital rejected the October 12, 2012 transfer application because of the lack of a position number and the lack of an open position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Nor does the CBA require a completed application. The only difference in the \"Employee Information\" sections of the two applications are that they each include one detail that the other does not. While the October 12, 2012 application includes information about the \"Current Working Days,\" the January 4, 2013 application includes a completed category for \"Shift/Hours.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   October 12, 2012 Application; January 4, 2013 Application);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeMarco v.

Based on these facts, a reasonable juror could conclude that the proffered reason for denying the January 4, 2013 application was \"either a\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   fabrication or otherwise did not actually motivate the employment action.\"\n   <em>\n    Fuentes v.

As discussed above, Defendant has neither provided any evidentiary support nor explanation for its argument that Smith was not qualified. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. 7 n.1.) However, in its Rule 56.1 statement, Defendant cites to Smith's deposition testimony in support of its assertion that she \"testified that [her disability] rendered her completely unable\n   to do her job.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   56.1 \u00b6 9; Smith Dep. 76.) In one of the cited to portions of her deposition, Smith testified that she could not work when she was experiencing a \"depressive episode.\" (Smith Dep. 76:7-9.) Smith explained that the Hospital provided her intermittent leave as an accommodation when she could not work because of her disability. (Smith Dep. 69:17-20.) Defendant does not challenge any other aspect of Smith's work performance. With accommodations in the form of intermittent leave, Smith worked for five years for Defendant without incident. Prior to her termination, the only issues on record regarding Smith's work performance are interpersonal problems with her supervisor and disciplinary action for excessive leave.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   56.1 \u00b6 10.)

Moreover, O'Grady, the Chief Nursing Officer, the final authority on termination decisions, testified that she viewed leave to be a reasonable accommodation. (O'Grady Dep. 21:22-24; 28:18-21.) Indeed, the Hospital has accommodated Smith with intermittent leave for her disability. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Smith Dep. 69:17-20; Def.

Furthermore, O'Grady admitted she never instructed Jackson to check whether Smith's absences were accommodations for a disability prior to requesting that Jackson discipline Smith for her absences. (O'Grady Dep. 33:19-22.) Therefore, Smith may have been disciplined for taking approved disability leave in addition to her disability-related FMLA leave.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Smith Dep. 99-102.)

However, Defendant did not attach nor reference the Hartford letter in its submissions. Nor can Defendant rely on Smith's testimony to support its argument that she had no additional FMLA leave. (Smith Dep. 102.) Although Defendant's counsel explained the purported contents of the Hartford letter, Smith did not acknowledge the substance as described. Instead, Smith merely stated that she \"[did not] recall having a communication with [Hartford]\" about the matter discussed therein.

However, Defendant has not provided sufficient evidence for the Court to conclude that the days listed on the Disciplinary Warning Notice were not FMLA leave. As discussed earlier, Defendant has only argued that Smith had no more FMLA leave left in October. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def. 56.1 Resp. at 8-9.) In addition, Defendant has not represented that its list of accommodations that it provided to Smith in its Rule 56.1 statement is exhaustive.
