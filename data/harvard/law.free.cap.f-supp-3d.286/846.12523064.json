LAWSON, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Michigan prisoner Jeffrey Durk Carter was convicted in 1987 of multiple counts of sexual assault, robbery, and weapons offenses and sentenced to lengthy prison terms. His convictions became final after completion of his direct appeals in 1990. In 2004, he began several rounds of post-conviction litigation in the state courts, mainly looking to have DNA evidence tested. However, he was unsuccessful, because the evidence was destroyed according to the routine practice at the time. Carter filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in this Court in December 2014. The warden contends, among other things, that the petition is untimely. The Court agrees, and will dismiss the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Michigan Court of Appeals summarized the relevant facts of the case in its opinion on direct review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   The charges stemmed from offenses committed in Detroit against a woman and her two male friends in the early morning hours of June 1, 1986. The threesome had returned to their vehicle in the Joe Louis Arena parking structure after a Bob-lo midnight cruise, when they were approached by a uniformed man (defendant) who identified himself as a police officer. Defendant performed a field sobriety test on the driver of the vehicle, Jim Reynolds, and also informed Reynolds that a warrant\n   was issued for his arrest due to outstanding parking tickets. Reynolds became suspicious because he did not have any outstanding tickets.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Reynolds started to walk away but defendant drew a gun. Defendant then ordered all three individuals to put their hands on the wall. Defendant stole the men's wallets and other valuables, and took the woman's purse. Defendant forced the woman into Reynolds' vehicle and drove to a remote area where he forced the woman to engage in various sexual acts. Defendant then drove to a motel where he again forced the woman to engage in sexual acts involving penetration. Afterwards, defendant drove the woman to an area near Woodward Avenue and dropped her off.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Reynolds' vehicle was recovered four days later. Items found inside the vehicle included a police-type jacket with defendant's name inscribed on it, pieces of paper and handwritten business cards with defendant's name on them, handcuffs, a starter pistol, several rounds of live ammunition for other weapons, and a police-type walkie-talkie. Defendant was arrested a short time later and transported to police headquarters. After defendant exited the police vehicle, Reynolds' wallet was found in that vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   At trial, all three victims identified defendant as the perpetrator. Defendant's primary defense was the reliability of the victims' identification. Defendant, who testified on his own behalf, claimed that he was home in bed, alone, on the night in question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    People v. Carter\n   </em>\n   , No. 99440, *1-2 (Mich. Ct. App. Aug. 14, 1989).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Carter filed a direct appeal in the Michigan Court of Appeals raising claims concerning the jury instructions, the admission of certain expert testimony, the prosecutor's reference to his post-arrest assertion of his rights to silence and counsel, improper rebuttal testimony, the admission of other acts testimony, the prosecutor's closing argument, the prosecutor's comments on his testimony, the sufficiency of the evidence, trial counsel's failure to seek suppression of the victims' pretrial identifications, and the validity of his sentence. The court affirmed his convictions and sentences,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *2-12, and the Michigan Supreme Court denied leave to appeal,\n   <em>\n    People v. Carter\n   </em>\n   , No. 87341 (Mich. S.Ct. May 30, 1990).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2004, Carter filed the first in a series of post-conviction motions, beginning with a motion to produce DNA evidence in the state trial court. The trial court conducted a hearing, found that the potential evidence was destroyed before the enactment of a 2001 law requiring biological evidence to be retained for the period of a convict's incarceration, ruled that there was no bad faith by the prosecution, and dismissed the motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v. Carter\n   </em>\n   , No. 86-04185, Hrg. Tr. at 9 (Wayne Co. Cir. Ct. Nov. 10, 2004). The court stated that the dismissal was without prejudice to the petitioner filing a motion for new trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2006, Carter filed a motion for new trial in the state trial court raising claims concerning the effectiveness of trial counsel, the legality of his arrest, and the legality of the search and seizure of evidence. The trial court denied the motion, holding that Carter did not demonstrate good cause and prejudice under Michigan Court Rule 6.508(D)(3).\n   <em>\n    People v. Carter\n   </em>\n   , Nos. 86-04185, 86-04186 (Wayne Co. Cir. Ct. April 24, 2007).

Carter\n   </em>\n   , No. 281571 (Mich. Ct. App. Feb. 15, 2008). The supreme court denied\n   leave to appeal on July 29, 2008.\n   <em>\n    People v.

The court construed it as a motion for relief from judgment. Carter raised claims concerning DNA evidence from the crime scene, the effectiveness of trial counsel in several respects, the legality of his arrest, and the validity of the search and seizure of evidence. The trial court denied the motion, finding that because the claims lacked merit, Carter failed to establish prejudice under Michigan Court Rule 6.508(D)(3).\n   <em>\n    People v. Carter\n   </em>\n   , No. 86-04185 (Wayne Co. Cir. Ct. Jan. 8, 2010). The record does not show that Carter appealed that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 2010, Carter filed a motion for discovery in the state trial court seeking records, which was denied because the state trial record was given to appellate counsel during direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    People v. Carter\n   </em>\n   , No. 86-4185 (Wayne Co. Cir. Ct. July 12, 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2011, Carter filed another motion for a new trial in the trial court under Michigan Court Rule 6.431, and a motion under Michigan Compiled Laws \u00a7 770.16 for DNA testing of blood and semen found on the victim's panties. The court denied the request for DNA testing because the evidence was no longer available for testing and was destroyed between 1986 and 2001 before the law required its preservation. The court denied the motion for new trial because it was untimely under state law.\n   <em>\n    People v. Carter\n   </em>\n   , Nos. 86-04185, 86-04186 (Wayne Co. Cir. Ct. June 23, 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 2013, Carter filed a motion for investigation by a state court administrator under Michigan Court Rule 8.113, which was denied.\n   <em>\n    People v. Carter\n   </em>\n   , No. 86-04185 (Wayne Co. Cir. Ct. December 18, 2013). Also in 2013, he filed a complaint for superintending control in the Michigan Court of Appeals, which was denied.\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   , No. 318809 (Mich.

He did not appeal that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On December 15, 2014, Carter signed and dated the present federal habeas petition; it was deem filed on that date.\n   <em>\n    Ingram v.

Finality of the Conviction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Carter's convictions became final in 1990 when his direct appeal came to an end. Because that occurred before the AEDPA was enacted, he was entitled to a one-year grace period, beginning on April 24, 1996, to file his habeas petition or a motion for post-conviction relief that would toll the limitations period.\n   <em>\n    Stokes v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3754271\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/475/732/#p734\">\n    475 F.3d 732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 734 (6th Cir. 2007). That period expired on April 24, 1997.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   None of Carter's post-conviction motions served to toll the federal statute of limitations, because he did not file any of them during the grace period. His first motion for new trial in the state trial court was not filed until 2004 (and he did not file his subsequent post-judgment state court motions until 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2013), well after the grace period lapsed. A state court post-conviction motion that is filed after the limitations period expires cannot toll that period because there is no period remaining to be tolled.\n   <em>\n    Hargrove v. Brigano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11422321\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/300/717/\">\n    300 F.3d 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 718 n.1 (6th Cir. 2002). The AEDPA's limitations period does not begin to run anew after the completion of state post-conviction proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Searcy v.

Carter's petition is untimely when measured by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   B. State-created Impediment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Carter does not contend that his claims arise from newly-created rights recognized by the United States Supreme Court and made retroactive to cases on collateral review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(C). Rather, he arguably asserts that the State created an impediment to timely filing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The impediment theory is based upon reports that Carter believes were suppressed or evidence that was destroyed. Subsection (B) does not apply under such circumstances. The cases applying that subsection \"have dealt almost entirely with the conduct of prison officials who interfere with inmates' ability to prepare and to file habeas petitions by denying access to legal materials.\"\n   <em>\n    Shannon v. Newland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8955784\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/410/1083/#p1087\">\n    410 F.3d 1083\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1087-88 (9th Cir. 2005). Typical conditions of prison life, however, do not constitute an unconstitutional state-created impediment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maclin v. Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Fed.%20Appx.%20587\">\n    74 Fed.Appx. 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 589 (6th Cir. 2003) (limited access to prison law library does not constitute a state impediment). Moreover, the claimed impediment must have actually prevented the petitioner from filing a timely petition of a known claim.\n   <em>\n    Wood v. Spencer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3107596\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/487/1/#p7\">\n    487 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7-8 (1st Cir. 2007) (finding that\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation could not fairly be said to have prevented petitioner from filing timely federal habeas petition). Carter does not allege any facts to show that state or prison officials intentionally denied him access to legal materials or otherwise interfered with his ability to file timely his federal habeas petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Carter's alleged\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation does not constitute a state-created impediment within the meaning of subsection (B). The term \"impediment\" refers to the ability to pursue a known claim and is distinct from discovering the factual predicate that is the basis for a claim. Moreover, the Supreme Court has held that a prosecutor's duty to disclose exculpatory evidence under\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   does not continue after the defendant is convicted and the case is closed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    District Attorney's Office for Third Judicial Dist. v.

Additionally, Carter requested reports and DNA evidence during state post-conviction collateral review proceedings in 2004 and learned that the biological evidence had been destroyed sometime after trial between 1986 and 2001. One must conclude that he was aware of the basis for his claims at that time. But he waited nearly two years to file his motion for new trial in 2006. And he has not explained sufficiently why it took him so many years after his convictions became final to pursue his claims.
