Condon, filed a Complaint in this Court on March 3, 2017, seeking review of the Commissioner's decision to deny his claim for Social Security benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20401\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   This Court may review a final decision of the Commissioner.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff filed an application for benefits on November 8, 2013. Tr. at 241-44. Plaintiff, whose date of birth is November 21, 1955 (Tr. at 241), was 59 (Tr. at 50) years old at the time of the hearing on July 22, 2015, before Administrative Law Judge Henry Hamilton (ALJ). Tr. at 42-99. The ALJ issued a Notice Of Decision-Unfavorable on December 23, 2015. Tr. at 13-28. On January 3, 2017, the Appeals Council declined to review the ALJ's decision. Tr. at 1-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The ALJ found that Plaintiff was insured for disability insurance benefits until December 31, 2016. At the first step of the sequential evaluation (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1520\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4) ), the ALJ found that Plaintiff did not engage in substantial gainful activity after June 28, 2013, the alleged onset of disability date. At the second step, the ALJ found Plaintiff has the following severe impairments: somatic symptom disorder, with predominant pain, persistent and severe; pain disorder associated with both psychological factors and general medical condition; major depressive disorder ; chronic headaches ; degenerative disk disease; essential hypertension ; diabetes mellitus ; anxiety disorder; obesity. Tr. at 18. The ALJ found that Plaintiff's impairments are not severe enough to qualify for benefits at the third step of the sequential evaluation. Tr. at 19. At the fourth step, the ALJ found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   After careful consideration of the entire record, the undersigned finds that the claimant has the residual functional capacity to perform medium work as defined in 20 CFR 404.1567(c) except he can lift 50 pounds occasionally and 25 pounds frequently. He can stand, sit and walk for six hours out of an eight-hour day. He can push and pull as much as he can lift and carry. He can frequently climb ramps, stairs, ladders, ropes and scaffolds. He can frequently balance, stoop, kneel, crouch and crawl. He can\n   frequently work from unprotected heights and moving mechanical parts. He can frequently tolerate dust, odors, fumes and pulmonary irritants. He can frequently work around loud noise. He is limited to simple and routine tasks and time off tasks can be accommodated by normal breaks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Tr. at 20. The ALJ found that Plaintiff is unable to perform any of his past relevant work\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   . Tr. at 26. At the fifth step of the sequential evaluation, the ALJ found that jobs exist in significant numbers which can be done within the limits of Plaintiff's residual functional capacity. Examples of such jobs are hand packager, store/laborer, and laundry worker. Tr. at 27. The ALJ found that Plaintiff is not disabled nor entitled to the benefits for which he applied. Tr. at 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   MEDICAL EVIDENCE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 9, 2011, Plaintiff saw Wendy Muller, O.D. Tr. at 665-70. Plaintiff reported that he was working in a new building and that the lighting was really bothering him. Tr. at 655. After the examination, the doctor opined that Plaintiff needed to work in an environment with incandescent lighting and away from outside light/glare due to photophobia. Tr. at 668.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 22, 2011, Plaintiff saw Susan J. Snyder, D.O., to complete FMLA\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   paperwork. Tr. at 709-15. The doctor noted that on February 21, Plaintiff had been able to go back to his office, but that within thirty minutes he had a headache and eye discomfort. He was moved to a location which had different lightening, and was able to tolerate about four and a half hours of work before he had to leave. The doctor wrote: \"I do not feel he is disabled and neither does he. I feel as though his symptoms are exacerbated under certain work conditions. When he is no longer in those work conditions, his symptoms abate and his performance is back to normal.\" Tr. at 709-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 14, 2011, Plaintiff saw Louis J. Scalion, M.D., at Wolfe Eye Clinic. Tr. at 673-75. Plaintiff complained of photophobia and soreness in both eyes. The doctor noted that during the course of the examination, Plaintiff seemed upset about his current work environment. When the doctor opined that dry eye syndrome was the cause of the problem, Plaintiff disagreed and said he knew it was the light exposure at work which was causing his problem. Tr. at 673.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On March 10, 2011, Plaintiff saw Dr. Snyder for a recheck of his blood pressure. Plaintiff reported that he was having difficulty sleeping. Tr. at 743-44. The doctor adjusted Plaintiff's blood pressure medication and prescribed lorazepam to take at bed time. Tr. at 744.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 8, 2011, Plaintiff saw Dr. Snyder for a recheck of his blood pressure which the doctor said continued to be \"a little bit elevated.\" Plaintiff reported continued headaches and dizziness. Tr. at 745-46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On April 13, 2011, Plaintiff saw Richard S. McCaughey, D.O., at Iowa Methodist Occupational Health and Wellness. Tr. at 676-77. Plaintiff reported that he worked for the State of Iowa as an accounting specialist. Around the first of the year,\n   Plaintiff moved into a new building and began to notice that he did not feel well. Plaintiff complained of eye pain, headache, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, and difficulty with thought process. Plaintiff reported that his symptoms improve when he is away from the building, and that he could only be in the building for about an hour. Tr. at 676. The doctor suggested that the State might arrange for Plaintiff to work in a different building. The doctor also suggested that the State might seek the assistance of an industrial hygienist to suggest ways to improve the work environment. If neither of these suggestions provided a solution, the doctor recommended that Plaintiff follow up with his \"personal doctor outside work comp.\" Tr. at 677.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On May 5, 2011, Plaintiff saw Dr. Snyder for blood pressure check. Plaintiff reported dizziness and headache within an hour of going to work. \"He feels a lot of lethargy and mental fogginess.\" Tr. at 747-48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On May 12, 2011, Plaintiff saw Mark Puricelli, D.O., at Ruan Neurology Clinic &amp; Research Center. Tr. at 716-17. Plaintiff described bi-temporal throbbing headaches accompanied by nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and feeling of general malaise. Plaintiff also noted that he felt dizzy and had chronic diarrhea on the days when he has headaches. Plaintiff reported that his symptoms clear on days he is not at work. Tr. at 716. After his examination, the doctor diagnosed migrainous headache. Because the headaches had an onset specific to a particular environment, the doctor wrote that Plaintiff did not have primary headache or neurological disorder. The doctor was reluctant to prescribe medication because the symptoms were alleviated when he was not at work. The doctor said he would order an MRI of the brain to determine if Plaintiff had some illness such as toxic meningitis which would account for the headaches. Tr. at 717.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On June 6, 2011, Plaintiff saw Charles Crivaro, D.C. Plaintiff complained of a week long history of pain across his low back into his right SI joint and right buttock. Plaintiff also complained of weakness in the right ankle and foot. The doctor noted that after Plaintiff's job moved into a new building in January 2011, he experienced debilitating headaches and 30 pound weight loss. Plaintiff said he felt as though he were in a mental fog. Tr. at 680. On June 10, 2011, Plaintiff reported no improvement. Tr. at 681. On June 24, 2011, Plaintiff reported some improvement, but was still sore in the right SI joint. The doctor opined that the ankle pain may be due to spending an extended time in bed due to work related headaches. Tr. at 682. On July 13, 2011, Plaintiff reported left SI joint pain which radiated to the mid thigh. Tr. at 683. On July 14 and 19, 2011, Plaintiff reported improvement and he said he was worse when he first gets out of bed. Tr. at 684-85. Plaintiff saw Dr. Crivaro on July 21, 25, 26, 29, August 2, and 8. Tr. at 686-91.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On June 17, 2011, Plaintiff saw Dr. Snyder for what was diagnosed as sinusitis. Tr. at 753-54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On June 23, 2011, Dr. Snyder filled out a Hartford insurance company's Attending Physician's Statement of Functionality. Tr. at 718-19. The doctor wrote that Plaintiff could sit, stand and walk for two hours at a time, for a total of two hours per day. The doctor indicated that there was no restriction on Plaintiff's ability to lift and carry up to 50 pounds. No restrictions were noted for Plaintiff's ability to reach with either arm. The doctor wrote that Plaintiff's vision was impaired intermittently, but that his visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. The doctor wrote that Plaintiff does not have a psychiatric or cognitive impairment. When asked for \"current restrictions or limitations, the doctor wrote: \"Unable\n   to remain at work for 8 hours due to occurrence of symptoms while there. Usually unable to work [more than] 2 hours due to symptoms.\" Tr. at 719.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On September 1, 2011, Randall Ruisch, D.D.S., wrote that he had treated Plaintiff's dental problems for over twenty years. Dr. Ruisch wrote that Plaintiff is able to tolerate routine dental restorative work without dental anesthesia. The doctor wrote: \"Mark has demonstrated unusual pain tolerance and an extremely high pain threshold.\" Tr. at 757.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On September 28, 2011, Plaintiff saw Elizabeth N. McCurdy, D.O., to discuss the possibility of returning to work. Tr. at 758-61. Plaintiff reported that when he went to work in a new building on January 18, 2011, he immediately had headaches, difficulty concentrating, difficulty with his eyes and diarrhea. Plaintiff reported that he was only able to work in the building for an hour per day. Tr. at 759. On physical examination, no abnormalities were noted, including a notation that Plaintiff was not currently having a headache. Tr. at 759-60. The doctor agreed to a plan which would allow Plaintiff to return to work on a progressively increasing basis, eventually leading to full time work. Tr. at 761 and 762. On October 7, 2011, Dr. McCurdy wrote that Plaintiff had done well and could resume normal full time work hours on October 10, 2011. Tr. at 766.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On November 10, 2011, Plaintiff saw Dr. Muller, who noted that Plaintiff's visual acuity in both eyes was 20/20. Tr. at 671.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On January 16, 2012, Plaintiff saw Amerlon Enriquez, M.D. for evaluation of obstructive sleep apnea and headaches. Tr. at 692-94. The doctor wrote: \"A little more than a year ago he was moved to a different building for work and developed a lot of headaches, however has been moved again and the headaches resolved.\" Tr. at 693. Plaintiff also saw Dr. McCurdy on January 16. Tr. at 768-71. Plaintiff reported that he was not having headaches in his current office, which was in a different building. Tr. at 769.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On February 8, 2012, Plaintiff saw Teck K. Khoo, M.D., at Iowa Diabetes and Endocrinology Center. Tr. at 696-97. Although the focus of the treatment was diabetes, Dr. Khoo wrote that Plaintiff reported daily migraines, and Dr. Khoo suggested that Plaintiff see Dr. Puricelli to determine if a prophylactic was necessary. Tr. at 697.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On March 14, 2012, Sunil Bansal, M.D., submitted a report of an independent medical evaluation. Tr. at 698-708. After a review of the available medical records and Plaintiff's history, and after a physical examination, Dr. Bansal answered specific questions which had been submitted to him. The doctor was first asked the final diagnosis and prognosis, to which he answered chronic headache, eye strain, and fatigue. The doctor was asked to opine if the diagnosis was causally related to his work, and the doctor stated that it was clear that moving into the new building caused the chronic headaches, eye strain, dizziness, and fatigue. Tr. at 706. In response to a question regarding permanent partial impairment, the doctor opined that Plaintiff had a profound functional impairment: \"The frequent headaches have deprived Mr. Condon [of] the ability to engage in productive work when they occur, especially with the lack of concentration, disorientation, dizziness, and eye strain that accompanies them.\" The doctor wrote that Plaintiff should avoid prolonged exposure to fluorescent lighting. The doctor wrote that Plaintiff would require ongoing treatment for chronic headaches. Tr. at 707.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On April 2, 2012, Anthony J. Sciorrotta, D.O., and John D. Kuhnlein, D.O., submitted a report regarding Plaintiff's claim of disability benefits caused by his exposure to sunlight and fluorescent light in the\n   building in which he worked. Tr. at 628-32. The pages of this report are numbered and show that it is eleven pages in length. However pages two through seven are missing. The opinions expressed in the report were based on a review of the medical records rather than a medical examination. Tr. at 623. The doctors opined that there was no objective evidence that exposure to anything in the workplace was the cause of Plaintiff's headaches. The doctors opined that Plaintiff has other medical conditions-such as hypertension, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, and smoking-which can as easily explain his symptoms; the symptoms were present prior to working in the building; there is no evidence of exposure unique to the workplace to explain the symptoms; physicians' opinions relating the symptoms to the work environment were based on Plaintiff's statements rather than on objective data. Tr. at 629. The doctors noted that their review of the medical records showed that Plaintiff complained of fatigue, concentration issues, and eye problems as early as 2008. Tr. at 630. Dr. Sciorrotta and Dr. Kuhnlein wrote that they disagreed with Dr. Bansal's opinion Plaintiff's complaints are related to his work for the State of Iowa. Tr. at 632.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On June 18, 2012, Plaintiff saw Dr. McCurdy. Tr. at 472-76. Plaintiff's medical problems were: history of chronic headaches ; migraine headaches; nicotine dependence; obstructive sleep apnea ; anxiety disorder; type 2 diabetes ; obesity ; hyperlipidemia ; hypertension ; suspected allergic rhinitis ; chronic diarrhea of unknown origin. Plaintiff reported that the lighting in the building in which he works, cause headaches. Plaintiff said that when he enters the building his stomach will begin to churn and will become uncomfortable and painful. Plaintiff correlated the headaches and diarrhea-both of which he attributed to the work environment. The doctor noted that Plaintiff was obese with a body mass index of 31.5. Plaintiff's diabetes was noted to be well controlled. The doctor noted that a neurologist had prescribed meloxicam and Topamax. Plaintiff had been referred to a neurologist at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. Plaintiff reported that because of headaches, he needed to go home for a nap during the lunch break. Plaintiff was very upset about the decline in his ability to function at work. Plaintiff also complained of nasal congestion and rhinorrhea when using his CPAP. Tr. at 473. On physical examination, other than some nasal congestion, no abnormalities were recorded. Tr. at 474. The doctor noted that Plaintiff had brought disability paper work but that he was not in a hurry to have it filled out, and he was hopeful that the doctors at the University of Iowa would be able to recommend something to resolve his problems. Tr. at 475.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On August 31, 2012, Plaintiff was seen by E. Torage Shivapour, M.D., at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics neurology clinic. Tr. at 404-08. Plaintiff reported that shortly after his job required moving into a new building in January 2011, he began to notice that the lights in the new building were hurting his eyes and causing headaches. As time went on, Plaintiff developed additional symptoms such as nausea, elevated blood sugar, poor sleep, frequent diarrhea and weak ankles. Plaintiff needed to tape his ankles in order to walk. Plaintiff also noted cognitive changes such as difficulty following a train of thought and low mood. Plaintiff had a constant feeling of fatigue requiring frequent naps. Plaintiff said that he felt grouchy and unsociable. He became increasingly sensitive to light such that he could not tolerate going to movies, church, or restaurants. Tr. at 404. The symptoms persisted even after Plaintiff changed buildings in September 2011. The doctor noted that the headaches had elements of both migraine\n   and tension headaches, but they were not typical for either type. The doctor also noted that work-up, including an MRI of Plaintiff's brain, had been negative. Tr. at 407. Because of Plaintiff's affect, cognitive complaints, and self reports of low mood and personality changes, the doctor asked Plaintiff to undergo some psychological testing. Tr. at 407-08.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On September 5, 2012 Plaintiff saw Dr. McCurdy. Tr. at 477-80. Plaintiff reported having sensitivity to all types of fluorescent lighting. On Review of systems, chronic fatigue, chronic persistent daily headaches-with no increase in frequency or severity, chronic insomnia and depressed mood were all noted. On physical examination, no abnormalities were noted. Tr. at 478. Plaintiff was encouraged to continue working with the sleep specialist to treat obstructive sleep apnea. Plaintiff was encouraged to get regular exercise and make healthy lifestyle changes to combat his chronic fatigue. Plaintiff was encouraged to follow through with the recommendations made after neuropsychological testing. Tr. at 479\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On September 12, 2012, Plaintiff saw Daniel Tranel, Ph.D., at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. Tr. at 409-11. Plaintiff reported that he had been an accountant and an expert witness for the Iowa State Attorney General with a speciality focus on utilities. Plaintiff said that because of the headaches, he was missing 8 to 24 hours of work each two week pay period. Tr. at 409. Plaintiff's intellectual functioning, as the psychologist expected, fell in the average, high average and superior ranges. On other tests-Beck Inventories, MMPI-2, Survey of Pain Attitudes, and Coping Strategies Questionnaire-Plaintiff endorsed a broad spectrum of somatic complaints such as dizziness/lightheadedness, abdominal discomfort or indigestion, loss of energy/fatigue, hypersomnia, loss of interest in sex, cognitive complaints, and a pessimistic outlook on his future. Tr. at 410. Under the heading \"Impressions,\" Dr. Tranel wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Our examination indicates major psychological factors in Mr. Condon's chronic pain and cognitive complaints. The attitudes he harbors about headaches (as threatening, irrepressible, and immobilizing), his habitual reactions to HA pain (withdrawing from activities and relationships, taking daytime naps that likely interfere with nighttime sleep), and his social role difficulties (work, family, marriage, etc.) are probably components of a broader somatic symptom-maladjustment-stress-illness process. Psychological treatment that focuses on identifying and modifying ineffective symptom-related attitudes, rituals, and interpersonal relations could have substantial beneficial effects.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Dr. Tranel gave Plaintiff the name of a psychologist close to his home, and the web site of the Iowa Psychological Association. Tr. at 411.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On September 17, 2012, Plaintiff saw Dr. Khoo. Plaintiff's A1c was 6.3. Plaintiff's diabetic medication was metformin which was taken twice per day. Tr. at 389. The doctor's assessment was that Plaintiff's diabetes was controlled and that he could be treated by his primary care physician. Tr. at 391.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On October 30, 2012, Plaintiff saw Dr. Puricelli. Tr. at 393-95. The doctor noted that Plaintiff had been seen at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics where a psychological test had shown functional somatic and cognitive symptom complaints. Dr. Puricelli wrote that no neurological abnormalities had been found. The doctor wrote: \"The patient has declined a referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist for treatment since his medical records are 'discoverable'. He continues to see (sic)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   compensation for his headaches from his employer.\" Tr. at 393. Dr. Puricelli offered a referral to a local psychologist or psychiatrist, but Plaintiff declined. Tr. at 395.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On November 9, 2012, Plaintiff saw Dr. Muller. Diagnoses included myopia and presbyopia, but no other abnormalities were noted. Tr. at 507-08.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On December 4, 2012, Plaintiff saw Mishelle L. Paullus, FNP at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics neurology clinic. Tr. at 412-15. Plaintiff reported that his headaches were slightly worse since discontinuing the medication Topamax, but he noticed that his thinking was slightly more clear. Nurse Paullus noted the testing and recommendations made by Dr. Tranel, and Plaintiff said he felt the psychological factors were more the sequelae of his chronic pain, but that he had scheduled an appointment with a Des Moines psychologist-Samuel Graham. Plaintiff reported using hydrocodone for his worst headaches. Tr. at 412. Nurse Paullus prescribed Depakote which she said was helpful both as a headache preventative and as a mood stabilizer. Tr. at 414. Plaintiff was advised to use a minimum number of hydorcodone because of long-term side effects. Plaintiff was also advised to engage in regular exercise, improve his nutrition, stop smoking, observe good sleep hygiene and stress management. Tr. at 415.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On December 10, 2012, Plaintiff saw Sam L. Graham, Ph.D. for an initial evaluation. Tr. at 431-32. Plaintiff reported that he had worked for the State of Iowa for 23 years, but that after his office was moved to a new building, he experienced a dramatic increase in headaches, nausea, vomiting, and occasional diarrhea. Plaintiff said that he was eventually fired from his job, but after the Union intervened on his behalf, he was reinstated and moved to a different building. Dr. Graham noted that Plaintiff \"was somewhat loquacious as he described his situation and I could not complete the initial evaluation in an hour.\" Tr. at 431. Plaintiff returned to Dr. Graham's office on December 28, 2012. Dr. Graham's Axis I\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   diagnosis was pain disorder associated with both psychological factors and a general medical condition; rule out adjustment disorder NOS. On Axis II, diagnosis was deferred. On Axis V, the global assessment of functioning (GAF) was rated at 64\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   . The doctor noted that at the next session, Plaintiff would be given \"relaxation training protocol.\" Tr. at 430.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On January 3, 2013, Plaintiff saw Gregory A. Hicklin, M.D., at the Iowa Clinic. Tr. at 418-20. The purpose of the visit was to renew Plaintiff's prescription for a CPAP machine for treatment of sleep apnea. Tr. at 732-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On January 4, 2013, Plaintiff saw Dr. Graham who instructed Plaintiff to use \"autogenic training\" which Plaintiff was to do twice a day. Tr. at 428.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On January 9, 2013, Plaintiff saw Dr. McCurdy. Tr. at 481-84. The doctor noted\n   that the neurologist at the University of Iowa recommended that Plaintiff stop taking hydorcodone/acetaminophen and begin taking Depakote. Dr. McCurdy made that medication change. Plaintiff was taking meloxicam prescribed by Dr. Purcelli, which he reported was somewhat helpful. Tr. at 482. No abnormalities were noted on physical examination. Tr. at 483. Plaintiff also saw Kristel Howell, ARNP regarding the CPAP machine for treatment of sleep apnea. Tr. at 500-01.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiff saw Dr. Graham on January 11, 2013, and reported that he was using the autogenic protocol, but not regularly. Dr. Graham provided some EMG biofeedback. Tr. at 427. On January 28, 2013, Plaintiff told Dr. Graham that the Depakote was working as well as the medication it replaced. Plaintiff reported that the autogenic training tape had been beneficial and that he was using it on a twice daily basis. Tr. at 426. On March 4, 2013, Dr. Graham noted that Plaintiff was coping adequately using the techniques provided. The doctor wrote: \"We appear to have met his basic treatment goals at this time.\" Plaintiff was told that he could return on an as needed basis. Tr. at 425.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On March 25, 2013, saw Dr. Crivaro. Plaintiff reported that two months previous, he slipped on ice and jammed his left shoulder. Plaintiff also reported the difficulty he was having with headaches. Plaintiff reported a 30 pound weight loss, and he said he felt as though he was in a mental fog. Tr. at 57. Between March 25 and July 19, Plaintiff saw Dr. Crivaro thirteen times. Tr. at 456-69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On May 10, 2013, Plaintiff saw Dr. McCurdy. Tr. at 486-89. It was noted that Plaintiff gained 10 pounds since his previous visit, that he was not getting regular exercise nor eating a healthy diet, and he continued to smoke. Plaintiff reported that the Depakote was helping with his headaches and that he did not notice any side effects. Tr. at 487.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On July 1, 2013, Plaintiff saw Dr. McCurdy. Tr. at 490-94. Plaintiff reported that he had lost his job due to medical issues, and he requested that the doctor complete paper work related to long term disability. Tr. at 490. Plaintiff reported that while the Depakote helped with the headaches, it made him feel as though he was in a fog making concentration difficult. The doctor wrote: \"This is a several year ordeal for him that [is] not improving and he feels like he cannot adequately control it with medication and still function effectively at his job.

The doctor wrote that he stood by his opinions expressed in his IME report. Tr. at 626. Dr. Bansal wrote that he disagreed with the opinion of Dr. Brown that absent objective findings there is no disability.

Tr. at 781.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   On May 15, 2015, Dr. Van Der Veer answered written questions. The doctor stated that since January 2014, he had treated Plaintiff for migraine headaches. When asked if Plaintiff would be able to do a job involving lifting, carrying, standing and sitting, the doctor responded: \"I do not agree. Yes, he is physically able to do this\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   no light triggers are present. Once headaches start, he could not do this at all.\" The doctor opined that Plaintiff is not able to work because non-incandescent lighting is ubiquitous. The doctor opined that Plaintiff's complaints are credible based on the doctor's observations when Plaintiff is having headaches. Tr. at 742.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   On August 10, 2015, Plaintiff saw Dr. Van Der Veer. Tr. at 830-33. The doctor ordered several laboratory tests (Tr. at 801-30) none of which produced abnormal results. Tr. at 806.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   On September 8, 2015, Plaintiff saw Dr. Graham for a mental status examination. Tr. at 834-37. Plaintiff reported the onset of headaches with exposure to fluorescent lights, LCD lights and flat screen lights. Tr. at 834. Dr. Graham's Axis I diagnoses were: somatic symptom disorder with predominant pain, persistent, severe; and major depressive disorder. Dr. Graham opined that Plaintiff's ongoing physical pain disorder and major depressive disorder\"...would appear to combine to disable him for competitive employment.\" Dr. Graham opined that Plaintiff is not able to maintain concentration, attention and pace in normal competitive work environments. Tr. at 836.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   At the administrative hearing (Tr. at 42-99), Plaintiff was asked what he experiences when exposed to non-incandescent lighting, to which he responded: \"I start getting a burning in my eyes and a pain in my front forehead, and it spreads around to the side.\" In addition, he said, his stomach begins to churn and growl. He said he also experiences diarrhea. Tr. at 53. Plaintiff testified that he injured his back when he was 18 years old, and that he had back pain three to six times per month. Tr. at 64. Plaintiff testified that if he had a job that required him to lift twenty five pounds frequently, he would miss a lot of work because of back pain. Tr. at 66. Plaintiff testified that in 2008, he underwent rotator cuff surgery on his right shoulder. Tr. at 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   After Plaintiff testified, the ALJ called Randall Harding to testify as a vocational expert. Tr. at 82. In response to the hypothetical question which contained the elements of the ALJ's residual functional capacity finding (Tr. at 84), the vocational expert testified that Plaintiff's past relevant work is not possible, but that unskilled jobs exist that could be performed. Tr. at 84-55. The ALJ asked the vocational expert to consider an individual who \"may only have frequent exposure to non-incandescent lighting.\" Tr. at 87. The vocational expert stated that \"frequent\" implied up to\n   66% of the time. The vocational expert went on to testify that because of the variability of lighting within any given building, he would not be able to answer the question. Tr. at 88-89. When asked for examples of jobs which allow for the wearing of sun glasses, the vocational expert cited jobs such as window cleaner, and landscape specialist. Tr. at 91. The vocational expert also testified that absences of three or more days per month would eliminate the possibility of all work as would the necessity to work at a slow pace for a third of a work day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In his decision, the ALJ noted that the finding of residual functional capacity requires a two-step process: 1) a determination that there is an underlying medically determinable physical or mental impairment (s) that can reasonably be expected to produce the pain or other symptoms; 2) an evaluation of the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of the symptoms to determine the extent to which they limit the claimant's functioning. Tr. at 20. The ALJ wrote that Plaintiff's credibility had been evaluated under the standards set forth in\n   <em>\n    Polaski v. Heckler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"301493\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/751/943/\">\n    751 F.2d 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 1984), and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1529\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 416.929. Tr. at 21. The ALJ found that while Plaintiff's medically determinable impairments could reasonably be expected to cause the alleged symptoms, his statements concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of the symptoms were not \"entirely credible,\" because the objective findings in the medical evidence fail to provide strong support for the allegations of symptoms which produce limitations on the claimant's ability to perform basic work activities. Tr. at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The ALJ wrote that he considered the opinion of Dr. McCurdy that Plaintiff was unable to work for eight hours because of his symptoms. The ALJ gave minimal weight to Dr. McCurdy's opinion because the limitations were inconsistent with the evidence as a whole, and because the doctor relied on Plaintiff subjective complaints. Tr. at 23-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The ALJ weighed the opinion rendered by Dr. Bansal against those rendered by Dr. Sciorrotta and Dr. Kuhnlein. The ALJ found the Sciorrotta/Kunlein opinions more persuasive. Tr. at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The ALJ considered the opinion of Dr. Van Der Veer, but gave it minimal weight because the doctor relied on Plaintiff's subjective complaints. Tr. at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The ALJ considered the September 8, 2015 report submitted by Dr. Graham. The ALJ accorded minimal weight to the opinion that Plaintiff is not able to maintain concentration, attention, and pace in a normal competitive work environment \"in that the claimant showed only mild neurocognitive functioning and Dr. Graham stated specifically that the claimant was oriented in all spheres and his attention was easily gained and directed, which is inconsistent with findings.\" Tr. at 25. The ALJ went on: \"Additionally, had Mr. Graham performed a records review he would see that the claimant consistently maintained a body mass index of 32 throughout the entire medical record and records actually show he gained weight and was advised to lose weight for diabetic purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   \" Tr. at 25-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The ALJ wrote that he gave significant weight to the opinions rendered by the State Agency medical consultants, especially regarding Plaintiff's physical limitations.

Congress has imposed on them responsibility for assuring that the Board keeps within reasonable grounds.

After a mental status examination using the St. Louis University Mental Status exam protocol, Dr. Graham diagnosed somatic symptom disorder with predominant pain, persistent and severe, and a major depressive disorder. Both of these impairments are included in the list of severe impairments at step two of the ALJ's sequential evaluation findings. Most significant, is Dr. Graham's use of the term \"severe.\" The DSM-IV-TR defines \"severe\": \"Many symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis, or several symptoms that are particularly severe, are present, or the symptoms result in marked impairment in social or occupational functioning.\" DSM-IV-TR at 2.

There is no suggestion that Dr. Graham's opinion is based on anything other than medically acceptable clinical diagnostic techniques, and the opinion is consistent with all the other evidence in this record. Dr. Graham's opinions and observations are consistent with those of the other medical providers, including Plaintiff's primary care physicians-Snyder and McCurdy, Dr. Bansal who performed an independent medical evaluation, and the opinion of Dr. Van Der Veer who treated Plaintiff on several occasions. None of the neurologists who saw Plaintiff doubted that he experiences headaches-only\n   that the cause may be mental rather than physical in nature. It was the neurologist at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Dr. Shivapour, who first suspected that psychological testing may be helpful in diagnosing and treating Plaintiff's headaches. It was because of the neuropsychological testing that Plaintiff found his way to Dr. Graham. From beginning to end, Plaintiff has been consistent in his complaints of debilitating headaches caused, in his mind, by artificial lighting. Doctors Sciorrotta and Kuhnlein do not suggest that Plaintiff does not have headaches-their professional opinion is that the headaches are not caused by Plaintiff's workplace. See Tr. at 629.
