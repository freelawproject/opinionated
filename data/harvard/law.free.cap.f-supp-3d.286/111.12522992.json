BATES, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In 2016, the Department of Transportation issued a final rule (the \"Reporting Rule\") that will require airlines to report the number of wheelchairs and scooters that are mishandled after being transported as checked luggage on passenger flights. Although the Reporting Rule was initially scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2018, the Department later issued another final rule (the \"Extension Rule\") that delayed the Reporting Rule's effective date by one year. Several months later, plaintiffs filed this action challenging the Extension Rule, arguing that it is arbitrary and capricious and that it should have been issued using notice-and-comment procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the Court, the Department defends neither the substance of the Extension Rule nor the procedures that were used to promulgate it. Instead, the Department argues only that the Court lacks jurisdiction over plaintiffs' challenge, because a statute vests that jurisdiction exclusively in the federal courts of appeals. Indeed, the Department agrees that summary judgment should be entered for plaintiffs if there is jurisdiction here. But while plaintiffs' arguments against the Extension Rule may have merit, the Court's first consideration-and here, its only one-is jurisdiction. For the reasons that follow, the Court agrees with the Department that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2011, the Department of Transportation (the \"Department\") proposed a new rule that would require airlines to report the number of wheelchairs and scooters that are delayed, damaged, or lost after being transported as checked luggage on domestic passenger flights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reporting Ancillary Airline Passenger Revenues,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041%2C726\">\n    76 Fed. Reg. 41,726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (July 15, 2011). In its notice of proposed rulemaking, the Department noted that \"[m]any air travelers who use wheelchairs are reluctant to travel by air because of concern that the return of their wheelchairs or scooters will be delayed, or the wheelchair/scooter will be damaged or lost.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041%2C726\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041%2C726\">\n    at 41,728\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The proposed rule, the Department explained, would enable a traveler to select an airline based on its track record of handling mobility devices and would encourage airlines to handle such devices with greater care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After receiving hundreds of comments from airlines, industry groups, disability-rights organizations, and other members of\n   the public, the Department issued the final Reporting Rule in November 2016. The rule will require air carriers to \"report monthly to the Department ... [t]he total number of wheelchairs and scooters that were enplaned in the aircraft cargo compartment for any domestic nonstop scheduled passenger flight,\" as well as the number of such bags that were \"mishandled.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=14%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20234.6\">\n    14 C.F.R. \u00a7 234.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)-(3) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=14%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20234.2\">\n    14 C.F.R. \u00a7 234.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defining a \"[m]ishandled checked bag\" as one that was \"lost, delayed, damaged or pilfered\").

The Department contends that \u00a7 46110 strips this Court of jurisdiction over plaintiffs' challenge to the Extension Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Initially, the Department's case seems straightforward. The Extension Rule restates the authority citation for 14 C.F.R. part 234,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   which cites three statutory provisions:\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20329\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 41101, and 41701.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Extension Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2014%2C437\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. at 14,437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The latter two provisions, \u00a7\u00a7 41101 and 41701, both appear in Part A. Thus, the Extension Rule was issued \"in part\" under Part A, and jurisdiction to review the rule lies in the courts of appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   But as plaintiffs point out, neither \u00a7 41101 nor \u00a7 41701 even arguably supports the Extension Rule. Section 41101, entitled \"Requirement for a certificate,\" requires that an air carrier obtain a certificate from the Department before providing air transportation services to the public. And \u00a7 41701, entitled \"Classification of air carriers,\" authorizes the Department to establish \"reasonable classifications for air carriers.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Combined Mem. at 15. Any connection between these two provisions and the Extension Rule is tenuous at best.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, although \u00a7 329 at least\n   colorably supports the Extension Rule,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20329\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (authorizing the Department to \"collect and collate transportation information [it] decides will contribute to the improvement of the transportation system of the United States\"), \u00a7 329 does not appear in Part A. Thus, plaintiffs argue, the Extension Rule was not \"issued under\" Part A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Department's responses are twofold. First, the Department points to a sentence in the Extension Rule which states that the rule was issued by the Department's Deputy General Counsel \"under authority delegated in 49 CFR 1.27(n).\" Extension Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2014%2C437\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. at 14,437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 1.27(n) provides: \"The General Counsel is delegated authority to ... conduct all departmental regulation of airline consumer protection ... pursuant to chapters 401 ..., 411 ..., 413 ..., 417 ..., and 423\" of title 49-five chapters that all appear in Part A. Thus, the Department reasons, because the General Counsel issued the Extension Rule under the authority delegated in \u00a7 1.27(n), and because \u00a7 1.27(n) delegates authority to issue only Part A rules, the Extension Rule must have been issued under Part A. See Defs.' Combined Mem. at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This argument fails for at least two reasons. First, it does not account for the possibility that the Extension Rule finds support in\n   <em>\n    neither\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 329 (because the General Counsel lacks authority to issue rules under that provision)\n   <em>\n    nor\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 41101 and 41701 (because neither of those provisions supports the Extension Rule as a substantive matter).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Reply to Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Pls.' Reply\") [ECF No. 19] at 7-8. As plaintiffs correctly point out,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2014%2C437\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2014%2C437\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   the fact that \u00a7 1.27(n) limits the General Counsel's authority to Part A statutes simply suggests that the Extension Rule was not properly issued under\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of its cited authority; it does not provide a reason to ignore the cited authority and look instead to authorities that are not cited in the rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Department's argument also ignores\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2021.43\">\n    1 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which provides that if an agency amends a part of the Code of Federal Regulations, and if \"the authority for issuing [the] amendment is the same as the authority for the whole C.F.R. part,\" then the amending document \"shall simply restate\" the authority citation for that part. Here, the Extension Rule \"simply restat[ed]\" the authority citation for 14 C.F.R. part 234.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Extension Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2014%2C437\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. at 14,438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The authority citation for part 234 continues to read as follows ....\"). This suggests that the statutes cited in the authority citation were \"the authority for issuing the amendment.\" It also suggests that the citation to \u00a7 1.27(n) was meant only to identify the\n   <em>\n    delegated\n   </em>\n   authority that allowed the General Counsel to issue the Extension Rule on the Secretary's behalf. Thus, plaintiffs are correct that the Extension Rule's citation to \u00a7 1.27(n) does not identify the authority under which the rule was \"issued\" for purposes of \u00a7 46110.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Next, the Department argues that even if part 234's authority citation sets out the Extension Rule's statutory authority, \u00a7 46110 still applies because two of the statutes listed in the authority citation\n   ( \u00a7\u00a7 41101 and 41701 ) appear in Part A.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Reply at 4-8. This is so, the Department claims, even assuming that neither statute actually supports the Extension Rule, because \"whether an agency action was duly authorized is a\n   <em>\n    merits\n   </em>\n   question of law to be decided by the court to which Congress conferred jurisdiction\"-here, the courts of appeals.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2014%2C437\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2014%2C437\">\n    at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But this argument also misses the mark. Plaintiffs do not ask the Court to determine whether the Extension Rule is\n   <em>\n    valid\n   </em>\n   under \u00a7\u00a7 41101 and 41701, as the Department asserts,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2014%2C437\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2014%2C437\">\n    at 5-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; rather, they urge the Court to determine whether those provisions even\n   <em>\n    colorably\n   </em>\n   support the rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

Central to the D.C. Circuit's reasoning in that case was its conclusion that no statute other than section 15G even colorably authorized the joint rulemaking effort that produced the Risk Retention Rule. Here, the situation is exactly the opposite: all parties agree that the Department easily could have issued the Extension Rule under other Part A authorities and that, had it done so, jurisdiction would lie in the courts of appeals. In fact, the Department suggests (and plaintiffs do not really dispute) that the Extension Rule cited \u00a7\u00a7 41101 and 41701 by mistake. Thus, the concern driving the D.C. Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Loan Syndications\n   </em>\n   is not present here: the Extension Rule could have been-and indeed, likely should have been-issued under statutory authority that would have triggered direct review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   There is ample evidence in the record to support this conclusion. Before the Department promulgated the Reporting Rule in 2016, the authority citation for part 234 cited\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20329\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (entitled \"Transportation information\"), 41708 (\"Reports\"), and 41709 (\"Records of air carriers\"). Sections 41708 and 41709 both appear in Part A. Moreover, unlike \u00a7\u00a7 41101 and 41701, both would likely support the Reporting Rule (and hence the Extension Rule).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2041708\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A) (authorizing the Department to \"require an air carrier ... to file annual, monthly, periodical, and special reports with the Secretary in the form and way prescribed by the Secretary\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2041708\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 41709(a) (providing that the Secretary \"shall prescribe the form of records to be kept by an air carrier ... and the time period during which the records shall be kept\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Department's 2011 notice of proposed rulemaking for the Reporting Rule proposed without explanation to amend part 234's authority citation by replacing \u00a7\u00a7 41708 and 41709 with \"49 U.S.C. ... chapters 41101 and 41701.\" Reporting Ancillary Airline Passenger Revenues,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041%2C726\">\n    76 Fed.

Apparently recognizing that there are no \"chapters 41101 and 41701\" in title 49, the drafters of the final Reporting Rule changed the citation again, this time to its present form: \" 49 U.S.C. 329, 41101 and 41701.\" Reporting Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2014%2C437\">\n    82 Fed.

And the Extension Rule, issued few months later, simply restated this citation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Extension Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2014%2C437\">\n    82 Fed.

This mistake was then compounded by the drafters of the final Reporting Rule, who \"corrected\" the citation not by changing the phrase \"41101 and 41701\" to \"411 and 417,\" but rather by changing the word \"chapters\" to \"sections.\" In light of the\n   foregoing review of the Reporting Rule's drafting history, this explanation for the change-the only one offered by either party-\"makes perfect sense.\"\n   <em>\n    Am. Petroleum Inst.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5865552,3662463\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/1329/\">\n    714 F.3d at 1333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Why else would the Department have changed the citation from clearly applicable statutory authority ( \u00a7\u00a7 41708 and 41709 ) to clearly inapposite authority ( \u00a7\u00a7 41101 and 41701 )?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Indeed, plaintiffs do not seriously dispute that the Extension Rule's citation to \u00a7\u00a7 41101 and 41701 was a mistake. Instead, they argue that they should nonetheless be allowed to proceed for two reasons. First, they argue that the Department should suffer the consequences of its own error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Combined Mem. at 20. Plaintiffs frame the issue as one of notice, arguing that \"[n]othing in the [Extension] Rule put [plaintiffs] on notice that it was validly promulgated under [P]art A ... and, accordingly, that a jurisdictional provision directed [that] any challenge might need to be brought in the court of appeals within 60 days.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5865552,3662463\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/1329/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But this is not so. The Extension Rule clearly cited two Part A provisions, and plaintiffs have cited no authority that would have suggested in March 2017, when the Extension Rule was promulgated, that they could safely ignore those provisions for purposes of \u00a7 46110. Plaintiffs may have believed at the time that the citation to \u00a7\u00a7 41101 and 41701 did not validly trigger \u00a7 46110, but they cannot say that they lacked notice that \u00a7 46110 might apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Second, plaintiffs argue that if district courts lack the power to disregard citations to authorities that do not even colorably support a rule, then an agency could \"manufacture\" jurisdiction simply by citing inapposite authorities that trigger the agency's preferred jurisdictional route.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. This argument has some force.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a case where an agency appears to have attempted to manufacture jurisdiction using citations to inapposite statutory authority, plaintiffs' proposed approach-taking a \"peek\" at the rule's cited authorities and disregarding any plainly inapposite ones-might be warranted. In this case, however, the record suggests that the Extension Rule's citation to \u00a7\u00a7 41101 and 41701 was not an intentional act of forum shopping, and plaintiffs do not contend otherwise. The parties do not dispute that had the Department wanted to ensure that \u00a7 46110 would apply to the Reporting Rule, it could have included a citation to one of the many on-point authorities that appear in Part A. Indeed, it could have simply left the authority citation for part 234-which previously cited \u00a7\u00a7 41708 and 41709 -unchanged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court concludes that where, as here, the record suggests that a rule mistakenly cites an inapposite statutory authority instead of some other, clearly applicable authority, and where there is no evidence (or even allegation) of bad-faith conduct on the part of the promulgating agency, the Court may treat the rule as issued \"under\" the mistakenly omitted authority for purposes of ascertaining its jurisdiction under a direct-review statute. This conclusion is in accord with the pragmatic approach taken by the D.C. Circuit\n   in\n   <em>\n    American Petroleum\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Loan Syndications\n   </em>\n   , where the court rejected a mechanical analysis of the challenged rules' authority citations and looked instead to the statutory authorities that actually supported the rules. It also comports with the D.C. Circuit's frequently articulated presumption in favor of direct review.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Loan Syndications &amp; Trading Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310437,4251655\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/818/716/\">\n    818 F.3d at 719-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that the D.C.

The latter citation would confer jurisdiction (since \u00a7 46110 applies to statutes issued \"in whole or in part\" under Part A), and the former citation would save the rule on merits review.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Nat'l Auto.
