Accordingly, these facts are undisputed unless otherwise noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff is the sole tenant of a building located at 6620 Southwest Scholls Ferry Road in Tigard, Oregon. The building is owned by Uptown Market Property, LLC (Uptown Property).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff conducts a beer-brewing and retail-sales business in the leased building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The obligations and responsibilities of Plaintiff and Uptown Property are set forth in their Lease and include the following relevant provisions: (1) Uptown Property is required to have standard multi-peril insurance covering the building and other improvements, but that insurance does not include Plaintiff's trade fixtures, improvements, and other property on the leased premises; (2) Uptown Property is not liable for injury to \"goods, stock, merchandise, or any other property\" of Plaintiff and is required to have its own insurance to cover risks to Plaintiff's property; (3) any improvements, alterations, and other work performed on the property are considered the property of Uptown Property with the exception of Plaintiff's trade fixtures; and (4) Uptown Property is responsible for \"structural repairs and maintenance and repairs necessitated by structural disrepair or defects,\" repair and maintenance of the \"foundation of the Building,\" and repair of \"floors, and floor coverings when such repairs are made necessary because of failure of [Uptown Property] to keep the structure in repair.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As noted, Uptown Property is the owner of the building. The loan for purchase of the building is secured by an installment note, and the building is the collateral for the loan. Uptown Property also granted a Deed of Trust to the bank \"to all real property\" located at 6620 S.W. Scholls Ferry Road. Pursuant to the loan agreement, Uptown Property was required to provide the bank \"with evidence of insurance coverage\" to ensure that the bank did not have to purchase insurance to protect its own interests in the building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff is a guarantor of the loan on the property, and Plaintiff granted to the bank \"a security interest in all property in which [Plaintiff] has an ownership interest which is now or in the future in the possession of [the] [b]ank to secure payment under the [Guaranty] Agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant issued a Commercial Package Insurance Policy to Plaintiff as the named insured for the period of January 22, 2014, to January 22, 2015. Uptown Property is not named as an insured under Defendant's Policy. On November 18, 2014, a policy-change endorsement added U.S. Bank as a loss payee for business personal property under the Loss Payable Provisions of the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Subject to its terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions, Defendant's Policy provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Coverage\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   We will pay for direct physical loss or damage to Covered Property at the premises described in the Declarations [6620 S.W.

Section B.1. of the Policy sets out the following exclusions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   1. We will not pay for loss or damages caused directly or indirectly by any of the following.

Soil conditions include contraction, expansion, freezing, thawing, erosion, improperly compacted soil and the action of water under the ground surface.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    g.

The parties agree the only property owned by Plaintiff that was damaged were \"taps at the bar\" that do not drain properly. The taps are operational, but the drains are not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On January 6, 2015, Plaintiff submitted an insurance claim to Defendant under the Policy. On that date an insurance adjuster-representative for Defendant met with Plaintiff about its claim. Defendant subsequently retained Jon Burks, a project engineer with PT &amp; C/LWG Forensic Consulting, to determine the cause of the damage reported by Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On September 4, 2015, Burks inspected the building. On October 7, 2015, Burks issued a report in which he concluded the cracking of the concrete slab-on-grade floor at the building was consistent with long-term and ongoing nonuniform movement of the underlying soils as well as subsequent differential movement of the concrete slab; the concrete floor was built out-of-level, and that condition had been exacerbated by nonuniform movement of the underlying soils; and the cracking and\n   out-of-level concrete floor surface and separations of the counter-bar's laminate and cove base finishes were not the result of a spontaneous or concentrated introduction of moisture into the underlying soil such as that from a recent plumbing leak.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On October 8, 2015, Defendant denied Plaintiff's claim on the basis that there was not any coverage for its loss. Defendant specifically relied on the \"Earth Movement Exclusion\" of the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff then retained Jeffery Lewis, a structural engineer with West Coast Forensics, to investigate the cause of the damage to the building and to recommend possible repairs. On November 12, 2015, Lewis inspected the premises. On December 13, 2015, Lewis issued his report in which he found significant settlement of the floor slab had occurred with the maximum settlement located under the walk-in cooler; the cooler had settled with the floor slab and the doors were \"racked\" even though the cooler had been leveled; a water-supply line had leaked significantly during the month of January 2015, and water usage for the month was approximately 65,000 gallons higher than the previous month's usage; and a plumber reported he could not find a physical break in the main sewage line for the building, but the main line was \"sagging badly\" and was probably broken. Lewis also concluded the slab damage was directly related to the water leak (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the leaking high-pressure pipe caused underlying soils to erode and to wash away through the failed sewer main line); settlement was responsible for the slab slope in its entirety; and some of the slab cracks were from shrinkage during the original construction, but some of the slab cracks were fresh and associated with the high-pressure water leakage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On June 21, 2016, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant and another party in Oregon state court. Plaintiff later filed an amended complaint naming only Defendant. On September 30, 2016, Defendant was served with summons and complaint. Plaintiff alleges claims against Defendant for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On October 20, 2016, Defendant removed the state-court case to this Court and filed its Answer. Defendant denies Plaintiff's claims and asserts the Policy exclusions as an affirmative defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On December 4, 2016, the parties filed their respective Motions for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     STANDARD\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Washington Mut.

Oregon Revised Statutes \u00a7 742.011 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    Insurable interest in property.\n   </strong>\n   No policy of insurance of property or of any interest in property or arising from property shall be enforceable as to the insurance except for the benefit of persons having an insurable interest in the things insured as at the time of loss.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Oregon courts have held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   It is well settled that any one has an insurable interest in property who derives a benefit from its existence or would suffer loss from its destruction. It is sufficient to constitute an insurable interest in property that the insured is so situated with reference to the property that he would be liable to loss should it be injured or destroyed by the peril against which it is insured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    Bird v.

Or. Aug. 3, 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiff contends it derives a benefit from the existence of the building as the tenant; has suffered a loss as a result of damage to the building; and, therefore, has an insurable interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Here it is undisputed that Plaintiff does not own the building where the damage occurred. The building is owned by Uptown Property and leased to Plaintiff to conduct business on the property. Plaintiff\n   derives a benefit from the continued existence of the building and would suffer a loss if the building were destroyed. Plaintiff, however, must have suffered an actual loss for an insurable interest to exist, and any recovery for such loss would be limited to the actual loss sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As noted, pursuant to the terms of the Lease, Uptown Property owns all of the property on the premises with the exception of Plaintiff's \"trade fixtures,\" Uptown Property is responsible for the repair and maintenance of the structure, and Uptown Property is obligated to maintain in full force a multi-peril policy covering the building and other improvements exclusive of Plaintiff's trade fixtures. Plaintiff, as the tenant, was obligated to obtain insurance coverage only as to its own property, but it was not required to obtain first-party property coverage on the building. Although Plaintiff obtained a policy of insurance from Defendant, Uptown Property was not named as an insured under the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The parties agree the only damage to property owned by Plaintiff was the damage to its bar taps. Plaintiff, however, seeks damages that include replacement of the foundation and the pouring of a new concrete floor. It is undisputed that Uptown Property owned the concrete slab, foundation, and plumbing of the building that were damaged. Under the terms of the Lease, those repairs are the sole responsibility of Uptown Property as the lessor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The record does not reflect Plaintiff actually suffered any loss as a result of the damage to the building other than the damage to the bar taps. Plaintiff, however, argues: \"At the time of loss, there was the\n   <em>\n    possibility\n   </em>\n   that the damage caused would result in financial injury to Plaintiff, in the damage to trade fixtures, damage to the cooler and the resulting impact upon the marketability of Plaintiff's product and Plaintiff's continued business operations.\" Pl.'s Response at 4 (# 32)(emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   On this record the Court concludes there is not a genuine dispute of material fact as to the damage Plaintiff sustained to its bar taps (although the parties agree \"the taps are operational, [but] the drains are not\"). The record does not reflect any evidence of actual loss of business or negative impact on Plaintiff's products or operations as a result of the alleged damage. Accordingly, the Court concludes Plaintiff has not shown actual loss sufficient to constitute an insurable interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Plaintiff, nevertheless, contends it has a \"financial interest\" in the building because, as guarantor of the mortgage, Plaintiff had the obligation to insure the building due to the fact that Uptown Property did not have insurance. Uptown Property, however, was aware the bank \"may purchase insurance at [Uptown Property's] expense to protect [the bank's] interest\" if Uptown did not provide evidence of insurance to the bank. Thus, Plaintiff's only obligation as guarantor was to guarantee payment of the cost of any insurance that the bank might obtain to protect its own interests if Uptown Property did not obtain such insurance. In other words, Plaintiff was not obligated to obtain first-party property insurance on the building on behalf of Uptown Property. As the parties note, although Plaintiff obtained insurance from Defendant, it did not name Uptown Property or even the bank as an insured. The Court, there, concludes Plaintiff does not have a financial interest in the building that is sufficient to constitute an insurable interest based on its status as a guarantor of the loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In summary, the Court concludes Plaintiff has not shown it suffered any actual loss other than the alleged damage to its own property. The damages Plaintiff seeks\n   for replacement of the foundation and pouring a new concrete floor are not an insurable interest of the Plaintiff, and, in fact, are the sole responsibility of Uptown Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Accordingly, on this record the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Complaint in it entirety.
