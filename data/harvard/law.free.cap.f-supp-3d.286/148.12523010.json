This case is not about what is good housing policy, however. This case is about the rule of law-whether an agency effectively may suspend a duly promulgated regulation without observing the procedures or identifying relevant factual criteria that the law requires to effect such a change. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\"), without notice and comment or particularized evidentiary findings, has delayed almost entirely by two years implementation of a rule requiring over 200 local Public Housing Authorities (\"PHAs\") in 24 metropolitan areas, which HUD selected based on fixed, objective criteria, to calculate housing vouchers' values based on local, rather than metropolitan-wide, prevailing market rents. The plaintiffs, two voucher holders and a nonprofit organization devoted to providing housing opportunities for low-income people in Connecticut, move to preliminarily enjoin HUD to implement the rule on January 1, 2018, the rule's effective date. Pls.' Mot. Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. 15 (\"Pls.' Mot.\").

Defs.' Opp'n, Ex. 1 (\"Interim Report\"), ECF No. 24-4. This report contained good news on SAFMRs efficacy to achieve Section 8's statutory goals, with mixed results for some demonstration project PHAs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Specifically, the Interim Report found that SAFMRs in the pilot PHAs make \"the availability of units [ ] much more evenly distributed across different types of neighborhoods, leading to increased availability in high-rent ZIP Codes and reduced availability in low-rent ZIP Codes.\" Interim Report at vii;\n   <em>\n    see also id\n   </em>\n   . at viii (\"Because SAFMRs increase access to high-rent ZIP Codes and reduce access to low-rent ZIP Codes, we found not unexpectedly that the transition to SAFMRs led to an increase in units potentially available to HCV holders in higher-opportunity areas under SAFMRs compared with FMRs and fewer units in lower opportunity areas.\"). As a result, \"[f]ollowing the implementation of SAFMRs, HCV holders in the demonstration sites are slightly more likely to live in high-rent ZIP Codes than they were prior to the demonstration,\" while no such change was observed in \"comparison PHAs.\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at viii.

Moreover, Housing Assistance Payment (\"HAP\") costs, which \"are the subsidy costs that PHAs incur on behalf of HCV holders for rent and utilities,\" \"declined in real terms per unit between 2010 and 2015 in SAFMR PHAs,\" while \"[r]ents paid to landlords remained nearly flat in real terms between 2010 and 2015 but varied by rent category.\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at x.

Each action, by nature, affects discrete, particular geographic areas. Thus, \u00a7 888.113(c)(4), read as a whole and in concert with surrounding provisions, requires HUD to justify a particular SAFMR designation's suspension or PHA's exemption by reference to specific rental housing market conditions local to the affected area. HUD may not, in other words, suspend an SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA by citing abstract policy concerns or conclusions extrapolated from data with no or only tenuous relation to the specific affected PHA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The plaintiffs and defendants read \u00a7 888.113(c)(4) differently.

Section 888.113(c)(4), however, by its plain terms authorizes HUD to suspend an SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA even when the conditions that triggered the SAFMR's application to that metropolitan area or PHA still apply, so long as a qualifying event occurs. HUD could have written \u00a7 888.113(c)(4) in terms that would allow SAFMR suspensions or PHA exemptions only when a particular metropolitan area or PHA no longer satisfied the criteria for SAFMR designation in the first place, but HUD did not so limit the suspension/exemption authority that the regulation conferred.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wallaesa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323414,12310372,5923310\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/1071/\">\n    824 F.3d at 1083\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If Congress had intended that narrow meaning, it knew how to say so.\"). Moreover, to construe the term \"events\" to reach only adverse rental housing market condition changes that are \"sudden\" and \"unexpected\" has no basis in the regulatory text, is neither compelled by nor necessary to give effect to the two preceding actions, and would leave HUD powerless to suspend the Rule's impact under circumstances that, though foreseen or gradual, negatively impact voucher holders.

The defendants specifically argue that (1) the three enumerated actions merely illustrate, rather than exhaust, the sort of actions that trigger HUD's authority to suspend an SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA, and (2) the third action gives HUD unreviewable discretion to suspend an SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA for essentially any reason.

These arguments do not pass muster.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   First, the defendants argue that \u00a7 888.113(c)(4) does not provide an exclusive list of actions that may justify suspending an SAFMR designation or exempting a PHA, but merely nonexclusive examples of such actions. Defs.' Opp'n at 23-24. This construction is inconsistent with \u00a7 888.113(c)(4)'s phrasing, which provides, \"Actions that may serve as the basis of a suspension of Small Area FMRs\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   ,\" then lists three specific actions.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20888.113\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 888.113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(4) (emphasis added). Section 888.113(c)(4)'s use of the term \"are\" rather than \"include\" compels a conclusion that the enumerated examples constitute an exclusive, rather than merely illustrative, list of actions that may justify suspending an SAFMR designation or exempting a PHA. Had HUD wished to reserve to itself authority to suspend an SAFMR designation for reasons other than an enumerated action's occurrence, HUD could have drafted \u00a7 888.113(c)(4) to provide that \"Actions that may serve as the basis of a suspension of Small Area FMRs\n   <em>\n    include\n   </em>\n   \" the three enumerated actions. HUD, however, did not do that; by drafting \u00a7 888.113(c)(4) to contain the term \"are\" rather than \"include,\" HUD limited its authority to suspend an SAFMR designation to the occurrence of an enumerated action.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wallaesa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323414,12310372,5923310\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/1071/\">\n    824 F.3d at 1083\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Second, the defendants argue that even if HUD may suspend an SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA only upon an enumerated action's occurrence, the third action is phrased so broadly as to give HUD essentially unreviewable discretion to suspend an SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA for any reason. Defs.' Opp'n at 22-26. The\n   <em>\n    ejusdem generis\n   </em>\n   canon, the defendants say, is inapplicable because \u00a7 888.113(c)(4) contains no \"general term which follows specific ones.\" Defs.' Opp'n at 24 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). This is incorrect. Section 888.113(c)(4) enumerates two specific actions-\"A Presidentially declared disaster area that results in the loss of a substantial number of housing units\" and \"A sudden influx of displaced needing permanent housing\"-followed by a third, more general action-\"Other events as determined by the Secretary.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20888.113\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 888.113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The defendants contend that the Rule's overall context shows that\n   <em>\n    ejusdem generis\n   </em>\n   does not apply, identifying three aspects of the Rule that the defendants characterize indicating \"an intent to be expansive.\" Defs.' Opp'n at 24-25.

Opp'n at 25. The\n   <em>\n    ejusdem generis\n   </em>\n   canon, however, requires no clear statement that specific language limits general language's scope. Indeed, to require such clarity would defeat the canon's purpose of clarifying ambiguous statutes. Finally, the defendants observe that the third action's wording \"specifically states that the nature of the referenced 'events' are those that are 'determined by the Secretary,' not those that are similar in kind to the preceding examples,\" which the defendants argue \"forecloses the notion that the nature of the 'events' referenced therein is to be limited by the preceding examples.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323414,12310372,5923310\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/1071/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That HUD has some discretion to determine which events justify suspending an SAFMR designation is undisputed, however; the question is whether that discretion is bounded. Here, the sequence of two specifically-phrased actions followed by a generally-phrased third action indicates that the first two actions limit HUD discretion under the third action.

For example, in at least one significant way, the Long Beach pilot PHA did not demographically represent the Rule-affected PHAs.

SAFMRs' success thus requires all PHAs within a metropolitan area to adopt SAFMRs. Laredo and Mamaroneck, the only two pilot PHAs that implemented SAFMRs throughout their entire metropolitan areas, significantly were the only pilot PHAs that saw virtually no decrease in rental housing unit supply.

Most significantly, as discussed above, the Rule requires\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   PHAs within an affected metropolitan area to use SAFMRs, addressing\n   a crucial issue that the demonstration project uncovered.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20888.113\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 888.113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3) ;\n   <em>\n    Final Rule\n   </em>\n   , 81 Fed.

The Rule also contains several other provisions to protect voucher holders against issues the demonstration project revealed, including (1) \"limit[ing] the annual decrease in Small Area FMRs to no more than 10 percent of the area's FMR in the prior fiscal year\" and allowing PHAs to (2) \"hold harmless those families remaining in place from payment standard reductions,\" (3) \"establish a new payment standard for families under HAP contract between the full 'hold harmless' option ... and the new payment standard based on the Small Area FMR,\" (4) \"establish different policies regarding how decreases in payment standards will apply [to voucher holders] for designated areas within their jurisdiction,\" and (5) \"request and receive approval to establish an exception payment standard promptly for a ZIP Code area if necessary to react to rapidly changing market conditions or to ensure sufficient rental units are available for voucher families.\"\n   <em>\n    Final Rule\n   </em>\n   , 81 Fed.

HUD has discounted the importance of two of these five enumerated voucher holder protections incorporated into the Rule, noting that the 10 percent SAFMR cap \"may only slow the pace of the loss of units, as opposed to preventing the overall decline in the number of units available to HCV families,\" and that the \"hold harmless\" provision does not \"protect[ ] families that must move to a new unit or [ ] applicant families off the waiting list who are trying to lease a unit on the program for the first time.\" Suspension Mem. at 5-7.

Neither the Suspension Memo nor Letter to PHAs, however, even attempt to make such a showing. Nor, for that matter, does the defendants' briefing.

As explained above, \u00a7 888.113(c)(4) required HUD to identify adverse rental housing market conditions local to a particular area or PHA to justify suspending an SAFMR designation or exempting a PHA in that area. HUD, as explained, did no such thing. Instead, HUD attempted to justify delaying the Rule's implementation by two years by citing data based on a small number of pilot PHAs, which did not represent the Rule-affected areas in terms\n   of demographics or scope and which HUD selected partially randomly (1) on the basis of entirely different criteria than those HUD used to select the Rule-affected areas and (2) for entirely different objectives than HUD sought to achieve through the Rule's promulgation. HUD, in so doing, \"relied on factors\"-i.e., the demonstration project data-\"which [law] ha[d] not intended it to consider\" and \"entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem\"-i.e., local rental housing market conditions in the Rule-affected areas.\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   , 875 F.3d at 19 (quoting\n   <em>\n    State Farm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n    463 U.S. at 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations omitted)).

Simsbury's poverty rate of 3.4 percent, Decl. of Sasha Samberg-Champion (\"Pls.' Decl.\"), Ex.

The fact that Ms. Carter's PHA may implement SAFMRs voluntarily,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Suspension Mem. at 3; Letter to PHAs at 3, does not prevent Ms. Carter from showing irreparable harm. For the reasons explained above, SAFMRs fail to assist voucher holders to relocate to high-opportunity areas unless all or substantially all PHAs within a metropolitan area implement SAFMRs, meaning that a single PHA, such as Ms. Carter's, likely will not implement SAFMRs voluntarily. Further, HUD's counsel conceded at oral argument that no Rule-affected PHA has come forward to opt into the Rule voluntarily, Hr'g Tr. at 18-19, which likewise illustrates the unlikeliness that Ms. Carter's PHA will implement SAFMRs voluntarily.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The defendants correctly observe that Ms. Carter's children already attend school in Simsbury, Defs.'

Carter Decl. \u00b6 6. The defendants argue that \"the mere possibility ... that [Ms. Carter's] school-age children may potentially earn a higher income in their mid-twenties if they move at some point to a lower-poverty area is entirely speculative and in no way imminent.\" Defs.'

Opp'n at 34. To apply for housing in Simsbury prior to the Rule's implementation, however, would be futile-the Rule's premise is that voucher holders such as Ms. Carter cannot obtain housing in high-income areas like Simsbury because current payment standards do not suffice to make such housing affordable. Ms. Carter has established that she intends to apply for and obtain such housing as soon as she possibly can. Carter Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. A landlord's discrimination against voucher holders, moreover, would violate Connecticut law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Con. Gen.

Furthermore, HUD's own calculation, based on detailed housing market data, that an FMR of $1,940 will suffice to allow a voucher holder to rent a four-bedroom unit in Simsbury belies HUD's speculative assertion that such units may be unavailable to Ms. Carter even under the Rule,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

Ms. Moore and her minor child live in an apartment in the City of Chicago, Illinois. Moore Decl. \u00b6 1. The Chicago Housing Authority has issued Ms. Moore a Housing Choice Voucher for $1,207 per month for a two-bedroom unit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 7. Ms. Moore wishes to move to DuPage County, Illinois, to live in a neighborhood that will afford her family greater employment opportunities, higher quality education, and a safer living environment, as well as to be nearer to Ms. Moore's mother, who provides child care so that Ms. Moore can work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. DuPage County's poverty rate of 7.4 percent, Pls.' Decl., Ex.

Ms. Moore has not, however, been able to locate any two-bedroom rental units in DuPage County for $1,207 per month.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. The Rule would enable Ms. Moore to move her family from the City of Chicago to DuPage County. For fiscal year 2018, the FMR for a two-bedroom unit in the broad Chicago metropolitan area, which includes DuPage County, would be\n   $1,180 per month. Pls.' Decl., Ex. C, Chicago FMRs at 1, ECF No. 16-3.

D, 2018 Chicago SAFMRs, ECF No. 16-4. This difference in voucher purchasing power throughout much of DuPage County would dramatically improve Ms. Moore's ability to find suitable housing there. In addition, Ms. Moore will, absent the Rule's implementation, continue to incur opportunity and transportation costs arising from her daily trips to bring her child to and from her mother's house for child care.
