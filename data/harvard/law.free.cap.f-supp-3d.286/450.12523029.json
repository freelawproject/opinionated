Factual background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court assumes familiarity with the facts as detailed in the January 2017 Decision and provides a summary of only the pertinent facts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   January 2017 Decision.) For purposes of this motion, the facts alleged in the Complaint are assumed to be true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff was released from prison in 2010 and moved into his family's home located in Brooklyn, New York. (Compl. 6.) Plaintiff's wife also resided at his family's home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In 2011, Plaintiff had a \"verbal argument\" with his wife that resulted in his wife obtaining an order of protection against him, which prohibited him from residing with her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The day after Plaintiff's wife obtained the order of protection, Jones, Plaintiff's then-parole officer, told Plaintiff that, despite the order of protection, he could reside in an upstairs apartment with his parents while his wife lived in the basement apartment of the same building. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At some point thereafter, Plaintiff was arrested for violating the order of protection and served 365 days at the Greenburg Correctional Facility. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After his release in 2012, Plaintiff violated the terms of his release on two separate occasions, resulting in parole revocations in 2014 and 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9, 11.) Although Plaintiff challenges all three revocations, Jones was not involved in the latter two revocations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Jones violated his due process rights by allowing him to reside at the family home, putting him at risk of violating the conditions of his parole. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, 9.) He asserts that by failing to adequately assess the risks involved, Jones failed to follow the proper procedures required in selecting a \"suitable place\" of residence for a parolee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) Plaintiff seeks $15 million in damages for psychological and emotional damage, lost wages and loss of family time with his parents and child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
