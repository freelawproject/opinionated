Now pending before the Court is Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint with Prejudice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a), 12(b)(1), and 12(b)(6). (ECF No. 16.) The issues have been briefed (ECF Nos. 16 &amp; 20), and no hearing is required, Local Rule 105.6 (D. Md. 2016). For the reasons explained below, Defendants' motion to dismiss will be GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff, proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , originally filed this multi-faceted complaint against\n   the above-named defendants on February 24, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The original complaint, which was sixty-one pages, was labeled \"Complaint for Civil RICO Violation of Title 18, US Code, Sections 1962(a), 1962(c), 1962(d).\" (ECF No. 1.) In addition to alleging that Defendants violated various provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"), the complaint also alleged an assortment of other federal and state constitutional, statutory, and common law claims. Plaintiff's original complaint was a winding morass of improper legal conclusions and arguments. Accordingly, the Court informed Plaintiff that the complaint failed to comply with Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure because it did not include: (1) a short and plain statement of the grounds upon which this court has jurisdiction (specifically what defendants allegedly did to violate plaintiff's rights); (2) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that plaintiff is entitled to relief; and (3) a demand for judgment for the relief plaintiff seeks. (ECF No. 2.) The Court then granted plaintiff twenty-one days to file an amended complaint in accordance with Rule 8(a). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 23, 2017, Plaintiff filed his First Amended Complaint. (ECF No. 3.) The amended complaint, which was sixty-seven pages, added headings titled \"Short Plain Statement of the Grounds Upon Which This Court Has Jurisdiction and the Claim Upon Which the Plaintiff Is Entitled to Relief\" and \"Short Plain Statement of the Relief Sought,\" apparently in an attempt to respond to the Court's prior directive. The amended complaint, however, remained generally ambiguous, unintelligible, and vexatious. Accordingly, the Court informed Plaintiff that the amended complaint still failed to satisfy Rule 8(a) for all the same reasons previously stated by the Court. (ECF No. 6.) The Court again granted Plaintiff twenty-one days to correct the deficiencies in his complaint and instructed him to file a clear and concise pleading. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 2, 2017, Plaintiff filed his Seconded Amended Complaint, which is the operative complaint currently before the Court. Aside from being one page longer than the previous complaint, the current complaint does not appear to be materially distinguishable from its predecessor. As best the Court can tell, Plaintiff added some additional detail under the section of the complaint titled \"Short Plain Statement of the Relief Sought.\" However, given the general redundancy and disorganization of the complaint (as well as its predecessors), and Plaintiff's failure to identify the amendments as required by Local Rule 103.6(c), the Court is unable to identify any other potential revisions made by Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. Rule 8(a) Pleading Requirements\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) imposes a baseline standard to which all complaints must adhere. A complaint must contain \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Moreover, \"[e]ach allegation must be simple, concise, and direct.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(1). The rule is intended to: \"give fair notice of the claim being asserted\" to the adverse party; \"sharpen the issues to be litigated\"; and \"confine discovery and the presentation of evidence at trial within reasonable bounds.\"\n   <em>\n    T.M. v.

(ECF No. 16.)\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    The Court previously dismissed without prejudice defendants Steven Plaisance, Kyle Leukota, and Buonassissi Henning &amp; Lash, PC, due to Plaintiff's failure to prosecute. (ECF No. 21.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Defendants also argue that the complaint should be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) because the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. Defendants contend that, because Plaintiff filed a petition for bankruptcy prior to filing the instant suit, all of Plaintiff's claims in fact belong to his bankruptcy estate.

Md. Feb. 15, 2017) (noting that claims that are \"not properly scheduled...remain the property of the bankruptcy estate, even after the bankruptcy case has closed\"). As an initial matter, neither party has submitted bankruptcy court records that would indicate whether Plaintiff scheduled his claims. More importantly though, both parties seemingly agree that each of Plaintiff's numerous bankruptcy cases was dismissed, in most instances within weeks of being filed. And the dismissal of a bankruptcy case (unlike a discharge) generally \" 'restore[s] the status quo ante;' it is as if the bankruptcy petition had never been filed.\"\n    <em>\n     In re Derrick\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299917\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/190/346/#p350\">\n     190 B.R. 346\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 350 (Bankr.
