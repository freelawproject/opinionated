Am. Compl. [Dkt. # 31] \u00b6\u00b6 1, 11. He leaned back against a chain linking two bollards together, and a 200-pound bollard fell on his leg and fractured it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 14-19. He has brought this action against defendants SK &amp; A Structural Engineers, PLLC (\"SK &amp; A\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Concrete Protection &amp; Restoration, Inc. (\"CPR\"), alleging that they were grossly negligent when they failed to secure the bollards to the ground.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Both defendants have moved to dismiss plaintiff's single-count complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on the grounds that the action is barred by the applicable statute of limitations, or in the alternative, that plaintiff has failed to state a claim for gross negligence. Mot. of SK &amp; A to Dismiss Am. Compl. [Dkt. # 33] (\"SK &amp; A Mot.\"); Mot. to Dismiss Am. Compl. [Dkt. # 36] (\"CPR Mot\"). Because plaintiff filed his amended complaint over two years after the expiration of the three-year statute of limitations, the Court will grant defendants' motions. This holding does not mean that plaintiff was not injured, and it is not a finding on the question of whether defendants bear responsibility for the dangerous situation alleged in the complaint. Notwithstanding the pain and the ongoing inconvenience plaintiff has suffered, the Court is required to follow the law that governs when a lawsuit must be filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff, a journalist and citizen of France, was in Washington D.C. with his cameraman on assignment filming a documentary. Am. Compl. \u00b6 11. They decided\n   to take a video of the window dressing in the White House Gift Store.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. Large bollards, linked by chains, had been placed along the sidewalk across the street from the store to prevent taxis from stopping there to pick up or drop off patrons.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-4, 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 11, 2012, while plaintiff searched for the best angle to film the window, he leaned back against one of the chains and, as he puts it, he felt it \"release[ ] all resistance.\" Am. Compl. \u00b614. As the top of one of the bollards tilted towards the street, the chain gave way and plaintiff \"lost his balance and [fell] backward with all his weight on the chain.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. Plaintiff's body pulled on the chain, causing the 200 pound bollard to fall onto his left leg.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff was immediately transported to George Washington Hospital and diagnosed with an open fracture of his left tibia. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-19. A few days later, he was repatriated to France.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Plaintiff alleges that he developed an ulcer on his left leg which did not heal until December 2012, leaving a scar and \"permanent and substantial muscular atrophy in his left leg.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-22. He claims that he has not regained full mobility in the leg and that he attends physical therapy several times a week.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. Plaintiff alleges that he has incurred $58,580.66 in medical bills and that he has lost income in excess of $80,028 due to his inability to continue work as a producer of television documentaries, a profession which requires \"physical mobility and capacity that he has been unable to retrieve.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24, 28-35. Plaintiff claims that the pain from his injury has caused him to stop participating in physical activities, and that it has \"substantially deteriorated his relationship with his wife and his two young children.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. He also alleges that, as a result of the accident, he has been treated for depression since December 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff initially filed a complaint on August 21, 2015 against Clarion Partners, LLC, based on an allegation that it was the manager of the 1440 New York Avenue building.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl. [Dkt. # 1]. Clarion Partners represented that it did not own or manage the property at the time of the accident, so plaintiff substituted 1440 New York Avenue Corporation, the owner of the property at the time, as the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Consent Substitution of Party [Dkt. # 5].\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the course of discovery, plaintiff learned that SK &amp; A and CPR were the parties responsible for the bollard installation portion of a renovation project at the property, and that the renovation was performed under the auspices of a permit issued by the District of Columbia.

Plaintiff entered into a stipulation of dismissal with 1440 New York Avenue Corporation and sought leave of Court to substitute SK &amp; A and CPR as the proper defendants. Pl.'s Mot. to Amend at 2. On February 27, 2017, the Court granted plaintiff's motion, and the operative complaint took effect the next day.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Min. Order (Feb. 27, 2017);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff's amended complaint alleges that in 2010, \"SK &amp; A was responsible for overseeing the renovation work at 1440 New York Avenue NW ... that was executed\n   by CPR pursuant to a permit issued by the Government of the District of Columbia.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 1. Defendants had to \"make sure that all work would be done in accordance with the Permit,\" which required the bollards \"to be attached to the ground through four bolts anchored into the sidewalk concrete\" to prevent them from falling.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 5. The permit included drawings that depicted how to attach the bollards to the ground.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2 to Pl.'s Opp. to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. [Dkt. # 21-2] (\"Permit\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff claims that defendants knew that the bollards were not bolted into the ground properly, and that they failed to notify the city inspector. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. He also alleges that before the final inspection of the renovations, SK &amp; A \"instructed CPR to place the bollards in a straight line and caulk the perimeter of the bollards that touches the sidewalk\" instead of bolting them down, and that \"CPR complied with the instruction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. As a result, the city inspector failed to discover that the bollards had not been properly installed as required by the permit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. The complaint alleges that defendants were grossly negligent when installing the bollards, and that their negligence resulted in serious bodily harm to plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Both defendants moved to dismiss the complaint with prejudice, arguing that the action is barred by the three-year statute of limitations or, in the alternative, that it should be dismissed for failing to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SK &amp; A Mot.; Mem. of P. &amp; A. [Dkt. # 33-1] (\"SK &amp; A Mem.\"); CPR Mot.; Mem. of P. &amp; A. [Dkt. # 36-1] (\"CPR Mem.\"). Plaintiff argues that the statute of limitations did not begin to run against defendants until he learned of their identities and wrongdoing through discovery, and he also maintains that the amended complaint includes sufficient facts to support a claim of gross negligence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp. to SK &amp; A Mot.

On September 11, 2012, plaintiff leaned on a chain he presumed was connected to two bollards firmly anchored to the ground, but one fell on him and crushed his leg.

While plaintiff argues that he cannot be charged with inquiry notice until he discovered the proper party to sue,\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s SK &amp; A Opp.; Pl's CPR Opp., that is not the standard.

Plaintiff realized from the start that the bollard was not bolted to the ground, and therefore, he was on notice that someone had failed to secure it properly, or at the least, that someone had failed to maintain it properly. This satisfies the quantum of knowledge required to put a plaintiff on inquiry notice. This conclusion is bolstered by the fact that plaintiff brought his original negligence claim, alleging that \"the pillars [were] not anchored in the ground but [were] simply resting on the ground\" within the three-year statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 14.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Moreover, a reasonable person would have conducted an investigation after his injury, and that investigation would have revealed some evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the named defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cevenini\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11859751\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/707/768/#p771\">\n    707 A.2d at 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
