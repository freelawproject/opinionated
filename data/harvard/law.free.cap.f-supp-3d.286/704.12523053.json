Russell, III, United States District Judge\n   THIS MATTER is before the Court on Defendants Board of Education of Talbot County (the \"Board\"), Kelly L. Griffith, and Tracy Elzey's Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim (ECF No. 36) and Plaintiff M.A.B.'s Motion for Preliminary Injunction (ECF No. 41). This action arises from Defendants' decision to require M.A.B., a transgender boy, to use restrooms and locker rooms for girls. The Motions are ripe for disposition, and no hearing is necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Local Rule 105.6 (D.Md. 2016). For the reasons outlined below, the Court will deny the Motion to Dismiss. In addition, the Court will deny without prejudice the Motion for Preliminary Injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   M.A.B. is a fifteen-year-old boy\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   who attends high school at St. Michaels Middle High School (the \"High School\"), which is located in Talbot County, Maryland. (Compl. \u00b6 2, ECF No. 1). His birth sex,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   which is usually based on \"the appearance of the person's external genitalia,\" is \"female.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20, 21). Yet M.A.B.'s \"deeply-held internal sense of his own gender,\" known as his gender identity, is male. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 20). \"[D]eterminations of gender,\" unlike determinations of birth sex, are based on \"multiple factors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21). These factors include \"chromosomes, hormone levels, internal and external reproductive organs, and gender identity,\" with gender identity being the \"primary determinant\" among them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21, 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Because M.A.B. was designated female at birth but has a male gender identity, that designation does not accurately reflect his gender identity-giving him the status of a transgender boy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20). As a result, he also has had feelings of gender dysphoria since early childhood. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 26). Gender dysphoria and \"the status of being transgender\" are \"not synonymous,\" though \"they are correlated.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24). Gender dysphoria is the \"clinically significant distress\" experienced by transgender individuals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23). Treatment for gender dysphoria includes \"social transitioning,\" which consists of \"living consistent with one's gender identity...in all aspects of one's life, including when accessing single-sex spaces like restrooms and locker rooms.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   When M.A.B. was in the sixth grade, he \"arrived at the clear realization\" that he was a boy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 26). M.A.B. received a clinical diagnosis of gender dysphoria in 2014, and has been seeing a medical professional regularly for his gender dysphoria and process of gender transition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26). When M.A.B. turned thirteen, therefore, he began to socially transition to life as male, including going by \"a more traditionally masculine chosen first name.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28). The Board and the High School \"took several steps\" to assist M.A.B.'s social transition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30). They addressed him by his new name, addressed him with male pronouns, and conducted a professional development workshop for its staff in 2015 on the topic of transgender students. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). M.A.B. later legally changed his name. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28). Since his transition\n   began, M.A.B. \"has been generally accepted and recognized as male\" by his peers at the High School. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   While aiding M.A.B.'s social transition in some ways, Defendants prohibited M.A.B. from using the High School's boys' locker rooms, and initially, its boys' restrooms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31). Instead, the Board \"designated\" three of the High School's single-use restrooms as \"gender neutral\" and required M.A.B. to use them when he needed to use the restroom or change his clothes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32). After the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit issued its opinion in\n   <em>\n    G.G. ex rel. Grimm v. Gloucester County School Board.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054700\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/709/\">\n    822 F.3d 709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 2016), Defendants permitted M.A.B. to use the boys' restrooms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31, 45). Since M.A.B. began using the boys' restrooms, no male students at the High School have voiced \"any discomfort\" about M.A.B.'s access. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49). In fact, many of M.A.B.'s peers \"congratulated him\" on the Board's decision to allow M.A.B. access. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Board, however, continued to prohibit M.A.B. from using the boys' locker rooms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31, 45). It maintained its decision to require M.A.B. to use the restrooms it designated as gender neutral whenever M.A.B. had to change his clothes (the \"Policy\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32, 45). Unlike the locker rooms, the designated restrooms the Board requires M.A.B. to use do not have benches or showers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36). Meanwhile, the boys' locker rooms have partitioned stalls for changing clothes and partitioned stalls that have toilets and stall doors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Board requires only M.A.B., and no other student, to change clothes in the designated restrooms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37). This has resulted M.A.B. experiencing humiliation and embarrassment, as well as alienation from his peers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38). He has received \"weird looks\" from other students when using the designated restrooms to change. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). M.A.B., then, \"has tried to use them as infrequently and inconspicuously as possible.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The designated restrooms are \"remotely located\" from the boys' and girls' locker rooms and the gymnasium. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35). The designated restrooms also do not have lockers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36). So, M.A.B. has to go to his student locker, which is far away from the designated restrooms, before changing his clothes, and his physical education teacher gives him extra time to change. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40, 41). Thus, when M.A.B. took physical education class in 2015, substitute teachers unaware of the Policy forced him to explain why he was tardy to class. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41). This required M.A.B. to disclose his transgender status to avoid disciplinary action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The \"stigma and impracticality\" of changing his clothes in the designated restrooms led M.A.B. to attend physical education class without changing when he thought he would not sweat very much. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42). At times, his physical education teacher penalized M.A.B.'s grade for not changing his clothes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   M.A.B., by and through his parents and next friends L.A.B. and L.F.B., filed the present action on July 19, 2016 against the Board, Kelly L. Griffith in her official capacity as Superintendent of Talbot County Public Schools, and Tracy Elzey in her official capacity as Principal of the High School. (ECF No. 1). In his four-count Complaint, he alleges claims under: Title IX of the Education of Amendments of 1972,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (2018) (\"Title IX\") (Count I); the Equal Protection\n   Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (Count II); Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights (Count III); and Article 46 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights (Count IV). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51-75). M.A.B. seeks judgment declaring that the Policy violates his rights under Title IX, the Fourteenth Amendment, and Articles 24 and 26. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17). M.A.B. also seeks a preliminary injunction requiring Defendants to allow him to use the High School boys' locker room on the same terms as other male students. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Finally, M.A.B. seeks nominal and compensatory damages, costs, and attorneys' fees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants now move to dismiss all counts against them for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), filing their Motion on April 18, 2017.

Defendants contend that the Policy does not implicate the Equal Protection Clause because it treats M.A.B. like every other student at the High School. The Policy requires him to use the locker room of his birth sex. Defendants further maintain that even under intermediate scrutiny, the Policy survives because it protects the privacy rights of the High School's students. The Court disagrees.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    The Policy clearly implicates the Equal Protection Clause. It treats M.A.B. differently from the rest of the High School's students. While the rest of M.A.B.'s peers may use the locker room that aligns with their gender identity, M.A.B. may not. Instead, Defendants discipline M.A.B. if he uses such a locker room-the boys' locker room. As a matter of fact, his physical education teacher penalized his grade when M.A.B. did not change his clothes because he did not want to deal with the \"stigma and impracticality\" of changing in the designated restrooms. (Compl. \u00b6 42). Also, M.A.B. had to disclose his transgender status to substitute teachers to avoid disciplinary action for being late to class after changing in those distant restrooms. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 41). None of these events would occur if the Policy permitted M.A.B. to change in the locker room that aligns with his gender identity, like the rest of the students at the High School. Thus, the Policy implicates the Equal Protection Clause.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    The Court concludes that the Policy does not withstand intermediate scrutiny because, as alleged, it is not substantially\n    related to the privacy rights Defendants raise.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    To be sure,\n    <em>\n     Whitaker\n    </em>\n    and the Fourth Circuit in\n    <em>\n     Grimm I\n    </em>\n    both acknowledged that bodily privacy is a \"legitimate and important interest.\"\n    <em>\n     Grimm I\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054700\" index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/709/\">\n     822 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    723 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Whitaker\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1047\">\n     858 F.3d at 1052\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (recognizing that the school district \"has a legitimate interest in ensuring bathroom privacy rights are protected\").

Defendants attempt to distinguish\n    <em>\n     Whitaker\n    </em>\n    's holding by emphasizing that the policy at issue in that case related to access to restrooms, instead of the locker room access at issue here. Nonetheless,\n    <em>\n     Whitaker\n    </em>\n    's reasoning applies with similar force. No allegations in the Complaint suggest that the High School's boys' locker room is \"particularly susceptible to an intrusion upon an individual's privacy.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"271\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1047\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    In fact, the boys' locker room here has partitioned stalls for changing clothes and stalls that have toilets and stall doors. (Compl. \u00b6 48). And the single-use restrooms Defendants require M.A.B. to change in are available as well. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 31, 32, 45).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Like in\n    <em>\n     Whitaker\n    </em>\n    , then, students \"who have true privacy concerns are able to utilize a stall\" to change in.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"272\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1047\">\n     858 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1052 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Grimm I\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054700\" index=\"273\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/709/\">\n     822 F.3d at 729\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Davis, J., concurring) (observing that if a student objects to using the restroom in the presence of a transgender student, \"all students have access to the single-stall restrooms\"). Thus, Defendants' argument that permitting M.A.B. to use the boys' locker room amounts to \"government compulsion of students to expose their bodies and to be exposed to the bodies of students of the opposite [birth] sex\" is misplaced. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss at 27, ECF No. 36-1).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    The presence of single-use restrooms and stalls in the boys' locker room is not enough to assuage Defendants' privacy concerns. They assert that if M.A.B. changing clothes in the designated restrooms makes him feel humiliated and embarrassed, as well as alienated from his peers, then students who use those restrooms for greater privacy will feel the same way. Defendants' argument is flawed for at least four reasons.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    First, unlike a boy who decides to change clothes in a single-use restroom or stall for greater privacy, barring M.A.B. from changing in the boys' locker room harms his health and well-being. M.A.B. has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, whose treatment requires \"social transitioning.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25, 26). This includes accessing single-sex spaces, like locker rooms, that align with his gender identity. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 25). Barring M.A.B. from accessing the boys' locker room interferes with his social transitioning. Second, Defendants' argument overlooks the very existence of the Policy. It\n    <em>\n     requires\n    </em>\n    M.A.B. to change\n    his clothes in the designated restrooms, against his doctor's medical advice, and M.A.B. risks discipline if he does not comply. Conversely, boys who have privacy concerns have the\n    <em>\n     option\n    </em>\n    of changing clothes in a single-use restroom or stall if they want greater privacy.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Third, their argument further overlooks the entire context surrounding the Policy. It singles M.A.B. out, quite literally because it does not apply to anyone else at the High School, and marks him as different for being transgender. On the contrary, a boy who makes the personal choice to change clothes in a single-use restroom or stall does not experience any such singling out at the hands of his school.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Grimm I\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054700\" index=\"274\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/709/\">\n     822 F.3d at 729\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Davis, J., concurring) (\"For other students, using the single-stall restrooms carries no stigma whatsoever, whereas for [the transgender plaintiff], using those same restrooms is tantamount to humiliation and a continuing mark of difference among his fellow students.\"). Fourth, even if some boys feel humiliated, embarrassed, or alienated for deciding to change clothes in a single-use restroom or stall, changing there still serves Defendants' privacy concerns because those boys still enjoy greater privacy. Defendants do not explain how preventing such ill feelings further the privacy rights of any students.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Because Defendants contend that they may bar M.A.B. from the boys' locker room completely-despite the presence of single-use restrooms or stalls-by implication, Defendants are arguing that the presence of M.A.B. in the boys' locker room-itself-is what infringes on the privacy rights of other boys.\n    <footnotemark>\n     16\n    </footnotemark>\n    Defendants do not provide any explanation for why completely barring M.A.B. from the boys' locker room protects the privacy of other boys changing there, while the availability of single-use restrooms or locker room stalls does not. Nor does the Court find any. M.A.B.'s presence in the boys' locker room \"provides no more of a risk to other students' privacy rights than the presence of an overly curious student of the same biological sex who decides to sneak glances at his or her classmates\" while they change their clothes.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Whitaker\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"275\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1047\">\n     858 F.3d at 1052\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . So, as in\n    <em>\n     Whitaker\n    </em>\n    , preventing M.A.B. from changing clothes in the boys' locker room \"does nothing to protect the privacy rights\" of students at the High School.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"276\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1047\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    Finally, just as in\n    <em>\n     Whitaker\n    </em>\n    , if Defendants were concerned that children with different-looking anatomies were changing clothes in the locker room together, \"then it would seem that separate [locker rooms] also would be appropriate for pre-pubescent and post-pubescent children who do not look alike anatomically.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1047\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1047\">\n     at 1052-53\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
