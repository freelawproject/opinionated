Section 405(g) seeking review of a final decision of Defendant Nancy A. Berryhill, the acting Commissioner of Social Security (the \"Commissioner\"). (Compl., Docket Entry No. 1.) Plaintiff challenged the Commissioner's determination that he earned income in the amount of $15,922.54 in 2008, while he was collecting disability insurance benefits. By Memorandum and Order dated March 22, 2016, the Court granted the Commissioner's motion for judgment on the pleadings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pryor v. Comm'r of Soc.

Plaintiff asserted that he had not worked \"[d]uring the tax years 2008 through 2011\" and had only collected disability insurance benefits, and therefore, wages earned from Parking Systems were erroneously attributed to his name and social security number.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2.

Plaintiff explains that he filed the motion \"[b]ecause all the evidence was denied in the U.S. Court of Appeals without any reason.\" (Pl. Mot. 2.) In addition, Plaintiff states that he did not have the \"new evidence\" when he first appeared before the Court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)

In support of the motion, Plaintiff has submitted several documents as \"new evidence\" for the Court to consider: (1) an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) identity theft affidavit dated November 30, 2016; (2) an IRS notice stating that Plaintiff's claim of identity theft had been verified dated May 15, 2017; (3) IRS letters purporting to confirm Plaintiff's claim of identity theft dated September 18, 2017; and (4) a google printout of 225 Clarkson Avenue Parking.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Pl.

However, the IRS documents dated November 30, 2016 and May 15, 2017, at most, acknowledge that Plaintiff had filed a claim for identify theft and are also duplicative of similar documents the Court considered in its March 22, 2016 Order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pryor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201171589\">\n    2016 WL 1171589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Teamsters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11107847\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/247/370/#p392\">\n    247 F.3d at 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he evidence must not be merely cumulative.\"). In addition, Plaintiff fails to articulate the evidentiary value of the google printout, describing the document as \"a copy of who r [sic] on 225 Clarkson Ave in Brooklyn.\" (Pl Mot. 4.) On its face, the printout only lists various businesses at the inputted address. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11107847\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/247/370/#p392\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) These three documents do not support Plaintiff's contention that he was a victim of identity theft, and therefore do not support Plaintiff's claim that he did not receive income from working for Parking Systems in 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Finally, although the IRS letters dated September 18, 2017 state that an \"investigation confirm[ed]\" that Plaintiff was a victim of identity theft and that the IRS was \"in the process of removing the fraudulent income ... for years 2007 through 2012,\" these letters do not undermine the Court's conclusion that the ALJ's decision was supported by substantial evidence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. September 21, 2017 Letter at 2-5.) Despite finding the failure of the IRS to \"ma[ke] adjustments to Plaintiff's 2008 income after receiving the June 2013 Identity Theft Affidavit\" probative, the Court relied on a variety of other evidence in reaching its decision, including an eyewitness observation by Special Agent Neisha\n   Samaroo of Plaintiff operating a toll booth at Park Systems.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pryor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201171589\">\n    2016 WL 1171589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3-5. Furthermore, the letters are unclear as to whether the IRS will make adjustments to Plaintiff's 2008 earnings, which are at issue in this case. On the subject line, the letters specify that the tax years are \"Dec. 31, 2011\" and \"Dec. 31, 2012.\" (Pl. September 21, 2017 Letter at 2, 4.) Plaintiff himself states that the letters are \"about correcting the earning for the years 2011 and 2012.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.)

Although Plaintiff admits that he knew of the discrepancies as to his earnings since 2008, he failed to contact the IRS until March 27, 2012.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pryor\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201171589\">\n     2016 WL 1171589\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at *2. Further, after the IRS informed Plaintiff that \"no action was necessary\" on Plaintiff's account based on the information submitted, Plaintiff failed to take prompt action.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201171589\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Instead, the motion suggests that Plaintiff only sought to \"remove the years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, and 2009\" after speaking with the IRS Identity Theft Department on July 28, 2017. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl. Mot. 5-6.) Although Plaintiff had to wait for the IRS to investigate his claims, the facts suggest that Plaintiff may have been able to receive a determination before his Rule 60(b)(2) motion was time-barred if he had diligently pursued the options provided by the IRS.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    The only letter submitted by Plaintiff that appears to specifically address his 2008 earnings does not indicate that the IRS intended to make any adjustments. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl. September 19, 2017 Letter at 8.) Instead, the IRS letter dated September 15, 2017, states that Plaintiff's \"accounts are now correct\" and that he does not \"need to take further action.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201171589\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
