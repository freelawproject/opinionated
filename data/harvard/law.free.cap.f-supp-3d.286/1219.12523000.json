On August 23, 2017, a grand jury charged Mr. Fox with one count of failing to register as required under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (\"SORNA\"). Mr. Fox now challenges this indictment, arguing that SORNA is unconstitutional. The government has filed a response to Mr. Fox's motion (Doc. 12). On January 4, 2018, the court held a hearing and took this motion under advisement. The court is ready to rule. For reasons explained below, the court denies Mr. Fox's Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

As required by various state sexual offender registration laws, he registered as a sex offender at least three times: on April 5, 2010 in Sedgwick County, Kansas; on May 18, 2010, in Colorado Springs, Colorado; and on October 11, 2010 in Lee County, Mississippi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In August 2017, deputies from the United States Marshals Service (USMS) were advised\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   that Lee County, Mississippi had issued a warrant for Mr. Fox for failing to register as a sex offender. According to the deputies' information, Mr. Fox was living in Marysville, Kansas. On August 16, 2017, the deputies contacted Marysville law enforcement officials and showed them Mr. Fox's photograph. The Marysville officials\n   advised that they believed they had spoken with Mr. Fox earlier that summer. And USMS deputies discovered that someone added Mr. Fox's name to a Westar Energy account in Marysville on June 20, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   That day, USMS deputies arrested Mr. Fox on the Mississippi warrant.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In his Motion to Dismiss, Mr. Fox argues that SORNA is unconstitutional for four reasons. First, he argues that SORNA violates the First Amendment's compelled speech doctrine. Second, he asserts that SORNA violates the Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause. Third, he contends that SORNA impermissibly delegates legislative authority to the Attorney General. And last, he argues that Congress exceeded its enumerated powers when it enacted SORNA. The court addresses these four arguments in subsections A through D, below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. First Amendment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mr. Fox's first argument contends that SORNA violates the First Amendment because it forces him to speak. Specifically,\n   he argues that SORNA forces him to declare that he is a dangerous person and forces him to reveal facts that he would prefer to keep secret. In general, the First Amendment \" 'prohibits the government from telling people what they must say.' \"\n   <em>\n    Agency for Int'l Dev. v.

SORNA protects the public by allowing the general public and state law enforcement to track sex offenders who move from another state. It does so by compiling information from every state about convicted sex offenders into a national database, creating national minimum standards for the type of information states must collect, and requiring convicted sex offenders to provide that information to state officials when they move to a\n   new state.

Reg. at 38,045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The only speech compelled by SORNA is facts that provide the public and state law enforcement officials with the necessary information to track them effectively. The identifying information that SORNA requires sex offenders to provide enables law enforcement to locate the offenders,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , name, social security number, certain addresses they frequent, and international travel plans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020914\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 20914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). And it only requires them to disclose it when they move and to update the information periodically to ensure its accuracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court indicated that a mandatory reporting law like SORNA might be constitutional. As explained above, in\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   , North Carolina had passed a law requiring all professional fundraisers to disclose to potential donors what percentage of money they raised in the last year had gone to charity to inform donors fully about the use of the money they might donate.\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775217\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/781/#p798\">\n    487 U.S. at 785, 798\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775217\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/781/#p798\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

SORNA requires convicted sex offenders to disclose information to states who, in turn, publish that information in a database. It does not require sex offenders to declare their status to every person they meet. Yes, SORNA compelled Mr. Fox to speak. But the law serves a compelling government interest and does so in a narrowly tailored fashion. It does not offend the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Naturally, Mr. Fox disagrees. He argues that SORNA is not narrowly tailored. SORNA's purpose, according to Mr. Fox, is to protect children from violent predators. Mr. Fox does not contest that this is a compelling governmental interest but he argues that SORNA is not narrowly tailored to serve that purpose. He argues that the law is overbroad because it applies to non-violent sex offenders as well as violent predators. And the law does not require the Attorney General to prove that a sex offender is violent before requiring him to register. He contends that Congress could have tailored the law more narrowly by requiring the Attorney General to prove that a sex offender is dangerous before requiring the offender to register.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The court disagrees with Mr. Fox's characterization of SORNA's goal. For one, SORNA does not label sex offenders as dangerous-it labels them as convicted sex offenders. And SORNA's statement of purpose does not single out violent predators of children.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020901\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 20901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, its expressed goal is to protect the public \"from sex offenders\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   offenders against children,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   in response to the vicious attacks by violent predators ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020901\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The court concludes that SORNA provides law enforcement officials and the public with information about sex offenders to further these goals directly. SORNA survives strict scrutiny and does not infringe on Mr. Fox's First Amendment rights improperly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Ex Post Facto\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Mr. Fox next argues that prosecuting him for failing to register under SORNA when the offense he originally was convicted for occurred before SORNA's effective date-2006-violates the\n   Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause. To violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, the law \" 'must apply to events occurring before its enactment' and 'must disadvantage the offender affected by it.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Instead, the Circuit reasoned that the only conduct SORNA punishes is failing to register-an offense occurring after 2006.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1333.

Namely, Mr. Fox argues that the SORNA-mandated disclosures require him to affirm a political or ideological belief and also require him to serve as a moving billboard for a governmentally-sponsored ideological message. Doc. 9 at 17. But saying something is so does not make it so. SORNA merely requires Mr. Fox to provide factual information about himself and the record of his sex conviction. This is not the kind of ideological content discussed in\n    <em>\n     Barnette\n    </em>\n    .\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"366560\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/319/624/\">\n     319 U.S. at 632\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"366560\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/319/624/\">\n     63 S.Ct. 1178\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
