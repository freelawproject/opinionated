INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Harriett Ames is the former Chief of the Personnel Security Branch within the Federal Emergency Management Agency. As head of the Personnel Security Branch, Plaintiff's responsibilities included adjudicating security clearances for employees. Following events that began with agency management stripping her Branch of some of its adjudicatory responsibilities and ended with her reassignment to a different unit, Plaintiff filed suit against Defendants under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution, alleging both retaliation and race, color, and gender discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This court previously dismissed Plaintiff's Equal Protection claim but deferred decision on whether\n   <em>\n    Department of Egan v.

At the motion to dismiss stage, the court reasoned, it was too early to determine whether adjudicating Plaintiff's claims would require an evaluation of the merits of her security clearance decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Now before the court is Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. After considering the record and the parties' briefs, the court concludes that Plaintiff has put forth sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment as to one of the three agency decisions underlying her claims-her reassignment. The court enters judgment in favor of Defendant with respect to the other two decisions at issue-stripping Plaintiff's Branch of security clearance adjudication responsibilities and temporarily transferring another agency employee into the Branch. The court therefore grants in part and denies in part Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following facts are undisputed, except where noted. Plaintiff Harriett Ames, a dark-skinned African-American woman, is the former Chief of the Personnel Security Branch at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (\"FEMA\"), a sub-agency within the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"). Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 73 [hereinafter Def.'s Mot.], Def.'s Stmt. of Material Facts in Dispute, ECF No. 73-1 [hereinafter Def.'s Stmt.], \u00b6 1; Pl.'s Statement of Material\n   Facts, ECF No. 78 [hereinafter Pl.'s Stmt.], Exs., ECF No. 78-1 [hereinafter Pl.'s Exs.], at 81, \u00b6 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Personnel Security Branch is a component of the Program Protection Division, which is within FEMA's Office of the Chief Security Officer (\"OCSO\"). Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6 2. As head of the Branch, Plaintiff was responsible for \"adjudicating [security] clearances of employees and prospective employees\" within FEMA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl., ECF No. 29 [hereinafter Am. Compl.], \u00b6 19; Def.'s Mot., Exs. 1-5, ECF No. 73-4 [hereinafter Def.'s Exs. 1-5], at 4, \u00b6 10;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot., Def.'s Mem. of Points &amp; Authorities, ECF No. 73-2 [hereinafter Def.'s Mem.], at 20-21; Pl.'s Opp'n to Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 76 [hereinafter Pl.'s Opp'n], at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In April 2011, the Personnel Security Branch adjudicated security clearances for Gary Walker and James Bland, two employees hired to work for FEMA OCSO as \"Supervisory Fraud Manager[s].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 14;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Exs. 1-5 at 13-18, 24. Plaintiff determined that Bland and Walker's positions would require \"SS.\" Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6 7; Def.'s Exs. 1-5 at 21. \"SS\" means \"Special Sensitive,\" a term that designates a position as requiring access to \"Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information\" (\"TS/SCI\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 13-14;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Stmt., Pl.

J., ECF No. 80 [hereinafter Def.'s Reply], Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Counter-Statement of Material Facts, ECF No. 80-1 [hereinafter Def.'s Reply Stmt.], at 4-5. \"Top secret\" clearance is the highest level of security clearance. Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6 15. Plaintiff approved a \"secret\" interim clearance status for Walker in April 2011 and requested an \"EOD\" (entry of duty) for him before he completed his \"e-QIP,\" a web-based automated system designed to facilitate the processing of investigative forms used when conducting background investigations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Def.'s Exs. 1-5 at 21, 24; Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6 8 n.2. Plaintiff also approved a \"secret\" interim clearance status for Bland in May 2011 and requested an EOD for him before a full background investigation was completed. Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 13, 16-17; Pl.'s Exs. at 90, \u00b6 79. Neither Plaintiff nor the Personnel Security Branch granted \"interim\n   <em>\n    top\n   </em>\n   secret clearance\" to any FEMA employees or hires, including Walker and Bland.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Some months later, Bland's and Walker's security clearances would come under scrutiny. In July 2011, the DHS Office of Inspector General (\"OIG\") conducted an investigation into FEMA OCSO's hiring and security clearance adjudication practices. Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6 21; Def.'s Mot., Exs. 9-14, ECF No. 73-5 [hereinafter Def.'s Exs. 9-14], at 16, \u00b6 3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23, \u00b6 13;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Stmt., Pl. Fact \u00b6\u00b6 40-42. During this timeframe, then-FEMA Associate Administrator David Garratt learned about the security clearance adjudications of Walker and Bland, both of whom were granted favorable adjudications despite\n   past transgressions. Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6 22;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Exs. 9-14 at 26-27, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5. On July 22, 2011, Garratt suspended FEMA OCSO from adjudicating security clearances for its own hires and employees. Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6 26; Def.'s Exs. 9-14 at 28;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 20. Because Garratt did not see any evidence of potentially compromised adjudication practices for FEMA hires outside of OCSO, he still permitted the Branch to adjudicate security clearances for non-OCSO personnel. Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 25, 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In light of the issues surrounding the Personnel Security Branch, including the then-ongoing OIG investigation, the DHS Chief Security Officer at the time, Gregory Marshall, ordered that a Security Compliance Review (\"SCR\") be conducted on the Personnel Security Branch and other FEMA security branches.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-31. The SCR was conducted in August 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. It resulted in 16 findings critical of the Personnel Security Program, whose day-to-day operations were run by Plaintiff, and an overall rating of \"unsatisfactory\" for the Program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-38;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Exs. 9-14 at 3-14. During that same month, Plaintiff told Jose Cantu, her first-line supervisor, that there was a backlog of 3,500 suitability/public-trust investigations that were awaiting adjudication but not reported \"on the metrics.\" Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6 56. Several weeks later, on September 8, 2011, Plaintiff sent an e-mail to Cantu and Jose Salazar, her second-line supervisor, stating that she was overwhelmed with deadlines and was experiencing headaches and chest pains, making it increasingly difficult to work under such conditions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 57-58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Later in September 2011, agency management detailed Alfreda Hester, an African-American woman and employee from DHS headquarters, to serve as a deputy to Cantu.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64-64A, 66. Her position title was \"Deputy Division Director for Program Protection Division.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66. Hester took over Plaintiff's duties adjudicating security clearances, representing the Branch in personnel security meetings and senior staff meetings, approving leave requests, and scheduling training.

First and foremost, the action taken against the Personnel Security Branch was not based strictly on Plaintiff's failure to follow agency policy forbidding interim clearances. Rather, the record evidence shows that the broader concern was that the security clearance adjudicatory process within Plaintiff's Branch had been compromised-a concern that arose when Garratt learned of the then-ongoing OIG investigation into the questionable adjudications of Walker and Bland.

In\n   <em>\n    Ryan\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs focused on the agency's adherence to the procedures used to make the clearance decisions, as opposed to the denials themselves.

A reasonable juror could not. The \"adverse\" action in question was directed not at Plaintiff alone, but at the\n   <em>\n    entire Branch\n   </em>\n   . Plaintiff cites no case for the proposition that an action taken against a group of people can be bootstrapped into an adverse action against an individual, and the court is aware of none. Moreover, the July restriction of adjudicatory authority is not \"categorically\" adverse, thus requiring Plaintiff\n   to show objectively tangible harm. But Plaintiff fails to present any evidence of such harm. She does not, for instance, claim that the suspension affected her pay or grade. While Plaintiff's declaration asserts that the suspension \"made it appear that [she] was somehow involved in unspecified wrongdoing,\" Pl.'s Exs. at 84, \u00b6 30, such alleged harm is little more than a reputational injury, which is not actionable,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stewart v.

September Detail of Ms. Hester\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The court turns next to the September 2011 decision to detail Ms. Hester to the Personnel Security Branch. According to Plaintiff, the detail resulted in Hester effectively replacing Plaintiff as Chief of the Branch. For the reasons stated below, while the court finds that\n   <em>\n    Egan\n   </em>\n   does not preclude review of Plaintiff's claims premised on the September detail, these claims fail on the merits because no reasonable jury could find that the reasons proffered by the agency were pretext for discrimination or retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Justiciability of Plaintiff's Title VII Claims Under\n   </em>\n   Egan\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The court begins its\n   <em>\n    Egan\n   </em>\n   inquiry by identifying the reasons proffered by the agency for the September 2011 detail of Hester. Those reasons have varied, albeit slightly. In its Motion, Defendant states that Hester was detailed \"to address two equally important concerns that arose at th[e] time,\" which \"formed the bases for the detail\": \"the shortcomings identified in the SCR\" and \"the thousands of backlogged cases awaiting clearance adjudication.\" Def.'s Mem. at 28;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6 60 (stating that Clifford Oliver, the then-Acting Chief of FEMA OCSO, \"decided to reach out to DHS OCSO for help\" \"[d]ue to the workload and stress experienced by the Personnel Security Branch and given the results of the SCR\"). Those reasons are corroborated by contemporaneous e-mails among Plaintiff's superiors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot., Exs. 15-23, ECF No. 73-6 [hereinafter Def.'s Exs. 15-23], at 2. By contrast, Defendant's supplemental interrogatory response offers a narrower reason: \"[T]he decision was made because of concerns that Ms. Ames and the Personnel Security Branch had improperly granted security clearances.\" Pl.'s Exs. at 22. Nowhere do Defendant's interrogatory responses identify a backlog of security clearances as a reason for the detail.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-13, 22-23, 29-30, 43-44, 53-55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendant contends that there is no inconsistency among these rationales for Hester's detail because, among its 16 findings, the SCR found that the Personnel Security Branch had improperly granted interim security clearances and that the processing of clearances was not in accordance with federal regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Exs. 9-14 at 10. In light of that finding, Defendant argues, the predictive security risk assessment at the heart of\n   <em>\n    Egan\n   </em>\n   is necessarily implicated, thereby barring review of the decision to transfer Hester into Plaintiff's Branch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendant's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Egan\n   </em>\n   cannot, however, be sustained on this record at the summary judgment stage. What role, if any, Plaintiff's erroneous security clearance determinations played in the decision to temporarily assign Hester to the Branch is unclear. True, the SCR makes reference to erroneous or improper processing of security clearances, but it does so only in two of 16 different administrative and management deficiencies identified within the Personnel Security Program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Exs. 9-14 at 3-14;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 37-55. Indeed, the majority of the SCR addresses problems with Branch management that have nothing to do with security risk assessments.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Def.'s Exs. 9-14 at 8 (negative comments by interviewed personnel regarding management and work environment);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 (management is inaccessible and can be abrupt, demeaning, and abusive at times);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (morale at extremely low level);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 (unrealistic metric/statistical units of production for adjudicative staff);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (poor communication due to inconsistencies in management's delivery of policy and guidance to staff);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9, 13 (inexperience of adjudication staff);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 (staff would benefit from training but requests are denied or they receive no response from management);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (staff not always utilized to its strengths);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13 (written policy frequently old, incomplete, and inaccurate);\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 40, 42, 46-52, 54. Other problems concern the Branch's failure to adjudicate clearances in a timely manner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Exs. 9-14 at 9 (FEMA not meeting adjudication timelines mandated by federal law);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10 (backlog of 4,200 cases awaiting adjudication);\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 41, 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In view of the breadth of the SCR's criticisms, the court cannot find at this stage, as a matter of law, that\n   <em>\n    Egan\n   </em>\n   precludes review of the decision to detail Hester to the Personnel Security Branch. If in fact the SCR prompted Hester's detail, it does not necessarily follow that\n   <em>\n    Egan\n   </em>\n   precludes review of that decision, as many of the report's critiques have nothing to do with predictive judgments about security risk assessments. Therefore, the court finds that there remains a material dispute of fact as to whether\n   <em>\n    Egan\n   </em>\n   precludes review of the decision to assign Hester to the Personnel Security Branch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Adverse Employment Action\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   As with the July suspension, Defendant also claims that Plaintiff did not suffer adverse employment action as a result of the September detail. Def.'s Mem. at 3, 21-22. The September detail at issue here does not involve hiring, firing, or failure to promote. After all, Plaintiff at least nominally\n   retained her title of Chief of the Personnel Security Branch, as well as her status as a GS-14 level employee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Correction at 3. Plaintiff further admits that her salary even increased during the time of the detail.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, Plaintiff relies instead on the change in her duties after Hester's detail, which she alleges resulted in her effective displacement as Chief of the Branch.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \"[W]ithdrawing an employee's supervisory duties\" or reassigning an employee with \"significantly different responsibilities\" can constitute an adverse employment action, but the inquiry is necessarily fact-bound.\n   <em>\n    Czekalski v.

Yet, Plaintiff does not merely allege that she was unable to attend certain meetings or receive certain communications, like the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Forkkio\n   </em>\n   .

The record contains an e-mail dated September 2, 2011, from Oliver, then-Acting Chief of FEMA OCSO, which states that the person designated to the Branch-who ended up being Hester-\"will have\n   <em>\n    complete authority\n   </em>\n   of the Personnel Security Program.

Thus, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the court finds a reasonable jury could find that the September detail was materially adverse for purposes of Plaintiff's discrimination claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Czekalski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3753162,3561423\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/475/360/\">\n    475 F.3d at 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Whether a particular reassignment of duties constitutes an adverse action for purposes of Title VII is generally a jury question.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The same result follows for Plaintiff's retaliation claim.

As already discussed, there is a factual dispute with regard to the consequences of the September detail.

Accordingly, the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   burden-shifting framework is no longer relevant, and the central question is whether a reasonable jury could find that the legitimate reason proffered by Defendant is not the actual reason and that Defendant intentionally discriminated or retaliated against her on the basis of race, color, or gender.

To begin, to the extent Defendant proffers different explanations for why it assigned Hester to the Personnel Security Branch, those differences are slight, giving rise to only a weak inference of pretext. As Defendant points out, the SCR clearly criticizes the Branch for granting security clearances not in accordance with federal regulations, which is the very reason Defendant put forth in its interrogatory responses for the detail. Moreover, the additional reason for the detail now proffered by Defendant, i.e., to address the backlog of security investigations, is rooted in undisputed record evidence. It is not cut from whole cloth for the purposes of litigation. There was a significant backlog of security clearance adjudications in the Personnel Security\n   Branch; the SCR did criticize the Branch for that backlog; and the backlog was cited in contemporaneous e-mails as a reason for Hester's transfer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Exs. at 85, \u00b6 37.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Exs. 9-14 at 3-14. Indeed, on the very day that Plaintiff complained to her first-line supervisor, Jose Cantu, that her workload was causing her significant stress, Oliver wrote to Cantu: \"With the disaster activity and the results of the SCR, I am aware of the recent workload and stress the personnel security program is under.\" Def.'s Exs. 15-23 at 2. To address the problem, Oliver indicated that he would be assigning \"a current DHS personnel security manager\" to FEMA-who turned out to be Hester-and hiring contractors to help with the workload.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413371\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/133/#p142\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Oliver signed off: \"I believe that the combination of these two actions is an appropriate response to Harriett's concerns raised in her e-mail to you. Please pass along my concern to Harriet concerning health and the steps I am directing be taken to support her.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413371\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/133/#p142\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Oliver's words and actions undermine any reasonable inference of discrimination. Thus, while the proffered explanation in Defendant's briefing is more fulsome than that set forth in its interrogatory responses, no reasonable jury could find that the more fulsome explanation is pretext for discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Geleta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3557307,5652597\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/645/408/\">\n    645 F.3d at 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that the employer's reasons had changed over time and were thus probative of pretext where an official initially told the plaintiff to make up a reason for his reassignment, and the defendants later stated instead that the program plaintiff directed was dismantled and then again shifted to say the employer decided to create a new vision for the program).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Additional record evidence, in the form of Plaintiff's own testimony, supports the court's conclusion. Plaintiff testified that after she was investigated by DHS OIG in 2011, and refused to re-adjudicate a case, \"the chain of events just started happening,\" and her \"duties were taken away,\" \"\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   they wanted [her] to ... re-adjudicate a case, and [she] refused to do it.\" Notice of Correction at 4. Thus, Plaintiff admits that her own conduct set in motion the course of events leading to Hester's designation to the Branch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Finally, and perhaps most critically, the person Plaintiff claims effectively replaced her, Hester, is herself an African-American female.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6 66; Pl.'s Stmt., Def.

Cir. 2005). Thus, the court finds that no reasonable jury could conclude that the real reason for the September detail was race, color, or gender discrimination or retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Accordingly, the court grants Defendant's Summary Judgment Motion with respect to Plaintiff's Title VII discrimination and retaliation claims based on the September detail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    C. November Removal and Reassignment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Finally, the court turns to Defendant's decision to remove Plaintiff from her position as Chief of the Personnel Security Branch and to reassign her as head of the Training Section. For the reasons stated below, the court not only finds that\n   <em>\n    Egan\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable to Plaintiff's Title VII claims based on the reassignment, but also holds that there is sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable jury could conclude that the reassignment was adverse and that Defendant's proffered reasons for that decision were pretext for discrimination and retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Justiciability of Plaintiff's Title VII Claims Under\n   </em>\n   Egan\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The question whether\n   <em>\n    Egan\n   </em>\n   bars judicial review of Plaintiff's Title VII claims predicated\n   on her reassignment turns on whether Defendant's proffered explanation for that action involves a predictive judgment about security risk. It does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As with the September detail, Defendant has proffered different reasons for its November reassignment decision. In its interrogatory responses, for example, Defendant states that Salazar made the decision to reassign Plaintiff due to concerns about the improper adjudication of security clearances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Exs. at 23.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Now in its Motion, Defendant claims that a series of other individuals participated in the decision both to remove Plaintiff as Chief of the Branch and to reassign her to a different position, citing broad reasons relating to the SCR as the basis for its decision-namely, that Plaintiff failed to accept the results of the SCR and impeded Defendant's efforts to address the shortcomings identified therein.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Def.'s Mem. at 3, 9, 30;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Stmt., \u00b6\u00b6 89-90. It ought to be plain by now that\n   <em>\n    Egan\n   </em>\n   does not necessarily preclude review of such reasons for an employment decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rattigan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3501640,5869853\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/689/764/\">\n    689 F.3d at 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"it is our duty not only to follow\n   <em>\n    Egan\n   </em>\n   , but also to preserv[e] to the maximum extent possible Title VII's important protections against workplace discrimination and retaliation\" (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Because a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that security-clearance concerns had little, or nothing at all, to do with the decision to reassign Plaintiff, the court cannot conclude at this stage as a matter of law that Plaintiff's discrimination claims premised on the November reassignment are non-justiciable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Adverse Employment Action\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Next, Defendant argues that the November reassignment does not constitute a material adverse action. Defendant points out that Plaintiff retained her GS-14 level and her title as \"Chief.\" Def.'s Mem. at 22. It also asserts that the transfer did not result in a reduction of Plaintiff's responsibilities. In support, Defendant points to Salazar's \"Memorandum of Record,\" which it claims Plaintiff refused to accept, stating that \"Plaintiff would serve as the 'primary supervisor' over an expansive security education and training program portfolio.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3501640,5869853\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/689/764/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing Def.'s Exs. 24-30 at 14-16);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 103-04. Defendant also points to Salazar's Declaration, Def.'s Mem. at 22, which describes the duties of Plaintiff's Training Section position as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   [T]he duties [of Plaintiff's job series] involved the management, supervision, and performance of work in: (1) developing, evaluating, maintaining, and/or operating systems, policies, training, devices, procedures, and methods used for safeguarding information, property, personnel, operations, and materials; and/or (2) developing and implementing policies and procedures for analyzing and evaluating the character, background, and history of employees, candidates for employment, and other persons\n   having or proposed to be granted access to classified or other sensitive information, materials, or work sites.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Def.'s Exs. 24-30 at 3, \u00b6 7. According to Defendant, this description shows Salazar \"envisioned Plaintiff performing functions\" of equal significance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 22-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Plaintiff, on the other hand, argues that her reassignment was materially adverse because her new position as Chief of the Training Section involved significantly different responsibilities, and her supervisory duties were eliminated or at least reduced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 17. In particular, Plaintiff contends that when she was reassigned to head the Training Section there was not \"any training section in existence, in the sense of a unit with employees.\" Pl.'s Stmt., Pl. Fact \u00b6 103. She further claims that at the time, \"there was not even a position description for the chief's job,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3501640,5869853\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/689/764/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , and that she was not provided with such a description until long after her meeting with Salazar in November 2011,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Exs. 91-92, \u00b6 89 (\"[Salazar] stated [a position description] was forthcoming, however I did not receive a new Standard Form action until February ....\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 181-82 (Salazar deposition). In this vein, Plaintiff also disputes that she refused to allow Salazar to issue her the \"Memorandum of Record.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Stmt., Def. Fact \u00b6 89, Pl. Fact \u00b6 90. Moreover, as to the position description itself, Plaintiff notes that there was nothing in the description (or Salazar's declaration) indicating that she would supervise anyone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Stmt., Pl. Fact \u00b6 105. Finally, Plaintiff claims that, even if she retained some supervisory authority, the position of Chief of the Training Section was a \"substantially different job,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 17, and that she had no experience in training staff or managing a training program,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Exs. at 91, \u00b6 87-88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   As discussed above, a lateral transfer can constitute a materially adverse action where the transfer involves the withdrawal of supervisory duties or reassignment with significantly different responsibilities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Czekalski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3753162,3561423\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/475/360/\">\n    475 F.3d at 364-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, Plaintiff has raised genuine factual disputes with respect to whether she lost supervisory duties and whether her position involved significantly different responsibilities. First, the parties disagree as to whether the training position was\n   <em>\n    in fact\n   </em>\n   a position with existing duties at the time of her reassignment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Exs. at 92, \u00b6 90 (\"As far as I could tell from what management told me, the training position would have few or no staff to supervise.\"). This factual dispute is material because if the Training Section was not staffed, then Defendant's contention that Plaintiff would be the \"primary supervisor\" of the Section is irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In addition, the parties disagree about whether the duties of the new position were substantially different than those Plaintiff performed as Chief of the Personnel Security Branch.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 86, \u00b6\u00b642-48 (describing some of Plaintiff's\n   duties as Chief of Personnel Security Branch),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Exs. 24-30 at 14-16 (Memorandum of Record).

Indeed, the title of the position was \"Chief of the Training Section.\" Defendant fails to address why the shift in the\n   <em>\n    nature\n   </em>\n   of the job responsibilities between the two pertinent positions-Chief of the Personnel Security Branch and Chief of the Training Section-was insignificant.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Exs. 24-30 at 4, \u00b6 7 (explaining why Salazar believed Plaintiff was qualified for the position based on her\n   <em>\n    previous\n   </em>\n   experience as a Federal Special Security Officer);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8 (stating that the work was \"just as significant,\" without any further comparison of the two positions' duties).

Unlike the September detail, however, the court finds that the inconsistencies in Defendant's reasons for Plaintiff's reassignment are far more pronounced and create a sufficient dispute of fact for the jury's consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Defendant's explanations for Plaintiff's reassignment have been a moving target. According to Plaintiff, when Salazar and Cantu informed her about the reassignment, they said that the decision was made \"to improve efficiencies of the office.\" Pl.'s Exs. at 91, \u00b6 89. They also demurred when Plaintiff asked if she had done something wrong-apparently, they never raised the issue of erroneous security clearances-and further told her that the training branch would be a \"good fit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4087058,12310092\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/1109/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A contemporaneous e-mail, however, suggests a different reason for the reassignment. On November 1, 2011, Kimberly Lew, DHS OCSO's Chief of Personnel Security Division, e-mailed Gregory Marshall, DHS's Chief Security Officer, to offer her observations and recommendations for improving the Personnel Security Branch.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Exs. 24-30 at 6-7. Lew did not mention \"efficiencies.\" Instead, she wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   [O]ur efforts to assist are moving at a slow pace. Harriett is still the driving force within the organization and we are constantly hitting road blocks. So my recommendation is to move Harriett to another security discipline within the office.

According to the Final Agency Decision, prepared at the conclusion of the internal EEO investigation: \"Management articulated legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for reassigning [Plaintiff] to the Training Branch. The [Program Protection Division Director] stated that he reassigned [Plaintiff] ... 'to improve efficiencies and effectiveness within [the Division] and to allow [Plaintiff] an opportunity to use [her] security skills within another unit of the OCSO.' \" FAD at 8. Once in litigation, that explanation faded away. Instead, Defendant's supplemental interrogatory response focused exclusively, and quite dramatically, on the concern that Plaintiff and the Personnel Security Branch had improperly granted security clearances that created an \"undue risk to national security.\" Pl.'s Exs. at 23. The interrogatory response said nothing about efficiencies, interfering with training efforts, or putting Plaintiff's skills to another use. Then, for purposes of summary judgment, the explanation shifted yet again. Defendant's newly proffered reason was \"to utilize [Plaintiff's] skill set and, more importantly, to remove an impediment to the efforts to address 'observations' identified in the SCR.\" Def.'s Mem. at 30-31. Each of the agency's declarants, including Salazar and Cantu, echoes this rationale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Exs. at 24-30 at 3, \u00b6 6 (Salazar Declaration) (\"I recommended to Mr. Oliver that Ms. Ames be reassigned ... because of her unwillingness to cooperate in implementing the mitigation plan under the SCR, among other reasons.\"); Def.'s Exs. 15-23 at 20, \u00b6 13 (Lew Declaration) (\"I also recommended that Ms. Ames be reassigned ... because she was impeding our efforts to address the issues in the SCR, including halting training efforts.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, \u00b68 (Cantu Declaration) (\"Based on the findings within the [SCR] ... as well as my personal observations that Ms. Ames was impeding our efforts to deal with the issues in the SCR, I made the decision to recommend that Ms. Ames be assigned ....\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Exs. 9-14 at 18, \u00b6 11 (Marshall Declaration); Def.'s Exs. 1-5 at 5, \u00b6 18 (Oliver Declaration). Not one of them attributes Plaintiff's reassignment, even in part, to her improper granting of security clearances that created an \"undue risk to national security.\" It may be, as Defendant contends, that the common thread running through these explanations is Plaintiff's impeding implementation of the SCR's recommendations. But that conclusion is better reached by the jury, not this court at the summary judgment stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Finally, record inconsistencies concerning who made the decision to reassign Plaintiff support her case for pretext. For example, in his EEO investigation affidavit, Cantu denied any participation in the reassignment decision. Pl.'s Stmt., Pl. Fact \u00b6 87; Def.'s Reply Stmt. at 1. Yet the record contains a memorandum issued by Cantu to Plaintiff dated November 21, 2011, which states, \"I have made the decision to reassign you ....,\" Def.'s Exs. 24-30 at 26, as well as evidence that Cantu told Oliver that he had decided to reassign Plaintiff,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Exs. 1-5 at 6, \u00b6 20 (Oliver declaration stating, \"[s]hortly after taking to him, Mr. Cantu emailed me and told me that he made the decision to recommend reassignment of Ms. Ames\"); Def.'s Exs. 24-30 at 22 (e-mail from Cantu to Oliver, stating Cantu had \"made the decision to recommend reassignment\" of Plaintiff and requesting favorable consideration of that decision);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23 (e-mail\n   from Cantu to Lew advising her that Plaintiff had been informed of her reassignment on the previous day and stating that he would like to introduce Nina Kirby as the acting Branch Chief). Defendant's Amended Answer attempts to clarify that Cantu did not make the decision but simply signed a letter from upper management,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Am. Answer \u00b6 48, and in its Motion Defendant continues to maintain that Cantu was not a decision maker,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply at 20. This may well be true. But a jury will have to decide whether Defendant's changing positions are merely innocent or proof of discriminatory motive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   With respect to Plaintiff's retaliation claim, the court finds that Plaintiff can proceed to trial. For the reasons already discussed, there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the agency's reason for the reassignment was pretext. Moreover, the record facts are sufficient to support a reasonable inference of causation. Plaintiff initiated contact with the EEO Counselor in August 2011 and filed a formal Complaint in October 2011.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAD at 2. The November reassignment occurred roughly two months later, on November 21, 2011. That temporal proximity is close enough to put the issue of causation to a jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamilton\n   </em>\n   , 666 F.3d at 1357-58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Thus, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is denied with respect to Plaintiff's discrimination and retaliation claims premised on her reassignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Plaintiff's Request to Reopen Discovery under Rule 56(d).\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In her Opposition, Plaintiff alternatively asks the court to deny Defendant's Motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d). Plaintiff claims that Defendant's answers to Plaintiff's interrogatories concerning the personnel who participated in the agency decision-making and the reasons for the three aforementioned decisions \"were radically different from the information provided in support of the summary judgment motion,\" and that such differences effectively barred her \"from follow-up written discovery and from taking the depositions of the officials whose affidavits the agency would ultimately rely on.\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 32. While she acknowledges that the \"natural remedy\" for such conduct would be to defer ruling on Defendant's Motion so that Plaintiff could take additional discovery, Plaintiff ultimately asks the court to deny the Motion in order to avoid rewarding Defendant for its conduct and further delaying resolution of the case.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, because she did not submit an affidavit or declaration along with her Opposition, as required by Rule 56(d), Plaintiff also moves for leave to file a one-sentence declaration of counsel, which simply says that the statements made by counsel regarding the Rule 56(d) request in Plaintiff's Opposition \"are true.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Request for Leave to File Decl. of Counsel, ECF No. 79 [hereinafter Request for Leave], at 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the following reasons, the court denies this request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Under Rule 56(d), if the nonmovant \"shows by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition, the court may: (1) defer considering the motion or deny it; (2) allow time to obtain affidavits or declarations or to take discovery; or (3) issue any other appropriate order.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d). A Rule 56(d) motion \"requesting time for additional discovery should be granted almost as a matter of course unless the non-moving party has not diligently pursued discovery of the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Convertino v.

Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). But merely invoking Rule 56(d) is not enough to defeat summary judgment. The party seeking relief under Rule 56(d) must submit a declaration stating with \"sufficient particularity\" why additional discovery is necessary.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3772206,5880430\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/684/93/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

Furthermore, while the court may consider the diligence of the party requesting relief, diligence alone is insufficient to satisfy Rule 56(d).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel.

The only remaining claim as to which additional discovery might be relevant is the September detail of Hester. As to that claim, however, the court's analysis accounted for the discrepancy in Defendant's reasons for that decision, yet the court decided based on the totality of the record that Plaintiff had come up short in demonstrating a genuine dispute of fact as to pretext. Thus, it is far from clear how additional discovery might alter the court's conclusion. Moreover, counsel's declaration does not state with \"sufficient particularity\" the facts he intends to discover.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Messina v. Krakower\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3453896,31229\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/439/755/\">\n    439 F.3d 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 762-63 (D.C. Cir. 2006). The declaration merely refers back to Plaintiff's opposition brief, which states that the new reasons offered in the summary judgment declarations \"bar[red] Ms. Ames from follow-up written discovery and from taking depositions of the officials whose affidavits the agency would ultimately rely on.\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 32;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Request for Leave at 3. That statement, however, is entirely conclusory and tells the court little about the facts Plaintiff proposes to discover. Accordingly, the court denies Plaintiff's request for relief under Rule 56(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the court grants in part and denies in part Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, and denies Plaintiff's Request for Leave to File Declaration of Counsel.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    Citations to Plaintiff's and Defendant's exhibits are to the page numbers electronically generated by CM/ECF.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Plaintiff admits that Defendant's evidence shows that she approved her staff's recommendation that \"FEMA comply with reciprocity requirements and recognize a secret clearance for Mr. Walker.\" Pl.'s Exs. at 91, \u00b6 84;\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Exs. 1-5 at 21 (e-mail from Plaintiff regarding EOD for Walker and Bland).

Thus, Defendant does not appear to dispute that some of Plaintiff's duties were transferred to Hester; rather, Defendant presumably seeks to clarify that Plaintiff retained her supervisory duties as Chief of the Branch after the September detail.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Although the court considers Plaintiff's argument, its factual premise is highly dubious. First, Plaintiff cannot seriously dispute the existence of the OIG investigation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ames v. U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290480\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/153/342/#p344\">\n     153 F.Supp.3d 342\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 344 (D.D.C. 2016) (noting that in August 2011, a senior special agent of the DHS OIG interviewed Plaintiff herself as part of an active investigation of Burt Thomas and the Bland/Walker adjudications). Second, Garratt's reasons for the July decision are not \"new,\" as Plaintiff claims.\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Exs. at 20-21, 27-28 (interrogatory responses),\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Exs. 9-14 at 26-27 (Garratt declaration). And while there are no contemporaneous records of Garratt's reasoning, there also are no records that contradict his story, nor any indication that he would have normally documented his reasoning. Finally, Plaintiff inaccurately characterizes the present record by stating that Salazar and Oliver (two officials who did not make the decision) were unaware of Garratt's reasoning.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n at 22, 25-26.

But the absence of a contemporaneous record does not create a conflict with Garratt's stated reasons, and Plaintiff's contention about the absence of knowledge by others is based entirely on her own speculation, not direct testimony from those persons.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290480\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/153/342/#p344\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (citing Pl.'s Stmt., Pl.

Here, Plaintiff's\n    <em>\n     temporary\n    </em>\n    replacement was a woman, Nina Kirby. The record does not, however, contain evidence as to the identity of Plaintiff's\n    <em>\n     permanent\n    </em>\n    replacement. Therefore, the strong inference against discrimination that applies when a replacement is of the same protected class does not necessarily apply here. A jury will have to decide what, if any, weight to give to the fact that Plaintiff was temporarily replaced by a woman.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    Citations to Plaintiff's Request for Leave are to the page numbers electronically generated by CM/ECF.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
