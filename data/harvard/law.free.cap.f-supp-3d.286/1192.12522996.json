The Court has certified this lawsuit as a class action encompassing all participants in, and beneficiaries of, certain retirement plans that had invested in a particular stable-value fund offered by Defendant (described in detail below).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Teets v. Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347508\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/315/362/#p374\">\n    315 F.R.D. 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 374 (D. Colo. 2016) (\"\n   <em>\n    Teets II\n   </em>\n   \"). Generally speaking, Plaintiff claims that Defendant has profited from this fund in a manner that violates ERISA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Currently before the Court is Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 181 (public entry); ECF No. 169 (supporting brief under Restricted Access) ), and also Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (ECF No. 182 (public entry); ECF No. 175 (supporting brief under Restricted Access) ). Defendant has filed an unopposed motion for oral argument on the parties' motions for summary judgment. (ECF No. 217.) The Court finds, however, that the parties' six merits briefs, along with a submission of supplemental authority (ECF No. 241), an amicus brief (ECF No. 178-1), and a response to the amicus brief (ECF No. 208), are more than enough to assist the Court in making its decision. Thus, the oral argument motion will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As for the motions themselves, Defendant's will be granted and Plaintiff's denied for the reasons explained below. The fourth pending motion in this case, Defendant's Motion to Decertify Class (ECF No. 180 (public entry); ECF No. 164 (supporting brief under Restricted Access) ), will accordingly be denied as moot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are undisputed unless attributed to a party, or otherwise noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff, a California resident, was a participant in the Farmers' Rice Cooperative 401(k) Savings Plan (\"Plan\"), a retirement plan sponsored by the Farmer's Rice Cooperative. (ECF No. 169 at 11, \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Plan contracted with Defendant for Defendant's recordkeeping, administrative, and investment services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17, \u00b6 30.) The named fiduciaries of the Plan (\"Plan Fiduciaries\"), who are not parties to this lawsuit, selected the investment options available to Plan participants such as Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) The Plan Fiduciaries selected, in total, twenty-nine investment options with a variety of risk and return characteristics. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   One of the investment options made available to Plaintiff and other Plan participants, and in which Plaintiff invested, was the Great-West Key Guaranteed Portfolio Fund (\"Fund\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18, \u00b6 34.) As the Fund's full name suggests, it is operated by Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12, \u00b6 7.) Formally speaking, the Plan entered into \"a Group Fixed Deferred Annuity Contract\" (\"Contract\") with Defendant, which establishes the terms on which Defendant offers the Fund to, and administers contributions to the Fund for, the Plan and its participants. (ECF No. 175 at 7, \u00b6 2;\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 179-1.) The major features of the Fund, as provided for in the Contract, are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 A guarantee to preserve principal and, once earned, interest. (ECF No. 169 at 12-14, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9, 13, 16.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 An interest rate, not to drop below 0%, that Defendant determines ahead of each coming quarter and then guarantees for the duration of that quarter (\"Credited Rate\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-10, 12; ECF No. 179-1 at 15.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 No fees or charges assessed against participants who withdraw any portion of their Fund balances (principal and/or accrued interest) at any time, including in the middle of a quarter. (ECF No. 169 at 13-14, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 The Plan's ability to leave the Fund (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , cease to offer it as an investment option to participants) without any surrender charge or market-value penalty, with the caveat that Defendant can delay transferring the Plan's Fund balance to the Plan for up to one year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14, \u00b6 19.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   During this one year, Plan participants may still withdraw their individual balances without fees or charges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In addition, although apparently not required by the Contract, Defendant has always announced the coming quarter's Credited Rate two business days in advance of that quarter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12, \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant has always fulfilled the Fund's guarantees. Investors have never suffered a loss of principal on their monies allocated to the Fund, and Defendant has always credited Fund participants with the Credited Rate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.) During the time period relevant to this lawsuit, the Credited Rate has been as high as 3.55% and as low as 1.1%. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18, \u00b6 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Although every Plan participant invested in the Fund owns his or her individual Fund balance, participants' contributions are not maintained in segregated accounts. Rather, Defendant deposits those contributions into its general account,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the account from which it satisfies all obligations to holders of all policies, be they traditional life insurance policies, investment contracts such as the Fund, or otherwise. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.) Defendant invests its entire general account in fixed income instruments and seeks to earn a return on those investments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Fund contributions are considered a part of what Defendant calls the \"MLTN portfolio,\" which is not a separate account but rather \"an 'internal allocation of assets' \" that Defendant uses to track the yield on investments made with Fund contributions and contributions to related products. (ECF No. 175 at 7-8, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.) Defendant attempts to earn revenue for itself on the MLTN portfolio. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After deducting expenses of offering the portfolio products, the Credited Rate is the most significant factor in determining whether Defendant will realize revenue for itself on the MLTN portfolio. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) This revenue-the difference between the portfolio's net investment yield and the Credited Rate-is known as the \"margin\" or the \"spread.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) Defendant sets the Credited Rate with an eye toward the margin it will earn based on that Credited Rate (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12, \u00b6 37), although it considers other factors as well, such as competitors' rates and other budget targets (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14, \u00b6\u00b6 40, 43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Although apparently not a feature of the Contract, Plaintiff claims that Defendant in practice prohibits retirement plans that offer the Fund from offering any fund that Defendant deems to be competing, such as another stable-value fund. (ECF No. 193 at 16, \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff asserts three claims for relief. Claims One and Two are inapplicable to Defendant unless Defendant is an ERISA fiduciary. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 47 \u00b6\u00b6 34-49.) Claim Three is potentially applicable regardless of whether Defendant is an ERISA fiduciary. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50-57.) Plaintiff has moved for summary judgment on the question of liability as to all three claims, and has also moved against all of Defendant's affirmative defenses, leaving only damages for trial. Defendant has cross-moved for summary judgment on all three of Plaintiff's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The analysis below will first address whether Defendant is an ERISA fiduciary (Part III.A), and then whether Defendant may still be liable as a nonfiduciary (Part III.B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Fiduciary Liability (Claims One and Two)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The GBP Exception\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    In General\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At the center of Claims One and Two is the allegation that Defendant failed to comply with ERISA's requirements for fiduciaries of plan assets. Under ERISA, a person is a \"fiduciary with respect to a[n employee benefit] plan to the extent (i) he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets * * * or (iii) he has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (21)(A). A fiduciary is required to \"discharge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and * * * for the exclusive purpose of: (i) providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries; and (ii) defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendant's primary summary judgment argument is that it is not a fiduciary with respect to the Fund because ERISA contains an exemption for a \"guaranteed benefit policy\" (\"GBP\"), meaning \"an insurance policy or contract to the extent that such policy or contract provides for benefits the amount of which is guaranteed by the insurer.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(B). The GBP exemption itself reads as follows: \"In the case of a plan to which a guaranteed benefit policy is issued by an insurer, the assets of such plan shall be deemed to include such policy, but shall not, solely by reason of the issuance of such policy, be deemed to include any assets of such insurer.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1101(b)(2). Defendant believes that Fund investments satisfy the GBP exemption, and so, in Defendant's view, it has no fiduciary responsibility toward Plaintiff when administering the Fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For reasons explained below, Defendant is correct that the Fund is a GBP. However, Defendant vastly overstates the scope of the GBP exemption. Thus, the Fund's status as a GBP turns out to be irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    The Court's Decision on this Question at the Motion-to-Dismiss Phase\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendant's argument that the Fund enjoys GBP status largely tracks the argument it advanced in a Rule 12(b)(6) motion at the outset of this case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 22.) The Court denied that motion, reasoning that it raised \"questions of fact more appropriate for consideration on summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Teets v. Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4361608\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/106/1198/#p1203\">\n    106 F.Supp.3d 1198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1203 (D. Colo. 2015) (\"\n   <em>\n    Teets I\n   </em>\n   \"). Although not spelled out in detail in the Court's opinion, the parties' cited case law convinced the Court that this case could turn on how Defendant administered the Contract in practice, regardless of its terms.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Assocs. in Adolescent Psychiatry, S.C. v.

Pa. 1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Through discovery, the parties have now developed evidence of Defendant's practices.

That is because the exception, by its terms, is quite limited: \"In the case of a plan to which a guaranteed benefit policy is issued by an insurer, the assets of such plan shall be deemed to include such policy, but shall not, solely by reason of the issuance of such policy, be deemed to include any assets of such insurer.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). Admittedly it may take several readings to understand this opaque language, but the meaning eventually becomes clear, particularly with the background understanding that life insurers have generally placed the proceeds used to purchase annuities into their general accounts, investing that money alongside all other money the life insurer has received:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [T]he serious ramifications of classifying general account assets as [ERISA] plan assets are quite clear.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   As a fiduciary, a life insurance company would be required under ERISA to manage its [entire] general account ... solely in the interest of participants and beneficiaries of employee benefit plan contractholders and for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to such participants and beneficiaries. However, ... the assets in the general account are derived from all classes of an insurer's business (i.e., life insurance, health insurance and annuities), and the principal functions which an insurer must perform in managing its business (the selection and control of risks, the investment and management of assets to support obligations with respect to such risks, and the distribution and allocation of surplus among policyholders) require the insurer to consider the interests of all of its contract holders, creditors and shareholders. Therefore, the application of ERISA's exclusive benefit rule would place an insurer in an untenable position of divided loyalties. Indeed, such a standard of conduct would directly conflict with the scheme of state insurance regulation which is designed to assure that an insurer maintain equity among its various constituencies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Stephen H.

Stated differently, the GBP exception essentially prohibits a plaintiff from claiming that the insurer breached its fiduciary duty by making imprudent choices when investing plan participants' contributions. But the contract by which the insurer obtained those contributions remains a part of the plan, and the insurer may still have fiduciary responsibilities in administering that contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051051\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/547/23/#p27\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (the GBP exception \"does not alter the fiduciary duties imposed on an insurer with respect to the management and administration of a plan as opposed to the oversight of investment policy\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Discretion as to Credited Rate Itself\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiff claims, correctly, that regardless of the GBP exception, the Contract is still part of the Plan and Defendant may have fiduciary responsibilities when it makes discretionary decisions regarding the Contract, such as setting the Credited Rate. (ECF No. 175 at 20-24.) To this, Defendant responds that the decision to set the Credited Rate is not an instance of \"discretionary authority,\" \"discretionary ... control,\" or \"discretionary responsibility\" that would trigger ERISA fiduciary status.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (21)(A)(i) &amp; (iii). This is so, according to Defendant, because it does not have \"the 'final say' \" on whether the Credited Rate will actually apply given that participants can withdraw their money from the Fund at any time without fees or charges. (ECF No. 189 at 24-28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   ERISA, by its terms, does not appear to turn on which party has the \"final say.\" Rather, it speaks in terms of exercising \"authority\" or \"control\" or \"responsibility,\" which-in some sense-Defendant undoubtedly does when it sets the Credited Rate. But Defendant is correct that there are a number of cases favoring the theory that a pre-announced rate of return prevents fiduciary status from attaching to the decision regarding the what rate to set, at least when the plan and/or its participants can \"vote with their feet\" if they dislike the new rate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The first such case is\n   <em>\n    Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. v.

First,\n   <em>\n    Ed Miniat\n   </em>\n   quotes in full, without a hint of disapproval, the passage from\n   <em>\n    CBOE\n   </em>\n   stating that a pre-announced, guaranteed rate of return excuses the insurance company from fiduciary responsibilities as to that rate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1111418\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/805/732/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1111418\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/805/732/\">\n    at 737-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, it indirectly reaffirms the portion of\n   <em>\n    CBOE\n   </em>\n   on which Defendant relies. Second,\n   <em>\n    Ed Miniat\n   </em>\n   had not progressed beyond the motion to dismiss phase, which is why the insurance company's unilateral rights were described as \"apparent.\" Here, the nature of Defendant's contractual rights and how Defendant has exercised them has been established through discovery. Third,\n   <em>\n    Ed Miniat\n   </em>\n   contains no discussion of the ability to protest changes or exit without paying a fee (the allegations established that the insurance company charged an enormous exit fee). Thus, for present purposes,\n   <em>\n    Ed Miniat\n   </em>\n   establishes-correctly, in this Court's view-that the mere fact of discretion embodied in an arms-length, bargained-for contract does not mean that ERISA's fiduciary duties are\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   excused as to exercises of such discretion. But that general principle does not answer the question of whether ERISA fiduciary duties govern a discretionary choice that the affected party may reject.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The other decision of note is\n   <em>\n    Pipefitters Local 636 Insurance Fund v.

In particular,\n   <em>\n    Pipefitters\n   </em>\n   says nothing about the \"final say\" theory reflected in\n   <em>\n    CBOE\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Midwest Community\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Charters\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Zang\n   </em>\n   . The Court is persuaded that those cases correctly state the scope of ERISA. Thus, if the all the circumstances of the alleged ERISA-triggering decision show that the defendant does not have power to force its decision upon an unwilling objector, the defendant is not acting as an ERISA fiduciary with respect to that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiff argues, however, that even this standard is not satisfied. Plaintiff's first argument in this regard is that none of Defendant's cases specifically discuss individual plan participants' (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the employees') ability to reject the insurance company's decision. Rather, these cases focus on the plan sponsor's (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , usually, the employer's) ability to reject the decision. (ECF No. 193 at 23-24.) Plaintiff is correct, but Plaintiff does not explain why this is a distinction with a difference. Nor does the Court perceive a meaningful distinction. ERISA does not impose obligations on retirement plans purely for those plans' sake, but because Congress was concerned with\n   <em>\n    plan participants'\n   </em>\n   welfare. Plan participants' \"veto\" authority is therefore as relevant as plan sponsors' authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that the Plan itself cannot easily withdraw from the Fund because the Contract imposes a waiting period\n   of up to one year. (ECF No. 206 at 12.) This is not an argument that the Court can consider in the present posture. The Contract does not\n   <em>\n    mandate\n   </em>\n   a one-year waiting period, so whether it would actually be imposed in any particular instance is speculative. And the decision itself whether to impose it might be separately challengeable as an exercise of ERISA discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff argues that Plan participants actually face significant barriers to divesting from the Fund because the Fund is the only stable value product Defendant will permit as to plans its services. (ECF No. 193 at 25.) The Court has given serious thought to this contention, but notes that it introduces a host of other considerations individual to each participant (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , investment time horizon and overall preferred risk profile). Thus, the Court finds that this presents too attenuated a basis to say that a Plan participant has no real ability to reject Defendant's Credited Rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Discretion as to Defendant's Own Compensation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plaintiff additionally asserts that Defendant breached its fiduciary duties because, by setting the Credited Rate, Defendant controlled the margin and in turn controlled its own compensation. (ECF No. 175 at 24-25.) Plaintiff is correct that, \"after a person has entered into an agreement with an ERISA-covered plan, the agreement may give it such control over factors that determine the actual amount of its compensation that the person thereby becomes an ERISA fiduciary with respect to that compensation.\"\n   <em>\n    F.H.

In other words, as against a plan fiduciary offering the Fund, it appears it would be enough to prove the fiduciary's actual or constructive knowledge that Defendant retains Fund-generated margin for itself (presuming, given Defendant's failure to contest it, that allowing Defendant to retain the margin is a prohibited transaction). The Court may assume that the record before it establishes at least this much beyond a genuine dispute (although, again, the Plan Fiduciaries are not parties to this lawsuit). But that is not the same standard to which\n   <em>\n    Salomon\n   </em>\n   holds the nonfiduciary party in interest. As to those parties (in this case, Defendant),\n   <em>\n    Salomon\n   </em>\n   requires \"actual or constructive knowledge of the circumstances that rendered the transaction unlawful.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413601\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/238/\">\n    530 U.S. at 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413601\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/238/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Plaintiff appears to interpret \"circumstances that rendered the transaction unlawful\" as establishing a standard no different from \"facts satisfying the elements of a [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201106\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ] transaction.\" Or, in the context of this case, Plaintiff assumes that simple knowledge that Defendant retains Fund-generated margin is enough to satisfy both elements of a nonfiduciary liability claim. The Court cannot agree. Although\n   <em>\n    Salomon\n   </em>\n   was not purporting to write a statute or a jury instruction, the Court discerns significant differences between the language used to describe the requisite knowledge of a plan fiduciary and the requisite knowledge of a nonfiduciary party in interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   As to a plan fiduciary, \"facts satisfying the elements of a [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201106\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ] transaction\" seems plainly aimed at requiring only a knowledge of basic facts, particularly that the party in interest will use plan property for its own gain. This would be consistent with \"the great weight of authority\" holding that \u00a7 1106(a) violations are essentially strict liability offenses.\n   <em>\n    Chao v.

But, as to a nonfiduciary party in interest, the standard is \"circumstances that rendered the transaction unlawful.\" Particularly in contrast to the fiduciary standard, this language appears aimed at exploring not just knowledge of the underlying facts, but knowledge of their potential unlawfulness. Indeed, the Supreme Court announced this standard specifically in the context of noting the limits of third-party liability. The entire relevant passage is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   It also bears emphasis that the common law of trusts sets limits on restitution actions against defendants other than the principal \"wrongdoer.\" Only a transferee of ill-gotten trust assets may be held liable, and then only when the transferee (assuming he has purchased for value) knew or should have known of the existence of the trust and the circumstances that rendered the transfer in breach of the trust. Translated to the instant context, the transferee must be demonstrated to have had actual or constructive knowledge of the circumstances that rendered the transaction unlawful. Those circumstances, in turn, involve a showing that the\n   <em>\n    plan fiduciary\n   </em>\n   , with actual or constructive knowledge of the facts satisfying the elements of a \u00a7 406(a) transaction, caused the plan to engage in the transaction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    Salomon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413601\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/238/\">\n    530 U.S. at 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413601\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/238/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Requiring a heightened showing as to nonfiduciary parties in interest is also consistent with the treatises the Supreme Court relied upon in\n   <em>\n    Salomon\n   </em>\n   to conclude that such parties may be liable in some circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413601\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/238/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413601\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/238/\">\n    at 250-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413601\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/238/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (analyzing treatises);\n   <em>\n    cf\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Knudson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108127\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/204/#p212\">\n    534 U.S. at 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108127\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/204/#p212\">\n    122 S.Ct. 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (endorsing many of the same treatises as guides to determining whether a form of relief is legal or equitable).

Rather, the plaintiff must show that the defendant knew or should have known that the transaction violated ERISA.

However, it is immaterial here. Plaintiff has asserted nonfiduciary liability as a specific claim for relief (Claim Three), and it would be rare indeed for any plaintiff to be able to assert a cause of action and then throw all the burden on the defendant to disprove it. Moreover, Plaintiff's briefs repeatedly argue that Defendant bears the burden of proof on certain questions (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 175 at 5, 31-32, 35, 41; ECF No. 193 at 4, 24 n.7, 26, 33), but Plaintiff nowhere argues that Defendant bears the burden of proof on Claim Three. Accordingly, Plaintiff has forfeited any argument that the burden of proof for Claim Three rests on Defendant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
