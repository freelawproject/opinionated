In addition, Employee agrees to arbitrate any and all disputes regarding the existence, validity, termination or enforceability of any term or provision in this Agreement. All arbitration between the parties shall be referred to and finally administered and resolved in Nassau, The Bahamas and administered by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") under its international dispute resolution procedures....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Article 16(b) (p. 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On or about June 9, 2014, Plaintiff was employed as a spa facialist aboard the M/S Crown Princess (the \"Vessel\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 6-8.

The SEA defines the \"Parties\" to the agreement as only \"the Company\"-which is defined as Steiner Transocean Limited-and \"Employee,\" which refers to Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SEA at 1. Similarly, the Arbitration Clause discusses only \"arbitration between the parties\" and provides only that \"[t]he Company and Employee may initiate arbitration ....\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The unseaworthiness claim listed is merely listed an example of the type of claim that would be subject to arbitration under the Arbitration Clause, which subjects \"any and all disputes, claims or controversies whatsoever\" to arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, unseaworthiness is one of over a dozen other examples, including \"constitutional\" claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   By the Moving Defendants' logic, because constitutional claims-which are levied against governmental bodies-are included on this list,\n   the SEA also contemplates governments enforcing the Arbitration Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Finally, Moving Defendants provide no authority for the proposition that an arbitration clause may implicitly confer the right to enforce arbitration to a third party merely because the clause provides examples of arbitrable claims, and one of those example claims would not apply to the signatory party, but would apply to a third party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In light of the above, the Court finds that the Arbitration Clause provides the Steiner Defendants the right to compel arbitration because (a) the Arbitration Clause expressly provides Steiner Transcocean Limited the right to compel arbitration and (b) Plaintiff does not dispute or contest in any way the Moving Defendants' assertion that the Remaining Steiner Defendants could compel arbitration based on the same clause. Accordingly, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20206\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Court finds it appropriate to send Counts I, VI, and VIII against the Steiner Defendants to arbitration as set forth in the SEA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20206\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A court having jurisdiction under this chapter may direct that arbitration be held in accordance with the agreement at any place therein provided for, whether that place is within or without the United States.\"). However, the Court finds that the Moving Defendants have failed to show that the remaining Counts (II, III, IV, V, VII, and VIII) against Princess and/or Reyes should be compelled to arbitration.
