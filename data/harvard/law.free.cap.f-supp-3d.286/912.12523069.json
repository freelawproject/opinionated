DeBerry Special Needs Facility in Nashville. The Magistrate Judge has entered a Report and Recommendation (Doc. No. 79) that recommends the Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc.

No. 80). After reviewing the matter\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   as required by Rule 72(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court agrees with the Magistrate Judge that Matthews' claim is subject to dismissal for both procedural and substantive reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Procedural Deficiencies\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In his objections, Matthews does not dispute that he did not comply with Local Rule 56.01 that, in relevant part, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   c.

However, both motions were untimely because they were filed after the February 15, 2017 discovery motion deadline as set forth in the Case Management Order (Doc. No. 49). Regardless, both motions are directed at discovering who was responsible for shackling Matthews. Whether that person was Copeland, McBay, or someone else matters not because Matthews has not presented evidence that the responsible party acted with the requisite malicious intent, nor has he shown sufficient injury so as to satisfy an Eighth Amendment claim. Accordingly, the Motions to Compel will be denied as moot.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    This is just a general rule.
