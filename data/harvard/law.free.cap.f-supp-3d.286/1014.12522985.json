Plaintiffs Ivan Swearingen (Ivan) and Ronda Swearingen (Ronda), administrators of the estate of Ryan Swearingen (Ryan) (collectively, Plaintiffs), resist the motion. No party requested a hearing on the Motion, and the Court finds a hearing is unnecessary. The matter is fully submitted and ready for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case presents the tragic consequences resulting from the collision between an individual's unfortunate and dangerous behavior and the reaction of law enforcement officers in performance of their duty under extreme circumstances. On August 2, 2014, several members of the Swearingen family, including Ryan and Ryan's children, gathered for a cookout at Ivan and Ronda's residence (the Swearingen home), located at 1527 Avenue E, Fort Madison, Iowa. Ryan and his children were overnight guests at the residence. Ronda went to bed around 10:30 p.m., and Ivan went to bed around 11:30 p.m. Ryan did not go to bed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At 1:16 a.m. the next morning, Carle called Mendy LeMoyne. Carle was a police captain with the City of Fort Madison who, that night, was working the overnight shift. LeMoyne was at her home, 1429 Avenue E, Fort Madison, Iowa, which she shared with Carle. LeMoyne's home was less than a block from the Swearingen home. During their call, LeMoyne noticed an individual, later identified as Ryan, in the alley slashing the tires on cars belonging to the tenants of Carle's rental property at 1428 Avenue D, Fort Madison, Iowa. The backyard was somewhat lit, enabling LeMoyne to discern that Ryan was wearing a plain white t-shirt, black gym shorts, and tennis shoes. LeMoyne informed Carle that Ryan had slashed tires on three cars with a knife. Ryan looked at LeMoyne through the window and, holding the knife, Ryan wiggled it over his head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Carle drove to the LeMoyne/Carle home to investigate. When Carle arrived, Ryan was bent over Carle's pick-up truck near the rear driver's side tire. Ryan saw Carle and took off running north through the yard of Carle's rental property. At 1:45 a.m., Carle notified dispatch that Ryan was popping tires and running from authorities. Judd later told investigators that Carle had radioed he was pursuing \"Ryan Swearingen.\" Carle initially followed Ryan in his squad car and then pursued Ryan on foot into the 1500 block alley between Avenues D and E. Despite Carle's repeated warnings to stop, Ryan kept running.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At 1:46 a.m., Carle saw Ryan enter and lock the back door of the Swearingen home. Carle knew that it was the Swearingen home that Ryan had entered, and he informed dispatch of Ryan's entry. Multiple officers responded to the Swearingen home at 1:47 a.m., including Officer Judd, Officer Tanner Hartman (Hartman), Officer Haris Smajlovic (Smajlovic), and Reserve Officer Kevin Riggs (Riggs). Smajlovic and Riggs went to the front of the house to stand guard in case anyone attempted to leave by the front door. Judd and Hartman joined Carle at the back of the house. Hartman, at one point, checked the side of the Swearingen home to determine there was no attempt by Ryan to flee the scene through a window.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Around this time, Ronda and Ivan were awakened by the sound of their dog barking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ronda heard police officers beating on the door, demanding that the door be opened, and saw Ryan holding green and white knives in his hands.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As this was happening, the officers saw Ryan walking around inside the home. Ryan then approached the back door, holding the green-handled knife in a reverse grip position. Ryan spun around in a frantic manner and appeared to be looking for a place to hide. The officers again commanded Ryan to open the door, and also, to drop any knives. Carle and Smajlovic saw Ryan holding a green knife, and Hartman saw Ryan with a green-handled knife in his hand, in a reverse grip position. Ivan entered the laundry room near the back door, where he saw Ryan standing against the wall and, like the officers, observed Ryan holding a knife. Carle, who was still outside, recognized Ivan and called on him by name to open the door. Ivan asked if the officers had a warrant and objected to their entry. The officers continued yelling at both Ryan and Ivan to open the door, but neither complied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At 1:49 a.m., Carle determined that officers should forcibly enter the Swearingen home. Smajlovic then entered the Swearingen home through the unlocked front door. Smajlovic unholstered his service pistol, pointed it at Ryan, and yelled at Ryan multiple times to drop the knife. Ryan did not drop the knife or knives. Moving out of view of the officers, Ryan entered a walk-through closet that had one door going into a bedroom and another door going into the laundry room near the back door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Meanwhile, Carle entered the Swearingen home through the back door by shattering the glass and reaching through the pane to release the lock. Carle was followed by Judd and Hartman. Carle and Judd drew their service pistols. Hartman drew his taser after Judd suggested that he do so. When Carle entered the house, he could not see Ryan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   While trying to locate Ryan, Judd saw the walk-through closet door, which was to his right, move a couple inches. Riggs also observed that the closet door was cracked about one-half inch and warned the other officers. Riggs, with his taser drawn, pointed the taser's laser light dot inside the cracked-open door, hoping that if someone was behind the door, they would see the dot and give up. Judd, grabbing the closet door handle with his right hand and holding his pistol in his left hand, pulled the closet door open. The parties do not dispute that Ryan was standing behind the closet door, but dispute Ryan's posture and orientation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Judd stepped back and fired three shots that struck Ryan. When the shots were fired, only two to three feet separated Judd and Ryan. Hartman cleared the door and pointed the red light from his taser at Ryan's left shoulder as Ryan fell to the ground. Hartman could see that Ryan had gunshot wounds on his left side and was gripping a knife in the same reverse-grip position as Hartman had observed earlier. When the shots were fired, Ronda could not see Ryan. Ivan could only see part of Ryan's torso and left arm but could not see either of Ryan's\n   hands, and Ivan did not see Judd fire the shots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At 1:51 a.m., Carle requested an ambulance at the Swearingen home. Riggs spotted a green-handled knife underneath Ryan's arm, with the blade pointing toward Ryan's body, retrieved it, and relocated it to the top of the washer and dryer. When emergency care units arrived at the scene, Lieutenant Mike Schneider of the Fort Madison Fire Department observed a black-handled kitchen knife on the floor next to Ryan's body. Ryan had sustained three gunshot wounds : the first entered his left upper arm with a back-to-front trajectory, the second entered his left mid-back with a back-to-front trajectory, and the third entered his left buttock. Ryan was transported to the Fort Madison Community Hospital where he later died.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Judd told investigators he believed that Ryan was a threat to the Swearingen family, that Ryan's mannerisms and actions indicated that he was out to do bodily harm to the officers, and that Judd was in imminent fear for his life. The Iowa Attorney General's Office Area Prosecution Division reviewed the incident to determine if criminal charges were warranted against Judd. The Attorney General's office concluded exigent circumstances supported the officers' warrantless entry into the home, and Judd's use of deadly force was justified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On March 4, 2017, Plaintiffs filed the instant lawsuit against Defendants, asserting two claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Count I of the Complaint alleges that Carle and Judd violated Ryan's Fourth Amendment rights by entering the Swearingen home without a warrant and that Judd violated Ryan's Fourth Amendment rights by using excessive force. Count II alleges that the City violated Ryan's Fourth Amendment rights by maintaining policies and customs, which directly and proximately caused Carle and Judd's unconstitutional conduct, and by failing to properly train its police officers. Defendants filed this motion, arguing that they are entitled to summary judgment on Count I because no Fourth Amendment violation occurred and, alternatively, because the officers are entitled to qualified immunity. Defendants maintain they are entitled to summary judgment on Count II, the municipal liability claim, because the officers are not liable for any underlying misconduct and there is no evidence of prior notice to the City of any deficiencies in policies or training.

Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Nance\n   </em>\n   , here, it is undisputed that Ryan was holding at least one knife before, during, and immediately following his encounter with Judd in the closet. Additionally, whereas in\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   the distance between officer and suspect was twelve feet, here, the distance between Judd and Ryan was no more than two to three feet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Judd testified that when he pulled the closet door open,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ryan raised-up\n   while holding the green-handled knife in a dagger position near his face, and stepped forward as if he was going to lunge at Judd.

Hartman demonstrated for investigators that Ryan was holding the knife by its handle, with the blade pointed up toward his elbow, both before and immediately following Ryan's encounter with Judd. Ivan testified that, from where he was standing in the kitchen, he could see the left side of Ryan's torso when the closet door opened. The autopsy revealed that Ryan sustained three gunshot wounds which, respectively, entered his left upper arm with a back-to-front trajectory, his left mid-back with a back-to-front trajectory, and his left buttock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   There is, indeed, an issue of fact as to whether Ryan moved toward Judd during their closet confrontation. But the Court is compelled to conclude this is not a\n   <em>\n    material\n   </em>\n   question of fact. Under the circumstances, given the distance between Ryan and Judd, Ryan's possession of at least one knife, Ryan's behavior up to that point, and the split-second circumstances, the record is adequate that a reasonable officer could have concluded that deadly force was justified. Ryan's behavior immediately preceding this encounter was erratic and, from the standpoint of a reasonable officer, dangerous. Ryan fled from police after being witnessed popping tires with a knife-a deadly weapon. Ryan did not drop his knife or knives despite multiple commands from officers to do so.

After fleeing into the Swearingen home, Ryan was discovered by Ivan standing against a wall, holding a knife. Ryan later entered the walkthrough closet, where police officers could not see him. Whether Ryan intended to ambush the officers or was hiding out of fear is not the inquiry for this Court.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 22, submitted by Defendants is\n   <strong>\n    granted\n   </strong>\n   as to all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The facts here are either materially undisputed or, if genuinely disputed, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Torgerson v.

What appears undisputed is that Ryan was holding at least one knife throughout the entire encounter at the Swearingen home.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    According to Judd, Ryan raised up, holding the green-handled knife in a dagger position near his face, and stepped forward as if he was going to lunge at Judd. On the other hand, Hartman demonstrated for investigators that Ryan was holding the knife by its handle, with the blade pointed up toward his elbow, both before and immediately following Ryan's encounter with Judd, and Ivan testified that, from where he was standing in the kitchen, he could see the left side of Ryan's torso when the closet door opened.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Plaintiffs offer a secondary argument: that any exigent circumstances were of the officers' own making. In determining whether police manufactured exigent circumstances, the Court considers the \"reasonableness and propriety of the investigative tactics that generated the exigency.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4221639\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/598/997/#p1005\">\n     598 F.3d 997\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1005 (8th Cir. 2010) (citation omitted);\n    <em>\n     cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Here, Carle and Judd's investigative conduct created no such exigency. Carle received word that Ryan was slashing tires, observed Ryan bent over his truck, and began his pursuit immediately thereafter. Judd began his pursuit after receiving word from Carle over dispatch. The officers were lawfully executing their law enforcement duties by pursuing a suspect observed committing a crime. Carle and Judd did not create the exigency that led to the hot pursuit and resulted in the warrantless entry.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Plaintiffs also argue that the Court should not address whether Judd is protected under qualified immunity for excessive use of force in light of\n    <em>\n     Attocknie v.

In\n    <em>\n     Attocknie\n    </em>\n    , the Tenth Circuit held that \"because a reasonable jury could determine that [an] unlawful entry was the proximate cause of [a] fatal shooting ... we need not decide whether [Defendant] used excessive force.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4332835\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/1252/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4332835\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/1252/\">\n     at 1258\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . This case differs from\n    <em>\n     Attocknie\n    </em>\n    , as Carle and Judd are entitled to qualified immunity for their warrantless entry. Moreover, the Eighth Circuit has held that \"the objective reasonableness analysis must be conducted separately for each search or seizure that is alleged to be unconstitutional,\" and therefore, \"[deadly force] may not be found unreasonable by reference to some separate constitutional violation.\"\n    <em>\n     Frederick v.

Though Hartman and Riggs were armed with tasers, Judd approached the closet door with his service pistol deployed. However, that is not the standard this Court must employ.
