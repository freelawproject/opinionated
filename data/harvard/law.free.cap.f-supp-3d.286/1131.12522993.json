The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare (IDHW) interprets state law to bar changes to the listed sex unless an applicant can show there was an error of identification at birth. Therefore, as a policy, IDHW categorically and automatically denies applications to change the listed sex for any other reason. The questions presented to the Court are whether IDHW's interpretation, as applied, violates the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and whether it impermissibly compels speech in violation of the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the Court notes the rare posture of the case. Plaintiffs, two transgender women born in Idaho, bring this action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , asking the Court for a declaration that IDHW's policy violates their constitutional rights and the rights of others similarly situated. Plaintiffs request that the Court apply heightened scrutiny review, and declare that IDHW's policy violates the Equal Protection Clause. They also seek a ruling that the policy infringes upon due process rights to informational privacy, individual liberty, autonomy, and dignity. Plaintiffs request further that the Court find that IDHW's policy impermissibly compels speech in violation of the First Amendment to the Constitution. Plaintiffs ask the Court to enjoin Defendants, and others subject to the injunction, from enforcing the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In turn, Defendants do not defend the constitutionality of the policy. Instead,\n   <em>\n    they admit\n   </em>\n   it is unconstitutional. Specifically, that it violates the Equal Protection Clause, failing minimum scrutiny review because \"a prohibition against changing the sex designation on the birth certificate of a transgender individual who has undergone clinically appropriate treatment to permanently change his or her sex\" bears no rational relationship to a conceivable government interest. (Ans. to First Am. Compl., Dkt. 19 at 2-3 \u00b6 5.) Defendants assert that, once they have an order from the Court in hand, they will create a new rule permitting transgender individuals to change the sex listed on their birth certificates. (Oral Argument at 9:50,\n   <em>\n    F.V. v. Armstrong et al.\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:17-CV-00170-CWD (February 1, 2018).) Defendants indicate also that the new rule will include a provision that any revision history related to changes to the listed sex or name changes will not be marked on the reissued birth certificates of transgender individuals. Defendants further indicate they cannot proceed to create a rule until they receive a court order (Oral Argument at 9:51,\n   <em>\n    F.V. v. Armstrong et al.\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:17-CV-00170-CWD (February 1, 2018).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants assert that, because they have made these concessions, the Court should exercise judicial restraint and decide the Plaintiffs' motion on the narrowest ground-that the current policy, as applied, is not rationally related to a legitimate government interest, violates the Plaintiffs' equal protection rights, and is thus unconstitutional under minimum scrutiny review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs counter that, in the face of pervasive government discrimination against transgender individuals, the Court has a constitutional duty and inherent authority to define the level of scrutiny that should be applied to their equal protection claim, and should determine favorable judgment is warranted on the basis of the other constitutional claims-in addition to fashioning a remedy mandating equal treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court will not reach Plaintiffs' Due Process or First Amendment claims for the following reasons. First, the Court finds resolution of the Equal Protection Clause claim captures \"the essence of\n   the right in a more accurate and comprehensive way\" than the Due Process Clause, \"even as the two Clauses may converge in the identification and definition of the right.\"\n   <em>\n    Obergefell v. Hodges\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591054\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2584/#p2603\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2603,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591054\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2584/#p2603\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). The substance of Plaintiffs' First Amendment claim is that if a birth certificate is reissued to a transgender individual, and the reissued birth certificate includes the revision history, it will impermissibly compel speech-i.e. it will force an individual to disclose their transgender status when they would not ordinarily do so. Given Defendants' concession and agreement, the compelled speech concern falls away, and the merits of this claim need not be addressed by the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After careful consideration, the Court finds IDHW's policy of categorically and automatically denying applications submitted by transgender individuals to change the sex listed on their birth certificates is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court finds further that any constitutionally sound rule must not include the revision history as to sex or name to avoid impermissibly compelling speech and furthering the harms at issue. The Court notes also that the new rule should withstand heightened scrutiny review to fall within the contours of equal protection law. To reasonably assure the rule and remedy comply with such existing law, the Court will discuss the same after presenting the background, introducing the parties, and outlining the standard of review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Idaho Vital Statistics Laws\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   States are responsible for the development and implementation of laws related to vital events such as recording births and deaths. However, most states, including Idaho, use the Model State Vital Statistics Act published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a basis for state law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Idaho Vital Statistics Act (Act), Title 39, Chapter 2 of the Idaho Code, authorizes the Idaho Board of Health and Welfare (Board) to propose rules to carry out its provisions related to vital statistics-the Vital Statistics Rules (Rules). IDAPA 16.02.08.000. IDHW is the state agency responsible for enforcement of the Act and the Rules, (together, vital statistics laws) for providing the official interpretation of such laws, and for developing temporary and final proposed rules. State legislative approval is necessary to enact final proposed rules into law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Idaho's vital statistics laws require that all amended birth certificates be marked as \"amended,\" including a record of the nature of the change, unless the change is made under one of the following circumstances: (1) minor corrections made within one year after the date of the event necessitating the correction; (2) voluntary acknowledgements of paternity and non-paternity; and (3) for changes to name and paternal and maternal information in instances of adoption.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2039-250\">\n    Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 39-250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 39-258 -59; IDAPA 16.02.08.201. In these circumstances, the vital statistics laws require the amendments not be marked or noted on the birth certificate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A catch-all provision applies to any amendment not specifically provided for in the vital statistics laws. IDAPA 16.02.08.201.08. Notably, amendments made under the catch-all provision must be described on the birth certificate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   All applications to amend birth certificates are reviewed by the state registrar. The registrar's determination must serve the objectives of the vital statistics laws and the best interests of the public. IDAPA 16.02.08.201(e). When applications are denied, an individual has a right to petition a court for an order requiring the registrar make the requested amendment.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2039-250\">\n    Idaho Code \u00a7 39-250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As explained above, IDHW interprets Idaho vital statistics law to prohibit changes to the listed sex unless there was an error in recording the sex at birth. Notably, IDHW asserts that Idaho birth certificates reflect the \"sex\" of a person at birth and do not contain a \"gender marker\" designation. (Ans. to First Am. Compl., Dkt. 23 at 2 \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.) From this interpretation comes IDHW's policy of automatically and categorically denying applications made by transgender individuals for the purpose of changing the listed sex to reflect their gender identity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Biological Sex, Gender Identity, Transition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   There is scientific consensus that biological sex is determined by numerous elements, which can include chromosomal composition, internal reproductive organs, external genitalia, hormone prevalence, and brain structure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sex determinations made at birth are most often based on the observation of external genitalia alone. World Professional Association for Transgender Health,\n   <em>\n    Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People\n   </em>\n   at 97 (7th Version, 2011) (hereinafter \"WPATH\n   <em>\n    Standards of Care\n   </em>\n   \"). For most people, this determination aligns with gender identity and gender expression.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2039-250\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Of importance here, however, are instances where it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Gender identity, also known as core gender, is the intrinsic sense of being male, female, or an alternative gender.

Transgender is an adjective used to designate \"a person whose identity does not confirm unambiguously to conventional notions of male or female gender.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Put another way, transgender is an adjective used to describe a person who has a gender identity that differs, in varying degrees, from the sex observed and assigned at birth. WPATH\n   <em>\n    Standards of Care\n   </em>\n   at 97.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Transgender individuals often suffer emotional distress in the process of recognizing and responding to the complex social and personal scenarios that result because their gender identity does not align with birth-assigned sex. (Dkt. 28-5 at 8;\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   e.g., American Medical Association Resolution 122 (A-08) at 1 (2008)).

For many people, this involves learning how to live socially in another gender role; for others this means finding a gender role and expression that is most comfortable for them. Transition may or may not include feminization or masculinization of the body through hormones or other medical procedures. The nature and duration of transition is variable and individualized.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   WPATH\n   <em>\n    Standards of Care\n   </em>\n   at 97.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In other words, transition is the process where a person works to bring their lived experience and outer appearance into alignment with their gender identity. Transition can include medical treatments, such as hormone therapy and surgery, but is often limited to social transition. WPATH\n   <em>\n    Standards of Care\n   </em>\n   at 71, 97. Not all transgender people choose to undergo surgery as a part of the transition process. This is due to numerous potential factors, including whether surgery is medically necessary, and personal and financial factors such as lack of insurance coverage.

Each Plaintiff has undergone the process of transition but is unable to obtain a birth certificate that reflects her gender identity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   F.V. is a 28-year-old woman born in Idaho. She is a transgender person who was assigned the sex of male at birth. Although F.V. states that she knew from approximately age 6 she was female, she began to live openly as a female when she was 15 years old. She has lived as a woman since that time, and asserts that doing so has been essential to her sense of self. F.V. relates that she \"cannot imagine living life as a man\" because she is not a man, and would be living a lie to try to do so. (Decl. of F.V., Dkt. 28-3 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   F.V. has taken steps, both medically and socially, to bring her body and expression of gender in line with her female gender identity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Her social transition has included legally changing her name from a traditionally male name to a traditionally female one, and changing her name and gender on her driver's license, passport, and in her social security records. On March 17, 2017, F.V. contacted the Idaho Bureau of Vital Records and Health Statistics to inquire about changing the sex listed on her birth certificate. She was informed that IDHW does not consider such applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   F.V. asserts that living with a birth certificate declaring she is male is a permanent\n   and painful reminder that Idaho does not recognize her as she is-as a woman. Beyond this, she states that presenting an identity document that conflicts with her gender identity is both humiliating and dangerous: it puts her at risk of violence by disclosing against her will and intentions that she is a transgender individual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Dani Martin (Dani) is a 31-year-old woman born in Idaho. Dani is a transgender person who was assigned the sex of male at birth. Like F.V., Dani states that she knew from a young age she was female. However, fear of rejection and bullying prevented her from coming out when she was younger. With the support of her spouse and her family, Dani began to transition in 2014. She has lived her life openly as a woman since that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Like F.V., Dani has taken steps, both medically and socially, to bring her body and expression of gender in line with her female identity. Her social transition has included legally changing her name from a traditionally male name to a traditionally female one, and changing her name and gender on her driver's license and in her social security records. Like F.V., Dani has been unable to change the gender on her birth certificate due to Idaho's prohibitory policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The mismatch between Dani's gender identity and the sex listed on her birth certificate has exposed her to harassment and embarrassment. She asserts the mismatch has also prevented her from making the change in other important records-perpetuating instances where she is forced to disclose her transgender status, face embarrassment, harassment, and potential physical violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    5.

Nov. 21, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In this matter, Plaintiffs, transgender individuals born in Idaho, have adequately\n   alleged they were treated differently from non-transgender people born in Idaho. IDHW practices a policy of automatically and categorically denying applications made by transgender people to amend the birth-assigned sex on their birth certificates to align with their gender identity. Plaintiff F.V. contacted IDHW to inquire about amending her birth certificate to align with her gender identity. IDHW informed F.V., consistent with its policy, that it does not consider applications made on that basis. Plaintiff Dani Martin's experience was the same. The IDHW Defendants provide no justification for the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Yet, in turn, IDHW permits some classes of people, adoptive parents for instance, to make amendments to birth certificates without record of the amendment on the reissued certificate. IDHW has similar laws and policies related to the change of paternal information. These laws give certain people access to birth certificates that accurately reflect who they are, while denying transgender people, as a class, access to birth certificates that accurately reflect their gender identity. Therefore, as Defendants concede, Plaintiffs' equal protection claims are valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Supreme Court of the United States has set forth a framework of tiered review for equal protection claims.\n   <em>\n    Latta v.

If a law does not classify on the basis of a suspect or quasi-suspect class, it is subject to minimum scrutiny-commonly called rational basis review.\n   <em>\n    Heller v.

The Supreme Court has carefully defined the limits of this level of review. It is applied when laws impermissibly interfere with fundamental rights or to the disadvantage of a suspect class.\n   <em>\n    Latta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4260981\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/19/1054/#p1073\">\n    19 F.Supp.3d at 1073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Strict scrutiny applies to classifications based on race, alienage, and national origin. IDWH's policy makes a classification based on transgender status. Therefore, under clear Supreme Court precedent, it does not trigger strict scrutiny review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In contrast, the most lenient level of scrutiny is rational basis review. This level of review is applied to laws that impose a difference in treatment between groups but do not infringe upon a fundamental right, or target a suspect or quasi-suspect class.\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   at 319-21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355778\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/312/#p319\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In such instances, if a court can identify any rational basis supportive of the government's need for the law, it is upheld.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355778\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/312/#p319\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In this matter, IDHW Defendants concede no rational basis exists to support the categorical denial of requests to amend sex-assigned birth on the basis of correcting it to match one's gender identity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Court notes the importance and potential implications of restrictions and restraints IDHW may place on the ability of transgender people to apply for and receive approval of applications to change the sex listed on their birth certificates. Because the Court does not have a proposed rule before it, it will not extrapolate on the potential legal ramifications of such restrictions-such topics are not ripe for its consideration. However, any new rule must not subject one class of people to any more onerous burdens than the burdens placed on others without constitutionally-appropriate\n   justification-for instance, to apply for a change in paternity information the applicant is not required to submit medical evidence, such as DNA confirmation, to prove paternity or non-paternity. Yet, all applicants for name changes are required to obtain a court order-regardless of the reason for the change. (\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   note 3 and accompanying text.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Court agrees there is no rational basis to support IDHW's policy. The following facts make this conclusion apparent: (1) IDHW already has a process in place for making amendments to birth certificates, as is evidenced by Idaho's vital statistics laws; (2) the vital statistics laws make certain that amendments or corrections are kept confidential when they pertain to sensitive personal and potentially private information, such as paternity or adoptive status; and (3) the laws make room for the amendment of any other information on the birth certificate with the proper form of application and evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Thus, under an alternative, constitutionally-sound reading of Idaho's vital statistics laws, amendments to the listed sex are not only possible, but procedures are in place to facilitate such amendments-and the Act allows the Board to draft a rule that does just that.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, there is no rational basis for denying transgender individuals birth certificates that reflect their gender identity and IDHW's policy, as applied, violates the Equal Protection Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Yet, as explained above, Plaintiffs ask the Court to take a step further to find that IDHW's policy similarly fails to withstand heightened scrutiny, which includes the mid-tier of equal protection review-intermediate scrutiny. Historically, intermediate scrutiny applies to quasi-suspect classifications based on sex and illegitimacy.\n   <em>\n    Clark v.

In other words, Plaintiffs suggest two ways for the Court to conclude that heightened scrutiny applies to government classifications based on transgender status. The first-the Court could find that discrimination based on transgender status is discrimination based on sex or gender. The second-the Court could conclude that transgender status is a suspect classification in and of itself. In either case, Plaintiffs contend IDHW's policy is not substantially related to an important governmental objective and fails intermediate scrutiny review.

Plaintiffs have sufficiently demonstrated that they have suffered irreparable injury and harm that cannot be remedied by ordinary remedies at law-and by Defendants' acknowledgment, IDHW cannot proceed to create a new rule to remedy the harm without a court order. Furthermore, the balance of the hardships warrants an equitable remedy, because allowing such amendments would pose no new burden on Defendants: Idaho vital statistics laws allow IDHW to create and implement a constitutionally-sound rule, and IDHW already has in place processes and procedures to facilitate the amendment of birth certificates in the ordinary course of its everyday activities. Finally, the public interest is not disserved by a permanent injunction. A rule providing an avenue to obtain a birth certificate with a listed sex that aligns with an individual's gender identity promotes the health, well-being,\n   and safety of transgender people without impacting the rights of others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    NOW THEREFORE IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   1) The Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS in part\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES in part\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment.
