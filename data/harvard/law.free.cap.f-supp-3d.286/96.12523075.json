Since\n   <em>\n    Cummock v.

In his Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. 7 (\"Motion\"), he seeks,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , an order that the Commission and co-defendant officials and entities \"promptly ... produce records requested by Secretary Dunlap,\" and that Defendants \"produce ... all future documents made available to or prepared for or by the Commission promptly and no later than two weeks in advance of any future Commission meeting.\" Pl.'s Mot. for Prelim. Inj., ECF No. 7, at 1. The urgency of Plaintiff's Motion, filed on November 16, 2017, was predicated on the belief that the Commission would convene another meeting soon, possibly in December.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Kris W. Kobach, ECF No. 30-2, Ex. 2 \u00b6 9 (\"Kobach Decl.\") (\"It is estimated the Commission will meet five times at a frequency of approximately 30-60 days between meetings, subject to members' schedules and other considerations.\");\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pl.'s Mem. of Law in Supp. of Pl.'s Mot. for Prelim.

Rather, relief may be granted if the Court finds that Plaintiff has a likelihood of succeeding on the merits, that he would suffer irreparable harm absent injunctive relief, and that other equitable factors-that is, questions of fairness, justice, and the public interest-warrant such relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Upon consideration of the pleadings,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the relevant legal authorities, and the record as a whole, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS-IN-PART AND DENIES-IN-PART\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. 7. The scope of the Court's consideration and decision today are narrow. The Court decides only Plaintiff's above-described requests for past and future documents. The Court finds the other requests in Plaintiff's Motion to be premature. Moreover, the Court expressly limits its decision to Plaintiff's Motion; the Court does not rule on Plaintiff's underlying Complaint, ECF No. 1, or any claim that other commissioners may assert against the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

But Defendants have erected and attacked a straw man, and offered in its place an outdated and indefensible view of their own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   To their first point, nowhere does Plaintiff argue that he or someone similarly situated should be entitled to \"every document connected with every advisory committee.\" Indeed, in a letter to Defendants during briefing on this Motion, he sensibly indicated a number of categories of documents that he does not seek, presumably because he does not think he would be entitled to them or he does not consider them relevant to his role as a commissioner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 30-6 App. A (indicating that Plaintiff does not seek, e.g., \"Commission members' personal notes and drafts of statements to be given at Commission meetings\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As for their second point, Defendants argue that only material relied on by the Commission \"as a whole\" should be made available, yet they inexplicably rely primarily on pre-\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   interpretations of Section 10(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n Mem. at 23 (citing 1980s Office of Legal Counsel guidance and district court decisions, one of which\n   was affirmed, also pre-\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   ). And despite Defendants' supporting argument based on\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   language,\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   does not make such a distinction. Accordingly, Defendants cannot deprive Plaintiff of the requested documents simply because they have not been provided to all commissioners.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply Mem. at 6-7. Like Cummock herself, Plaintiff is as much a part of the Commission as any other member. The likelihood of Plaintiff's success in securing mandamus relief is attributable to his right to substantive material that would inform his full participation in the Commission and its development of recommendations to the President.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   A thread running through Defendants' argument is their distinction of the later posture of commission proceedings in\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Opp'n Mem. at 24. It is true that the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security, unlike the Commission in this case, had already made its final report when the case was filed. But\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   is a case that never should have happened. If Cummock herself had received relevant documents along the way, then she would not have needed to file suit and ultimately obtain a D.C. Circuit decision that did the best it could at that stage to address her rights as a commissioner, namely by finding that she should be permitted to review documents after the fact and consider whether to amend her dissent. This Court will find that a preliminary injunction is necessary in this case to prevent the Commission from reaching the level of dysfunction that precipitated\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   . Plaintiff is entitled to substantive information so that he can contribute along the way in shaping the ultimate recommendations of the Commission; he need not wait to assert his rights under\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   until after the fact-when a breach of his right to fully participate could not truly be redressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    3. \"Clear Duty\" of the Commission\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   An advisory committee has a nondiscretionary duty to comply with the requirements of FACA \u00a7 10(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 U.S.C. app. 2 \u00a7 10(b) (2016) (\"[T]he records, reports, transcripts, minutes, appendixes, working papers, drafts, studies, agenda, or other documents which were made available to or prepared for or by each advisory committee\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   be available for public inspection and copying ....\" (emphasis added)); Pl.'s Mem. at 16 (discussing nondiscretionary duties under FACA and citing\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

To be clear, the Commission's duty to provide information pursuant to Section 10(b) and\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   is, like Plaintiff's right to the same, applicable during the life of the Commission, not simply after it submits its final recommendations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Turning to the scope of that duty, the Court has not considered line-by-line the documents requested by Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 30-6 App. B (identifying series of entries from\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   -type index in\n   <em>\n    Lawyers' Committee\n   </em>\n   ).

Accordingly, it will suffice to give some examples, in light of the record, of substantive disclosures that Plaintiff should have received in the past and is entitled to receive in the future. First, sufficiently in advance of the June 28, 2017, teleconference, Plaintiff should have been informed about, received a draft of, and been given the opportunity to comment on the voter data request that the Vice Chair planned to send to states-which he ultimately did on Commission letterhead, discussing the Commission's work, and offering sentiments \"[o]n behalf of [his] fellow commissioners.\" Kobach Decl.

Third, sufficiently in advance of any invitation being extended to the Minnesota Voters Alliance to speak at a December meeting, Pl.'s Mem. at 6, Plaintiff should have been informed of and been given the opportunity to comment on plans for the next meeting whenever it is held, the decision about whether or not to hold it in December, speaker possibilities for that meeting, and any proposal to invite this particular group.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Court shall not monitor every document to be released to Plaintiff, but expects Defendants to comply with the guidance set forth in this decision. The Commission has a clear duty to provide Plaintiff with these documents and any similar documents that exist now or in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    4. \"No Adequate Alternative\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Government argues that Plaintiff cannot recover under the APA.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Opp'n Mem. at 1.

The Court rejects each prong. The Commission is not permitted to circumvent the FACA obligations recognized by\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   simply by enshrining a particular view in the bylaws; if the converse were true, a commission established under FACA could agree in writing to eviscerate any of that statute's strictures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3669491,11662621\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/282/\">\n    180 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   290-91 ; Pl.'s Reply Mem. at 12-13. Plaintiff's right to change the bylaws in conjunction with other commissioners cannot compensate for a violation of rights protected in this circuit. Moreover, the record reflects that Plaintiff generally does take advantage of the opportunity to give input, but he makes the persuasive argument that he cannot meaningfully\n   do so unless he is fully informed.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl.'s Reply Mem. at 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Based on Plaintiff's likely success in establishing a clear right to substantive information in the Commission's possession, the Government's clear duty to provide Plaintiff with that information with sufficient notice to allow him to exercise his right to fully participate as a commissioner, and the inadequacy of alternatives under the APA or bylaws, the Court finds that mandamus is not only viable at this stage of this particular case, but that it likely should be granted on the basis of compelling equitable grounds. This is so even if, as Defendant maintains, the standard for an injunction that alters the status quo is higher than for one that does not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n Mem. at 7 (citing,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Tex.

Ex. 2 \u00b6\u00b6 2, 13, the Court nevertheless should not issue mandamus because \"Defendants do not concede that FACA can be constitutionally applied to presidential advisory committees.\" Opp'n Mem. at 37-38. The Court has found\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   to be the applicable law in this circuit, and it has been so for nearly two decades.\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   does not hesitate to apply FACA to a presidential advisory committee. While\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   did not provide relief by mandamus, the Court is not doing so today either. The Court finds that the standard for today's decision-likelihood of success on the merits-is satisfied in light of Section 10(b) and\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In addition to Plaintiff's FACA \u00a7 10(b) requests for documents, past and future, Plaintiff's Motion seeks several further types of relief, namely that Defendants be compelled \"to permit Secretary Dunlap to fully participate [in Commission activities] on an equal basis as all other commissioners,\" and that the Commission be \"enjoin[ed] ... from releasing a final report until Secretary Dunlap has received all documents to which he is entitled and has had an opportunity to review them, has participated in the drafting of the report or, if necessary, has completed a concurrence or dissent to the report.\" Pl.'s Mot. for Prelim.

Any further order to permit participation on an \"equal basis\" would assume that he will not be treated equally even after the Government provides documents in compliance with today's decision. The Court cannot reach that conclusion on this record. The request to temporarily enjoin the final report is similarly premature, insofar as it assumes that Defendants will not provide the required documents in a timely fashion.

There is no way to tell whether Cummock's full participation in that commission along the way would have affected its final report. Perhaps it would have obviated the need for a dissent.

However, several factors persuade the Court that this hardship is modest, at most. The Government already collected and categorized the documents to a degree sufficient to present the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   -type index in the\n   <em>\n    Lawyers' Committee\n   </em>\n   litigation. Moreover, the Government's offer to permit Plaintiff to view the documents suggests that the Government has already contemplated how to physically furnish them-and has found\n   it sufficiently possible that they have volunteered to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 30-7, at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Accordingly, the Court concludes that, in balancing the equities and considering the public interest, this narrowly tailored preliminary injunction is appropriate. By withholding the substantive documents discussed in this opinion, the Commission ignores the strictures imposed by FACA to prevent unbalanced commissions, and ignores the rights and obligations required by\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   , leaving the public to pay any concomitant price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW DOCUMENTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Apart from Plaintiff's Motion, the Court separately considers Defendants' offer to permit Plaintiff to review the requested documents, without receiving copies or taking notes. This is not a reasonable offer. If Defendants have decided that Plaintiff should be permitted to review documents, then he should be permitted to take notes and to make copies if he thinks that doing so would be useful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
