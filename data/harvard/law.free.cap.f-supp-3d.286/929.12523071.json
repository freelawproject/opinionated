The Illinois Election Code provides that candidates for the offices plaintiffs seek must submit a petition for nomination containing \"at least the number\n   of signatures equal to 0.5% of the qualified electors of [their] party who cast votes at the last preceding general election in Cook County.\" This requirement means, for the 2018 election cycle, that plaintiffs Acevedo and Raila (candidates for Cook County Sheriff and Cook County Assessor, respectively) had to obtain 8,236 qualified signatures, while plaintiffs Shaw, Stroger, Joyce, Williams, and Avila (candidates for Commissioner of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago) had to obtain 8,075 qualified signatures to be included on the Democratic primary ballot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   10 ILCS 5/7-10(d)(1), 5/7-10(g). A separate provision of the Illinois Election Code establishes that candidates for statewide office are required to submit petitions containing a minimum of 5,000 qualified signatures. 10 ILCS 5/7-10(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The complaint alleges that each plaintiff submitted a petition with signatures facially in excess of the relevant minimum requirement. But signature records examinations by the Cook County Clerk and the Chicago Board of Election Commissioner determined that each petition but Raila's (which evidently is still under challenge) fell short of the required number of valid signatures. All plaintiffs, however, obtained more than the 5,000 valid signatures that would have qualified them for inclusion on the Democratic primary election had they been running for statewide office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that their exclusion from the Democratic primary ballot pursuant to 10 ILCS 5/7-10 violates the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment under\n   <em>\n    Illinois State Board of Elections v.

But based on \"the affidavits, the evidence of the statute's effect in past elections and the evidence presented during a two-hour hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction,\" the court concluded that the discrepancy in signature requirements did not pass constitutional muster. Plaintiffs have not sought to present the kind of evidence on which the\n   <em>\n    Gjersten\n   </em>\n   court relied. In fact, asked at oral argument whether the candidate field for the offices plaintiffs seek had been larger in past election cycles, when the signature requirement was less than 5,000 (which, if so, might suggest that the higher minimums in the 2018 election cycle had a material negative effect on candidates' ability to obtain the necessary signatures), plaintiffs had no clear answer. In the present posture of this case,\n   <em>\n    Gjersten\n   </em>\n   supports defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Further, as defendants point out, numerous cases have upheld minimum signature requirements substantially more burdensome than the 0.5% requirement that applies to plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Burdick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729479\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/428/\">\n    504 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   435 and n. 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729479\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/428/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (upholding Hawaii's \"one percent of the State's registered voters\" requirement and noting its approval of equally or more burdensome requirements) (citing\n   <em>\n    Norman v.

Although these cases indeed do not establish a bright-line rule or \"litmus test\" for constitutionality, they do reflect the range of restrictions courts have considered to be reasonable. In the face of these decisions, plaintiffs must come forward with something more than dogged reliance on an expansive reading of\n   <em>\n    Socialist Workers Party\n   </em>\n   to show that the signature requirement the Illinois Election Code imposes on them amounts to an unreasonable burden on their fundamental rights. Because they have not, and because\n   <em>\n    Socialist Workers Party\n   </em>\n   does not, without more, transform a facially reasonable ballot restriction into an Equal Protection violation each time one class of candidates in a smaller political subdivision is subject to a more onerous signature requirement than another class of candidates in a larger one, plaintiffs' motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    Although plaintiffs' motion is styled, \"Emergency Motion for Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order,\" defendants were present at both of the hearings, and the Illinois State Board of Elections and its individual members filed a written response to the motion.

To be clear, however, their complaint does not claim that the challenged provisions of the Illinois Election Code create suspect race- or gender-based classes, or that the statute discriminates against them based on their race and/or gender. Indeed, none of the cases plaintiffs cite concerns allegedly race- or gender-discriminatory election laws. Their theory, rooted exclusively in\n    <em>\n     Socialist Workers Party\n    </em>\n    and its progeny, is that the statute creates geographic classifications that have no rational relation to any legitimate state interest.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
