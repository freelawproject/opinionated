The principal\n   question raised by the Motion is when, if ever, a retailer's website that is inaccessible to visually impaired persons may be the subject of a lawsuit by such a person under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Motion, filed by Defendant Jo-Ann Stores, LLC (\"Jo-Ann\"), contends that the Complaint filed by Plaintiff Rebecca Castillo (\"Castillo\") fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under the ADA for two reasons: (1) the ADA may not be applied to websites at all; and (2) in the alternative, Castillo has failed to allege to the extent required that her inability to access Jo-Ann's website acted as a barrier to her obtaining goods and services at Jo-Ann's physical store locations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Castillo has filed an opposition brief (Doc. 11) and Jo-Ann has replied (Doc. 12). For the reasons set forth below, the Court concludes that Castillo's Complaint states a claim under Title III of the ADA because it sufficiently alleges a nexus between the website and Jo-Ann's physical locations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Allegations of the Complaint\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Rebecca Castillo (\"Castillo\"), a resident of California, is a blind and visually impaired person who requires screen-reading software to read website content. Complaint, Doc. 1, pp. 1, 3, \u00b6\u00b6 1 and 10. Defendant Jo-Ann Stores, LLC (\"Jo-Ann\") is a specialty retailer of crafts and fabrics that is headquartered in the Northern District of Ohio. Doc. 1, p. 3, \u00b6\u00b6 11 and 12. Consumers may purchase products from Jo-Ann in person at its brick-and-mortar stores or online through Jo-Ann's website, www.joann.com.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Castillo alleges that Jo-Ann has failed to make its website accessible to blind or visually impaired individuals and that such failure discriminates against her and other blind or visually impaired individuals in violation of Title III of the ADA and California's Unruh Civil Rights Act (\"UCRA\"). Doc. 1, pp. 13-16. She seeks a declaratory judgment that Jo-Ann violated both Title III of the ADA and UCRA, preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting Jo-Ann from further violations, compensatory damages, and attorney fees and expenses. Doc. 1, p. 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Castillo alleges that screen-reading software such as the software she uses\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   works only if the information on a website is capable of being rendered into meaningful text. If not, the blind or visually-impaired user cannot access the website content that is available to sighted users. Doc. 1, p. 4, \u00b6 18. Currently, screen-reading software is the only method a blind or visually-impaired person can use to independently access the internet, websites and other digital content. Doc. 1, p. 4, \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Jo-Ann's website, www.joann.com, offers customers the following: a physical store locator feature; information about sales; offers and discounts (both in-store and online); the ability to browse product selections and to find product information; and the ability to make purchases. Doc. 1, pp. 3, 7-8, \u00b6\u00b6 12, 28. Jo-Ann's website is\n   not capable of being rendered into meaningful text, i.e., a person cannot access the above-cited services on www.joann.com using screen-reading software. Doc. 1, pp. 8-9, \u00b6 37. Castillo alleges that she has attempted unsuccessfully to access www.joann.com using screen reading software. Doc. 1, p. 8, \u00b6 33. She alleges that she was unable to complete an online transaction before the website timed out, and she was unable to access graphics and links on the website. Doc. 1, pp. 9-10, \u00b6\u00b6 37, 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Castillo makes several allegations with respect to the effect of the website's inaccessibility on her ability to access Jo-Ann's brick-and-mortar stores: she alleges that she was unable to use the store locator feature on the website to locate a physical store (Doc. 1, p. 9, \u00b6 37(b) ); that the access barriers she has encountered on www.joann.com have deterred her from visiting or locating Jo-Ann's brick and mortar stores (Doc. 1, pp. 8, 10, \u00b6\u00b6 36, 43); and that visually impaired persons cannot learn about in-store and online sales, offers and discounts, or schedule shipment or in-store pickup of purchases (Doc. 1, p. 13, \u00b6 51).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Robins\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/\">\n    136 S.Ct. 1540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/\">\n    194 L.Ed.2d 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) ). Specifically, Jo-Ann contends that, at most, Castillo's Complaint contains allegations of \"mere technical\" violations of Title III \"without alleging that she was actually unable to obtain Defendant's goods and services at its stores\" and, therefore, she does not meet the \"more rigorous\" articulation of \"concrete harm\" required by\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   .

She alleges that the inaccessibility of the website to her and other visually impaired persons constitutes a violation of Title III of the ADA, which provides that no individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of their disability in the full and equal enjoyment of goods and services of a place of public accommodation. See, e.g., Doc. 1, pp. 8-10, \u00b6\u00b6 31-40. Castillo thus has alleged an injury in fact that is concrete. Therefore, she has standing to sue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The plaintiffs alleged that the \"blackout rule\" was discriminatory because they had no other way to access the game; for instance, they could not listen to it on the radio because of their hearing impairment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"179547\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/59/580/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court's decision granting the defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. It explained first, that the \"blackout rule\" was not discriminatory because it affected both hearing-abled and hearing-impaired alike, i.e., neither could watch the games on television.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"179547\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/59/580/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Next, it found that none of the defendants was a place of public accommodation and the \"service\" that the plaintiff sought, the television broadcast, \"does not involve a place of public accommodation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"179547\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/59/580/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"179547\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/59/580/\">\n    at 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, the Court observed that there were two statutes relevant to televised broadcasts that did not indicate an intent by Congress to include the \"blackout rule\" within the purview of the ADA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"179547\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/59/580/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing the Communications Act of 1934 and the Television Decoder Circuitry Act of 1990).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The facts in\n   <em>\n    Stoutenborough\n   </em>\n   are very different from the facts in this case. First, the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Stoutenborough\n   </em>\n   did not show that the service they complained of discriminated against them vis-a-vis non-disabled persons. Castillo, however, alleges that Jo-Ann's website is discriminatory because visually-impaired people cannot access it but visually-abled people can. Next, it is undisputed that Jo-Ann owns and operates places of public accommodation, i.e., its brick-and-mortar stores. In contrast, none of the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Stoutenborough\n   </em>\n   were places of public accommodation. The broadcast service in\n   <em>\n    Stoutenborough\n   </em>\n   was held to not involve a place of public accommodation. Finally, unlike the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Stoutenborough\n   </em>\n   , Jo-Ann does not identify a federal statute relevant to this case that indicates a legislative intent that the ADA not apply to Jo-Ann's website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Thus,\n   <em>\n    Stoutenborough\n   </em>\n   does not foreclose Castillo's Title ADA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Castillo has alleged a nexus between Jo-Ann's website and its physical stores that is sufficient to state a claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Jo-Ann argues in the alternative that, even if Title III does not completely bar claims pertaining to websites, Castillo is required to allege a \"strong\" nexus between Jo-Ann's inaccessible website and its physical places of public accommodation, i.e., its brick-and-mortar stores. Doc. 10, p. 11. It contends that Castillo cannot show a strong nexus because she does not allege that the website \"impeded or prevented\" her from entering a Jo-Ann store. Doc. 10, p. 12. In her Opposition, Castillo argues that there is a clear nexus between the barriers she encountered on the website and Jo-Ann's physical locations: among other things, the website contained an inaccessible store locator feature that \"deterred\" her from locating and visiting a physical store. Doc. 11, p. 11. She also alleges that she was unable to make purchases and have products shipped from the store to her home and that Jo-Ann could not \"effectively communicate information about products and goods offered for sale in physical locations.\" Doc. 11, pp. 11-12.

In other words, the plaintiff requested that the court order the defendant to adopt a specific standard for web accessibility.

The Ninth Circuit explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   Retroactive application of the viewing angle interpretation is appropriate only as of the date on which AMC received constructive notice that the government viewed \u00a7 4.33.3 as incorporating a comparable viewing angles requirement and intended to enforce that requirement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5733906\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/549/760/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5733906\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/549/760/\">\n    at 768-769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Thus,\n   <em>\n    AMC\n   </em>\n   arose in a much different procedural and factual context than this case and does not support Jo-Ann's assertion that Castillo's Complaint should be dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gorecki\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202957736\">\n    2017 WL 2957736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (explaining that the\n   <em>\n    AMC\n   </em>\n   court reviewed whether a district court's comprehensive remedial plan was appropriate after granting the DOJ summary judgment and not in a ruling on a motion to dismiss);\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Andrews v.

Doc. 12, pp. 16-18 (citing Doc. 1, p. 14, \u00b6 60).

Doc. 10, pp. 20-21. As explained above, Castillo's Title III claim is a viable claim.
