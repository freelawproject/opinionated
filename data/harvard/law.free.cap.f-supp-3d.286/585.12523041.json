AARON, United States Magistrate Judge\n   Before the Court is a fee application of Defendant, Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research (\"SKI\") (ECF No. 155). For the reasons set forth below, SKI's fee application is granted. Plaintiff, Errant Gene Therapeutics, LLC (\"EGT\"), is ordered to pay to SKI $88,339.00 in attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   By Opinion and Order, dated June 5, 2017 (ECF No. 149; hereinafter \"June 5 Order\"), Magistrate Judge Ellis ordered that EGT pay the reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of SKI in bringing two motions for sanctions (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , ECF Nos. 100 &amp; 134). Magistrate Judge Ellis also ordered that \"SKI submit hours and rates for the Court's approval.\" Pursuant to the June 5 Order, SKI submitted its hours and rates, and filed a fee application, dated June 19, 2017 (ECF No. 155).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On its application, SKI currently is seeking fees in the amount of $122,100.20.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   EGT has opposed SKI's fee application and supplement. (ECF Nos. 168 &amp; 180.) EGT asserts in its opposition that SKI's application Is \"excessive,\" and EGT requests at least a \"90% reduction.\" (Pl.'s Opp. to Def.'s Fee Appl., ECF No. 168 at 3.) EGT also asserts that the hours spent by SKI's attorneys were \"staggering.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After the retirement of Magistrate Judge Ellis, SKI's fee application was assigned to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Applicable Legal Standards\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The June 5 Order requires EGT to pay SKI's \"reasonable attorneys' fees.\" (ECF No. 149.) In determining reasonable attorneys' fees in this case, the Court will use the lodestar approach to determine a \"presumptively reasonable fee\" by calculating the number of hours reasonably expended by counsel on the litigation and\n   multiply that number of hours by reasonable hourly rates.\n   <em>\n    Millea v.

First, the Court notes that the hourly rate for partner Charles Weiss was reduced from $780.00 in 2016 to $765.00 in 2017, and thus will use the lower hourly rate in calculating reasonable fees due for his time. Second, the Court notes that the hourly rate for associate Lin Weeks increased from $325.00 in 2016 to $382.00 in 2017 (a 17.5% increase), in circumstances where the hourly rate for Mr. Weiss decreased (as noted above), and the hourly rate for the other two associates increased by less than one percent. Thus, the Court will use the 2016 hourly rate of $325.00 for Mr. Weeks in calculating reasonable\n   fees due for his time. The Court in its discretion also will use the 2016 hourly rate of $450.00 for the time billed by associate Leonie W. Huang.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Number of hours\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court finds that the number of hours billed by Charles Weiss, the sole partner staffed to the matter, were reasonable, but that the number of hours billed by associates should be reduced. SKI seeks payment for 172.2 hours of time for associate Leonie Huang.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In determining the reasonableness of hours expended for fee-shifting purposes, there is a balance to be struck between principles of thoroughness and efficiency. Indeed, what one party finds to be thorough may seem to the other party to be excessive. Ms. Huang billed substantial amounts of time to the matter. Indeed, for 10 of the time entries of Ms. Huang, which were in excess of 8 hours per day, SKI itself reduced each of those entries to 8 hours. (Decl. of C. Weiss, ECF No. 156, \u00b6 9.) Then, in addition to 42.7 hours of junior associate time, Benjamin Wilson, a senior associate,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   also billed time to the matter. Although the addition of a third associate to the litigation team may have brought value to the client, the Court finds in its discretion that it is not reasonable to pass along to EGT the cost of the time for Mr. Wilson. Moreover, the Court finds 150 hours of Ms. Huang's time to be a reasonable amount of time for which to compensate SKI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Fees awarded\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Taking into account all the relevant factors under applicable law, the Court determines in its discretion that the following chart represents the reasonable attorneys' fees due to SKI on its application:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-27\"><strong>NAME</strong> <strong>TITLE</strong> <strong>HOURS</strong> <strong>RATE</strong> <strong>FEES</strong> Charles A.

(ECF No. 155, at 2.) In July 2017, in its reply memorandum, SKI supplemented its fee application, seeking additional fees for preparing its application and its reply memorandum (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 173.) The Court in its discretion declines to base its award on any amounts in excess of those sought in the initial fee application.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    In its Sur-Reply filed with permission of the Court (ECF No. 180), EGT seems to argue that it should no longer be sanctioned pursuant to the June 5 Order, in view of Magistrate Judge Ellis's Opinion and Order, dated October 16, 2017 (the \"October 16 Order\"), wherein Judge Ellis declined to hold EGI in contempt. (ECF No. 177.) EGI argues that October 16 Order \"vitiates and supersedes\" the June 5 Order. (ECF No. 180 at 2.) This challenge to the June 5 Order is not properly before the Court, inasmuch as no motion has been made directed to the June 5 Order, and this Court on the motion before it need only determine the amount of reasonable attorneys' fees due. In any event, the Court notes that the October 16 Order makes explicit references to the June 5 Order without calling it into question in any way. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 177 at 1, 3.) Further, the October 16 Order draws a distinction between the situation presented in the October 16 Order and that presented by the \"prior two sanctions orders,\" one of which was the June 5 Order.
