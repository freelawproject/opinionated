Plaintiff last resided there in April of 2013.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Duell was the mother of the three deceased children and one injured child and, at the time of the fire, still resided in the home with her ex-boyfriend, the decedent David Terry, who was the father of three of the children.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Almost immediately after the fire, the City of Schenectady Fire Department contacted the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (\"ATF\") to assist in the investigation of the fire.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21. During the ensuing days and months, various federal, state, and local members of law enforcement joined in the investigation.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Almost immediately after the fire was extinguished, arson was suspected.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22. The investigation revealed that the fire in the building, a wood-framed, two-family residence, started in the stairwell leading to the second story apartment.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Further, the cause of the fire was determined to be intentionally set by someone igniting gasoline that was placed in the stairwell.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On the day before the fire, May 1, 2013, Plaintiff had stayed at a motel in Saratoga Springs with two friend, including Bryan Fish.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1 at \u00b6 23. After leaving the motel, Plaintiff and Fish \"walked around Saratoga Springs and hung out in both a Stewart's Ice Cream Shop and McDonalds on Broadway.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Sometime between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m. on that date, Jennica Duell met Plaintiff and Fish after traveling from Schenectady.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The three continued to hang out in Saratoga with various other friends before spending the night at a friend's apartment at Jefferson Terrace, a public housing development in Saratoga Springs.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At around 8:30 a.m., on May 2, 2013, Plaintiff, Duell, and Fish awoke and went to a Stewart's on South Broadway to purchase breakfast and snacks to prepare for their travel back to Schenectady.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24. It was there where, on a television displaying the news, the three learned about the fire and ensuing fatalities.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \"Their reactions of shock, grief, and hysteria were recorded on the store's surveillance system, including [P]laintiff punching something.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After watch the report, the three obtained cab fare back to Schenectady from a sympathetic waitress at a restaurant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25. Besides expressing their obvious anguish, Duell additionally discussed who she believed was responsible for setting the fire that killed her children and David Terry.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   According to the complaint, Duell was recorded stating \" 'I do not know if a part of\n   me thinks that someone started the fire, was started. Because Dave's ... been having issues with his girlfriend's ex and he threatened to kill Dave.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Duell also borrowed the cab driver's telephone to call people to learn more of the circumstances surrounding the fire.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Investigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   According to the complaint, it was back in Schenectady where Plaintiff learned for the first time that, despite not being in the same county as the fire, he was the prime suspect for having set it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1 at \u00b6 26. After arriving at Duell's mother's house with Duell, he exited the apartment to get fresh air and was immediately confronted by various members of the Schenectady Police Department.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff was asked if he wanted to accompany them to the police station to talk about the fire and he agreed to do so.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Once at the police station, law enforcement, including Defendant Eric Hesch, questioned Plaintiff concerning the fire and his whereabouts that morning and the previous night.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27. Plaintiff told them about his time in Saratoga Springs and was asked for names of people who could corroborate his story and verify his alibi, which he promptly provided.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Aside from both Duell and Fish, Plaintiff provided the detectives with three names of individuals he was with in Saratoga, including the resident of the apartment in Jefferson Terrace, where he had spent the night.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff also conveyed to them the location of the Stewart's where he learned of the fire and that he traveled back to Schenectady in a cab.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   In fact, while it was then unknown to him, Plaintiff later learned that, after he and Duell had exited the cab, the police removed Bryan Fish from it.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   During the initial questioning, detectives asked Plaintiff if he knew whether anyone would have a motive to start the fire.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1 at \u00b6 28. Plaintiff mentioned to them that he was aware that an individual named Edward Leon had been involved in an ongoing dispute with David Terry over a woman, Bryanne Frolke, who had, in the past, dated Leon but was then dating Terry.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff also mentioned that he was aware, both from his stay at Terry's residence and through Duell, that Terry and others close to him had been receiving threatening text messages, some anonymous and some purportedly from \"The Undertaker.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff told them that everyone concerned knew that the text messages were from Leon.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At this point, investigators, including Defendant Meeks, continued to investigate Plaintiff and told him that he had been implicated in the fire by his own friends and that his bringing up Edward Leon was an attempt to shift the blame from himself to others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29. In fact, they accused Plaintiff of being the person who sent the anonymous and \"The Undertaker\" signed texts.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Investigators confronted Plaintiff with texts from a third party's telephone, later determined to be Fish's, in which Fish described Plaintiff as being angry.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   According to the complaint, Defendant \"Hesch or another investigator also claimed to smell gasoline on [P]laintiff, in spite of later forensic tests being negative for the presence of gasoline on [P]laintiff's clothing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Unbeknownst to Plaintiff, Duell was also transported to the police station shortly after Plaintiff arrived.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30. After the initial questioning, the detectives left Plaintiff alone in a room for hours when, as Plaintiff later learned, they began questioning both Duell and Fish.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   During their initial investigation, Defendants Stocklas, Maher, and Hesch, among others, questioned Fish, who had a documented history of learning disabilities and\n   attention deficit disorder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31. Initially, as is set forth in the federal criminal complaint, Fish's version of the events of the night of the fire mimicked Plaintiff's.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Fish claimed that he had been with Plaintiff, Duell, and others in Saratoga the entire night.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   According to the complaint, \"[a]fter Fish continued to persist in this accurate version of events, he was told that someone placed him at the fire scene.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant Stocklas eventually told Fish that a newspaper reported had not only seen him at the location, but that this reporter also picked him out of a photo array, \"a story that was untrue and obviously a ruse, while another investigator warned him to the effect of 'He'd never again see the light of day.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It was at this point that Fish revealed how he, Plaintiff, and Duell had been drinking and using drugs the night before and, as such, he could not remember many details.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   At some point near the beginning of the interrogation Fish vomited and, when told that the potential sentence for anyone convicted of the arson was death, he threatened suicide.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Further, the complaint alleges that Defendant Stocklas or Defendant Maher \"gratuitously mentioned to him that a water bottle had been used to pour gasoline at the fire scene. Where this information came from is unknown, but their mention of it occurred prior to Fish stating that a wattle bottle had been used.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Eventually, Fish signed a sworn statement where he claimed that he, Plaintiff, and Duell traveled to Schenectady in a black car with an unknown driver.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32. While he stated that he did not know the route they traveled, he indicated that he thought the purpose of the trip was for them to fight Terry and another occupant of the Hulett Street house.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Fish recalled smelling gasoline and further stated that he saw Plaintiff pour something into the hallway of the Hulett Street house from a Poland Spring water bottle and then light it.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants Disbrow and Steele, both then of the City of Schenectady Police Department, and others, questioned Duell for nine hours on May 2, 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33. While being interrogated from 12:45 p.m. until at least 5:00 p.m., Duell maintained that she had been with Plaintiff and Fish in Saratoga Springs the entire night.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Within a half hour of her interrogation, Duell, like Plaintiff, mentioned Edward Leon as a possible suspect.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Duell indicated that he was the ex-boyfriend of decedent David Terry's girlfriend Bryanne Frolke.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Duell related how Frolke had been having problems with Leon and how her apartment had recently suffered a fire.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   She told them that Leon was thought to have started that fire and, at one point in the interrogation, someone remarked, \"in substance and in part, that if Leon set one fire, he was capable of setting the one under investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Nevertheless, investigators repeatedly warned Duell during this time that she would never again see her lone surviving child and told her that they did not believe her story.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1 at \u00b6 34. Eventually, someone told her that several witnesses, including a tenant, placed her at the location of the fire.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   At about 6:45 p.m., Duell signed a sworn statement that she was present with Fish and another person when Plaintiff allegedly started the fire.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Three days after the first interrogation, Fish was again interviewed for hours and again provided a sworn statement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35. After hearing Duell's statement, the complaint alleges that Defendants \"attempted to conform and coalesce it with Fish's statement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In some regards, the complaint contends that this second statement\n   differed from the first \"in material aspects.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For example, despite his earlier lack of memory, Fish now gave a detailed, street by street description of the route that he, Duell, Plaintiff and the driver took to Schenectady.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   He described the car as having four doors and being maroon in color.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   He remembered seeing a small red gas can with a yellow nozzle that Plaintiff used to pour gas into a Poland Spring bottle.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \"Not surprisingly, the new details conformed to Duell's statement. Despite having no recollection of the events, he signed a detailed statement putting him at the crime scene with Duell and implicating Butler and mentioned the use of a 'Poland Spring\" water bottle.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"Thus, according to law enforcement accounts, both Duell and Fish, without having first conferred with each other prior to their respective interrogations, still managed to give materially consistent, albeit wholly false and contrived, detailed, and strikingly similar accounts of their and Butler's involvement with the fire.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36. Indeed, the federal criminal complaint refers to the two stories as having been developed over time and notes that there are several inconsistencies that developed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Butler told detectives that he had not committed the arson and had been in Saratoga all night. [Fish and Duell] initially also said they had been in Saratoga all night, but later gave sworn statements describing their presence with Butler in Schenectady when he set the fire. Their statements, and those of other witnesses, have developed over time, and there are some inconsistencies between witness accounts of the route of travel, acquisition of gasoline, and other details. However, after recanting their initial echoing of Butler's alibi, eyewitnesses have consistently stated that Butler set the fire.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Dkt. No. 1-2 at \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On June 4, 2013, Eric Fish was again interrogated and provided what would be his third known sworn statement concerning the fire.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1 at \u00b6 37. Notably, Fish acknowledged that he had not been honest with investigators concerning the fire.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   He further admitted to testifying falsely before th grand jury and acknowledged that Defendant Maher had shown him documents and portions of the investigations which \"proved\" that he had not been truthful previously.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   In this version of events, on the morning of the fire, Fish claimed that Plaintiff drove a dark colored car to Schenectady with him and Duell in it.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   This time, in contrast to a previous detailed description of the route from Saratoga to Schenectady, he had no recollection of what roads they took.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Further, despite his earlier denials of any supposed intention to commit arson, Fish now claimed that, on the way to Schenectady, Plaintiff openly remarked \"They're dead. They're gonna burn.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On March 4, 2014, Fish made a handwritten statement denying that he was at 438 Hulett Street on the night of the fire.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   According to the complaint, despite hours of interrogation, Plaintiff \"never deviated from his truthful account of his whereabouts and the events of the prior evening and never claimed any involvement in the fire,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , he maintained that he had been in Saratoga the entire evening.\" Dkt. No. 1 at \u00b6 39. Plaintiff also claims that he \"did say something to the effect that he would never want to hurt Duell and the children,\" which law enforcement apparently considered to be an inculpatory admission of his guilt.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff was arrested and charged in state court with, among other things, multiple counts of\n   murder and arson.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   After his arraignment on those charges, Plaintiff was remanded to the Schenectady County jail.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Upon seeing news reports of Plaintiff's arrest, James Frolke telephoned the Schenectady Police Department to inform them that he believed that Plaintiff was not responsible for the fire.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40. James Frolke is the father of Bryanne Frolke, who was then the girlfriend of the decedent David Terry and who had once dated Edward Leon.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   James Frolke informed the police that his daughter had recently broken up with Leon and characterized the breakup as \"tumultuous.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He stated that Leon sent his daughter several unsettling and threatening text messages.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Frolke noted that Leon had a tattoo of a wedding ring with Bryanne's initials on his finger.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   He recounted for the police an incident in March of 2013, a week after Bryanne had asked Leon to leave her residence. On that occasion, Leon had visited Bryanne and her children when that house caught fire.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Leon boasted of helping Bryanne and the children out of the burning house.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Despite this, James told the police that he had suspected Leon of setting that fire due, in large part, to Leon's demeanor and several individuals claiming to have observed Leon with a gas can before the fire broke out.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   As such, Plaintiff claims that, only hours after the fire, Edward Leon's name had been mentioned as a person with a motive by three separate individuals, Plaintiff, Duell, and James Frolke.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   According to Plaintiff, James Frolke had no prior relationship with either Plaintiff or Duell.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   James Frolke further recounted how Leon attempted to see Bryanne on the morning of the fatal fire and that James refused to let him see her.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41. He recalled that, on that day, Leon was driving a light colored minivan with a different colored back door.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   According to James Frolke, members of the Schenectady Police Department told him that they had \"pretty good information that [Plaintiff] is the guy and that they pretty much dismissed what [he] had to say.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On May 6, 2013, Duell returned to the police station and was again questioned.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

During this interrogation, Duell reiterated her initial claim that neither she, Plaintiff, nor Fish left Saratoga the night or morning prior to learning of the fire.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   According to the complaint, an investigator who was apparently not satisfied \"with her recantation of her incriminating statement\" told her the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   You're not being honest with us, Jennica.

Rather, the only evidence against Plaintiff was from four individuals who provided continually evolving statements to Defendants, which eventually led to several prosecutions and convictions for perjury. Further, the complaint indicates that the only credible evidence indicated that another individual was responsible for the fire. Although the threatening text messages sent to David Terry were initially attributed to Plaintiff, it was later determined by the investigator working for Plaintiff that the text messages originated from a prepaid phone purchased in Westchester, New York by Edward Leon.

Accordingly, any claim that Plaintiff may be seeking to allege under the first clause of section 1985(2) must fail. Finally, even assuming that Plaintiff intended to bring a cause of action under section 1985(2), the claim is still subject to dismissal because, as discussed above, Plaintiff has failed to plausibly allege the requisite meeting of the minds by Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Based on the foregoing, to the extent that Plaintiff was attempting to assert claims based on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1985, those claims are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

The defendant, however, argued that the plaintiff's Fourth Amendment claim should be considered most analogous to the tort of false arrest and that it should accrue when legal process commences.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609962\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/911/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The Supreme Court declined to decide this issue and remanded the matter back to the Seventh Circuit.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    As a result of this Memorandum-Decision and Order, the only remaining claim is Plaintiff's malicious prosecution claim against all Defendants.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
