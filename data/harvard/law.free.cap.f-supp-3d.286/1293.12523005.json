In its Motion, Defendant argues that there exist no genuine issues of material fact supporting Plaintiff's claims of hostile work environment and negligent supervision, and therewith Defendant deserves judgment as a matter of law pursuant to the prevailing legal standards governing the claims. The court finds that Plaintiff suffered sexual harassment, but the Eleventh Circuit standard prevents this court from finding that she suffered a hostile work environment. Based upon the following discussion, the court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \"[t]he court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 56(a). Defendant, as the party seeking summary judgment, bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, which it believes demonstrates the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\n   <em>\n    Clark v.

As part of her hiring, Williams joined the Internal Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union (\"IAM\"). IAM represents ULA's production technicians under a collective bargaining agreement that the union maintains with ULA. IAM also declared to Williams and her coworkers that they should bring any concerns or problems related to their employment with ULA to IAM, and IAM would then voice the concerns to ULA on the workers' behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   During Williams's initial orientation at ULA, ULA introduced Williams to the company's anti-harassment and anti-discrimination policies. ULA's policies state that any employee who believes she has been harassed by anyone in the workplace should report the matter to management or Human Resources. Williams also received periodic refreshers of these policies, including a session in November 2012, and understood that she should follow these policies if she believed she had been harassed in the workplace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ULA assigned Williams to work in the multi-layer insulation blanket shop (\"blanket shop\"), where Williams works with sewing machines and hand tools. Because ULA designated the blanket shop as a \"clean room\", ULA required Williams, as well as the other employees who worked in the blanket shop, to wear specific garments to ensure that the room remained sanitized and contaminant-free. Around August 2011, Brad Hawkins began serving as the blanket shop supervisor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Towards the end of 2011, Hawkins began to sexually harass Williams. The harassment began with sexually evocative facial gestures at Williams while he squeezed oil bottles and said something along the lines of \"ooh, this is juicy.\" Although Williams tried to ignore him, these types of comments occurred repeatedly. Around the same time, Hawkins told Williams and a coworker a joke about cows having sex. Williams tried to deflect and told Hawkins that the joke was inappropriate. Throughout the end of 2011, Mr. Hawkins continued to sexually harass Williams and her coworkers with sexual innuendos and facial gestures, though Williams could not recall the details of these innuendos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Williams took two leaves-of-absence in 2012 due to health problems. Upon her return from her first leave of absence in July 2012, Hawkins approached Williams from behind as she returned to her workstation from a break and informed her that he was doing a \"butt block\" for her. Williams grew uncomfortable and asked Hawkins what he meant, and he stated that he would block her butt so that nobody else could see it. Williams expressed her discomfort with the statement and told him to cease the remarks. During this same time period, Hawkins told Williams that she needed a \"sugar daddy\" and a \"work husband,\" and that he could be hers. In an attempt to deter him from making further comments, Williams stated that she did not need one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After she returned to work in October 2012 following her second leave-of-absence, Hawkins commented to Williams on two separate occasions that he asked a physician to place an extra stitch in his spouse's\n   vagina to make it tighter for him after childbirth. Each time, Williams expressed her discomfort with Hawkins about those comments. During this same time period, Hawkins made a comment to Williams about how he would allegedly not allow her to work in another department because another employee, Jonathan, was known as a \"hound dog\" and he did not want Williams around Jonathan. Hawkins also frequently discussed Jonathan's sexual exploits around Williams, who felt increasingly uncomfortable with these comments and informed Hawkins about her discomfort.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Around Christmas 2012, Hawkins joked that he remained unsure about letting Williams complete overtime work in a different department because the male workers in that area would want to see her \"down on all fours.\" Williams responded to the comment, and Hawkins laughed and repeated himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   During the first few months of 2013, Hawkins addressed work quality issues with the employees in Williams's department. In April 2013, Williams and her coworkers noticed that Hawkins performed work on sewing machines that ULA reserved for union members. Around the same time, Williams and her coworkers approached an IAM representative to express their concerns about Hawkins's behavior. (Ex. A 65:6-23, 89:3-22, Ex. B). On April 30, 2013, two IAM union stewards notified Hawkins's supervisor, John Heslop, that they needed a meeting to discuss the concerns regarding Hawkins's behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On May 6, 2013, two IAM union stewards met with Heslop and Cindy Lovell of ULA's human resources department to discuss the concerns that Williams and her coworkers shared about Hawkins's behavior. Without providing specific examples, the stewards notified ULA that Hawkins created a hostile work environment by uttering sexually explicit remarks that discomforted Williams and her coworkers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On May 14, 2013, ULA commenced an investigation into the allegations that the union stewards brought forth during their meeting. Lovell served as the case manager for this investigation and interviewed Williams and five of her product technician coworkers. ULA ensured that at least one IAM union representative sat in on every interview. Lovell asked each individual the same questions regarding Hawkins's behavior and his treatment of the employees he supervised. Four of the product technician workers, including Williams, commented on Hawkins's unethical behavior in the workshop and his issuance of corrective orders to the technicians when he found mistakes in their work. Williams, along with two of her coworkers, told Lovell that Hawkins made sexual comments to them. The two workers could not corroborate many of Williams's statements about what Hawkins said to her, but one of them had overheard Hawkins telling Williams that she needed a work husband.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In her interview with Lovell, Williams explained her concerns about Hawkins's untrustworthiness, his sharing of information about coworkers who were on leave, his working on sewing machines that ULA reserved for union work, and other workplace issues. Lovell also asked Williams whether Hawkins uttered any sexual comments towards her, and she mentioned three of the instances detailed above: (1) the \"juicy\" comment; (2) the \"hound dog\" comment; and (3) the vague joke about cows. However, the day after her interview, Williams sent Lovell an email adding two additional comments that Hawkins made to her: (1) the \"butt block\" comment; and (2) that Hawkins believed that the company did not need a union. Over the course of the investigation, Lovell expressed\n   concerns about Hawkins's trustworthiness and honesty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On June 18, 2013, an IAM representative emailed Darryl Boykins, a Human Resources Business Partner at ULA, with concerns about ULA's lack of action regarding the charges of sexual harassment against Mr. Hawkins. The following day, Lovell interviewed Hawkins and he denied the allegations. At the conclusion of her part in the investigation, Lovell documented her findings and determined that she could not find Williams's comments credible. Lovell based her determination on (1) Williams's interview; (2) Hawkins's denials, (3) the belief that some of Hawkins's comments were not sexual; (4) the lack of witnesses who could corroborate Hawkins's comments; and (5) the fact that Williams did not directly report the comments to ULA's human resources department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Lovell turned her final report over to ULA's Employee Corrective Action Review Team (ECART) for review. ECART consists of a panel of individuals who review an investigator's findings and issue recommendations for corrective action. ECART initially believed that Williams and her coworkers' complaints regarding Hawkins lacked credibility because (1) none of the employees that Hawkins supervised reported any of the alleged comments to Human Resources, which company policy requires; (2) the union did not lodge the complaints remotely contemporaneous to the period Hawkins uttered the remarks; and (3) the union lodged the complaints close to the period Hawkins criticized the workers' performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Boykins, an ECART member and Lovell's supervisor at the time, interviewed Hawkins. Boykins eventually found Hawkins's denials credible and reported this finding to ECART when it met again. ECART concluded that Williams's claims remained unsubstantiated; nevertheless, ECART issued an anti-harassment policy coaching to Hawkins that remained in his personnel file. Heslop administered this coaching to Hawkins in July 2013, and Williams testified that Hawkins did not utter any sexually suggestive comments after that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Throughout her employment with ULA, Williams received two verbal coachings for mistakes in her work, yet Williams never received any pay reduction, suspension, or formal discipline as a result of these verbal coachings. Moreover, ULA has never issued any formal or written discipline against Williams.. Although Williams has remained continuously employed at ULA without any position change, Williams asserts that ULA retaliated against her by failing to hire her for any of the ten jobs that she applied for with ULA and The Boeing Company, one of ULA's parent companies, from 2011 to 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In 2013, ULA discerned a potential contamination issue with a blanket shop product under Hawkins's supervision. Jan Garber, ULA's Ethics Officer, investigated the issue and presented her findings to ECART. Her findings documented Hawkins's dishonesty and numerous policy violations that stemmed from his actions following the blanket room contamination. Based on these findings, ECART terminated Hawkins's employment in January 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   With the encouragement of the IAM union stewards, Williams filed a Charge of Discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") in September 2013. On June 26, 2015, the EEOC issued its determination and concluded that Hawkins sexually harassed Williams, and that his conduct created a hostile work environment because it was sufficiently severe and pervasive. The EEOC further concluded that ULA failed to take reasonable care to correct the\n   harassment once it obtained corroborating information. The EEOC issued Williams her right to sue letter on November 27, 2015, after its conciliation attempt failed (Doc. 23-8 at 2), and she filed this complaint on February 15, 2016. (Doc. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    Williams's Hostile Work Environment Claim Fails Because (1) Hawkins's Conduct Does Not Meet the \"Severe and Pervasive\" Standard and (2) ULA Successfully Satisfies the\n    <em>\n     Faragher - Ellerth\n    </em>\n    Defense.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Title VII deems it unlawful for an employer \"to discriminate against any individual with respect to [her] compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's...sex.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1).

However, with the evidence drawn in the light most favorable to Williams, several of the incidents Williams encountered constitute inappropriate and vulgar sexual harassment: the sexual innuendo and facial gestures that Hawkins made to Williams and her female coworkers, the vague sexual joke about cows, the \"butt block\" comment, the \"hound dog\" comment, the comments about Williams needing a sugar daddy/work husband, his comments about his spouse's body, and the \"all-fours\" comment. Hawkins's alleged remarks reflecting his dislike of the union and his critical comments about Williams's work fail to reflect conduct of a sexual nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Furthermore, Lovell's interviews with Williams's other female coworkers strengthens the conclusion that Hawkins's comments constitute sexual harassment. Two of Williams's coworkers also indicated in their interviews that Hawkins expressed sexual remarks with them.

(Pl. Dep. at 164, ll. 1-24). Williams also testified that Hawkins uttered these types of remarks on a \"daily\" basis, but she narrows down the number of times to approximately twenty.

Williams either ignored Hawkins's comments or responded by informing him that those comments were inappropriate. Williams mentions a verbal coaching (referred to as a PIRS) she received for a mistake in her job performance. This coaching occurred in June 2013, shortly after Hawkins identified a mistake in Williams's work, and Williams believed this discipline reflected retaliation by Hawkins. However, this coaching served as the first and only time that Hawkins issued any type of negative review about her work, and Williams never received any pay reduction, suspension, or formal discipline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Williams argues that Hawkins's supervisory authority, coupled with ULA's knowledge of the EEOC claims Williams filed, possibly contributed to the denials Williams received for the jobs she applied for with ULA and The Boeing Company (\"Boeing\") from 2011 to 2015. Ostensibly, Williams broaches this argument to demonstrate the existence of a tangible employment action emanating from Hawkins's sexual harassment. However, ULA's response to this claim emphasized that ULA contributes no input into Boeing's employment decisions, and Williams provided no evidence to disprove ULA's response. Furthermore, Williams only recalled one job that she bid for within ULA-a lateral transfer to the foam shop. Williams expressed displeasure ULA denied her candidacy for that position, but she also acknowledged that the employee who won the bid enjoyed more seniority than her. Williams provides no further evidence that Hawkins's conduct interfered with her work. While Hawkins's behavior remains inappropriate and unwelcomed, the evidence does not demonstrate it resulted in a tangible employment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Williams argues that this court should give significant weight to the EEOC's findings, which stated that Hawkins's conduct constituted severe and pervasive behavior that created a hostile work environment. Williams refers to a Fifth Circuit case that deems it \"wasteful and unnecessary\" to \"ignore the manpower and resources expended on the EEOC investigation and the expertise acquired by its field investigators in the area of discriminatory employment practices.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Although Williams accurately states that two of her other coworkers expressed concerns about Hawkins's alleged sexual harassment, neither coworker could corroborate the statements Hawkins uttered to Williams. Furthermore, the time gap between Hawkins's utterance of these statements and Williams's report to IAM also concerned ULA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Williams also contests the reasonableness of ULA's investigation timeline. The IAM union representatives met with Heslop and Lovell on May 6, 2013, where they mentioned Williams and her coworkers' concerns about Hawkins's behavior. Eight days later, ULA's HR department commenced an investigation and interviewed Williams and six of her product technician coworkers. Even when Lovell interviewed Williams, Williams did not mention all of the allegedly sexual comments Hawkins uttered to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Williams emphasizes ULA failed to interview Hawkins until a month after the investigation commenced, after an IAM union representative prompted ULA by emailing concerns about the investigation's pace. However, as seen in the evidence, ULA engaged other facets of the investigation during that time, including attempting to trace emails and instant messages that could help corroborate Williams and her coworkers' concerns. After concluding the investigation in July 2013, ULA formally coached Hawkins, and any alleged comments from Hawkins ceased. The court finds that ULA took prompt corrective\n   action upon the conclusion of its meeting with the IAM union representatives by interviewing workers Hawkins supervised, including Williams, and then investigating the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Moreover, \"even if the process in which an employer arrives at a remedy in the case of alleged sexual harassment is somehow defective, the [\n   <em>\n    Faragher - Ellerth\n   </em>\n   ] defense is still available if the remedial result is adequate...In other words, a reasonable result cures an unreasonable process.\"\n   <em>\n    Baldwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3894997\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/480/1287/#p1300\">\n    480 F.3d 1287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1305 (11th Cir. 2007).

Here, Williams concedes that after Hawkins received counseling on the company harassment policy, he ceased the sexual remarks and gestures. Therefore, because the court finds that ULA exercised reasonable care to prevent and to promptly correct sexual harassment, ULA meets the first element of the\n   <em>\n    Faragher - Ellerth\n   </em>\n   defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   To establish the second element of the defense, the employer must show that \"the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\"\n   <em>\n    Faragher\n   </em>\n   , 524 U.S. at 807,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11183186\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/775/#p778\">\n    118 S.Ct. 2275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Ellerth\n   </em>\n   , 524 U.S. at 765,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11183137\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/742/#p745\">\n    118 S.Ct. 2257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, ULA imposed a prompt reporting duty for its employees under its sexual harassment policy: if an employee believes that she has been subjected to sexual harassment, she must report that conduct \"as soon as possible (preferably within three business days of the conduct) to enable the Company to\n   investigate and timely correct any behavior that may be in violation of this policy.\" (Doc. 22-2 at 94). In this case, Williams's complaint to the IAM union in April 2013 occurred nearly sixteen months after Hawkins allegedly began harassing Williams and four months after the \"all fours\" comment-the most recent of the remarks Williams reported during the investigation. This lengthy waiting period not only fails to comply with ULA's policy, but it also falls far outside the acceptable timelines that the Eleventh Circuit recognizes.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Walton v.

ULA's cases involve employees reporting their complaints to either mid-level employees or union stewards who, once upon receiving an employee's complaint of harassment, failed to directly report this complaint to the employer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Madray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11456820\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/208/1290/#p1298\">\n    208 F.3d at 1300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that Publix leadership was not put on notice about plaintiffs' sexual harassment complaints when they reported it to various mid-level managers who did not promptly report it);\n   <em>\n    Speigner v.

These cases presented the issue whether a plaintiff's report of harassment to her union supervisor constituted sufficient notice to the employer. Contrary to those cases, once Williams and her coworkers proceeded with their grievances regarding Hawkins, IAM union representatives scheduled a meeting with ULA's HR representatives a week later. The union representatives proceeded with Williams's complaints and were even present during\n   the interviews with Lovell. Therefore, the court remains unconvinced that Williams's decision to report this grievance to her union representatives instead of directly to ULA leadership constituted an unreasonable failure to follow policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   However, Williams still waited an unreasonable amount of time before reporting this harassment. Her fear of retaliation proves insufficient to overcome her delayed reporting, and the court therefore finds that ULA satisfied the second element of the\n   <em>\n    Faragher - Ellerth\n   </em>\n   defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   For these reasons, there exists no genuine dispute of material fact that ULA established both elements of the\n   <em>\n    Faragher - Ellerth\n   </em>\n   defense, and on that basis the court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   ULA summary judgment on Williams's claim of sexual harassment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    Williams's Negligent Supervision and Training Claim Fails as a Matter of Law Because Hawkins Did Not Commit a Tort under Alabama Law.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   ULA moves for summary judgment on Williams's claims for negligent supervision and training on the basis that Hawkins did not commit a tort against Williams.
