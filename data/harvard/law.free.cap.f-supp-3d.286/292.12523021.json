Gorton, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs Norma Ezell (\"Ezell\"), Leonard M. Whitley, Jr. (\"Whitley\") and Erica Biddings (\"Biddings\") (collectively \"plaintiffs\") bring this putative class action against ten insurance companies and subsidiaries (collectively \"defendants\") alleging that certain commissions charged in connection with annuity payments are unlawful. Pending before this Court is defendants' motion to dismiss. For the reasons that follow, the motion to dismiss will be allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs' putative class action arises from a number of structured settlements of personal injury, wrongful death and workers' compensation claims against non-parties insured by Lexington Insurance Company (\"Lexington\"). The structured settlements provided that the claimants would receive a portion of their settlement payments over time according to a fixed schedule (rather than in a lump sum). The structured settlement portions of those settlements were ultimately funded through the purchase of annuities from a separate life insurance company. Plaintiffs allege that defendants fraudulently deducted 4% from the cash portion of the settlement that the settling parties had agreed would fund the annuity payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Named Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The putative class action is brought by three named plaintiffs, Norma Ezell, Leonard Whitley and Erica Biddings on behalf of themselves and similarly situated settling parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs Norma Ezell (\"Ezell\") and Leonard M. Whitley, Jr. (\"Whitley\") are both residents of Aberdeen, Mississippi. Ezell and Whitley entered into a settlement agreement in April, 2003 with Community Eldercare Services and CLC of West Point, LLC, to resolve wrongful death claims arising from the death of their aunt, Odessa Ware. Lexington was the insurer of the nursing home. Ezell and Whitely each brought claims individually and in their capacity as heirs to the estate of their aunt. Ezell also sued as Administratrix of the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff Erica Biddings (\"Biddings\") resides in Southwest Ranches, Florida. In\n   August, 2009, Biddings settled wrongful death and personal injury claims brought individually and as a personal representative of the estate of her husband, Roddy Major, against Bull Motors LLC, doing business as Maroone Ford. Lexington was the liability insurer of Maroone Ford and was obligated to pay any claim made or judgment obtained against them covered by its policy with Bull Motors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs name ten affiliated insurance companies in their complaint: (1) Lexington, (2) American International Group, Inc. (\"AIG Parent\"), (3) AIG Assurance Company, (4) AIG Property Casualty Company, (5) AIG Specialty Insurance Company, (6) AGL, (7) National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa. (\"NUFIC\"), (8) AGC Life Insurance Company, (9) American General Annuity Services Corporation (\"AGASC\") and (10) AIG Domestic Claims, Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In their complaint, plaintiffs state that nine defendants are subsidiaries of AIG Parent. Throughout their complaint, plaintiffs refer to defendants collectively as \"AIG\". In their motion to dismiss, defendants clarify the relationship of the insurers. They state that Lexington, AIG Assurance Company, AIG Property Casualty Company, AIG Specialty Insurance Company and AGASC are AIG's property and casualty (\"P &amp; C\") insurance companies. Defendants contend that the complaint does not allege that any of AIG's P &amp; C companies, other than Lexington, had any interaction with the defendants. Defendants note that AGL, AGC Life Insurance Company and AGASC are AIG's life insurance companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Settlements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ezell and Whitley settled claims against Community Eldercare Services and CLC of West Point, which were insured by Lexington, in April, 2003. The terms of the settlement of Ezell and Whitley included a lump sum payment and a payment of $200,000 to be annuitized to provide periodic payments beginning in June, 2003. Under that payment structure, Ezell and Whitley were each allocated one half of the $200,000, or $100,000. The annuity to fund future payments was issued by American General Life Insurance Company (\"AGL\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Ezell and Whitely allege they were unaware that the amount listed in the settlement agreement, $200,000, included a commission that would be paid by defendants to someone working on behalf of defendants to settle the claim. They contend that defendants did not inform them that 4% of the annuity premium would be paid to an AIG Approved Broker, Jim Beatty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Biddings entered into a settlement agreement in August, 2009, resolving wrongful death and personal injury claims against Bull Motors LLC, which was insured by Lexington. Like the settlement of Ezell and Whitley, Biddings's settlement agreement with Lexington provided for a cash payment and a set of periodic payments with a then \"present value\" of $1,642,000. Lexington funded three separate annuities issued by three life insurance companies who are unaffiliated with defendants and not named in this action: Allstate Life Insurance Company, Hartford Life Insurance Company and New York Life Insurance Company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Biddings alleges that she was unaware that 4% of the $1,642,000 annuity premium would be paid to AIG Approved Broker Douglas \"Chuck\" Smith. The complaint states that Biddings did not know that the amount to be annuitized included a commission that would be paid to someone working on behalf of defendants to settle the claims brought against Lexington in its capacity as liability insurer to Bull Motors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs commenced this action on January 3, 2017. On March 31, 2017, defendants jointly moved to dismiss the complaint in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Motion to Dismiss\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \"state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl.

In considering the merits of a motion to dismiss, the Court may look only to the facts alleged in the pleadings, documents attached as exhibits or incorporated by reference in the complaint and matters of which judicial notice can be taken.\n   <em>\n    Nollet\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Justices of Trial Court of Mass.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11460639\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/83/204/#p208\">\n    83 F.Supp.2d 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 208 (D.

Although a court must accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in a complaint, that doctrine is not applicable to legal conclusions.\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/\">\n    556 U.S. 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As a preliminary matter, defendants assert that plaintiffs have failed to allege any ascertainable injury to establish standing, requiring dismissal of all of plaintiffs' claims. Defendants contend that plaintiffs have received all of the payments that they are entitled to under the terms of their settlement agreements. Because plaintiffs have received precisely what they bargained for, defendants maintain that the plaintiffs have not alleged a cognizable injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs respond by clarifying their allegations that Lexington did not annuitize the amounts which it was required to annuitize under the terms of the settlement agreements. Plaintiffs contend that only 96% of each settlement amount was annuitized while a 4% commission was \"secretly deducted\" to pay the broker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   To establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must show an injury in fact that is \"concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent\".\n   <em>\n    Blum\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4120878\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/744/790/#p796\">\n    744 F.3d 790\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 796 (1st Cir. 2014) (citing\n   <em>\n    Monsanto Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Geertson Seed Farms\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644345,12455278\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/139/\">\n    561 U.S. 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 148,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644345,12455278\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/139/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644345,12455278\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/139/\">\n    177 L.Ed.2d 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) ). The Supreme Court has emphasized that concreteness requires that the alleged injury \"actually exist\" and amount to more than an \"abstract\" injury.\n   <em>\n    Spokeo, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Robins\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1548\">\n    136 S.Ct. 1540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1548,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1548\">\n    194 L.Ed.2d 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). Particularity, on the other hand, reflects the notion that an injury \"must affect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way\".\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Defenders of Wildlife\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/\">\n    504 U.S. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 560 n.1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/\">\n    119 L.Ed.2d 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In their complaint, plaintiffs allege that defendants failed to allocate the promised amount to the annuity premiums. For each named plaintiff, the complaint states that defendants\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   failed to direct towards the purchase of an annuity for [the named plaintiff] the full [dollar amount] that had been promised and agreed to.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 48, 54, 61. Plaintiffs go on to allege that they were unaware that 4% of the annuity premium was to be paid to the broker in the form of a commission. Defendants respond that plaintiffs fail to state a claim because they do not allege\n   that the full amount promised by Lexington was not annuitized. To the contrary, plaintiffs' complaint states that 4% of the \"cash to be invested in the annuity\" was diverted to pay for the broker fees. \u00b6 64(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendants liken this case to\n   <em>\n    Abdullah ex rel. Abdullah\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Travelers Property Casualty Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11462137\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/83/289/#p291\">\n    83 F.Supp.2d 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 291 (D. Conn. 1999), where the district court held that plaintiffs failed to state a cognizable injury in a case where plaintiffs challenged a commission and rebate scheme related to annuities purchased to fund structured settlements. The plaintiffs claimed that the broker took a commission from the annuity transaction and proceeded to reimburse 75% of that commission to the settling insurer in the form of a rebate. In that case, the plaintiffs failed to allege that their\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   settlements suffered ... or that the value of the annuity was something other than represented.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3966141\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/824/733/#p739\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In a later case in the same district, however, that district court denied a motion to dismiss where the plaintiffs did allege, as plaintiffs do here, that the defendant insurance company deducted 4% from the amount they promised to pay to purchase the annuity in the structured settlement.\n   <em>\n    Spencer, et al.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    The Hartford Fin. Servs. Grp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 05-cv-1681 (D. Conn. Oct. 24, 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiffs here allege that they were injured by defendants' failure to annuitize the amount agreed upon in the terms of the settlement. In their reply memorandum, defendants suggest that plaintiffs' complaint cannot be read to allege that the annuity was not fully funded. Plaintiffs' complaint, however, maintains that defendants failed to do exactly that. Accordingly, plaintiffs have alleged a cognizable injury sufficient to give them standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Contractual Release\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendants also aver that plaintiffs' claims are barred by the terms of their original settlement agreements. They contend that the general releases of any claims against Lexington or its affiliates, together with the merger clauses in the agreements, preclude plaintiffs from now claiming that they are entitled to any payment not provided for in the contract. Plaintiffs respond that their claims are not barred under state law because the contractual release language does not apply to a subsequent fraudulent inducement or concealment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   It is undisputed that Mississippi law applies to the settlement agreements of Ezell and Whitley and Florida law governs Biddings's settlement agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Under Mississippi law, a settlement agreement is treated as a contract and the court, when interpreting that contract, determines first whether the contract is ambiguous as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Travelers Indem.

Miss. Feb. 25, 2014). In\n   <em>\n    Bogy\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ford Motor Co.\n   </em>\n   , the district court considered contractual release language similar to the language in the settlement agreements at hand and found that it was ambiguous.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3966141\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/824/733/#p739\">\n    824 F.Supp.2d 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 739 (S.D. Miss. 2011). Because the release language was ambiguous, the court held that it could not\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   conclude, as a matter of law, that the fraudulent inducement claim in [the suit] was barred by the express terms of the cited provision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3966141\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/824/733/#p739\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, Ezell and Whitley are not barred by the general release in the settlement agreement from bringing their fraud, civil RICO or unjust enrichment claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Biddings's settlement is governed by Florida law. Under Florida law, a general contractual release does not bar a\n   fraud claim where an agreement is procured by fraud or misrepresentation unless the contract explicitly states that it is \"incontestable on the ground of fraud\".\n   <em>\n    Global Quest LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Horizon Yachts, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277831\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/849/1022/#p1027\">\n    849 F.3d 1022\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1027-28 (11th Cir. 2017) (citing\n   <em>\n    Oceanic Villas, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Godson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1975881\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fla/148/454/\">\n    148 Fla. 454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1975881\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fla/148/454/\">\n    4 So.2d 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 690-91 (1941) ) (considering defendants' reliance on \"as is\" and \"entire agreement\" clauses).

Plaintiffs' complaint concedes, however, that the commissions were paid by the annuity issuers and not by Lexington. They have not adequately alleged that Lexington, the party that would be subject to the duty, knew about the commissions or had any role in paying the commissions. Nor do plaintiffs cite a single authority that would suggest that Lexington, as the settling party, had the affirmative duty to disclose the commission paid by a third party (and in the case of Biddings's settlement, a non-party) insurance company.
