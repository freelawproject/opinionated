According to Plaintiffs, the CAA's statutory timeline for compliance imposes a duty on Defendants to immediately publish designations in the Federal Register.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   State Reply at 8 &amp; n.8; NGO Reply at 10;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207407\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(A) (\"The Administrator shall publish a notice in the Federal Register promulgating any designation under paragraph (1) or (5), or announcing any designation under paragraph (4), or promulgating any redesignation under paragraph (3).\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In response, Defendants argue that EPA's duty to promulgate designations within two years does not include a duty to make those designations effective.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 13. Defendants contrast the statute's lack of a specific effective date with other CAA provisions that contain such dates.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207407\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207407\">\n    at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"effective one year after the date of promulgation\" (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207476\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ) ). Defendants represent that, consistent with past practice, EPA will make designations effective within thirty to sixty days of promulgation.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207476\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Wehrum Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 45-46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Here, the Court agrees with Defendants. The CAA does not set forth a specific date by which the agency must make designations effective. The statute does not expressly equate the Administrator's duty to promulgate with a duty to make designations effective. Plaintiffs fail to present any relevant case law that supports their statutory\n   construction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NGO Reply at 9-11. Instead, binding case law favors the opposite finding. In\n   <em>\n    WildEarth Guardians v. McCarthy\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit recognized from its earlier cases a \"clear statement rule in this context\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   When a plaintiff sues the EPA Administrator for failure to perform any act or duty under this chapter which is not discretionary with the Administrator,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207604\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), we have held that the nondiscretionary nature of the duty must be clear-cut-that is, readily ascertainable from the statute allegedly giving rise to the duty. We must be able to identify a specific, unequivocal command from the text of the statute at issue using traditional tools of statutory interpretation; it's not enough that such a command could be teased out from an amalgamation of disputed statutory provisions and legislative history coupled with the EPA's own earlier interpretation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314653\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/1179/#p1182\">\n    772 F.3d 1179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1182 (9th Cir. 2014) (internal quotations and citations omitted);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Our Children's Earth Found. v. U.S. E.P.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566535\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/842/#p851\">\n    527 F.3d 842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 851 (9th Cir. 2008) (construing the Clean Water Act's citizen-suit provision similarly). As in\n   <em>\n    McCarthy\n   </em>\n   , the Court cannot identify a clear-cut statutory command that directs the Administrator to make designations effective immediately upon promulgation. To the extent that other CAA provisions could theoretically be delayed by granting Defendants' request,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   NGO Reply at 9-10, that risk is addressed by EPA's commitment to make designations effective within thirty to sixty days following promulgation. The Court assumes that EPA will meet its stated thirty to sixty day timeline, and would consider whether a further order is necessary if it fails to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   NGO Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, Dkt. No. 11, State Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, Dkt. No. 43, Case No. 4:17-cv-06936-HSG, and enters judgment in favor of Plaintiffs and against Defendants. The terms of the judgment are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   (1) The Court\n   <strong>\n    DECLARES\n   </strong>\n   that Defendant Pruitt, in his official capacity as Administrator of the EPA, has failed to perform a non-discretionary duty imposed by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207407\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(B)(i) to promulgate by October 1, 2017 area designations for all areas of the country under the 2015 NAAQS for ozone;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   (2) The Court\n   <strong>\n    ORDERS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants to promulgate final designations for all areas of the country except for the eight undesignated counties composing the San Antonio area no later than April 30, 2018; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   (3) The Court\n   <strong>\n    ORDERS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants to promulgate final designations for the San Antonio area no later than 127 days from the date of this order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The clerk is directed to enter judgment in the lead case only and close that case file. The Court retains jurisdiction to make such orders as may be necessary or appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Parts I and II of this order set forth the relevant statutory and factual background.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    EPA's voluntary notice-and-comment period closed before oral argument, but after the parties completed briefing on the motions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    State Reply at 2.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    At oral argument, Defendants suggested that EPA could delay promulgating designations past the April 30 deadline depending on the comments received. The Court finds that any such further delay is unacceptable at this stage, and EPA will be held to its promised April 30 deadline.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
