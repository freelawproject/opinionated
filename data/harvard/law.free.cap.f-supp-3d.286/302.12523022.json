After considering the parties' submissions and pertinent law, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS in part and DENIES in part\n   </strong>\n   SIFC's motion for summary judgment at Docket No. 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Local Rule 56\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before addressing the merits of the summary judgment motion, SIFC asks the Court to accept its statement of undisputed material facts as uncontroverted because Caez's opposing statement violates Local Rule 56. (Docket No. 60 at 51).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Local Rule 56(c) instructs that \"[a] party opposing a motion for summary judgment shall submit with its opposition a separate, short, and concise statement of material facts.\" L.CV.R. 56(c).

Therefore, \"the rule is important to the functioning of the district court,\" and the First Circuit has consistently held that litigants ignore it at their peril.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Caban Hernandez v.

(Docket No. 33-1). Caez admitted 132 out of 167 of Defendants' uncontested material facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 52; 60 at 2. She denied or qualified the remaining thirty-five. SIFC asks the Court to deem most of these denied facts as uncontroverted because Caez failed to comply with Rule 56. Some of these facts and denials are irrelevant, and the Court will address only those that are not. Except for those in the following paragraph, which share a common denominator and can be addressed quickly, the Court will address the Local Rule 56 controversies in footnotes as they arise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Paragraphs 19, 22, 26, 37, 99, 100, 111, 112, 113, 115, 116, 117, 120, 121, 126, and 128 state something along the lines of \"[t]he exhibit does not support such allegation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 52 \u00b6 113. These paragraphs lack a\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   citation to the record at the end of each sentence. Thus, SIFC asks the Court to admit these facts as uncontroverted because they are not supported by a specific citation to record material. The Court agrees that these paragraphs do not comply with Local Rule 56. Nevertheless, the Court does not deem it necessary to be so strict. Denials such as \"the exhibit does not support such allegation\" or \"[t]he evidence submitted does not support the conclusion,\" allow the Court to infer that Caez is alluding to the same citation provided by SIFC in the fact she is contesting.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3115677\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/486/1/#p7\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Indeed, reviewing the citations reveals as much. Although the Court advises counsel for Caez to comply better with Local Rule 56 in the future, it will admit those denials and treat those facts as disputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As said above, the remaining issues will be addressed as they arise. Nevertheless, the Court emphasizes that this case illustrates the importance of Local Rule 56. Had the parties complied with the rule in its entirety, the Court would not have had to invest so much time and resources dissecting the parties' submissions. Moreover, as will be shown below, had Caez properly controverted some of SIFC's material facts, her case may have prospered. Nevertheless, she chose to ignore Local Rule 56 at her peril.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Relevant Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff Rosa Caez-Fermaint started working at the SIFC as a nurse in 1988. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6 3; 52 \u00b6 3). Through her tenure, she was promoted from Nurse 1 to Nurse 4. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6 6; 52 \u00b6 6). Her job functions as Graduate Nurse\n   IV are described in a document that does not indicate that she will be assigned to any specific medical area within the dispensary. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6\u00b6 8-10; 52 \u00b6\u00b6 8-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Caez began suffering panic attacks in 2008. Dr. S\u00e1nchez, a psychiatrist, diagnosed her with generalized anxiety disorder and panic attacks, and prescribed medication and therapy, which improved her condition. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6\u00b6 43, 47, 50; 52 \u00b6\u00b6 43, 47, 50). Due to her condition, Caez endures fitful sleep, although she can sleep 6-7 hours with her medication-which she feels makes it hard to concentrate (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6\u00b6 73, 81; 52 \u00b6\u00b6 73, 81). Nevertheless, she has no limitations in other daily activities, like eating, driving, or cooking. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6 69; 52 \u00b6 69). In fact, according to her psychiatrist, her condition does not limit her capacity to perform her functions as a nurse. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6 61; 52 \u00b6 61).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Rotation Program\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In October 2013, SIFC issued a memorandum explaining the necessity and purpose of establishing a rotation program that alternated nurses between the Emergency Ward and the External Clinic, the two sections of SIFC's dispensary. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6 32; 52 \u00b6 32). According to SIFC, the rotation program procured that nurses maintain their practice, skills, proficiency, and competence current, as required by local law, Puerto Rico's Department of Health and nurses' Code of Ethics. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6\u00b6 28, 30; 52 \u00b6\u00b6 28, 30). The authority to enact such program emanated from the Collective Bargaining Agreement with Caez's union, which gives SIFC \"all the powers and prerogatives inherent to the faculty of directing and administering its services.\" (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6\u00b6 29; 52 \u00b6\u00b6 29). Thus, beginning in 2013, nurses began to rotate on a monthly basis between the two areas of the dispensary. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6 35; 52 \u00b6 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Efforts of Reasonable Accommodation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Caez disagreed with the rotation program, and shortly after, during a work incident, suffered a panic attack. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6\u00b6 83-89; 52 \u00b6\u00b6 83-89). She returned to her psychiatrist, who diagnosed her with a relapse into her generalized anxiety disorder, and recommended keeping her in her current work area to improve her quality of life. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6\u00b6 92-96; 52 \u00b6\u00b6 92-96). As a result, SIFC, which had in place a procedure for handling requests for reasonable accommodation, placed Caez in an office where she felt comfortable. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6\u00b6 98, 101; 52 \u00b6\u00b6 98, 101). On November 23, 2013, Caez filed a formal request for reasonable accommodation in SIFC Office of Equal Employment Opportunity. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6 102; 52 \u00b6 102). Essentially, she asked to be exempt from rotating. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6 114; 52 \u00b6 114). After interviewing Caez and evaluating her request, SIFC determined she was not a qualified individual under the ADA and could comply with the rotation, and thus denied her request. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6 \u00b6 103, 122-23; 52 \u00b6\u00b6 103, 122-23). Nevertheless, SIFC allowed her to work in larger offices while rotating to the External Clinic and granted her other accommodations. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6 \u00b6 124-25, 127, 130-31; 52 \u00b6\u00b6 124-25, 127, 130-31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Caez requested a reconsideration in February 2014. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6 136; 52 \u00b6 136). She agreed to see Dr. L\u00f3pez, another psychiatrist designated by SIFC. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6 142; 52 \u00b6 142).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr.\n   L\u00f3pez recommended \"that she be provided a reasonable accommodation that includes the evasion of working in reduced spaces.\" (Docket Nos. 54 \u00b6 15; 59 \u00b6 15). based on Dr. L\u00f3pez's report, on September 29, 2014, SIFC reaffirmed that she was not qualified under the ADA. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6 149; 52 \u00b6 149). But, once again, SIFC allowed her to continue working in a larger office when she rotated through the External Clinic. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6 149; 52 \u00b6 149).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Caez struck back. She filed a charge with the Antidiscrimination Unit on October 2, 2014. A month later, she presented a new certificate from Dr. S\u00e1nchez, her own psychiatrist, which recommended that she avoid working in enclosed spaces. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6 150; 52 \u00b6 150). SIFC asked Dr. L\u00f3pez to re-evaluate Caez, and in late January, 2015, he reiterated that she should be provided a reasonable accommodation. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6 151; 52 \u00b6 151; 54 \u00b6 16, 59 \u00b6 16). Notably, in April, 2014, a month before Caez was terminated, SIFC's psychiatrist stated that transferring Caez would benefit her health.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 34-7 at 161.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    C. Antidiscrimination Claim and Disciplinary Actions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   SIFC subjected Caez to three disciplinary actions between January 2014 and May 2015, including her termination in May 2015. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6 157; 52 \u00b6 157). First, she was reprimanded in January 2014 for an incident that occurred in the preceding November. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6 159; 52 \u00b6 159).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   A month later, SIFC admonished her for failing to take patients' vital signs. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6 160; 52 \u00b6 160).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This disciplinary action resulted in a suspension and an independent examiner confirmed the suspension. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6\u00b6 161-62; 52 \u00b6\u00b6 161-62).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, Caez considers this punishment unfair because SIFC failed to provide her the\n   tools to take vital signs. (Docket No. 53 \u00b6 21).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Finally, it is undisputed that Caez's \"continuous conduct violations, insubordination, and refusal to comply with her duties\" resulted in the third measure in May 2015-her termination. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6 163; 52 \u00b6 163).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   This letter of termination lists a series of incidents that occurred between January and May, 2015, which Caez has not controverted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 46-23; 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Caez subsequently sued SIFC, and the matter is before the Court today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In sum, to untangle the web of events, the Court has drafted the following timeline:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 October 2013: SIFC begins rotation program.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 November 2013: Caez requests reasonable accommodation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 January 2014: SIFC disciplines Caez for the first time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 February 5, 2014: SIFC denies reasonable accommodation, and Caez asks it to reconsider.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 February 19, 2014: SIFC disciplines Caez for the second time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 October 2014: Caez files an antidiscrimination claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 November 2014: SIFC denies Caez's request for reconsideration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \u2022 April 2014: SIFC psychiatrist recommends Caez's relocation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \u2022 May 2015: Caez is terminated; letter cites incidents from May 2014 until May 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

In the alternative, SIFC argues that its actions were based on legitimate reasons and not pretextual. For the reasons discussed below, the Court holds that there is a genuine issue of material fact on the three elements of a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   discrimination case. Upon shifting the burden to SIFC, the Court finds that there is an issue of fact as to whether\n   <em>\n    one\n   </em>\n   of the adverse actions was based on legitimate reasons or was merely pretextual. Namely, Caez's 2014 suspension. However, the Court finds that there is no issue of fact as to whether there were legitimate reasons for the\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   adverse action-Caez's 2015 termination. For that reason, the Court grants in part and denies in part SIFC's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    1.

Caez argues the exact opposite-the job description does not state that she will\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be assigned to a specific area. (Docket No. 51 at 17). Moreover, SIFC argues that the collective bargaining agreement establishes that rotating is an essential function. But the fact it cites in support merely states that the agreement establishes \"the Fund has all the powers and prerogatives inherent to the faculty of directing and administering its services.\" (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6 30; 52 \u00b6 30). Here again, viewing this fact in the light most favorable to the non-movant, the Court finds that a jury could interpret this fact as the opposite-that the agreement's silence on the issue of rotation means it is not an essential function.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Finally, SIFC argues that the work experience of past holders of the position or of the incumbents in similar positions also illustrate that rotating is an essential function. For support, SIFC cites to evidence that nurses have rotated since 2013. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6 35; 52 \u00b6 35). But Caez argues otherwise, and indeed, evidence exists to support the contrary conclusion. Caez began working as a nurse in 1988. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6 3; 52 \u00b6 3).

Here there are three possible adverse actions: (1) the rotation program, (2) Caez's suspension in 2014 for failing to take vital signs and (3) Caez's termination in 2015. Because SIFC has proffered a legitimate business reason for the rotation program, the Court will not determine if it is a\n   reassignment for purposes of adverse action under the ADA. As to the 2014 suspension, Caez considers it was due to an unwarranted negative job evaluation because SIFC did not provide her the tools to take vital signs. This evaluation occurred two weeks after she requested reasonable accommodation. Thus, given the timing, a reasonable juror could infer that the adverse action was taken because of her disability. Similarly, SIFC terminated Caez on May 22, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 46-23). This is the epitome of an adverse employment action, and it occurred a month after Dr. L\u00f3pez, SIFC's own psychiatrist, stated that a relocation would benefit Caez. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 34-7 at 161). This fact alone would allow a reasonable juror to infer that SIFC terminated Caez because of her disability and the pressure to accommodate her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Court finds that Caez has proffered sufficient evidence to establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of disability discrimination and shift the burden against SIFC to show there are no genuine issues of facts regarding the legitimate reasons for its actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    4.

Legitimate Business Reasons\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   SIFC has met its burden of providing a legitimate reason for the rotation program, the temporary suspension, and the intention of termination from May 2015. The undisputed facts establish that SIFC established the rotational program \"to ensure that the Nurses at SIFC maintain their practice, skills, proficiency and competence current.\" (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6 30; 52 \u00b6 30). The rotation program ensures that nurses are proficient in every area, prepared for contingencies and can guarantee the Medical Dispensary's operation and quality of services. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6 31; 52 \u00b6 31). SIFC issued the norm \"to assign work equitably and the program applies to all the nurses.\" (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6 33, 36; 52 \u00b6 33, 36). Hence, the Court finds that there is no genuine issue of fact as to the legitimate reasons for the rotation program. As to the suspension, SIFC has offered a legitimate business reason to suspend her-she failed to take patients' vital signs. Likewise, there is no dispute as to the May 2015 termination letter, which includes a long list of disciplinary actions leading to SIFC's decision to terminate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6 163; 52 \u00b6 163; 60 at 50). Thus, the Court finds that there is no genuine issue of fact as to the legitimate reasons provided therein supporting Caez's termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   b. Pretext\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Because SIFC offered legitimate business reasons for its alleged discriminatory acts, the burden shifts to Caez to\n   prove that these reasons are mere pretext. The Court finds that Caez has only proven a genuine issue of fact regarding pretext on one of three actions: the temporary suspension. She has not argued that the reasons for the rotation program were pretext for discriminating against her because of her disability. Likewise, she has not argued that the reasons contained in the letter of termination were pretext for discrimination. Therefore, the Court must conclude that Caez has not met her burden of proof under the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   test as to those two instances of alleged discrimination. Nevertheless, Caez has disputed the reasons for her 2014 suspension in ways that are indicative of pretext. Her handwritten note protesting the suspension points to \"inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions\" in SIFC's account concerning her failure to take vital signs.\n   <em>\n    Carreras\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4218361\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/596/25/#p31\">\n    596 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   37 (citing\n   <em>\n    Santiago-Ramos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11189985\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/217/46/#p56\">\n    217 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   56 ). Namely, that SIFC could not expect her to take vital signs if it failed to provide her the tools for doing so. Thus, as to this adverse employment action, the Court finds a genuine issue of material fact that would entitle Caez to relief if a jury found her in favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   For the reasons discussed above, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS in part and DENIES in part\n   </strong>\n   SIFC's motion for summary judgment on the ADA discrimination claim. Although Caez has not met her burden of proof regarding pretext on the issue of the rotation program and her termination, she has proven an issue of material fact regarding the 2014 suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    ADA: Reasonable Accommodation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   An employer may also violate the ADA if it knows of an employee's disability, yet fails to make reasonable accommodations for said employee.\n   <em>\n    Estades Negroni v.

To survive summary judgment on her reasonable accommodation claim, a plaintiff must \"produce enough evidence for a reasonable jury to find that: (1) [s]he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (2) [s]he was able to perform the essential functions of the job with or without a reasonable accommodation, and (3) that [defendant], despite knowing of [her] disability, did not reasonably accommodate it.\"\n   <em>\n    Rocafort v.

Thus, a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case for reasonable accommodation shares the first two elements as a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case for discrimination, which Caez has already established, as discussed above.

Caez submitted a request for reasonable accommodation to SIFC's office of equal employment opportunity, seeking to be exempted from working in the External Clinic, and therefore, rotating. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6 \u00b6 102, 114; 52 \u00b6\u00b6 102, 114). She informed her supervisor and was placed in an office where she would feel comfortable while SIFC evaluated her request. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6 101; 52 \u00b6 101). SIFC denied her request, but nevertheless (1) allowed her to work in larger offices when rotating in the External Clinic, (2) instructed that crying patients be assigned to other nurses to avoid triggering a panic attack, and (3) allowed her to take breaks as necessary. (Docket Nos. 33-1 \u00b6\u00b6 130-31; 52 \u00b6\u00b6 130-31). Caez sought reconsideration, but was denied. Whether SIFC's voluntary accommodations amounted to reasonable accommodation is a question for the jury, not the judge, to decide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Moreover, a reasonable juror could find that a request to be exempted from rotating was reasonable, feasible, and would not cause undue burden. Since nurses did not rotate until November 2013, a juror could conclude that it was feasible to operate the facility without one of the nurses rotating. Moreover, SIFC has proffered no evidence of undue hardship. Granted, the rationale behind the decision to rotate is undisputed-to improve nurses' proficiency. But drawing all reasonable inferences in the non-moving party's favor, this fact does not allow the Court to infer that exempting Caez from rotating, thus reducing her proficiency, would constitute an \"undue hardship.\" Moreover, a jury should decide whether \"the type of operation or operations of the covered entity, including the composition, structure, and functions of the workforce of such entity\" is such that exempting Caez from rotating would be an \"undue hardship.\" Therefore, SIFC's motion for summary judgment as to the reasonable accommodation claim is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    ADA-Retaliation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The ADA prohibits retaliation for engaging in protected activity, such as requesting reasonable accommodation or filing an anti-discrimination complaint before the EEOC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012203\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <em>\n    Freadman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5733007\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/484/91/#p100\">\n    484 F.3d at 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nor do they dispute that a retaliation claim for events predating October 2014 are time-barred. (Docket No. 60 at 24). The issue is whether Caez meets the causal connection requirement for a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of retaliation, and if so, survives the burden-shifting test in connection to her October 2014 claim and May 2015 adverse action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   a. Causal Connection\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Viewing the undisputed facts in the light most favorable to Caez, the Court finds that there is an issue of fact regarding a causal connection between Caez's protected activity and SIFC's adverse employment action. SIFC argues that there is not sufficient temporal proximity between Caez's EEOC complaint in October 2014 and her termination in May 2015. Although the Court agrees that seven months is too long to prove a causal connection, the Court finds some pitfalls in SIFC's argument. First, the termination letter lists a series of conduct violations that began to accrue in November 2014-right after the complaint was filed. A reasonable juror could find that there was temporal proximity between the protected activity and the series of events leading to the adverse employment action. Simply put, a juror might infer that SIFC started preparing a case for Caez's dismissal a month after she filed her antidiscrimination claim. Second,\n   Caez was terminated a month after SIFC's physician recommended that she work in open spaces. \"It is well established that 'requesting an accommodation, without filing a formal charge or engaging in other specific behaviors listed in \u00a7 12203(a), is nonetheless behavior protected from an employer's retaliation.' \"\n   <em>\n    Carreras\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4218361\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/596/25/#p31\">\n    596 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   35-36 (citing\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9296858\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/352/472/#p478\">\n    352 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   477-78 ). Here, there is clear temporal proximity between that protected conduct (requesting accommodation) and the adverse action. Since \"the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   burden in this context is not an onerous one,\" the Court finds that a reasonable juror could find a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action given the preceding two reasons.\n   <em>\n    Calero-Cerezo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9057520\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/355/6/#p20\">\n    355 F.3d at 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   b. McDonnell Douglas Burden-Shifting\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Ultimately, it does not matter if Caez can set forth a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of retaliation. Under the burden-shifting approach, SIFC has proffered a legitimate reason for its decision to terminate Caez, such as insubordination, as discussed above in the context of discrimination. And likewise, Caez has offered no evidence that the reasons for her termination were pretextual. Had she offered any evidence indicative of pretext, the outcome of this case would be different.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9296858\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/352/472/#p478\">\n    352 F.3d at 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that plaintiff's contention \"that, as opposed to exhibiting insubordination, his behavior ... consisted of good-faith, successful efforts to obtain materials from a meeting that he had already missed while caring for his son\" allowed a reasonable juror to infer that the defendant's \"charge of insubordination masked retaliatory motives\"). Additionally, the Court notes that SIFC accommodated Caez throughout much of 2014, despite finding it lacked a legal obligation to do so, which militates against inferring retaliation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Soileau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7626755\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/105/12/#p16\">\n    105 F.3d at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, because Caez has not offered evidence, or even argued, that the reasons for her termination were pretextual, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   SIFC's motion for summary judgment as to the retaliation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    State Law Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <em>\n    1.

Defendant denies this fact, stating that \"there is no admissible evidence on the record to support this statement.\" (Docket No. 59 \u00b6 20). The Court has looked at the evidence and decided to treat the conclusion regarding \"[t]he intention of destitution\" as disputed, but not the fact that the medic said that a reubication would be beneficial for Caez.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    Caez's denial to paragraph 159 cites to plaintiff's deposition, but does not provide a specific citation to the record.

The fact states that C\u00e1ez was suspended for failing to take vital signs. (Docket No. 33-1 \u00b6 160). Caez \"denied in part\" the stated fact. (Docket No. 52 \u00b6 160). But what exactly she denied is unclear. Caez states that she opposed said sanction and informed her employer that she was not provided with the tools to take vital signs. But as SIFC points out, \"the fact that [Caez] opposed the sanction does not dispute the fact that it was imposed, on the contrary, it confirms it.\" (Docket No. 60 at 49).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Paragraph 162 states that an \"independent examiner concluded that the infractions had been committed and confirmed the suspension.\" (Docket No. 33-1 \u00b6 162). Caez denied this fact stating that this was determined at an informal hearing, not a formal one. (Docket No. 52 \u00b6 162). This may be true, but it is irrelevant. The fact is that the independent examiner reached that conclusion, and Caez has not provided a citation to the record that denies this fact. Actually, Caez has not even provided a citation that establishes it was an informal hearing. Therefore, the Court admits the fact as uncontroverted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    In support of this fact, Caez cites to a note she wrote on the letter notifying her of the disciplinary action, provided in SIFC's exhibits. (Docket No. 46-24 at 2). SIFC denies this fact and argues that the statement contained in this note is inadmissible evidence, but does not explain why. \"It is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to do counsel's work, create the ossature for the argument, and put flesh on its bones.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Therefore, the Court will admit this fact as uncontroverted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    Similarly, paragraph 163 states that \"Plaintiff's continuous conduct violations, insubordination and refusal to comply with her duties resulted in a third disciplinary measure.\" (Docket No. 33-1 \u00b6 163). Caez denies this fact by stating it \"is still debated and the formal hearing is yet to be held.\" (Docket No. 52 \u00b6 163). But again, Caez provides no citation to support her denial. Thus, the Court shall deem this fact as uncontroverted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    Because this fact is not dispositive, the Court will not consider if the evidence is admissible.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    SIFC asks the Court to admit paragraphs 11, 34, and 37 as uncontroverted because Caez failed to properly dispute them. The three paragraphs basically state that participation in SIFC's rotation program is an essential function of Caez's nursing job. Caez argues that this is \"conclusory\" and inadmissible evidence. Additionally, she cites to SIFC's Exhibit 3 to dispute the fact.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Docket 46-1. Indeed, Exhibit 3 does not state that rotation is essential. SIFC invites the Court to view this as an omission that does not contradict the asserted fact, but at this stage the Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Thus, the Court finds that Caez's denial and citation to Exhibit 3 suffices to dispute the facts stated in those three paragraphs. Since it does not alter the outcome of the motion, the Court deems it unnecessary to consider the evidentiary objection and whether the statements are inadmissible as conclusory.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
