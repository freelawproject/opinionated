However, the following summary is relevant to Catholic Charities' present request for attorney's fees and costs. On February 13, 2015, Catholic Charities submitted a FOIA request to the defendant seeking \"[d]ocuments relating to the processing, answering, and responding to FOIA requests for assessments of asylum officers.\" Am. Compl., Exhibit (\"Ex.\") 9 (Catholic Charities' FOIA Request).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 18, 2015, the defendant requested additional time to process the request, citing \"unusual circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Summ.

Cleveland, Catholic Charities of Washington (Feb. 18, 2015)) at 1. The plaintiffs' amended complaint alleged as its ninth cause of action that the \"[d]efendant ... provided nothing in response\" to Catholic Charities' FOIA request. Am.

J. Mot. at 1. Thereafter, in October 2015, the defendant produced three documents in response to Catholic Charities' FOIA request. Pl.'s Mem. at 3; Def.'s Resp. at 6. Although the Court found \"that the defendant's delay in processing Catholic Charities' FOIA request appear[ed] to be unjustified,\" the Court denied Catholic Charities' summary judgment motion because Catholic Charities \"failed to address this Circuit's standard for the award of costs and attorney fees under the FOIA.\"\n   <em>\n    Gatore v.

In response, Catholic Charities filed its Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment as to Ninth Cause of Action, in which it argued that the Guide fell within the scope of its FOIA request and requested that the Guide be produced to it within ten days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Renewed Summ.

Accordingly, the Court ordered the defendant to \"show cause ... why the Court should not award the amount of attorney's fees and costs requested by Catholic Charities.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 14, 2017, the defendant filed a motion for reconsideration of the Court's February 3, 2017 Order.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Defendant's Motion to Reconsider &amp; Stay, or Alternatively, to Modify the February 3, 2017[ ] Order and Memorandum in Support (Feb. 14, 2017).

The defendant concedes that \"Catholic Charities prevailed on its ninth cause of action and ... is eligible for attorney's fees on that discrete issue,\" Def.'s Resp. at 6, and therefore, the Court need not reconsider its previous conclusion as to eligibility. The defendant disputes, however, that Catholic Charities is entitled to any amount of fees, arguing that all four entitlement factors weigh in its favor because the Guide \"is of no public value,\" \"Catholic Charities' request [for the Guide] was for private advantage and not for public informational purposes,\" and the defendant \"was not unreasonable in not releasing the full ...

Access to such information is especially important for organizations like Catholic Charities and their clients given that the \"FOIA is the exclusive means that a respondent in Immigration Court proceedings must use to obtain documents for use in immigration proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Jarno v.

And the mere fact that Catholic Charities has cited the Guide's content in litigating its remaining claims in this suit,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. at 8, without more, does not \"transform [this] nonprofit['s] interests from [a] public interest to [a] commercial or self-interest,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elec.
