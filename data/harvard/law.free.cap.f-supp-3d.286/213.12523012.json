Plaintiff Dorothy Uwakwe, a Nigerian-American woman, alleges that her former employers, defendants Pelham Academy and Justice Resource Institute, Inc., discriminated against her on the basis of her race and national origin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The principal question before the Court is whether Uwakwe's discrimination claims under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , are time-barred. Title VII claims are subject to a fairly short limitations period: they must be filed within 90 days after the plaintiff receives a right-to-sue notice from the EEOC. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1). Here, the EEOC apparently mailed the notices on June 17, 2016. This action was not filed until April 1, 2017, 288 days later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defense counsel received a copy of the notices on June 20, 2016, three days after they were mailed. Plaintiff, and her counsel, have submitted affidavits saying that they did not receive the notices until January 3, 2017, and then only after an inquiry by counsel. The notices were addressed properly and were not returned as undeliverable. Plaintiff and her counsel do not proffer any reason, plausible or not, why they might not have received the notices. They simply deny that they did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   By law, such a notice is presumed to have been received within a reasonable time after mailing, which the First Circuit has suggested is anything from three to five days. The first question presented is whether plaintiff's simple denial is enough to overcome that presumption: more precisely, whether that simple denial is sufficient to delay accrual of the limitations period. Although the First Circuit has not addressed that question, the Second and Sixth Circuits have concluded that mere denial, without more, is not enough. This Court will adopt that approach, and conclude that plaintiff is deemed to have received the notice by June 22, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The question then becomes whether the doctrine of equitable tolling should apply and toll the running of the limitations period beginning on June 22, 2016 (the presumed latest date of receipt). The answer to that question depends on whether plaintiff's counsel acted diligently under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As set forth below, plaintiff's counsel did little to monitor the proceeding. He did not send an e-mail or make any other written inquiry to the EEOC for more than half a year after the matter had been closed. More importantly, once he became aware that the notices had been sent, he did not act quickly to get the complaint on file; instead he simply assumed that he was entitled to a wholly new limitations period, and waited nearly three more months before filing the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Because of that lack of diligence, the limitations period will not be tolled. Accordingly, and for the reasons that follow, defendants' motion for summary judgment will be granted as to Counts 1 through 4 and 7. The remaining two counts will be dismissed for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Dorothy Uwakwe alleges that she was employed by Pelham Academy and the Justice Resource Institute, Inc. (\"JRI\") beginning in April 2008. (Compl. \u00b6 10).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   She alleges that she was wrongfully accused of assaulting another employee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-14). Subsequently, on October 3, 2014, she was demoted from a supervisory position that paid $18 per hour to a residential counselor position that paid $12.75 per hour. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Uwakwe alleges that the demotion was due to discrimination based on her race and national origin and that she was constructively discharged. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-13). She also alleges that she was humiliated by defendants and her co-workers and subjected to a hostile work environment because of her accent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The complaint asserts claims for (1) discrimination on the basis of race and national origin in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; (2) retaliation in violation of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a), the Equal Pay Act of 1963,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20215\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3), and the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, Mass.

(Def. Mot. to Dismiss Ex. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On June 17, 2016, the Boston Area Office of the EEOC mailed one letter and two documents titled \"Dismissal and Notice of Rights.\" (Compl. Ex. A; Def. Mot. to Dismiss Ex. 2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The letter stated: \"Included with this letter is your Notice of Dismissal and Right to Sue. Following this dismissal, you may only pursue this matter by filing suit against the Respondent\n   named in the charge within ninety (90) days of receipt of said notice. Otherwise, your right to sue will be lost.\" (Compl. Ex. A). The notices stated: \"Your lawsuit\n   <strong>\n    must be filed\n    <em>\n     WITHIN 90 DAYS\n    </em>\n    of your receipt of this notice\n   </strong>\n   ; or your right to sue based on this charge will be lost.\" (Compl. Ex. A; Def. Mot. to Dismiss Ex. 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The letter was addressed to Uwakwe \"c/o\" Benneth O. Amadi, her attorney.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   It set forth the correct and complete business address for attorney Amadi at his office in Lynn. (Compl. Ex. A at 1). The notices themselves were addressed to Uwakwe herself, with what appears to be a correct and complete address at her home in Roslindale.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the bottom of the page, the notices indicated that two individuals were provided \"cc\" copies: (1) plaintiff's counsel Amadi, again with his correct mailing address, and (2) defense counsel, also with a correct address. (Compl. Ex. A; Def. Mot. to Dismiss Ex. 2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defense counsel received the notices on June 20, 2016, three days after mailing. (Def. Mem. in Response to Ct. Order Ex. 1 \u00b6 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   From that point, there is no evidence in the record of any activity with respect to these claims for more than half a year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On December 30, 2016, Uwakwe's counsel Amadi e-mailed Anthony Pino, an EEOC Enforcement Supervisor. The e-mail stated as follows: \"Please cause the Notices of Right to Sue to issue in relation to the above-referenced EEOC Charge Numbers.... My client wants to file federal complaints and therefore requests for the Rights to Sue.\" (Compl. Ex. A). Pino responded on January 3, 2017: \"As you can see from the attached, this matter was closed on June 17, 2016.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). According to Uwakwe, Pino's e-mail attached only the notice related to the charge against JCI. (Pl. Mot. to Strike at 2-3 &amp; n.2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Amadi did not express surprise or make any protest to Pino. Nor did he follow up as to the absence of any notice concerning Pelham. Instead, on January 6, 2017, he sent the following e-mail to Pino: \"Since the letter you enclosed in your email to me was alleged to have been mailed on or about June 17, 2016, but is being received today, January 3, 2017, I shall start counting the 90 days from today for the filing of my client's case in the Federal District Court.\" (Pl. Response to Ct. Order Ex. A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Amadi filed this action on behalf of Uwakwe on April 1, 2017-288 days after the date the notices were mailed, and 88 days after the date of Pino's e-mail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendants responded by filing a motion to dismiss Counts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 of the complaint as untimely; Count 5 as barred by the exclusivity provisions of the Massachusetts Workers' Compensation Act; and\n   Count 6 for failure to state a claim. (Def. Mot. to Dismiss at 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In response to the motion to dismiss, Uwakwe submitted an affidavit that stated, in its entirety, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   1. I did not personally receive any right-to-sue letter (\"RTS\") at all from the EEOC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   2.

Attorney Amadi also submitted an affidavit that stated, among other things, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   2. I received the EEOC right-to-sue-letter (\"RTS\") by email from the EEOC on January 3, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   6.

I was contacting the EEOC Investigator who was investigating the case, and each time I was informed that they were still investigating the case; and that they had too many other cases also to attend to.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   8. I was very much in contact with the EEOC and I was diligently contacting them from time to time. But when I called the investigator's line in the last week of December 2016, the recorded message indicated that she was not on duty and that Mr. Pino of the EEOC should be contacted. I called Mr. Pino of the EEOC and he was not around also; and when he did not return my call, I emailed him on or about December 30, 2016 and informed him that my client need the Right to Sue letter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   9. Mr. Pino later replied to my email on January 3, 2017 and the email contained the RTS as an attachment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   11. Apart from the fact that the RTS was stamped June 27, 2017 [sic], there is nothing to show in reality that it was received by my office or by the plaintiff before January 3, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   (Aff. in Opp. to Mot. to Dismiss \u00b6\u00b6 2-11 (\"Amadi Aff.\")). Neither Uwakwe nor attorney Amadi provided any explanation or suggestion as to any possible reason why they might not have received the letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On September 1, 2017, the Court entered an order converting defendants' motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment, because both parties had presented matters outside the pleadings with respect to whether the claims were timely, and giving the parties an opportunity to file further submissions to the Court. Both parties filed a short response with additional briefing. Defendants filed an objection to Uwakwe's response, to which Uwakwe objected in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The role of summary judgment is to \"pierce the pleadings and to assess the proof in order to see whether there is a genuine need for trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Mesnick v.

Mot. to Strike at 1). Specifically, plaintiff objects to the defendants' statements that \"[t]he Complaint ... was silent as to when the RTS Notices were received by [plaintiff's] counsel,\" and that \"plaintiff conveniently ignores the fact that the EEOC issued two RTS Notices to plaintiff's counsel, not one.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The complaint at \u00b6 5 alleges that \"[p]laintiff was issued with [sic] the permission and/or right to sue. See Exhibit A. Exhibit A is dated June 17, 2016, but plaintiff received it on January 03, 2017 through his [sic] attorney.\" (Compl. \u00b6 5). The latter sentence could be read two ways-either as saying that plaintiff actually received the notice from her attorney on January 3, 2017 (without stating when the attorney received it), or as saying that plaintiff constructively received the notice on January 3, 2017 (when the notice was received by her attorney). Because of the ambiguity, the Court will not fault defendants for stating that the complaint is silent as to when the notice was received by plaintiff's counsel. However, in light of plaintiff's subsequent clarification, the Court will construe the complaint as alleging that plaintiff and her counsel first received the notice on January 3, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As to the statement that \"plaintiff conveniently ignores\" the second notice, plaintiff's counsel insists that he only ever received one notice (by e-mail on January 3) and that defendants are wrong to suggest otherwise. But plaintiff seems to misunderstand defendants' point. Defendants are not suggesting that the e-mail contained two notices; they are arguing that plaintiff has not presented an explanation as to why two notices would have gone missing in the mail.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, plaintiff's counsel's insistence that he only received one notice by e-mail on January 3 reinforces defendants' point-that a diligent attorney who had not received either notice in the mail but was now presented with evidence that one matter had closed months earlier would have wondered where the other notice was and would have inquired as to whether that matter was also closed. That is not\n   deceptive conduct on the part of defendants; it is a legitimate argument in their favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The motion to strike will therefore be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on Counts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   To proceed under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, a plaintiff must file her complaint within ninety days of receiving a notice of the right to sue from the EEOC. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    Abraham v.

There is only one reasonable conclusion that can be drawn from this record. In this case, we are confronted with overwhelming evidence that Cook received notice that her claim had been administratively denied and that she had a right to sue her employer: the EEOC mailed the Notice both to Cook and to Providence. The latter received the notice; Cook's Notice was not returned undelivered; Cook admitted that in June of 1984 she talked to an EEOC employee who told her that she 'should have received a Right to Sue.' In contrast, Cook offers only her unsubstantiated testimony that she never receive the May, 1983, Notice of Right to Sue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   This dispute, moreover, is not material because whether or not Cook received the initial Notice of Right to Sue is not determinative.

Oct. 5, 2004) (holding that where mail to plaintiff was returned as undeliverable, the limitations period did not start running until plaintiff's attorney received the notice six months later).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The cases holding that a mere denial is insufficient to overcome the presumption do not clearly set forth the rationale for doing so. Presumably, those courts were concerned that clear proof of actual mailing or receipt is usually impossible to obtain; that the presumption of receipt exists precisely to address that problem; and that the presumption would be virtually meaningless if it could be overcome so easily. Permitting such a result would also undercut the legislative scheme, including the short limitations period, which is intended to promote the swift and fair resolution of employment discrimination disputes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, of course, a bare denial of receipt is easy to fabricate and nearly impossible to rebut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Put simply, a statute of limitations that can be defeated so easily provides little limitations protection at all. Moreover, any genuine issue of unfairness can be addressed by the doctrine of equitable tolling, which permits the court to toll the limitations period when necessary to avoid injustice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The approach of the Second and Sixth Circuits is sensible, but it is not without its problems. An affidavit-even a bare-bones denial-is a form of evidence. An affidavit denying receipt is therefore evidence disputing a material fact; normally, such evidence is sufficient to defeat summary judgment. Furthermore, to the extent that such a denial is inherently implausible or incredible, it presents a question of credibility that would normally be reserved for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   It is true that a defendant is put in a difficult position if a plaintiff and her counsel deny receipt, and the presumption disappears: it is almost impossible to prove that it\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   receive it, and therefore the simple denial effectively becomes conclusive proof. But the reverse is also true. If the EEOC incompetently fails to mail the notice-or if the post office incompetently fails to deliver it-the plaintiff can do little more than deny receipt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1704642\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/820/176/\">\n    820 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   179 n.3 (\"We recognize the difficult situation in which an addressee is placed: what evidence, other than her denial of receipt, is available to rebut the presumption that a letter is received? Nonetheless, on these facts, we believe Cook's denials are not sufficient to support a reasonable conclusion that the letter was not received.\"). A plaintiff with a meritorious case could thus be barred through no fault of her own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   There is no perfect way to reconcile those competing considerations. On the one hand, the approach of the Second and Sixth Circuits-that the mere denial of receipt, without more, is insufficient to overcome the presumption-is both sensible and practical. The purpose of the presumption is to resolve disputes of this very nature, where neither party can prove or disprove mailing or receipt. And to hold otherwise is to invite abuse: it is tantamount to permitting a plaintiff to select the date the limitations period begins to run by the single expedient of a bare-bones denial. At a minimum, it would tend to encourage factual disputes as to when a notice was received.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Irwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219498\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/89/#p92\">\n    498 U.S. at 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219498\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/89/#p92\">\n    111 S.Ct. 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining, after holding that receipt by an attorney constituted sufficient notice to the client, that \"[t]he practical effect of a contrary rule would be to encourage factual disputes about when actual notice was received, and thereby create uncertainty in an area of the law where certainty is much to be desired\").

The first concerns the period between June 22, 2016 (when plaintiff is deemed to have received the notices), and December 30, 2016 (when plaintiff's counsel e-mailed the EEOC asking for issuance of the notices to right to sue). By December 30, 2016, more than 21 months had elapsed since the time the original charges were filed with the EEOC. Counsel for plaintiff contends that he \"enquired [sic] constantly\" about the status of the case, and that the \"EEOC Investigator ... informed [him] that they were still investigating the case.\" (Amadi Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7). There is no evidence that any investigatory activity was actually occurring during that period. And counsel has produced no corroborating evidence of any inquiry at all, such as an e-mail or a letter, or an affidavit from the investigator (whom he does not\n   identify). He apparently made no inquiry of Pino or any other EEOC supervisor for at least half a year. While he swears that he was \"diligently contacting [the EEOC] from time to time,\" (Amadi Aff. \u00b6 9), he does not allege that he called at any particular time between June 17 and December 30. Nor does he contend that he was lied to about the status of the investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The second component of the diligence question concerns the period beginning on January 3, 2017, once plaintiff's counsel was informed that the case had been closed. Again, plaintiff's counsel expressed no surprise to the EEOC that he had not received any notice. Nor did he diligently attempt to get a complaint on file as quickly as he could under the circumstances. Instead, he simply announced to the EEOC that he would \"start counting the 90 days from today for the filing of my client's case in the Federal District Court.\" (Pl. Response to Ct. Order Ex. A). He then waited 88 days, until April 1, 2017, to file the complaint. In all, 288 days elapsed between the date of the notice (June 17, 2016) and the date of the filing of the complaint (April 1, 2017). More than two years in total elapsed between the filing of the charges with the EEOC (March 25, 2015) and the filing of the complaint (April 1, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Even where equitable tolling is available, there is a split among the courts as to how the doctrine ought to be applied. Some courts have held that once a party discovers the relevant fact that otherwise would have triggered the running of the limitations period, equitable tolling provides a reasonable period of time in which to take action. Others, however, have held that such a discovery simply triggers the running of an entirely new limitations period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Thus, the Seventh and Third Circuits have explicitly held that equitable tolling only provides a party with a reasonable period of time to act after the relevant fact is discovered, but does not simply restart the limitations period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kren v.

Surely diligent counsel would have questioned the long delay and lack of activity, and made inquiries with the EEOC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Counsel contends only that he spoke to an EEOC investigator at unspecific times during the pendency of the claim, who told him that the matter was still under investigation. Again, however, there was no apparent investigative activity occurring at the time, and no affidavit from the investigator confirming that claim has been submitted to the Court. There is no evidence that counsel made any effort to contact any EEOC supervisor or official, and no evidence of any written inquiry as to the status of the case. It is notable that his very first e-mail to the EEOC in the record produced a reasonably prompt response, informing him that the matter had been closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   If the only delay were the period from June 22, 2016 (the date of presumed receipt of the notice) to January 3, 2017 (the date plaintiff's counsel contends he actually received the notice), the question of whether to toll the limitations period would be a much closer call. But once counsel became aware that the case had been closed six months earlier, he did not diligently attempt to get a complaint on file at the earliest reasonable opportunity. Instead, counsel simply declared that plaintiff was entitled to a new limitations period, beginning on January 3, 2017. He then took nearly the entire limitations period-88 of 90 days-to get the complaint on file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   There appears to have been no practical reason or need for the extra delay. Plaintiff's counsel presumably had already marshalled the evidence in plaintiff's case, at least sufficiently to present it to the EEOC. He had already decided to pursue the case in federal court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. Ex. A (\"My client wants to file federal complaints and therefore requests for the Rights to Sue.\")). Thus, once he became aware that the notices had issued, there was nothing left to do but prepare and file a complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   This Court is inclined to agree with the approach of the Seventh and Third Circuits, that even if the matter had been equitably tolled up to January 3, 2017, at most plaintiff was entitled to a reasonable period of time to get the complaint on file, not a wholly new limitations period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the Court need not decide that issue, because\n   the question of equitable tolling should be considered in light of all the circumstances, including plaintiff's diligence before and after January 3, 2017. Taken together, counsel's failure to exercise reasonable diligence during the period leading up to December 30 and his failure to get the complaint on file within a reasonable period of time after January 3 are fatal. Accordingly, and considering the actions of plaintiff's counsel in their entirety, the Court concludes that application of the doctrine of equitable tolling is inappropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   This matter will therefore be dismissed on the basis of the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   As neither party has presented documents outside the pleadings related to Counts 5 and 6, the Court will continue to treat these claims under the motion-to-dismiss standard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Count 5\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Count 5 alleges \"intentional/reckless infliction of emotional distress.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 34-36).
