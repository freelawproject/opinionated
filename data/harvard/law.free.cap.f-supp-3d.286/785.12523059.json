The motion was granted by ORDER (ECF No. 221) dated November 27, 2017. This Memorandum Opinion sets out the reasoning for having done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In this products liability action, Robert Benedict sues Hankook Tire Company Limited (\"HTCL\") and Hankook Tire America Corporation (\"HTAC\") for the production and distribution of an allegedly defective tire. Benedict seeks summary judgment as to Defendants' affirmative defense of contributory negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Undisputed Relevant Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On the morning of November 14, 2014, Benedict set out on his route delivering cement for his employer, Essex Concrete (\"Essex\"), in a fully-loaded cement mixer truck. Benedict was authorized to operate the truck because he maintained a valid Commercial Driver's License (\"CDL\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While driving in the right-hand lane along Highway 288 in Colonial Heights, VA on his way to the first delivery of the day, Benedict heard a loud \"boom.\" The tread on the front right tire (the \"subject tire\") separated (the \"tread separation\"), resulting in a sudden loss of all air pressure. Benedict was caught completely off guard by this event and, indeed, was uncertain as to whether a tire failure had occurred. He had not noticed any items of concern during his pre-trip inspection of the subject tire. And, although he had experienced five to seven tire disablements in the past, all had involved rear tandem tires and none had resulted in a loud noise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At some point after Benedict perceived the boom, his truck veered to the right and struck an embankment on the side of the road. The truck then rolled once and came to rest upright. Benedict estimates that the total time between the boom and the collision with the embankment was \"at most, 2-3 seconds.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Before the tire failure, Benedict was driving normally and at a lawful speed. The incident was investigated by a Virginia State Trooper, who concluded that Benedict took no improper action in response to the disablement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the time of the accident, the 2014 Virginia Commercial Driver's License Manual (the \"CDL Manual\"), published by the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles, was in effect. It apprises commercial drivers of \"important information that [they] must know to operate [their] vehicle[s] in a safe and professional manner.\" Pl.'s Br. Ex. I Introduction. It advises drivers facing a tire failure to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Hold the steering wheel firmly.\n   </strong>\n   If a front tire fails, it can twist the steering wheel out of your hand. Keep a firm grip on the steering wheel with both hands at all times.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Stay off the brakes.\n   </strong>\n   Braking when a tire has failed could cause you to lose control. Unless you are about to run into something, stay off the brake until the vehicle has slowed down. Then, brake gently and pull off the road.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Check the tires.\n   </strong>\n   Even if the vehicle seems to be handling normally. Many times you won't know that a dual tire is flat unless you look at it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Pl.'s Br. Ex. I 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The subject tire was a Hankook Aurora TH08 Radial 425/65 R22.5 manufactured by HTCL in South Korea in 2005 and distributed by HTAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Two cuts extending to the belts have been found on the subject tire. Federal regulations require removing tires from service if they suffer cuts of a specified level of severity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Benedict initially asserted three claims: (1) products liability negligence (including manufacturing defect, design defect, and failure to warn); (2) breach of the implied warranty of merchantability; and (3) breach of the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. First Am. Compl. 5-11. He is now pursuing only the negligent manufacturing and implied warranty of merchantability claims. Nov. 20, 2017 Hr'g Tr. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants raised several affirmative defenses in response, including contributory negligence. HTCL's Answer to First Am. Compl. 9; HTAC's Answer to First Am. Compl. 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Both sides then moved for summary judgment. Benedict sought partial summary judgment to bar Defendants' contributory negligence defense. Defendants sought summary judgment as to Benedict's active claims. Related to their motion, Defendants also moved the Court to exclude the testimony of Benedict's tire expert, David Southwell. The Court ruled on these three motions during a hearing held on November 20, 2017, Nov. 20, 2017 Hr'g Tr. 152, and issued an ORDER (ECF No. 221) on November 27, 2017 formalizing its decision. This Opinion is thus one of three detailing the Court's reasoning in this matter. (ECF Nos. 341-43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Expert Testimony Rule\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The threshold question to be resolved in deciding Benedict's motion is whether Defendants must produce expert testimony to establish the standard of care by which to measure Benedict's conduct. Benedict asserts that Virginia law requires the elements of negligence to be demonstrated by expert testimony where, as here, they turn on \"technical or specialized knowledge\" because the proper response of a commercial truck driver to a tire failure falls into this category.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Br. 10-17. Defendants do not dispute that expert testimony is generally required in technical cases or that this case is sufficiently complex to require expert testimony under the general rule. Defs.' Opp'n 12. Rather, they contend that an exception should be made here, to wit, that expert testimony as to\n   the standard of care is unnecessary because the \"CDL Manual\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   itself defines the standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n 12-13. They also argue that the experts in this case\n   <em>\n    have\n   </em>\n   established the CDL Manual as the standard of care;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   that there is sufficient evidence that Benedict failed to comply with the CDL Manual; and that a deviation from the standard of care is a jury question outside the province of experts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n 1, 4, 8, 14-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court concludes that expert testimony is required to illuminate the standard of care under the facts presented by this case and that Defendants' arguments are unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Parties Are Correct that the Expert Testimony Rule Has Been Triggered\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The first issue is whether, as the parties seem to agree, this case comes within the category of cases covered by the expert testimony rule. Just because both sides have agreed to this legal conclusion does not mean that the Court is bound by it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    H &amp; R Block E. Enters., Inc. v.

In\n   <em>\n    Roberts v.

Most laypersons, even those experienced in driving personal vehicles, would likely not be familiar with the proper method of navigating a fully-loaded cement truck, weighing more than 50,000 pounds, through a steer tire failure. This conclusion is supported by Defendants' expert Gary Holbrook, who states that commercial drivers should be trained in how to handle tire disablements in trucks and that \"even many years of experience\" driving trucks \"cannot substitute for proper driver training.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n Ex.

Accordingly, the Court accepts the parties' view that the standard of care here is \"beyond the realm of common knowledge and experience of a lay jury\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   and hence properly the subject of expert testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nichols\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=441%20S.E.2d%201\">\n    441 S.E.2d at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Expert Testimony Rule Requires Expert Evidence as to the Standard of Care in this Case, Which Defendants Have not Presented\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The next issue is whether Defendants have satisfied the expert testimony rule or, alternatively, whether the rule leaves any room for Defendants' claimed exception based on the CDL Manual. Defendants have not done so and the rule is not nearly as flexible as they contend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court notes that there are but two exceptions to the expert testimony rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Seaward Int'l, Inc. v.

The violation, in other words, was not a mere but for cause of the injury. And, moreover, the court provided little explanation as to\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   the violation was a proximate cause, having focused instead on whether it was\n   <em>\n    an intervening and superseding cause\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3834815\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/628/1488/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3834815\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/628/1488/\">\n    at 1494, 1496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It only appears in a single sentence in the brief's \"Introduction\" and arguably in a few sentences within the portion of the \"Background\" supporting Defendants' contention that expert testimony as to the standard of care is unnecessary because the CDL Manual sets the standard on its own and every expert in this case relies on it.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs.'
