He appeals from the judgment entered on the verdict of guilty and from an order denying a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-13\">The information alleged that on July 21, 1925, the defendant made a fictitious check for the payment of money, purporting to be signed by Robert Dean when in fact there was no such person; that knowing the check to be fictitious and with intent to defraud Livingston Brothers, Inc., a corporation, he uttered and passed the check to the corporation as true and genuine.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-14\">The check alleged to be fictitious is set out in the information in the words and figures following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>\u201c100 American Bankers Association 100 Travelers Cheque No. A1846905 Bankers Trust Company New York City Robert Dean July 21, 1925 19\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-5\">Pay to the order of Livingston Bros.

App. 142 [87 Pac. 239]).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">While the instruments in certain respects are the same, differences relating to the parties and provisions forming material parts of the contracts, appear, which affect the sense and change the identity of the instrument alleged to an extent which under the rule stated constitutes a material variance; and, no other evidence sufficient to support the charge as laid in the information having been adduced, it will be necessary to reverse the judgment.  But it does not follow therefrom, as contended by appellant, that the proceedings had will bar his prosecution for the offense shown by the proofs. As was said in <em>People </em>v. <em>McNealy, </em>17 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>Cal. 332, f\u2018It would be a contradiction in terms to say that a person was put in jeopardy by an indictment under which he could not be convicted; and it is obviously immaterial whether the inability to convict arose from variance between the proof and .the indictment or from some defect in the indictment itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-3\">The judgment and order are reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">Tyler, P. J., and Campbell, J., <em>pro tem., </em>concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
