This record shows that the petitioner some years prior to his commitment to the state hospital at Napa had at different times been committed to the state hospital at Stockton, subsequently discharged therefrom and, also, committed to the state hospital at Mendocino and subsequently discharged therefrom. The record in both of said previous commitments set forth that the applicant was suffering from mental deterioration superinduced by alcoholism, his condition being associated with what is called \u201cArterial sclerosis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The record shows that the medical staff of the Napa state hospital was willing to grant the applicant a leave of absence, provided some friend or relative would obligate himself to become responsible for the applicant and to take such supervision of him as would prevent the applicant from becoming a menace either to himself, to others, or, in anywise, injurious to life or property; that no relative or friend has consented to become so responsible for the applicant. Upon the hearing before this court oral testimony was taken, which testimony was to the effect that, if granted a leave of absence from said hospital, the applicant was in such a mental condition as not to be able to take care of himself, being more or less irresponsible, and should at all times be under the supervision of someone, who would be able to guard him. with the same degree of care that is exercised over patients at the Napa state hospital. The testimony introduced in this ease further shows that for a period of about one month during this year the applicant was absent from the Napa state hospital, having left the same without permission, and that his return to the hospital was necessitated by a condition alleged to be that of alcoholism.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The testimony further introduced upon the hearing of this cause and, also, the record presented from the two proceedings herein referred to, leads to the conclusion that the applicant is not simply a person who has lost .the power of self-control in relation to the use of alcoholic liquors, but that his mentality has been seriously impaired and that he is now a subject suffering from a disordered brain. This is a condition, of course, rendering the applicant less able to control his appetite for intoxicating liquor, and, in a sense, places him in the class of persons referred to in section</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>2185c of the Political Code relative to the commitment of persons who have lost the power of self-control in relation thereto, but we think, these facts being admitted, the conclusion that the applicant is not also within the class of persons referred to by section 2168 of the same code, having to do with commitment of persons whose mentality is so far disordered or affected as to render them proper subjects for commitment thereunder, does not necessarily follow, nor does it follow that, because of the disordered mental condition of a person, he is more likely to indulge in alcoholic stimulants, nor does the fact that alcoholic stimulants render one suffering from mental deterioration more injurious or inimical to himself, or the person or property of others, necessitate commitment under section 2185c of the Political Code and not commitment under section 2168 of the same code.  It is simply a question of fact whether the subject is or is not suffering from a disordered mental condition, such as requires commitment under section 2168, <em>supra, </em>and not what causes have primarily superinduced his condition. The line of demarcation is one of fact and when the facts are ascertained the respective sections apply. In the case at bar it would appear from the testimony that the applicant is so far mentally affected as to require someone to look after and care for him all the time, and that he cannot be safely discharged without someone ready and willing to take the place of supervisen now exercised over the patient by the Napa state hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The fact that the officials of the Napa state hospital are ready and willing to grant the applicant a leave of absence under conditions that would safeguard the applicant and prevent him from becoming a menace either to himself or to others is not a sufficient reason for an order of discharge by way of a writ of <em>habeas corpus. </em>We find nothing in the ease of <em>In re Harcourt, </em>27 Cal. App. 642 [150 Pac. 1001], nor in the other authorities cited, when applied to the case at bar, which would lead to the conclusion that the applicant should be released.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The application is denied and the petitioner remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
