The Superior Court <em>{Lewis, </em>J.) sentenced him to ten to thirty years in prison on each indictment, to be served concurrent with each other and consecutive to sentences the defendant already was serving. On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court violated his privilege against self-incrimination under Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution by using his silence as a factor in sentencing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b771-14\">The following facts were adduced at trial and sentencing. Between October 25 and October 27, 2004, the defendant appeared in Merrimack County Superior Court for a judicial proceeding. At the time, the defendant was serving sentences for burglary and accomplice to theft. Each morning of the proceeding, Lieutenant Leo Degreenia of the Merrimack County Sheriffs Department placed a leg brace on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>defendant while he was in the holding cell in the basement of the courthouse. The leg brace contained a locking mechanism that prevented the defendant\u2019s knee joint from bending, which required the defendant to walk stiff-legged. While sitting, however, the defendant could unlock the brace by pulling a lever, thus allowing his knee to bend. The purpose of the brace was to prevent the defendant from running.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">On October 27, 2004, Deputy Sheriff James Moran escorted the defendant from the holding cell to the courtroom. At the end of the proceeding, pursuant to normal practice, the trial court ordered that the defendant be returned to the holding cell. Around this time, Deputy Sheriff Wayne Robie noticed the defendant \u201c[Booking at the different entrances and exits and the window areas in the courtroom, seeing where each bailiff was positioned____\u201d Moran approached the defendant to escort him back to the holding cell. When the defendant finished speaking with his attorney, Moran directed the defendant to face the front of the courtroom and place his hands behind his back so that he could handcuff him. The defendant placed his right hand behind his back, and as Moran attempted to handcuff him, the defendant \u201cturned toward the right and bolted towards the doors.\u201d Moran and another deputy sheriff yelled for the defendant to stop. Before he reached the exit door, the defendant ran into Deputy Sheriff Robert Croteau, who was stationed at the exit. Both individuals were forced through the doors into the small hallway between the inner and outer doors to the courtroom. Croteau then tackled the defendant. The defendant continued to resist until several other court officers arrived to subdue him. The defendant was handcuffed and taken to the holding cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">Later, when Deputy Sheriff Dennis Crawford unlocked the brace to remove it, he observed part of a shoelace tied around the leg strap. The shoelace was holding the locking pin up such that the lock would not work properly while standing. As a result, the defendant could bend his knee and run in a normal fashion. The lace had been cut from one of the defendant\u2019s shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">During a subsequent interview, Lieutenant Robert Krieger of the Merrimack County Sheriffs Department asked the defendant where he had obtained the lace used to disable the lock. The defendant responded: \u201cYou know where I got the shoelace from. You have my shoes.\u201d Krieger testified that, when he asked the defendant how he thought he would get out of the courthouse, the defendant \u201csaid it wasn\u2019t a very well thought out plan and laughed____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">At trial, the defendant admitted that he had used a paper clip that he found on the floor of the holding cell to cut his shoelace, which he then used to keep the brace\u2019s lock open. He testified that he disabled the lock on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>all three days of the proceeding, not with the intent to escape, but to prevent the brace from \u201cpinching\u201d him. The defendant further testified that when he turned away from Moran, he did not intend to escape, but was trying \u201cto get out of being grabbed by a number of people.\u201d He was \u201cupset,\u201d \u201cnervous,\u201d and \u201c[s]omewhat afraid\u201d because he felt that a number of court officers were \u201cmoving very aggressively towards\u201d him. Thus, when Moran reached for his arm, he \u201cpanicked a little bit\u201d and \u201clunged toward the door.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">With respect to his interview with Krieger, the defendant admitted to informing Krieger that he had used a lace from his shoe to disable the brace\u2019s lock. However, he did not \u201cthink\u201d that he \u201csaid it wasn\u2019t a very well thought out plan.\u201d Instead, the defendant testified that he \u201csaid that was not my plan or [he] didn\u2019t have a plan to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The jury found the defendant guilty of attempted escape and possessing an implement for escape. Prior to sentencing, the defendant refused to speak to the person conducting the presentence investigation (PSI). <em>See generally </em>RSA 651:4 (2007). At the sentencing hearing, the State requested the maximum extended term sentence of ten to thirty years, consecutive to the sentences the defendant already was serving. <em>See </em>RSA 651:6 (2007). The State based this request upon: (1) the defendant\u2019s character; (2) prior criminal history, which included, among other convictions, three prior convictions for escape; (3) the nature and circumstances of the offenses; and (4) potential for deterrence and rehabilitation. Defense counsel asked the trial court for leniency, contending, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-7\">Unfortunately, Mr. Burgess, as he sits before you, is a man without hope, without a future and without a family and I ... would ask the Court for a little mercy in this case because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely that given his current situation that Mr. Burgess is ever going to walk out of prison as a young man, a healthy man and a free man----I think this was an impulsive and irrational act. I don\u2019t think \u2014 see how any individual could have expected to escape from a courtroom with six guards nearby.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">The defendant did not address the court during the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-11\">The trial court imposed the maximum extended term sentence. In support of this sentence, the court stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-12\">I very carefully considered this matter, given it a good deal of thought, read the Pre-Sentence report, listened to arguments of counsel, considered the defendant\u2019s situation and have concluded that I\u2019m going to go along with the State\u2019s position in this matter. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>There isn\u2019t any real basis for mercy as asked for by defense counsel in this case. We have a defendant who has an extended record, has simply not accepted over the years in any constructive way his situation, made matters deliberately worse for himself time and time again. The tragedy involved here is entirely attributable to Mr. Burgess\u2019 actions. <em>He has not cooperated in terms of the Pre-Sentence report in terms of telling any </em>\u2014 or <em>talking to me as he\u2019s had opportunities to do about his situation. </em>The record is a fairly deplorable one and at the same time the kind of crimes we\u2019re talking about, the attempted escape and the implements of escape go to the very integrity and safety of the personnel that are involved with law enforcement and the judicial process and there needs to be a very stern message sent out that this is simply not going to be tolerated at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-5\">To the degree that any of this had to do with impulsivity on the part of Mr. Burgess, Mr. Burgess in my mind clearly knew what he was doing, has done this a number of times in the past and could very well have much more seriously injured the people involved, let alone the injury to the process itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">The defendant subsequently moved to vacate the sentence. Relying upon <em>Mitchell v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 314 (1999), the defendant argued that the trial court violated his privilege against self-incrimination under both the New Hampshire and United States Constitutions by considering his failure to participate in the PSI and his silence at the sentencing hearing. The State responded that, despite \u201cany alleged consideration that may have been given to the defendant\u2019s silence prior to, or during, the sentencing hearing,\u201d the trial court considered several other aggravating factors that supported the sentence. To alleviate any uncertainty on the issue, the State asked the trial court to clarify whether it \u201cconsidered the defendant\u2019s silence at the sentencing hearing or his lack of participation in the pre-sentence investigation as factors in his sentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">In a written order, the trial court explained its decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-9\">[T]he Court did not consider the defendant\u2019s silence or his lack of involvement in the Pre-sentence Report preparation process in a manner proscribed by <em>Mitchell </em>or other pertinent authorities. As the sentencing hearing transcript reflects ..., the Court considered the defendant\u2019s silence at the sentencing hearing and his declination to participate in the pre-sentence investigation process in the context of dealing with the plea by his counsel for leniency or mercy, and in assessing the degree, if at all, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>defendant had any rehabilitation potential, or ability to alter his undisputed long history of disturbing criminal activity, both in and out of prison, including three (3) prior convictions of Escape. The defendant\u2019s silence and declination obviously did not result in the Court being presented any evidence from the defendant through these means pertaining to rehabilitation or leniency. The Court did not consider the defendant\u2019s silence at the sentencing hearing, or his lack of involvement in the pre-sentence investigation process, for any other purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Citing several cases from other jurisdictions, the trial court concluded that it \u201cdid not... impermissibly punish the defendant for exercising his right to remain silent,\u201d but, instead, \u201cacted in a manner deemed appropriate by the great weight of authority.\u201d The court therefore denied the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court violated his privilege against self-incrimination under Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution by using his silence as a factor in sentencing. The defendant does not assert a violation of his federal constitutional rights. The State counters that the trial court limited its consideration of the defendant\u2019s silence to its assessment of defense counsel\u2019s plea for mercy and the defendant\u2019s potential for rehabilitation, and, therefore, its consideration of the defendant\u2019s silence was proper. Additionally, the State contends that because the trial court was presented with numerous other aggravating factors supporting the imposed sentence, the record establishes an objective basis sufficient to sustain the trial court\u2019s discretionary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">\u201cThe State Constitution requires the trial court to consider numerous objective factors before imposing any sentence____Part I, Article 18 ... requires the trial court to consider all the relevant factors necessary to the exercise of its discretion,\u201d including \u201cwhether the sentence imposed will meet the traditional goals of sentencing\u2014 punishment, deterrence and rehabilitation.\u201d <em>Duquette v. Warden, N.H. State Prison, </em>154 N.H. 737, 746 (2007) (quotation omitted). \u201cAlthough a sentencing judge has broad discretion to choose the sources and types of evidence upon which to rely in imposing sentence, that discretion is not unlimited.\u201d <em>State v. Lambert, </em>147 N.H. 295, 295-96 (2001). For example, \u201cjudges in sentencing should not rely upon allegations of other crimes by the defendant when such allegations are unsubstantiated, resolved by acquittals, or the product of speculation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 296 (quotation omitted). \u201cIf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>improper evidence is admitted at sentencing, the sentence imposed must be reconsidered unless the trial court clearly gave that evidence no weight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). While we normally review a trial court\u2019s sentencing decision under our unsustainable exercise of discretion standard, <em>id., </em>where, as here, the defendant asserts that his constitutional rights have been violated as a result of the trial court\u2019s sentencing decision, we review that decision <em>de novo. See State v. Decato, </em>156 N.H. 570, 573 (2007) (&lt;cWe review questions of constitutional law <em>de novo.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The defendant asserts that the trial court violated his privilege against self-incrimination under Part I, Article 15 of the State Constitution. Part I, Article 15 provides, in relevant part: \u201cNo subject shall be ... compelled to accuse or furnish evidence against himself.\u201d N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 15. The privilege against self-incrimination found in the Fifth Amendment to the Federal Constitution is comparable in scope to the privilege afforded to the defendant under Part I, Article 15, <em>Knowles v. Warden, </em>140 N.H. 387, 391 (1995); <em>see </em>U.S. CONST, amend. V, although, in certain instances, we have determined that Part I, Article 15 provides greater protection to a defendant than does the Fifth Amendment, <em>see, e.g., State v. Roache, </em>148 N.H. 45, 49 (2002). Here, because the defendant does not assert a federal constitutional claim, we address his claim under the State Constitution, and cite federal law only as it aids our analysis. <em>See, e.g., State v. Barkus, </em>152 N.H. 701, 706 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">We have never addressed whether and to what extent the privilege against compelled self-incrimination applies at sentencing. We have broadly stated that this privilege \u201cnot only permits [a defendant] to refuse to testify against himself at a criminal trial..., but also privileges him not to answer official questions put to him in any other proceeding, civil or criminal, formal or informal, where the answers might incriminate him in future criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>Knowles, </em>140 N.H. at 391 (quotation omitted). The United States Supreme Court has held that a defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination \u201cis fulfilled only when a criminal defendant is guaranteed the right to remain silent unless he chooses to speak in the unfettered exercise of his own will, and to suffer no penalty for such silence.\u201d <em>Estelle v. Smith, </em>451 U.S. 454, 468 (1981) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">In <em>Mitchell, </em>the United States Supreme Court specifically extended the privilege against self-incrimination to sentencing. The Court held that a court may not draw an adverse inference from a defendant\u2019s silence at sentencing in determining facts relating to the circumstances and details of the crime. <em>Mitchell, </em>526 U.S. at 328. In that case, without any plea agreement, the defendant pleaded guilty to distributing cocaine. <em>Id. </em>at 317. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>However, she explicitly reserved the right to contest the amount of cocaine at issue. <em>Id. </em>At sentencing, the defendant \u201cput on no evidence\u201d and did not \u201ctestify to rebut the Government\u2019s evidence about drug quantity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 319. After the testimony, \u201cthe District Court ruled that, as a consequence of her guilty plea, [the defendant] had no right to remain silent with respect to the details of her crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In sentencing the defendant, the District Court credited testimony indicating that the defendant \u201chad been a drug courier on a regular basis\u201d partly because the defendant did \u201cnot testify!] to the contrary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The United States Supreme Court held that the defendant\u2019s guilty plea did not constitute a waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination with respect to all the crimes comprehended in the plea, <em>id. </em>at 321-25, and, further, that, because sentencing proceedings are part of a criminal case, the privilege applies at sentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 327. It explained that \u201c[w]here the sentence has not yet been imposed a defendant may have a legitimate fear of adverse consequences from further testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 326. In contrast, where \u201cthe sentence has been fixed and the judgment of conviction has become final,\u201d \u201cthere is no basis for the assertion of the privilege\u201d because \u201cthere can be no further incrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Noting that \u201c[t]he normal rule in a criminal case is that no negative inference from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify is permitted,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 327-28 (citation omitted), the Supreme Court held that this rule against negative inferences applies with equal force at the sentencing phase \u201cwith regard to factual determinations respecting the circumstances and details of the crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328-29. However, the Court explicitly left open the question of whether a sentencing court may consider a defendant\u2019s silence as it \u201cbears upon the determination of a lack of remorse, or upon acceptance of responsibility for purposes of the downward adjustment provided in \u00a7 3E1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (1998).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">The defendant urges us to apply the principles of <em>Mitchell </em>here and hold that \u201cthe trial court erred in considering [his] silence during the PSI process and at sentencing as a factor supporting the imposition of a lengthy prison sentence.\u201d He contends that the distinction between a court drawing a negative inference from silence with regard to the facts and circumstances of a crime and drawing the inference to determine whether the accused deserves leniency or is amenable to rehabilitation is \u201cunworkable.\u201d The defendant submits that a trial court would always \u201cin some measure penaliz[e] the accused for exercising his right to trial and testifying as to his innocence\u201d if it drew \u201can adverse inference from the accused\u2019s silence when considering amenability to rehabilitation or deservingness of leniency.\u201d Thus, the defendant urges us to hold under our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>constitution that \u201ca sentencing court may not draw any adverse inferences from the accused\u2019s silence during the sentencing process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The defendant makes two distinct, albeit somewhat related, arguments. First, he argues that the trial court erred in drawing an adverse inference from his silence at the sentencing hearing. Second, he contends that the trial court improperly drew a negative inference from his failure to participate in the PSI. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">A trial court has \u201cbroad discretion to choose the sources and types of evidence upon which to rely in imposing sentence.\u201d <em>Lambert, </em>147 N.H. at 295. One such relevant factor is a defendant\u2019s lack of remorse. <em>State v. Hammond, 144 </em>N.H. 401, <em>408 (1999). </em>While we have never previously articulated them, the theoretical grounds for considering such evidence are that it may reflect upon a defendant\u2019s character and be pertinent in determining whether rehabilitation efforts would be successful. <em>State v. Barnes, </em>637 A.2d 398, 402-03 (Conn. App. Ct. 1994); <em>Jackson v. State, </em>643 A.2d 1360, 1379 (Del. 1994); <em>see also State v. Sweeney, </em>124 N.H. 396, 401 (1983) (noting that a court may properly consider the defendant\u2019s character and potential for rehabilitation in determining sentence); <em>Jennings v. State, </em>664 A.2d 903, 908 (Md. 1995) (summarizing cases). <em>But see </em>Ward, <em>Sentencing Without Remorse, </em>38 LOY. U. CHI. L.J. 131 (Fall 2006) (arguing that remorse should not be relevant in criminal sentencing because its application does not serve the prominent theories of punishment).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">In this case, the trial court appears to have reasoned that, because the defendant was silent at the sentencing hearing, he lacked remorse, and, thus, had a decreased potential for rehabilitation. Consequently, the trial court declined defense counsel\u2019s plea for leniency and imposed the maximum extended term sentence. The question therefore is whether the trial court violated the defendant\u2019s right against self-incrimination by basing its sentence in part upon the defendant\u2019s failure to express remorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">It is well established that a court cannot punish a defendant for standing trial rather than pleading guilty. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>390 U.S. 570, 583 n.20 (1968); <em>see also Bordenkircher v. Hayes, </em>434 U.S. 357, 363 (1978) (\u201cTo punish a person because he has done what the law plainly allows him to do is a due process violation of the most basic sort.\u201d). While a trial court may consider a defendant\u2019s false trial testimony as a factor in sentencing, <em>United States v. Grayson, </em>438 U.S. 41 (1978), it may not constitutionally increase a defendant\u2019s punishment because he refuses to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>admit his guilt after conviction, <em>Thomas v. United States, </em>368 F.2d 941 (5th Cir. 1966); <em>cf. Minnesota v. Murphy, </em>465 U.S. 420, 434 (1984). Even at the time of sentencing, a defendant has \u201cnot been finally and irrevocably adjudged guilty\u201d since \u201c[s]till open to him [ar]e the processes of motion for new trial (including the opportunity to discover new evidence), appeal, petition for certiorari, and collateral attack. Indeed, appeal is now an integral part of the trial system for finally adjudicating the guilt or innocence of a defendant.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>368 F.2d at 945. Allowing a sentencing court to penalize a defendant for not admitting guilt after a jury has convicted him would jeopardize a defendant\u2019s right to these post-trial processes, <em>Poteet v. Fauver, </em>517 F.2d 393, 396 (3d Cir. 1975), and chill his right to remain silent, <em>Thomas, </em>368 F.2d at 945. Accordingly, after a jury trial, a sentencing court may not constitutionally consider a defendant\u2019s refusal to admit guilt as a factor in sentencing. <em>See Brown v. State, </em>934 P.2d 235, 245-46 (Nev. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">However, even though a court may not constitutionally consider a defendant\u2019s refusal to admit guilt as a factor in sentencing, some courts hold that a defendant\u2019s silence after trial may be considered as a failure to accept responsibility or failure to express remorse, and thus indicate that an individual has a reduced potential for rehabilitation, without violating the defendant\u2019s right to remain silent. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Johnson, </em>903 F.2d 1084, 1090 (7th Cir. 1990); <em>Barnes, </em>637 A.2d at 402-03. These courts draw a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-6\">\u201c[distinction between imposing a harsher sentence upon a defendant based on his or her lack of remorse,... and punishing a defendant for his or her refusal to admit guilt,... the latter being a violation, <em>inter alia, </em>of a criminal defendant\u2019s right to due process, to remain silent and to appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-7\"><em>State v. Meister, </em>No. 30152, 2007 WL 2821981, at *15 (Idaho Ct. App. Oct. 1, 2007) (quoting <em>State v. Kamana\u2019o, </em>82 P.3d 401, 407 (Haw. 2003)); <em>see also Bergmann v. McCaughtry, </em>65 F.3d 1372, 1379 (7th Cir. 1995); <em>Barnes, </em>637 A.2d at 402-03; <em>Jennings, </em>664 A.2d at 910; <em>People v. Wesley, </em>411 N.W.2d 159, 162 (Mich. 1987) (plurality opinion); <em>State v. Tiernan, </em>645 A.2d 482, 486 (R.I. 1994); <em>State v. Loveland, </em>684 A.2d 272 (Vt. 1996); <em>cf. People v. Ward, </em>499 N.E.2d 422, 425-27 (Ill. 1986); <em>State v. Fuerst, </em>512 N.W.2d 243, 247 (Wis. Ct. App. 1994). In these jurisdictions, unless the sentencing court suggests that the defendant\u2019s admission of guilt would reduce his sentence, no constitutional right is violated when the court considers the defendant\u2019s silence as a failure to accept responsibility or express remorse for the limited purpose of determining whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>rehabilitation efforts would be fruitful. <em>Meister, </em>2007 WL 2821981, at *15; <em>Barnes, </em>637 A.2d at 402-03; <em>Wesley, </em>411 N.W.2d at 162-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Other courts have rejected this distinction and hold that a sentencing court may not consider a defendant\u2019s silence at sentencing as indicating a lack of remorse without violating his privilege against self-incrimination. <em>See State v. Hardwick, </em>905 P.2d 1384, 1391 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1995) (\u201cA convicted defendant\u2019s decision not to publicly admit guilt [by expressing remorse] is irrelevant to a sentencing determination, and the trial court\u2019s use of this decision to aggravate a [defendant's sentence offends the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d); <em>People v.

Jackson, </em>643 A.2d at 1380. Noting that \u201c[e]ven courts which permit consideration of a lack of remorse note that there is a fine line between punishing a defendant for remaining silent and proper consideration of his failure to show remorse,\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>643 A.2d at 1380 (citing <em>Johnson, </em>903 F.2d at 1090), the courts generally reason that, because the terms contrition and remorse \u201cconnote an acknowledgement of guilt on the part of a defendant,\u201d a \u201c[defendant's lack of contrition is, for legal purposes, tantamount to a refusal to admit guilt,\u201d <em>Hardwick, </em>905 P.2d at 1391; <em>cf.

Accordingly, since \u201ccontrition or remorse necessarily imply guilt, it would be irrational or disingenuous to expect or require one who maintains his innocence to express contrition or remorse.\u201d <em>Hardwick, </em>905 P.2d at 1391; <em>see also Young, </em>987 P.2d at 894-95 (where a defendant maintains his innocence throughout the criminal process, he has \u201cno opportunity to express remorse\u201d); <em>Brake v.

Williams, </em>389 S.E.2d at 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">We agree with the courts rejecting the distinction between using a defendant\u2019s silence to infer a failure to express remorse and using it to punish a defendant for refusing to admit guilt. \u201cRemorse\u201d is defined as \u201ca gnawing distress arising from a sense of guilt for past wrongs,\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1921 (unabridged ed. 2002), or \u201cdeep and painful regret for wrongdoing,\u201d RANDOM HOUSE Dictionary of the English Language 1214 (1966). Thus, for a defendant to truthfully express remorse, he must to some degree acknowledge wrongdoing or guilt. <em>See Ward, </em>499 N.E.2d at 429 (Simon, J., dissenting) (\u201c[a] defendant... can hardly be expected to be remorseful for something he contends he did not do\u201d (quotation omitted)). In this respect, we see no practical difference between a defendant\u2019s failure to express remorse and his refusal to admit guilt. <em>See Wesley, </em>411 N.W.2d at 165, 166 <em>&amp; </em>n.2 (Brickley, J., concurring) (criticizing distinction as illusory, unworkable, and unmanageable).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">In either case, the defendant must admit wrongdoing and jeopardize his post-trial remedies, testify falsely and risk a perjury conviction, or remain silent and risk obtaining a greater sentence. <em>South Dakota v. Neville, </em>459 U.S. 553, 563 (1983); <em>see Thomas, </em>368 F.2d at 945. The privilege against self-incrimination \u201cprevents the state from forcing the choice of this \u2018cruel trilemma\u2019 on the defendant.\u201d <em>Neville, </em>459 U.S. at 563. Accordingly, because the only affirmative way for a defendant who maintains his innocence throughout the criminal process to express remorse at sentencing is to forego his right to remain silent, <em>see Jackson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>643 A.2d at 1379; <em>Brake, </em>939 P.2d at 1033, a court may not constitutionally draw an adverse inference of lack of remorse from the defendant\u2019s silence at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">We note that a majority, if not all, of the Federal Circuit Courts of Appeal that have addressed the issue left open in <em>Mitchell </em>have held that it is not a Fifth Amendment violation to deny a reduction of a sentence under the acceptance of responsibility provision of the Sentencing Guidelines, section 3E1.1, because a defendant refuses to admit guilt or express remorse. <em>See United States v. Cohen, </em>171 F.3d 796 (3d Cir. 1999); <em>United States v. Larkin, </em>171 F.3d 556 (7th Cir. 1999); <em>United States v. VillasenorCesar, </em>114 F.3d 970 (9th Cir. 1997); <em>United States v. Clemons, </em>999 F.2d 154 (6th Cir. 1993); <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>971 F.2d 1076 (4th Cir. 1992); <em>United States v. Singer, </em>970 F.2d 1414 (5th Cir. 1992); <em>United States v. Lyles, </em>946 F.2d 78 (8th Cir. 1991); <em>United States v. Rogers, </em>921 F.2d 975 (10th Cir. 1990); <em>United States v. Parker, </em>903 F.2d 91 (2d Cir. 1990); <em>United States v. Henry, </em>883 F.2d 1010 (11th Cir. 1989); <em>United States v. Paz Uribe, </em>891 F.2d 396 (1st Cir. 1989). <em>But see United States v. Frierson, </em>945 F.2d 650 (3d Cir. 1991); <em>United States v. Oliveras, </em>905 F.2d 623 (2d Cir. 1990); <em>United States v. Perez-Franco, </em>873 F.2d 455 (1st Cir. 1989). These courts reason that, in refusing to grant a reduction of a sentence under section 3E1.1, a sentencing court is simply denying a benefit to the defendant, rather than imposing a penalty upon his exercise of the privilege. <em>See, e.g., Frazier, </em>971 F.2d at 1081-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">We do not find this reasoning persuasive outside the unique structure of section 3E1.1. Under section 3E1.1, if a \u201cdefendant clearly demonstrate^] acceptance of responsibility for his offense,\u201d the sentencing court may \u201cdecrease the offense level by 2 levels.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1; <em>see United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220 (2005) (declaring unconstitutional provisions of the Federal Sentencing Act making the guidelines mandatory and setting forth standard of review on appeal). The purpose of this section is to give a lower sentence to a defendant who, in a timely fashion, takes responsibility for his actions. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 comment (backg\u2019d). Consistent with this purpose, the section \u201cis not intended to apply to a defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt, is convicted, and only then admits guilt and expresses remorse.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 comment (application n.2). While \u201c[c]onviction by trial does not automatically preclude a defendant from consideration for such a reduction,\u201d it is only in \u201crare situations [that] a defendant may clearly demonstrate an acceptance of responsibility for his criminal conduct even though he exercises his constitutional right to a trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For example, the section may apply \u201cwhere a defendant goes to trial to assert and preserve issues that do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>relate to factual guilt (e.g., to make a constitutional challenge to a statute or a challenge to the applicability of a statute to his conduct).\u201d <em>Id. </em>In these instances, however, <em>\u201ca </em>determination that a defendant has accepted responsibility will be based primarily upon <em>pre-trial </em>statements and conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Read in this context, it is clear that section 3E1.1 simply encourages guilty pleas by offering a defendant the benefit of a lower sentence in exchange for taking responsibility early. <em>See Frazier, </em>971 F.2d at 1084. It is well settled that the government may offer substantial benefits to a defendant in return for a guilty plea without violating the Fifth Amendment. <em>Corbitt v. New Jersey, </em>439 U.S. 212, 218-20 (1978); <em>Bordenkircher, </em>434 U.S. at 364-65; <em>Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 751 (1970). Furthermore, since section 3E1.1 is not intended to apply to circumstances where a defendant refuses to admit factual guilt, a defendant invoking section 3E1.1 does not incriminate himself and jeopardize his post-trial rights by admitting wrongdoing. Therefore, section 3E1.1 may be reasonably interpreted as denying a defendant a benefit he would have received had he accepted responsibility in a timely fashion, rather than penalizing him for exercising his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Our sentencing scheme contains no similar provision explicitly encouraging defendants to accept responsibility early. Rather, in New Hampshire, trial courts have broad discretion to determine the length of a sentence. <em>State v. Morehouse, </em>120 N.H. 738, 742 (1980). In this context, characterizing a court\u2019s refusal to grant leniency based upon a defendant\u2019s failure to express remorse as a \u201cdenied benefit\u201d as opposed to a \u201cpenalty\u201d is inconsistent with the reality of New Hampshire\u2019s sentencing scheme. <em>See Frierson, </em>945 F.2d at 658. The trial courts determine which factors favor mitigation or aggravation of a sentence, and, thus, may adjust a sentence within the statutory limits at their discretion. <em>Petition of State of N.H. (State v. Fischer), </em>152 N.H. 205, 211 (2005). Therefore, \u201c[w]e doubt that a principled distinction may be drawn between \u2018enhancing\u2019 the punishment imposed upon the [defendant] and denying him the \u2018leniency\u2019 he claims would be appropriate if he had\u201d expressed remorse, <em>Roberts v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 552, 557 n.4 (1980), since, ultimately, the result is the same: a sentence within the statutory limits for the specified crime. Moreover, for a defendant who has maintained his innocence throughout the criminal process, the Hobson\u2019s choice has not disappeared after trial: the defendant must either remain silent and lose the opportunity for leniency, or speak and run the risk of jeopardizing his post-trial rights. <em>Frierson, </em>945 F.2d at 659. Accordingly, under our sentencing scheme, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>denying a defendant leniency simply because he fails to speak and express remorse is equivalent to penalizing him for exercising his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">In holding that a sentencing court may not draw a negative inference of lack of remorse from a defendant\u2019s silence at sentencing, we note that this holding does not preclude a court from considering other evidence besides a defendant\u2019s silence that indicates a defendant\u2019s lack of remorse. <em>See Shreves, </em>60 P.3d at 996. Nor does it prevent a trial court from considering a defendant\u2019s false trial testimony as a sentencing factor. <em>Grayson, </em>438 U.S. at 53-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">Furthermore, this holding is limited to situations where a defendant maintains his innocence throughout the criminal process and risks incriminating himself if he expresses remorse at sentencing. Where a defendant pleads guilty to a crime, he accepts a lower sentence in exchange for his admission of wrongdoing, and, thus, must inevitably incriminate himself. The Hobson\u2019s choice faced by defendants who maintain their innocence is no longer present as this defendant does not risk jeopardizing his post-trial rights by speaking. Accordingly, with a guilty plea, a court\u2019s denial of leniency based upon a defendant\u2019s failure to express remorse is more akin to a defendant not receiving an additional benefit he would have received had he expressed remorse, rather than being penalized for exercising his privilege against self-incrimination. <em>See Frazier, </em>971 F.2d at 1082-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">Thus, a sentencing court\u2019s inference of a lack of remorse from a defendant\u2019s silence at sentencing does not violate the privilege against self-incrimination in all instances. To determine whether a particular defendant\u2019s right to remain silent has been violated, we must examine the factual circumstances of each case. For example, where a defendant admits to committing the acts underlying the charged crime, but disputes whether he had the requisite mental state for the crime, or offers a legal justification for committing those acts, the defendant\u2019s silence at sentencing might, in certain instances, legitimately be considered as a lack of remorse. <em>See Brake, </em>939 P.2d at 1034 (Shearing, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">In <em>Brake, </em>the defendant was charged with first degree murder. <em>Id. </em>at 1031. At trial, the defendant admitted to shooting the victim, but claimed that he had done so in self-defense. <em>Id. </em>The jury found the defendant guilty. <em>Id. </em>At sentencing, citing the defendant\u2019s failure to express remorse, the court imposed the maximum sentence. Id. at 1033. On appeal, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>majority of the Supreme Court of Nevada concluded that the sentencing court violated the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights. <em>Id. </em>It reasoned that the defendant\u2019s \u201ctheory at trial was that he had killed [the victim] in self-defense; as such, he had maintained his innocence of the crime for which he was ultimately convicted and was unable to express remorse and admit guilt to first degree murder without foregoing his right to not incriminate himself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Chief Justice Shearing disagreed with the majority, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-5\">[The defendant] <em>admitted </em>killing the victim. The only question was whether or not the killing was in self-defense. Even if the killing had been in self-defense, [the defendant's lack of remorse would have been a legitimate consideration of the sentencing judge. [The defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense and a feeling of remorse are not in conflict. Thus,... [the defendant\u2019s right to remain silent is not implicated. The sentencing judge may legitimately consider a defendant\u2019s lack of feeling about killing a fellow human being, when the defendant admits to the killing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1034 (Shearing, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">We find Chief Justice Shearing\u2019s reasoning persuasive for the purposes of this case. As in <em>Brake, </em>the defendant confessed to committing the acts underlying both crimes. He admitted that he cut the lace from his shoe; used it to disable the locking mechanism of the brace; pulled away from Moran when Moran attempted to handcuff him after the proceeding; and lunged towards the courtroom exit. The defendant denied only that he had the requisite intent to escape from official custody. His right to remain silent was not implicated because he would not have risked incriminating himself or jeopardizing his post-trial rights by expressing remorse for his acts. For example, the defendant could have expressed regret for endangering the safety of court personnel without undermining his assertion that when he broke away from court officers, he did not intend to escape from official custody, but, rather, was reacting to feelings of panic and anxiety. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s asserted lack of intent to escape would not have conflicted with any feelings of remorse. Because this is not a case in which \u201cthe only affirmative way for [the] defendant to express remorse [wa]s to waive his right to remain silent,\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>643 A.2d at 1379, we reject the defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court penalized him for exercising his privilege against self-incrimination when it denied him leniency based upon his silence at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">The defendant also argues that the trial court improperly considered his \u201csilence during the PSI process ... as a factor supporting\u201d his sentence. The trial court\u2019s order on the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate clarifies that the court considered, not the defendant\u2019s \u201csilence\u201d at the PSI, but his \u201clack of involvement\u201d or \u201cdeclination to participate\u201d in the PSI as a sentencing factor. Accordingly, we do not address the separate question of whether a sentencing court\u2019s use of a defendant\u2019s silence during a PSI would violate his privilege against self-incrimination under the State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Here, the defendant never met with the officer conducting the PSI. This failure to participate in the PSI is relevant to the defendant\u2019s potential for rehabilitation, which is an appropriate sentencing consideration. <em>See Lee v. State, </em>36 P.3d 1133, 1141 (Wyo. 2001) (\u201cA defendant\u2019s failure to cooperate in the PSI is certainly a valid factor for a trial court to consider in contemplating the appropriate sentence----\u201d); <em>cf. Roberts, </em>445 U.S. at 557 (failure to cooperate with authorities gives rise to an inference of a decreased potential for rehabilitation). A PSI contains, among other things, information pertaining to a defendant\u2019s family history, prior criminal record, and other background information. <em>State v. Schulte, </em>119 N.H. 36, 39 (1979). In fact, a PSI may \u201ccontain information bearing no relation whatever to the crime with which the defendant is charged.\u201d <em>State v. Ferbert, </em>113 N.H. 235, 237-38 (1973) (quotation omitted). Therefore, participation in the PSI did not require the defendant to incriminate himself. For example, he could have been involved with the PSI and still refused to discuss his factual guilt or possible remorse by invoking his right to remain silent at that time. Instead, the defendant refused to cooperate with the authorities on the simplest matters not relating to the crimes with which he was charged. <em>See Commonwealth v. Begley, </em>780 A.2d 605, 644 (Pa. 2001). Thus, he could not properly invoke the privilege as a basis for refusing to participate in the PSI. Given that the defendant could have participated in the PSI without jeopardizing his post-trial rights, the trial court did not violate his privilege against self-incrimination when it used the defendant\u2019s declination to participate in the PSI as a factor indicating that he had a reduced potential for rehabilitation. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">Because the trial court in this case did not violate the defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination under the State Constitution by using his silence at the sentencing hearing and failure to participate in the PSI as sentencing factors, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b786-11\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Galway and Hicks, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
