Labranche, Jr., appeals his first degree murder conviction. <em>See </em>RSA 630:1-a (2007). He argues that the Superior Court <em>(Conboy, </em>J.) erred by permitting the State\u2019s expert psychiatrist to testify that the charged offense was not the product of his mental illness. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-12\">The following is supported by the record. On the afternoon of August 29, 2005, motorists witnessed the defendant\u2019s mother, Jane Labranche, lying by the road outside of the home she shared with the defendant in Franklin. Several witnesses stopped to help Jane, who was covered in blood from repeated stab wounds. One witness testified that Jane told him that it was her son, the defendant, who stabbed her and that he was still in the house. Jane later died from multiple stab wounds. After Jane was seen lying by the road, the defendant was seen leaving the house and driving away in his Chevrolet Nova. Later that day, police found the defendant in Concord sitting in his parked Nova. He was arrested for the murder of Jane Labranche.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-13\">Before trial, the defendant provided notice to the court that he intended to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. <em>See </em>RSA 628:2 (2007). He submitted a motion to exclude the testimony of the State\u2019s expert psychiatrist \u201con the question of whether or not the death of Jane Labranche was the product of [the defendant\u2019s] mental illness or mental defect.\u201d The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>At the nonbifurcated trial, the State\u2019s expert psychiatrist, Dr. Albert Drukteinis, testified that while the defendant \u201cdid have a psychotic disorder,\u201d it was his opinion that the defendant\u2019s \u201cactions were not the product of a mental illness.\u201d Dr. Drukteinis testified that because he has a medical degree, he has a \u201cbroader understanding of the body and the brain and brain function.\u201d He further explained that in an insanity case such as this, he offers his opinion on whether the defendant has \u201ca mental disorder,\u201d whether \u201cthat mental disorder rise[s] to the level of a mental illness,\u201d \u201cthe features of that illness, and then whether the behavior or actions ... are a product of that mental disorder or mental illness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">At the close of the evidence, the court instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-6\">The opinion of an expert may assist you in understanding the evidence and in deciding the facts in the case. But you are not bound by the opinion of an expert. You are free to ignore the expert\u2019s opinion if you find that the reasons given in support of the opinion are not sound, or if you find that other evidence outweighs the opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">The court further instructed: \u201cIt\u2019s up to you, the jury, to determine as questions of fact whether the Defendant suffered from a mental disease or defect, and that such caused him to act as he has been charged.\u201d The jury returned a guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">The defendant now appeals, arguing that \u201cthe trial court erred in permitting the State\u2019s expert psychiatrist to testify that the homicide was not the product of [the defendant\u2019s] mental illness\u201d and that the admission of this testimony \u201crendered the trial fundamentally unfair,\u201d which violated his right to due process under the New Hampshire Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">The trial court retains the discretion to admit expert testimony and we review its decision under an unsustainable exercise of discretion standard. <em>Milliken v. Dartmouth-Hitchcock Clinic, </em>154 N.H. 662, 665 (2006). To show that the trial court\u2019s decision was not sustainable, the defendant must show that the ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b766-10\">RSA 628:2,1, provides, in pertinent part, \u201cA person who is insane at the time he acts is not criminally responsible for his conduct.\u201d Insanity is an affirmative defense in New Hampshire. <em>State v. Abbott, </em>127 N.H. 444, 448 (1985). A defendant asserting an insanity defense must establish that he suffered from a mental illness and that the crime charged was a product of that illness. <em>Id. </em>These are questions of fact for the jury. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b766-11\">The defendant argues that Dr. Drukteinis\u2019 testimony on whether his conduct was the product of a mental illness was inadmissible pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 702 because it \u201cdid not aid the jury in its search for the truth.\u201d He argues that this issue is \u201cnot outside the ken of an average juror\u201d and involves \u201ca moral component, an inquiry as to which psychiatrists ... have no more expertise than jurors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Rule 702 provides: \u201cIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-6\">The test generally employed to determine the admissibility of opinion evidence is not to inquire whether the issue to which it relates is for the jury, nor whether it is a matter of daily occurrence and open to common observation, but whether the witness\u2019 knowledge of the matter in question will probably aid the triers in their search for the truth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-7\"><em>Brown v. Cathay Island, Inc., </em>125 N.H. 112, 116 (1984) (quotations omitted); <em>see also State v. St. Laurent, </em>138 N.H. 492, 495 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">The defendant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-9\">Nothing about New Hampshire\u2019s jury-defined insanity standard gives the expert predominance in defining the characteristics of the link between mental illness and crime. Moreover, as trial counsel observed, [Dr.] Drukteinis used very basic factual considerations to draw his conclusion, including whether [the defendant] tried to hide the crime, whether he fled the scene, and whether, upon his arrest, he responded appropriately to questions posed by the police. Such issues are within the ken of the average juror.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">(Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">The question for the trial court, however, is whether the proffered testimony will aid the jury. Dr. Drukteinis, as a psychiatrist, has a medical background and experience in treating mental illness. His medical opinion likely aided the jury to understand the complexities of mental illness and the multitude of behaviors likely to stem from mental illness. <em>Cf. Currier v. Grossman\u2019s, </em>107 N.H. 159, 161 (1966) (\u201c[I]n matters of common knowledge about which the jury know as much as a witness, an opinion cannot help them and therefore should not be introduced. This familiar principle is sound but inapplicable here, as it could reasonably be found by the Presiding Justice that the officer\u2019s testimony, due to his superior knowledge and the investigation he made, might aid the jury.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>While Dr. Drukteinis may have emphasized \u201cvery basic factual considerations\u201d in stating his opinion, we do not believe this constitutes a valid basis upon which to exclude his testimony. \u201c[EJxpert testimony is admissible if it will ... assist the trier of fact to understand the facts already in the record, even if all it does is put those facts in context.\u201d 4 J. McLaughlin, Weinstein\u2019s Federal Evidence \u00a7702.03[1] (2007) (footnote omitted). Dr. Drukteinis testified at trial that he used his knowledge and background in psychiatry to offer an opinion upon</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-5\">whether the individual has a mental disorder and what is the diagnosis, and whether that disorder was present at the time of the behavior which is at issue, and then from all the facts and circumstances surrounding the case,... whether that behavior was really the product of the mental disorder or alternative reasons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Regardless of whether this issue includes a \u201cmoral component,\u201d a psychiatrist\u2019s expert opinion on this matter may be of aid to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">The defendant cites our decision in <em>St. Laurent </em>in support of his argument. In <em>St. Laurent, </em>the defendant was charged with assault and pled not guilty by reason of insanity. <em>St. Laurent, </em>138 N.H. at 493. At trial, the defendant attempted to introduce the testimony of an expert psychologist \u201con the ultimate issue of whether the defendant possessed the requisite <em>mens rea </em>for the crimes charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494. We concluded that such testimony \u201cwill not aid the jury in its search for truth\u201d because \u201c[t]he jury is capable of deciding the issue of intent without expert assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">We disagree with the defendant, however, that <em>St. Laurent </em>is applicable to this case. The expert testimony to which the defendant objects in this case does not address the issue of intent, but rather the issue of whether the defendant\u2019s actions were the product of a mental illness. As we stated above, the complexities of mental illness are matters where expert testimony may \u201cassist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 702; <em>cf. State v. Gourlay, 148 </em>N.H. 75, 82 (2002) (distinguishing inadmissible expert testimony on intent from admissible expert testimony on \u201cthe defendant\u2019s mental and cognitive deficits, an area in which the jury would need assistance\u201d). Moreover, as the court\u2019s instruction to the jury made clear, the jury, as the fact finder, was not bound by Dr. Drukteinis\u2019 opinion and was free to reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">The defendant cites cases from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and the Maine Supreme Court, where expert testimony regarding the issue of whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was a product of a mental illness was held inadmissible. <em>See Washington v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number><em>United States, </em>390 F.2d 444, 455-56 (D.C. Cir. 1967); <em>State v. Durgin, </em>311 A.2d 266, 267 (Me. 1973). Both jurisdictions at one point employed the <em>Durham </em>rule, <em>Durham v. United States, </em>214 F.2d 862 (D.C. Cir. 1954), which is similar to New Hampshire\u2019s insanity doctrine, but ultimately abandoned the test. <em>See United States v. Brawner, </em>471 F.2d 969, 973, 981 (D.C. Cir. 1972) <em>(en </em>banc) (superseded by statute); <em>State v. Flick, </em>425 A.2d 167, 171 (Me. 1981). Under the <em>Durham </em>rule, the D.C. Circuit in <em>Washington </em>held that \u201c[t]he term \u2018product\u2019 has no clinical significance for psychiatrists,\u201d and therefore their testimony is inadmissible. <em>Washington, </em>390 F.2d at 456; <em>see also Durgin, </em>311 A.2d at 268 (\u201c[T]he expert should not give his opinion as to the cause of the conduct.\u201d). With due respect to those courts, we are not persuaded by their analyses and are not bound by their decisions. In addition, we note that the <em>Durham </em>rule, while similar to our approach regarding insanity, is not identical in its application. <em>See </em>Reid, <em>Understanding the New Hampshire Doctrine of Criminal Insanity, </em>69 Yale L.J. 367, 390-93 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-3\">The defendant also argues that the admission of Dr. Drukteinis\u2019 testimony \u201crendered the trial fundamentally unfair, violating [his] right to due process under the New Hampshire Constitution.\u201d However, passing reference to due process, without more, is not a substitute for valid constitutional argument, and we therefore decline to address this argument. <em>Buchholz v. Waterville Estates Assoc., </em>156 N.H. 172, 177 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">Accordingly, we can not say that the trial court engaged in an unsustainable exercise of discretion in admitting the testimony of Dr. Drukteinis on the issue of whether the defendant\u2019s actions were a product of a mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b769-6\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Duggan and Galway, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
