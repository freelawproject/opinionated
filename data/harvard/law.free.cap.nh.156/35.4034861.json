We affirm in part, vacate in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The record supports the following: The county is a public employer within the meaning of RSA 273-A:l, X (Supp. 2006). The union is the exclusive bargaining representative for certain workers at the county\u2019s nursing home. The county and the union were signatories to a collective bargaining agreement (CBA). Particularly relevant to this appeal are articles 1,2,24 and 25 of the CBA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">\u25a0 Article 1 contained the parties\u2019 agreement that \u201cany rights, duties or authority existing by virtue of the New Hampshire Revised Stat[ut]es Annotated or other law shall in no way be abridged or limited\u201d by the CBA and that, to the extent that any CBA provision was inconsistent with \u201cany such law, the provision(s) of law shall prevail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">* Article 2 gave the county the exclusive right to manage the nursing home, including the right to discipline or discharge employees, \u201c[e]xcept as specifically limited or abridged by the terms of [the CBA].\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-9\">\u25a0 Article 24 provided that \u201c[r]esident abuse/neglect/exploitation\u201d would not be tolerated and that \u201c[a]ny instance of physical, verbal, mental or medical abuse/neglect/exploitation of any resident shall be grounds for immediate termination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-10\">\u25a0 Article 25 contained grievance and arbitration procedures. In the case of arbitration, this article provided that the arbitrator\u2019s decision would be \u201cfinal and binding\u201d if it was \u201cwithin the scope of authority and power of the Arbitrator set forth within this Agreement.\u201d This article also provided: \u201cThe function of the Arbitrator is to determine the interpretation of the specific provisions of this Agreement. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>is agreed that the arbitrator shall have no authority to add to, subtract from, or modify any terms of this agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">The CBA expired on March 31, 2002; the parties did not enter into a new CBA until after the events herein described.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Beginning in May 1999, the county employed Melissa Foote as a resident assistant, and later as a licensed nursing assistant (LNA), at the nursing home. Foote also served as a shop steward for the union, participating in contract negotiations and representing bargaining unit members.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">On October 28, 2002, Foote was working at the nursing home where her duties included performing safety checks on certain nursing home residents every half hour and responding to their calls. At approximately 2:30 p.m., two LNAs found one of the residents sitting in his wheelchair. He had defecated. One LNA thought that the resident should be wearing an adult diaper, but the other was unsure. Foote, as the LNA primarily responsible for this resident, was called to answer this question. Foote responded to the resident\u2019s accusation that she had not attended him by pointing a finger in his face and yelling, or loudly interrupting him, to emphasize what she had done that day. Ultimately, this incident was reported to the assistant director of nursing at the nursing home, who filled out a complaint form, asked a social worker to interview the resident, and called Foote and a union representative to her office to discuss what had happened. It was also reported to the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Based upon recommendations from the administrator and assistant administrator of the nursing home, the county\u2019s board of commissioners voted to terminate Foote\u2019s employment effective November 23, 2002. The administrator testified that he based his recommendation, at least in part, upon Foote\u2019s refusal to admit to wrongdoing. The union then filed a grievance on Foote\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">The parties proceeded to arbitration. The arbitration issue to which they stipulated was: \u201cWhether there was just cause for the County to terminate Ms. Foote under the collective bargaining agreement? If not, what shall the remedy be?\u201d In its brief to the arbitrator, the county agreed that \u201cunder RSA 28:10-a, County employees who have been employed for more than one year are entitled to a \u2018good cause\u2019 standard of discharge.\u201d According to that brief, the county further agreed that \u201cgood cause would be examined under traditional just cause standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">After five days of hearing, the arbitrator found that while Foote had not neglected the resident, she had verbally abused him. The arbitrator further found, however, that her conduct \u201cwas no more serious than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>employees who have continued to work at the Nursing Home,\u201d and that had Foote admitted to having verbally abused the resident, she would not have been terminated. Therefore, the arbitrator found that terminating Foote was an \u201coverly harsh and unreasonable penalty\u201d for which the county lacked just cause. The arbitrator ordered the county to reinstate Foote, without back pay or other lost benefits, conditioned upon Foote\u2019s taking anger management and abuse/neglect training programs. The county refused to reinstate Foote, prompting the union to file an unfair labor practice charge with the PELRB. The county filed a counterclaim alleging that the union had engaged in an unfair labor practice by demanding Foote\u2019s reinstatement. Specifically, the county asserted that the arbitrator\u2019s award was void and unenforceable because it exceeded his authority under the CBA and because it violated public policy. The PELRB ruled in the union\u2019s favor. This appeal and cross-appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">When reviewing a decision of the PELRB, we defer to its findings of fact, and, absent an erroneous ruling of law, we will not set aside its decision unless the appealing party demonstrates by a clear preponderance of the evidence that the order is unjust or unreasonable. <em>Appeal of Nashua Police Comm\u2019n, </em>149 N.H. 688, 689 (2003); <em>see also </em>RSA 541:13 (2007). Though the PELRB\u2019s findings of fact are presumptively lawful and reasonable, we require that the record support its determinations. <em>Appeal of City of Laconia, </em>150 N.H. 91, 93 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The county first argues that the PELRB erred by enforcing the arbitrator\u2019s award because the award exceeded the arbitrator\u2019s authority and, therefore, was not final and binding. \u201cA judicial challenge to arbitral authority requires the reviewing court to consider both the CBA and the arbitral submission.\u201d <em>Larocque v. R.W.F., Inc., </em>8 F.3d 95, 96 (1st Cir. 1993); <em>see Appeal of Police Comm\u2019n of City of Rochester, </em>149 N.H. 528, 534 (2003) (extent of arbitrator\u2019s jurisdiction is determined by parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate; parties may agree to submit even question of arbitrability to arbitrator); <em>Local 238 Intern. Broth. Teamsters v. Cargill, Inc., </em>66 F.3d 988, 991 (8th Cir. 1995) (\u201cOnce the parties have gone beyond their promise to arbitrate and have actually submitted an issue to an arbiter, we must look both to their contract and to the submission of the issue to the arbitrator to determine his authority.\u201d (quotation omitted)). \u201c[T]he overriding concern is whether the contracting parties have agreed to arbitrate a particular dispute, not whether the agreement is within the CBA.\u201d <em>Appeal of Police Comm\u2019n of City of Rochester, </em>149 N.H. at 534 (quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>While ordinarily we interpret contractual provisions <em>de novo, see Appeal of Town of Durham, </em>149 N.H. 486, 487 (2003), \u201cthe general rule [is] that the interpretation of a CBA is within the province of the arbitrator, subject to certain exceptions recognized by our case law\u201d that are not relevant here. <em>Appeal of State of N.H., </em>147 N.H. 106, 109 (2001); <em>see Appeal of City of Manchester, </em>153 N.H. 289, 294 (2006) (where PELRB had authority to interpret CBA to determine whether claim was arbitrable, we review PELRB\u2019s interpretation of CBA <em>de novo); Appeal of Town of Durham, </em>149 N.H. at 487-88 (same). \u201c[W]hen the parties include an arbitration clause in their CBA, they choose to have disputes concerning constructions of the CBA resolved by the arbitrator.\u201d <em>Appeal of State of N.H., </em>147 N.H. at 109 (quotation and brackets omitted). \u201cBecause the parties have contracted to have disputes settled by an arbitrator chosen by them rather than by a judge, it is the arbitrator\u2019s view of the facts and of the meaning of the contract that they have agreed to accept.\u201d <em>Paperworkers v. Misco, Inc., </em>484 U.S. 29, 37-38 (1987); <em>see Keebler Co. v. Truck Drivers, Local 170, </em>247 F.3d 8, 10 (1st Cir. 2001). For this reason, the PELRB does not regularly have jurisdiction to interpret the CBA when it provides for final and binding arbitration. <em>Appeal of State of N.H., </em>147 N.H. at 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Our review of the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the CBA is similarly limited. <em>See Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. Local 27, </em>864 F.2d 940, 944 (1st Cir. 1988). Just as the court may not reject the arbitrator\u2019s factual findings simply because it disagrees with them, neither may the court reject the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the CBA simply because the court disagrees with it. <em>See Misco, </em>484 U.S. at 38. While the arbitrator cannot ignore the plain language of the CBA, because the parties authorized the arbitrator to give meaning to that language, \u201ca court should not reject an award on the ground that the arbitrator misread the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[A]s long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority, that a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.\u201d <em>Id.; see Georgia-Pacific Corp., </em>864 F.2d at 944. The court\u2019s task is thus \u201cordinarily ... limited to determining whether the arbitrator\u2019s construction of the [CBA] is to any extent plausible.\u201d <em>Exxon Corp. v. Esso Workers\u2019 Union, Inc., </em>118 F.3d 841, 844 (1st Cir. 1997), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Eastern Associated Coal Corp. v. United Mine Workers, </em>531 U.S. 57 (2000). \u201c[A]n arbitrator\u2019s view of the scope of the issue is entitled to the same deference normally accorded to the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement.\u201d <em>Larocque, 8 </em>F.3d at 97 (quotation and ellipses omitted); <em>see Pelletier v. Auclair Transp. Co., </em>109 N.H. 302, 304 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>In looking to the parties\u2019 submission, which asked the arbitrator to decide whether the county had \u201cjust cause\u201d to terminate Foote and, if not, to formulate a remedy, and in light of the parties\u2019 expired CBA, which did not reference \u201cjust cause,\u201d the arbitrator determined that the \u201ctraditional just cause standard\u201d applied to his review of the county\u2019s decision. Under this standard, \u201cthe arbitrator ... has the authority to consider the underlying issues and surrounding circumstances necessary to interpret and apply the express provisions of the CBA and reach a final decision.\u201d <em>Appeal of City of Manchester, </em>153 N.H. at 293. The United States Supreme Court has identified seven criteria for analyzing whether just cause exists: (1) the reasonableness of the employer\u2019s position; (2) the notice given to the employee; (3) the timing of the investigation undertaken; (4) the fairness of the investigation; (5) the evidence against the employee; (6) the possibility of discrimination; and (7) the relation of the degree of discipline to the nature of the offense and the employee\u2019s past record. <em>Misco, </em>484 U.S. at 34 n.5; <em>see Appeal of City of Manchester, </em>153 N.H. at 293 (citing seven criteria with approval). Consistent with this standard, the arbitrator examined whether Foote\u2019s conduct warranted the maximum penalty under the CBA, and determined that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">We cannot say that the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the CBA and the parties\u2019 submission is so implausible as to require reversal. <em>See Misco, </em>484 U.S. at 38. Nor can we say that the county has demonstrated by a clear preponderance of the evidence that the PELRB\u2019s decision to uphold this interpretation is either unjust or unreasonable. <em>See Appeal of Nashua Police Comm\u2019n, </em>149 N.H. at 689. \u201cBy requesting that the arbitrator determine whether [the county] had just cause to discharge [Foote], both parties conferred authority upon the arbitrator to decide that issue.\u201d <em>Homestake Min. Co. v. United Steelworkers, </em>153 F.3d 678, 680 (8th Cir. 1998) (quotation and brackets omitted). Having been asked whether there was just cause to terminate Foote and, if not, to provide a remedy, \u201c[t]he arbitrator was free to conclude that there was no just cause for discharging [Foote], but that there was just cause for a lesser discipline.\u201d <em>Boston Medical v. Service Employees, Local 285, </em>260 F.3d 16, 22 (1st Cir. 2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1083 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Our conclusion is consonant with the decisions of other courts. <em>See id. </em>(citing cases). In <em>Bureau of Engraving v. Graphic Communication International Union, </em>284 F.3d 821, 823-24 (8th Cir. 2002), for instance, as here, the arbitrator ordered the employer to reinstate an employee who had been terminated for accruing thirteen unexcused absences. Unlike the CBA at issue here, the CBA in <em>Bureau of Engraving </em>included a just cause provision. <em>Bureau of Engraving, </em>284 F.3d at 824. It did not, however, state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>that thirteen unexcused absences constituted just cause. <em>Id. </em>at 825. As did the parties in this case, the parties in <em>Bureau of Engraving </em>framed the issue for the arbitration as: \u201cWhether the Employer had just cause to terminate the employment of the grievant..., and if not, what should be the remedy?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 824 (quotation omitted). The arbitrator concluded that although the employee had accrued thirteen absences, the employer lacked just cause for terminating her. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">On appeal, the employer contended that the arbitrator had exceeded his authority by ignoring the plain language of the attendance policy, which provided that the remedy for thirteen unexcused absences was termination, and by conducting a just cause analysis. <em>Id. </em>The court ruled that the parties\u2019 submission conferred authority on the arbitrator to conduct a just cause analysis and that the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the submission was reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 825. As the court explained: \u201cFor reasons known only to it, [the employer] agreed to stipulate to the just cause analysis____Having entered into the just cause stipulation, it is disingenuous for [the employer] to argue now that the arbitrator acted improperly by conducting the very analysis [the employer] asked it to undertake.\u201d <em>Id.; see Homestake Min. Co., </em>153 F.3d at 680 (where employer requested arbitrator to determine whether employer had just cause to discharge employee, employer cannot argue that arbitrator lacked authority to decide this issue); <em>Cargill, Inc., </em>66 F.3d at 990-91 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">Similarly, here, having agreed that the arbitrator would apply \u201ctraditional just cause standards\u201d and, in its brief to the arbitrator, having itself analyzed the decision to terminate Foote under those standards, the county cannot argue now that the arbitrator acted improperly by analyzing just cause as he did. In its brief to the arbitrator, the county conceded that \u201cfor the purposes of this arbitration, good cause would be examined under traditional just cause standards or principles.\u201d In keeping with this concession, the county argued that: the CBA permitted the county to discharge Foote; Foote\u2019s conduct could not be tolerated; Foote knew or should have known that her conduct would result in discharge; Foote was not entitled to progressive disciplinary or corrective action as such action would have been futile; Foote was not discharged because of anti-union bias; Foote was not disparately treated; and no mitigating circumstances existed that would warrant reducing Foote\u2019s termination to a lesser sanction. In short, the county argued the seven criteria set forth in <em>Misco, </em>484 U.S. at 34 n.5. Having itself analyzed its decision to terminate Foote under traditional just cause principles, the county cannot fault the arbitrator for engaging in the same analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">The county argues that under articles 2, 24 and 25 of the CBA, once the arbitrator found that Foote had verbally abused the resident, he lacked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>the authority to disagree with the county\u2019s decision to terminate her. <em>See Poland Spring Corp. v. United Food, Local 1445, </em>314 F.3d 29, 35 (1st Cir. 2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 818 (2003). To the county, once the arbitrator found that Foote committed an act listed in the CBA as \u201cgrounds for immediate termination,\u201d he was \u201cnot free to fashion a separate remedy apart from the one provided in the parties\u2019 agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The county also contends, contrary to its argument before the arbitrator, that the parties\u2019 submission did not ask the arbitrator to apply traditional just cause principles, but rather to apply the CBA\u2019s implied definition of \u201cjust cause.\u201d While the county concedes that the CBA \u201cwas silent with respect to the articulation of a just cause standard,\u201d the county asserts that \u201cthe mere existence of a collectively bargained labor agreement mandates that the employer ... demonstrate \u2018cause,\u2019 \u2018just cause\u2019 or \u2018good cause.\u2019\u201d Thus, according to the county, the reference in Article 24(B) to \u201cgrounds for termination\u201d was akin to a reference to \u201cjust cause,\u201d and that under this provision, terminating an employee for verbally abusing a resident constituted <em>per se </em>just cause. <em>See Georgia-Pacific Corp., </em>864 F.2d at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">To support its assertions, the county relies upon <em>Georgia-Pacific Corp., </em>864 F.2d at 945-46, and <em>Poland Spring Corp., </em>314 F.3d at 34-35. Both of these cases are distinguishable from this case. The CBAs in those cases unambiguously provided that employees could not be terminated except for just cause and expressly included the employee\u2019s act within the definition of just cause. <em>See Georgia-Pacific Corp., </em>864 F.2d at 942; <em>Poland Spying, </em>314 F.3d at 31. The CBA in the instant appeal does not even use the phrase \u201cjust cause.\u201d The instant case is, thus, unlike <em>Georgia-Pacific Corp. </em>and <em>Poland Spring, </em>which stand \u201cfor the proposition that, once an arbitrator finds that an employee committed some act specifically listed in the [CBA] as providing just cause for termination, the arbitrator is not free to determine that the act does not warrant termination but rather warrants some lesser penalty.\u201d <em>Keebler Co., 247 </em>F.3d at 13. When confronted with the CBA and the parties\u2019 submission asking him to determine whether just cause existed, we cannot say that the arbitrator unreasonably harmonized the two. <em>See Trailmobile Trail. v. Inter. Un. of Elec. Workers, </em>223 F.3d 744, 747 (8th Cir. 2000) (holding that it was up to arbitrator to harmonize management rights clause with just cause provision of CBA); <em>Metro Chevrolet v. Union de Tronquistas, </em>835 F.2d 3, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1987) (when CBA contains general clause prohibiting termination except for just cause and does not equate certain behavior with just cause, \u201can arbitrator is empowered to determine whether the employee\u2019s action which precipitated the dismissal constitutes just cause\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Had the county wanted the arbitrator to determine only whether Foote had engaged in the conduct of which she was accused, it could have framed the issue accordingly. \u201cIf the factual finding were the only bone of contention, why not frame the issue as whether [Foote] committed [abuse]? In essence, [the county] submitted a single question to the arbitrator and now complains that he lacked the authority to answer it.\u201d <em>Hartco Flooring v. Local 14597, </em>192 Fed. Appx. 387, 391 (6th Cir. 2006) (not recommended for full-text publication). Having requested that the arbitrator determine whether Foote was discharged for just cause, the county should \u201cnot now be heard to complain that the arbitrator performed the analysis that it requested instead of making a purely factual finding.\u201d <em>Trailmobile Trail., </em>223 F.3d at 747.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Further, while the county\u2019s interpretation of the submission may be plausible, \u201c[w]e do not agree that the submission to arbitration requires this interpretation, and the ... limitations upon review of arbitration awards militate against an interpretation of the submission which would upset the award[] in this case.\u201d <em>Pelletier, </em>109 N.H. at 304; <em>see LB &amp; B Associates v. International Broth., </em>461 F.3d 1195, 1198 (10th Cir. 2006) (while employer\u2019s interpretation of CBA\u2019s just cause and immediate discharge provisions was one interpretation, arbitrator read these provisions differently and his interpretation was not unreasonable). The arbitrator\u2019s decision that the parties\u2019 stipulation \u201cgave him the authority to conduct a just cause analysis is reasonable as well and the interpretation of [the stipulation] [was] within the arbitrator\u2019s domain.\u201d <em>Bureau of Engraving, </em>284 F.3d at 825. While the county assumes that engaging in one episode of verbal abuse \u201cequaled just cause for termination,... the arbitrator concluded otherwise. That conclusion will not be disturbed here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u2018Whether the arbitrator\u2019s reading of the [CBA and stipulation] was strained or even seriously flawed ... is irrelevant. The arbitrator arguably construed and applied [them], and this is precisely what the parties bargained for him to do.\u201d <em>Bruce Hardwood Floors v. So. Coun. of Ind. Workers, </em>8 F.3d 1104, 1108 (6th Cir. 1993); <em>see LB &amp; B Associates, </em>461 F.3d at 1200.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">For all of the above reasons, therefore, we hold that the PELRB did not err as a matter of law by enforcing the arbitrator\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">The county next asserts that the PELRB erroneously enforced the arbitrator\u2019s award because the award violated public policy. \u201cTo so find, we must conclude that the PELRB\u2019s order contravenes a strong and dominant public policy as expressed in controlling statutes, regulations, common law, and other applicable authority.\u201d <em>Appeal of Town of Pelham, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>154 N.H. 125, 129 (2006) (quotation omitted). \u201c[I]n such cases our review is limited to the confines of positive law, rather than general considerations of supposed public interests.\u201d <em>Id.; see W.R. Grace &amp; Co. v. Rubber Workers, </em>461 U.S. 757, 766 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\u201cIn the context of an arbitration award that reinstates a fired employee, the question is not whether the charged conduct offends public policy, or whether some remedy short of unconditional reinstatement... might have been preferable. Rather, the sole question is whether the award itself \u2014 the order for reinstatement \u2014 gives offense.\u201d <em>Mercy Hospital v. Massachusetts Nurses Ass\u2019n, </em>429 F.3d 338, 343 (1st Cir. 2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>126 S. Ct. 1939 (2006); <em>see Eastern Associated Coal Corp., </em>531 U.S. at 62-63. In making this determination, \u201cwe must read the pertinent statutes and regulations in light of background labor law policy that favors determination of disciplinary questions through arbitration when chosen as a result of labor-management negotiation.\u201d <em>Mercy Hospital, </em>429 F.3d at 344 (quotation omitted); <em>Eastern Associated Coal Corp., </em>531 U.S. at 65. Further, \u201c[w]ith a few limited exceptions not relevant here, [we are] bound by [the] arbitrator\u2019s findings of fact.\u201d <em>Mercy Hospital, </em>429 F.3d at 344. Thus, we examine \u201conly whether the reinstatement award, on the facts as found by the arbitrator, contravenes an explicit, well-defined, and dominant public policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The county argues that there are strong and dominant public policies against reinstating an LNA who has been found to have verbally abused a resident and who fails to understand the wrongful nature of her conduct. To support this argument, the county relies upon 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.13 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.13 provides that a resident of a long-term care facility, like the nursing home, \u201chas the right to be free from verbal, sexual, physical, and mental abuse, corporal punishment, and involuntary seclusion.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.13(b). It also provides that a long-term care facility, like the nursing home, must \u201c[n]ot employ individuals who have been... [f]ound guilty of abusing, neglecting, or mistreating residents by a court of law; or ... [h]ave had a finding entered into the State nurse aide registry concerning abuse, neglect, mistreatment of residents or misappropriation of their property.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.13(c)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">We disagree that 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.13 expresses a strong and dominant public policy against reinstating an LNA who has been found by an arbitrator to have engaged in one episode of verbal abuse and/or who fails to admit her wrongdoing. While the regulation precludes nursing homes from employing individuals who have been found guilty by a court of abusing, neglecting or mistreating residents, as those terms are defined elsewhere, and from employing those for whom the State has entered an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>adverse finding into the State\u2019s nurse aide registry, it is silent with respect to reinstating an LNA such as Foote.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Foote was not found by a court to have engaged in abuse as that term is used in 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3002(1) (Supp. 2007). 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3002(1) defines \u201cabuse\u201d as the willful \u201cinfliction of injury, unreasonable confinement, intimidation, or cruel punishment with resulting physical harm, pain, or mental anguish ... or ... deprivation ... of goods or services that are necessary to avoid physical harm, mental anguish, or mental illness.\u201d The arbitrator did not use this definition and we express no opinion as to whether Foote\u2019s conduct meets it.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Moreover, the regulation is silent with respect to reinstatement. Other provisions in the same statutory and regulatory scheme, however, reveal that hiring (and, by extension, reinstating) an LNA who engages in a single episode of verbal abuse is not precluded. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1395i-3(g) (Supp. 2007), a nurse aide may petition the State for removal of his or her name from the registry \u201cupon a determination by the State that... the employment and personal history of the nurse aide does not reflect a pattern of abusive behavior or neglect; and ... the neglect involved in the original finding was a singular occurrence.\u201d Thus, under federal law, a nursing home is not precluded from having in its employ an LNA, such as Foote, who was found by an arbitrator to have engaged in one episode of verbal abuse. We therefore conclude that 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.13 does not \u201cestablish a public policy prohibiting [Foote\u2019s] reinstatement with [sufficient] clarity.\u201d <em>Boston Medical, </em>260 F.3d at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">The county mistakenly relies upon the strong and dominant public policy against abuse of nursing home residents as support for its arguments. <em>See, e.g., </em>42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1395i-3(c)(1)(A) (Supp. 2007) (residents in skilled nursing facility have \u201c[t]he right to be free from physical or mental abuse\u201d). As discussed previously, \u201cthe question is not whether [Foote\u2019s] <em>conduct </em>violated a public policy in favor of competent nursing care, but whether <em>the order to reinstate her </em>violated that policy.\u201d <em>Boston Medical, </em>260 F.3d at 23; <em>see Eastern Associated Coal Corp., </em>531 U.S. at 62-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">Similarly misplaced is the county\u2019s reliance upon <em>Gogebic Medical Care v. AFSCME Local 992, </em>531 N.W.2d 728 (Mich. Ct. App.), <em>appeal denied, </em>549 N.W.2d 560 (Mich. 1995). In that case, unlike the instant appeal, the State had entered an adverse finding against the nurse on the State\u2019s nurse aide registry. <em>Gogebic Med. Care, </em>531 N.W.2d at 731. Moreover, <em>Gogebic Medical Care Facility </em>was decided before the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Eastern Associated Coal Corporation </em>and conflicts with our decision in <em>Appeal of Town of Pelham, </em>154 N.H. at 129-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>31. In <em>Eastern Associated Coal Corporation, </em>the United States Supreme Court \u201cadhered to the so[-]called narrow approach applied by ... most... federal circuit courts, namely that a reviewing court must find the terms of an award, not the underlying conduct at issue, violated public policy.\u201d Glanstein, <em>A Hail Mary Pass: Public Policy Review of Arbitration Awards, </em>16 OHIO St. J. ON DlSP. RESOL. 297, 301 (2001); <em>see Eastern Associated Coal Corp., </em>531 U.S. at 62-63. We embraced this narrow approach in <em>Appeal of Town of Pelham, </em>154 N.H. at 129-31, where we examined whether there was a strong and dominant public policy against reinstating untruthful police department employees. The court in <em>Gogebic Medical Care, </em>531 N.W.2d at 731, by contrast, examined whether the nurse\u2019s underlying conduct violated the general public policy in favor of protecting long-term care facility residents from abuse, not whether there was a strong and dominant public policy against reinstating her.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Because we find that no strong and dominant public policy exists against reinstating an employee such as Foote, we hold that the PELRB did not err as a matter of law by ordering the county to comply with the arbitrator\u2019s award. <em>See Appeal of Town of Pelham, </em>154 N.H. at 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">In its cross-appeal, the union raises the following issues: (1) whether the PELRB erroneously dismissed the bifurcated \u201cReserved Issues\u201d without an opportunity for the union to address those matters; (2) whether the PELRB applied the wrong legal standard when it failed to admit or take administrative notice of the union\u2019s evidence that would have reinforced its position that State agencies with primary responsibility to protect the public interest had recently taken actions to permit Foote to practice as an LNA; and (3) whether, if reinstatement to her former position is improper, Foote may be reinstated to another position in the county. In light of our decision to affirm the PELRB\u2019s decision upholding the arbitration award, we conclude that issues (2) and (3) are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">With respect to issue (1), the union argues that the PELRB erred when it dismissed the Reserved Issues <em>sua sponte. </em>The record submitted on appeal reveals that the hearing officer\u2019s March 2,2006 decision notified the union that the Reserved Issues would be \u201cadministratively dismissed unless either party files a request for further PELRB proceedings within 30 days.\u201d The record further reveals that on March 24, 2006, the union filed a request for further PELRB proceedings on the Reserved Issues. Nonetheless, on April 19,2006, the PELRB dismissed the Reserved Issues as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>The so-called Reserved Issues involved whether the county violated RSA 273-A:5,1 (1999) by: (1) refusing to reinstate Foote in contravention of the arbitrator\u2019s award, thereby interfering with her licensing obligations and future job prospects; (2) engaging in anti-union discrimination by refusing to reinstate Foote; and (3) failing or refusing to provide discovery materials in connection with a proceeding before DHHS. The union argues that proving anti-union discrimination would \u201cstrengthen [its] request for additional remedies,\u201d including attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Thus, whether the county engaged in anti-union discrimination by failing to reinstate Foote does not appear to be moot. While the county asserts that the arbitrator already addressed the union\u2019s anti-union discrimination claim, the county is mistaken. The arbitrator addressed only whether the county engaged in anti-union discrimination when it terminated Foote, not whether it did so when it refused to reinstate her.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\">In light of the record submitted on appeal, we therefore vacate the PELRB\u2019s dismissal of the Reserved Issues as moot and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. <em>See </em>RSA 273-A:6, IX (1999) (orders and decisions of PELRB shall contain findings of fact and conclusions of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; vacated in part; and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b72-5\">Galway and Hicks, JJ., concurred; Duggan, J., with whom Broderick, C.J., joined, dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b72-6\">DUGGAN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AH\">dissenting. Because I believe that the arbitrator fashioned his own brand of industrial justice, and that affirming the PELRB\u2019s decision threatens to create unnecessary uncertainty in our state\u2019s labor law jurisprudence, I respectfully dissent. I first explain why I disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis, and then set forth how I would resolve this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">The arbitral submission asked the arbitrator to resolve the following inquiry: \u2018Whether there was just cause for the County to terminate Ms. Foote under the collective bargaining agreement? If not, what shall the remedy be?\u201d The majority holds that this submission, combined with the fact that the CBA \u201cdid not reference \u2018just cause\u2019\u201d allowed the arbitrator to apply a \u201c\u2018traditional just cause standard\u2019\u201d to essentially exercise his independent judgment to determine the level of discipline for Foote\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Article 24 of the CBA provides: \u201cAny instance of physical, verbal, mental or medical abuse/neglect/exploitation of any resident <em>shall be grounds </em>for immediate termination.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The majority apparently concludes that there is a meaningful difference between article 24 and a hypothetical CBA that provides: \u201cAny instance of physical, verbal, mental or medical abuse/neglect/exploitation of any resident <em>shall be just cause </em>for immediate termination.\u201d I do not agree. Moreover, drawing such a distinction threatens to create unnecessary uncertainty about how we will resolve future cases. For example, other CBAs might contain language such as: (1) \u201cAny instance of physical, verbal, mental or medical abuse/neglect/exploitation of any resident <em>shall be reason </em>for immediate termination\u201d; or (2) \u201cAny instance of physical, verbal, mental or medical abuse/neglect/exploitation of any resident <em>shall be cause </em>for immediate termination.\u201d We will have to decide where, along a continuum, this alternative language falls, or require parties at the bargaining table to use one synonym, <em>i.e. </em>\u201cjust cause\u201d over another, <em>i.e. </em>\u201cgrounds,\u201d \u201creason\u201d or \u201ccause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Treatises, case law, and dictionaries support the view that \u201cjust cause,\u201d \u201ccause,\u201d \u201creason\u201d and \u201cgrounds\u201d are not distinct concepts when they are used in a collectively bargained-for agreement to describe conduct that serves as an adequate basis for discharge. Those offenses that are \u201cgrounds,\u201d \u201ccause\u201d or \u201creason\u201d for termination are necessarily \u201cjust cause\u201d for termination. Thus, by expressly and unambiguously providing specific \u201cgrounds\u201d for termination, the CBA <em>did </em>reference a \u201cjust cause\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">One respected arbitration treatise observes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-7\">Most collective bargaining agreements do, in fact, require \u201ccause\u201d or \u201cjust cause\u201d for discharge or discipline____ It is common to include the right to suspend and discharge for \u201cjust cause,\u201d \u201cjustifiable cause,\u201d \u201cproper cause,\u201d \u201cobvious cause,\u201d or quite commonly simply for \u201ccause.\u201d <em>There is no significant difference between these various phrases.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">Elkouri &amp; Elkouri, How Arbitration Works 887 (5th ed. 1997) (brackets omitted; emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">Numerous courts use these terms interchangeably. <em>See, e.g., Intern.

Misco, Inc., </em>484 U.S. 29, 38 (1987), did not specifically offer an interpretation of the word \u201cgrounds.\u201d Instead, he acknowledged that article 24 provides that \u201ccertain kinds of conduct shall be grounds for immediate termination\u201d and \u201cclearly put[s] members of the bargaining unit, including Foote, on notice that they could be subject to immediate termination for incidents of abuse.\u201d Then, as the basis for his decision, he appears to have essentially used \u201cjust cause\u201d in the arbitral submission as a vehicle to mete out a penalty that he did not find \u201charsh\u201d or \u201cunreasonable.\u201d In so doing, the arbitrator did not engage in contract interpretation, or even permissible contract misinterpretation. <em>See Misco, </em>484 U.S. at 38 (\u201c[A]s long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority, that a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.\u201d). Instead, he departed from the CBA to arrive at his own brand of industrial justice, a result that is prohibited by the plain language of the CBA (\u201cthe arbitrator shall have no authority to add to, subtract from, or modify any terms of this agreement\u201d), the plain language of the arbitral submission (\u2018Whether there was <em>just cause </em>for the County to terminate Ms. Foote <em>under the collective bargaining agreement. </em>If not, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>what shall the remedy be?\u201d (emphasis added)), and well-settled, persuasive and overwhelming authority from jurisdictions across the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Courts in other jurisdictions consistently hold that where an employment agreement lists certain behavior as grounds or cause for termination, and where there is a finding that such conduct has occurred, the arbitrator is not free to fashion his own remedy. Although the term \u201cjust cause\u201d often appears in these cases, its absence does not change the essential reasoning. <em>See, e.g., Poland Spring Corp. v. United Food, Local 1445, </em>314 F.3d 29, 34-35 (1st Cir. 2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 818 (2003) (\u201conce an arbitrator finds that an employee has committed an act specifically listed in the collective bargaining agreement as providing just cause for termination, the arbitrator is not free to fashion a separate remedy apart from the one provided by the parties\u2019 agreement\u201d); <em>Logistics Personnel v. Truck Drivers Local Union, </em>6 F. Supp. 2d 650, 655 (E.D. Mich. 1998) (where CBA provides that testing positive on drug test is grounds for termination, \u201cthe only relevant question, under the collective bargaining agreement, is whether the employee ... tested positive\u201d); <em>Bruce, </em>103 F.3d at 452 (where CBA states that employee will be discharged for immoral conduct, arbitrator not free to impose ten-day suspension); <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf Nav. v.

June 27, 2007) (where arbitrator determines that just cause exists, it is \u201cpatently irrational\u201d for him to exceed his authority by considering an alternate form of discipline). There is no persuasive reason that our state\u2019s labor law jurisprudence should be different.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The cases relied upon by the majority are distinguishable. For example, in <em>Bureau of Engraving v. Graphic Communication International Union, </em>284 F.3d 821, 824 (8th Cir. 2002), the arbitral submission asked the arbitrator to determine \u2018\u201cWhether the Employer had just cause to terminate the employment of grievant, Linda Puffer, and if not, what should be the remedy?\u201d\u2019 Thus, in contrast to the instant ease, the arbitral submission in <em>Bureau of Engraving </em>made <em>no </em>reference to determining just cause <em>\u201cunder the CBA.\" </em>The argument for allowing an arbitrator to depart from the CBA is much stronger when the arbitral submission, for whatever reason, gives the arbitrator broad authority and does not require him to be grounded in the parties\u2019 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">In <em>Homestake Mining Co. v. United Steelworkers of America, </em>153 F.3d 678, 680 (8th Cir. 1998), the arbitrator determined that the worker\u2019s conduct did not constitute a violation of the employer\u2019s rule. Here, by contrast, the arbitrator expressly found that Foote <em>did </em>abuse the elderly resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">In <em>Trailmobile Trailer, LLC v. International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers, </em>223 F.3d 744, 746 (8th Cir. 2000), a handbook provision that listed examples of conduct that <em>\u201cmay </em>subject an employee to immediate discharge without warning\u201d was at issue, and the CBA provided that the employer could only enforce \u201creasonable rules.\u201d In the instant case, there is no provision at issue regarding the enforcement of \u201creasonable rules\u201d and the proscribed conduct is written directly into the CBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">In <em>LB &amp; B Associates v. International Brotherhood, </em>461 F.3d 1195, 1196 (10th Cir. 2006), the CBA provided that an employee who engaged in sexual harassment \u201c\u2018may be subject to immediate discharge.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>(emphasis omitted). The Tenth Circuit expressly noted that if the CBA did not use such permissive language, a different outcome would have obtained. <em>Id. </em>at 1198 n.2. The CBA here uses the word \u201cshall.\u201d <em>See Dancart Corp. v. St. Albans Rubber Co., </em>124 N.H. 598, 602 (1984) (the word \u201cshall\u201d \u201ccommonly does have a mandatory character\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">In <em>Boston Medical v.

Instead, the arbitrator was charged with reconciling a management rights clause, reserving to management the exclusive right to discipline, and a clause providing that employees could be discharged only for \u201cjust cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20-21. The First Circuit expressly noted that <em>Boston Medical </em>is distinguishable from \u201ca case where the collective bargaining agreement specifically provides for automatic discharge in [certain] situations____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23 n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">In <em>Local 238 International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. Cargill, Inc., </em>66 F.3d 988, 990 (8th Cir. 1995), the Eighth Circuit found \u201can inherent tension or ambiguity\u201d between the CBA and a drug and alcohol policy that was not \u201cwritten verbatim into the collective bargaining agreement.\u201d However, the court clearly stated that \u201c[i]f the collective bargaining agreement expressly provided that an employee who refuses to take an alcohol test \u201cwill be terminated,\u2019 we would agree with the district court\u2019s decision that the arbitrator\u2019s award \u2018ignored the plain mandatory language\u2019 of that agreement----\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the CBA states that abuse shall be grounds for termination. No separate policy is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">In order to uphold the arbitrator\u2019s decision, the majority turns to a seven-factor test. There are two reasons why we should not turn to that test <em>in this case. </em>First, the arbitral submission did not ask the arbitrator to decide: \u201cWhether there was just cause for the County to terminate Ms. Foote? If not, what shall the remedy be?\u201d Instead, it asked the arbitrator to resolve the following concrete inquiry: \u201cWhether there was <em>just cause </em>for the County to terminate Ms. Foote <em>under the collective bargaining </em>agreement? If not, what shall the remedy be?\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the arbitrator\u2019s decision had to be anchored in the plain language of the CBA, language that unambiguously lists the conduct that constitutes \u201cgrounds\u201d \u2014 \u201cjust cause\u201d \u2014 to terminate. The arbitrator was not free to depart from that language. If the parties had no intention of requiring the arbitrator to enforce the unambiguous contract terms, then they would not have inserted the phrase \u201cunder the collective bargaining agreement\u201d into the arbitral submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">Second, as the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has explained, the type of broad \u201cjust cause\u201d analysis embodied by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>seven-factor test comes into play when a collective bargaining agreement does not spell out conduct that shall serve as an adequate basis for discharge. <em>Warrior Gulf &amp; Nav., </em>996 F.2d at 281 n.8. It is not employed in every single case.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s explanation is not inconsistent with <em>Appeal of City of Manchester, </em>153 N.H. 289, 293 (2006), where we cited the seven-factor test with approval, but noted that in deciding just cause issues, the arbitrator has \u201cthe authority to consider the underlying issues and surrounding circumstances necessary to interpret and <em>apply the express provisions of the CBA </em>and reach a final decision.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Here, the arbitrator examined the surrounding circumstances and found abuse. He was then compelled to apply the express provisions of the CBA. Nothing in <em>Appeal of City of Manchester </em>authorizes the arbitrator to supplant an express CBA provision with a seven-factor test. If we conclude that \u201cjust cause\u201d means employing a seven-factor test in every case, then employers will never be able to make specific types of conduct grounds for immediate termination, because anytime they try to do so, their disciplinary decisions will be subject to upset by an arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The majority states that if the county was concerned that the arbitrator might second-guess its decision to discharge Foote, then it could just have asked the arbitrator to \u201cdetermine only whether Foote had engaged in the conduct of which she was accused.\u201d If that is true, then both sides would have had to have been agreeable to the idea that under the CBA, abuse, alone, <em>does </em>constitute a valid basis to terminate employment. Clearly (and understandably), given the posture of this case, the union would never have made such a concession. In fact, it would seem that firing Foote for abuse was one impetus that led the union to grieve the case in the first place. Furthermore, it seems unfair to fault the county for failing to anticipate that the arbitrator would depart from the plain language of the CBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">To borrow from the First Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-8\">The reservation of a right to ... discharge for [a particular type of conduct] would be wholly ineffective and meaningless if the employer\u2019s action, pursuant to such right, is subject to review by an arbitrator on the basis of appropriateness. If the reserved right is construed to mean that the employer can take no disciplinary action in excess of a reprimand, except at its own risk and subject to severe penalties in case an arbitrator should later be of the opinion that some milder action is appropriate, the effect would be that the employer\u2019s inherent right which has not been expressly relinquished by contract is no right at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number><em>Metro Chevrolet, </em>835 F.2d at 5 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Accordingly, I would adopt the reasoning of the cases that hold that where a CBA lists particular types of conduct as grounds for termination, the arbitrator\u2019s inquiry ends when he finds that such conduct has occurred. Consistent with those cases, I would hold that although the \u201carbitrator ha[d] the authority, in the context of a just cause grievance, to consider the underlying issues and surrounding circumstances necessary to interpret and apply the express provisions of the CBA and reach a final decision,\u201d <em>Appeal of Town of Pelham, </em>154 N.H. 125, 128 (2006), his award nevertheless had to be consistent with the CBA and the arbitral submission. <em>LaRocque v. R.W.F., Inc., </em>8 F.3d 95, 96-97 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Article 24 does not say that termination for abuse may occur only where equitable or \u201cfair.\u201d <em>See Poland Spring, </em>314 F.3d at 38 (Boudin, C.J., concurring). Rather, it states, <em>\u201cAny </em>instance of physical, verbal, mental or medical abuse/neglect/exploitation of any resident <em>shall be grounds </em>for immediate termination.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This language unambiguously gives the county just cause to terminate employment where abuse occurs. Moreover, article 2 of the CBA reserves \u201cexclusively\u201d to management the right to \u201cdiscipline or discharge\u201d employees. Taken together, articles 2 and 24 plainly contemplate that certain management decisions, such as termination for abuse, will not be second-guessed during arbitration. Significantly, as part of the CBA, these two provisions were among the terms and conditions bargained for <em>by the parties </em>and it was not for the arbitrator to ignore them. If the parties desired some other outcome, they were free to negotiate for other language to be included within the CBA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-8\">The paramount point to be remembered in labor arbitration is that the power and authority of an arbitrator is totally derived from the collective bargaining agreement and that he violates his obligation to the parties if he substitutes his own brand of industrial justice for what has been agreed to by the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 33 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">The rationale for this holding is persuasive: \u201ccontractual provisions like the [termination for abuse] clause ... are bargained for and inserted precisely to take discretion away from arbitrators charged with enforcing the collective bargaining agreement.\u201d <em>Poland Spring, </em>314 F.3d at 34-35.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-11\">[T]o sustain [the arbitrator\u2019s decision] in this case, notwithstanding the pre-negotiation that took place, [is] the equivalent of... saying that the parties engaged in a meaningless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>act by negotiating the disciplinary rules and incorporating them into the collective bargaining agreement. [It says] that the arbitrator retained the right to fashion remedies even when this <em>contractual </em>authority was not given by the parties. That is not the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-5\"><em>Warren, </em>845 F.2d at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The approach outlined above may seem unfair when applied to the instant case, especially since other employees had not been discharged for abusive conduct. However, the arbitrator was free to interpret the word \u201cabuse,\u201d and apply it however he saw fit. He was also free to find that Foote\u2019s conduct did not constitute \u201cabuse\u201d within the meaning of the CBA. That said, once he made a finding that abuse occurred, the CBA unambiguously required him to uphold the county\u2019s decision to terminate employment under the CBA. No interpretation of that directive is required, and ignoring it is reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">In conclusion,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-8\">[i]t is not... satisfactory to say to employers that they can draft the collective bargaining agreement to clearly restrict the arbitrator from exercising the authority the arbitrator applied here. The realities of what happens at the bargaining table may make this illusory. [The CBA article at issue] was admirably drafted to give management some flexibility and give workers the protection that not every instance of [prohibited conduct] must mean termination. It can be questioned why the price of that flexibility should be to permit an arbitrator to second guess management\u2019s judgment to be less forgiving [in certain instances].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-9\"><em>Poland Spring, </em>314 F.3d at 42 (Lynch, J., dissenting).
