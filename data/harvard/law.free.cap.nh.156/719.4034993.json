We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-20\">The following facts are undisputed. Route 123 is a state route that descends into the center of Alstead. Warren Brook runs parallel to Route <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>123 in this section. Cooper Hill Road runs perpendicular to, and connects to, Route 123. Cooper Hill Road runs over Warren Brook, with Warren Brook passing under the road by way of a culvert.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">In October 2005, southwestern New Hampshire experienced unprecedented rainfalls within a short period of time. When the heavy rains fell, the increased volume in Warren Brook overwhelmed the culvert at Cooper Hill Road, and the area immediately uphill from the road filled with an extraordinary volume of water. The elevated Cooper Hill Road began to act as a temporary dam, holding back increasing amounts of water. The water eventually burst through the road near the area of the culvert, releasing a surge of water into the downstream valley. This surge of water damaged the plaintiffs real and personal property located on Forest Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">The plaintiffs properties were insured by Phenix Mutual. Phenix Mutual denied coverage under the policy and the plaintiff brought a declaratory judgment action, asserting that the damage to his properties was \u201cdirectly caused by the explosion of the road and that the explosion occurred as a result of the pressure of water.\u201d Phenix Mutual moved for summary judgment, arguing that the policy precludes coverage because the loss was proximately caused by flood, not by explosion. The plaintiff filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted Phenix Mutual\u2019s summary judgment motion, ruling that the collapse of the road was not an \u201cexplosion,\u201d and, regardless of whether the term \u201cexplosion\u201d applies to the facts of this case, the damage to the plaintiffs property was caused entirely by water, an excluded cause, and was not proximately caused by the \u201cexplosion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">On appeal, the plaintiff argues that the trial court erred: (1) in holding that the failure of the roadway was not an explosion under the provisions of the policy; (2) in finding that the loss was not subject to the ensuing loss provision; and (3) in finding that the water exclusion in the insurance policy applied to his loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">\u201cIn reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we look at the affidavits and other evidence, and all inferences properly drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Palmer v. Nan King Restaurant, </em>147 N.H. 681, 682-83 (2002). \u201cIf our review of that evidence discloses no genuine issue of material fact, and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we will affirm the grant of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 683. \u201cWe consider a disputed fact \u2018material\u2019 for purposes of summary judgment if it affects the outcome of the litigation under the applicable substantive law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cOur review of the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts is <em>de novo.\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>Under the insurance policy, Phenix Mutual agreed to pay for certain enumerated \u201ccovered causes of loss.\u201d The policy defines \u201cexplosion,\u201d a covered cause of loss, as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">including the explosion of gases or fuel within the furnace of any fired vessel or within the flues or passages through which the gases of combustion pass.

The fundamental goal of interpreting an insurance policy, as in all contracts, is to carry out the intent of the contracting parties. To discern the parties\u2019 intent, we first examine the language of the contract itself.\u201d <em>Tech-Built 153 v. Va. Surety Co., </em>153 N.H. 371, 373 (2006) (quotation and citations omitted). \u201cIn interpreting policy language, we look to the plain and ordinary meaning of the policy\u2019s words in context. We construe the terms of the policy as would a reasonable person in the position of the insured based upon more than a casual reading of the policy as a whole.\u201d <em>Broom v. Continental Cas. Co., </em>152 N.H. 749, 753 (2005) (citation omitted). \u201cPolicy terms are construed objectively, and where the terms of a policy are clear and unambiguous, we accord the language its natural and ordinary meaning. We need not examine the parties\u2019 reasonable expectations of coverage when a policy is clear and unambiguous; absent ambiguity, our search for the parties\u2019 intent is limited to the words of the policy.\u201d <em>Oliva v. Vt. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>150 N.H. 563, 566 (quotations and citations omitted). \u201cThe fact that the parties may disagree on the interpretation of a term or clause in an insurance policy does not create an ambiguity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The plaintiff argues that the failure of the culvert under Cooper Hill Road and the resulting collapse of the roadway was an \u201cexplosion\u201d under the policy because it was caused by a sudden release of energy in the form of movement of water. Alternatively, the plaintiff argues that to the extent that \u201cexplosion\u201d is reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation, the policy must be construed in favor of the insured and against the insurer. Phenix Mutual argues that the term \u201cexplosion\u201d does not apply where natural elements acted, over time, to overwhelm and overflow the culvert and, further, that the policy excludes coverage for loss or damage caused directly or indirectly by water.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">The trial court concluded that the term \u201c\u2018explosion,\u2019 by any reasonable reading of the Policy, does not include the factual circumstances here,\u201d and declined to find coverage. We need not reach this issue, however, because we agree with the trial court\u2019s further conclusion that regardless of whether the failure of the culvert and Cooper Hill Road can be characterized as an \u201cexplosion,\u201d the policy precludes coverage because the loss was caused by flood, not by explosion. Consequently, we need not decide if the term \u201cexplosion,\u201d as used in the policy is ambiguous, and we note that a court will not create an ambiguity simply to construe the policy against the insurer. <em>Int\u2019l Surplus Lines Ins. Co. v. Mfgs. &amp; Merchants Mut. Ins. Co., </em>140 N.H. 15, 20 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>Accordingly, assuming without deciding, that the collapse of Cooper Hill Road was an \u201cexplosion,\u201d the policy\u2019s water exclusion applies to preclude coverage. The policy specifically excludes \u201closs or damage caused directly or indirectly\u201d by water \u201cregardless of any other cause or event that contributes concurrently or in any sequence to the loss.\u201d The plaintiff does not argue that his property damage was caused by anything other than water. Indeed, as the trial court noted, the plaintiff \u201cappears to concede that water indirectly caused the damage to his properties.\u201d We agree with the trial court\u2019s finding that \u201cit is undisputed that the rain-induced flood or overflow of Warren Brook either directly or indirectly caused damage to the [plaintiffs] properties____Thus, the water exclusion would apply to preclude coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">In addition, the ensuing loss provision does not provide coverage for damage caused by water. Rather, that provision states that \u201cif Water, as described in g.(l) through (4) above, results in fire, explosion, or sprinkler leakage, we will pay for the loss or damage caused by that fire, explosion or sprinkler leakage.\u201d The plain and ordinary meaning of these words as set forth in the context of the policy is that if water had caused fire, explosion, or sprinkler leakage on the plaintiffs property, the damage resulting from such fire, explosion or sprinkler leakage would be covered by the policy. Thus, the provision is specifically limited to coverage for certain secondary losses \u2014 fire, explosion, or sprinkler leakage \u2014 caused by water. As the trial court stated, \u201c[a]s demonstrated by the exemptions found in the \u2018explosion\u2019 clause and the water exclusion, this Policy is designed to ensure that Phenix does not become a flood insurer. To apply the ensuing loss provision to provide coverage for what is essentially a flood would subvert the intent of the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">Even if we assumed that the collapse of Cooper Hill Road was an explosion, neither party has argued that the damage here was caused by, for example, dirt, rocks, or broken pavement from that collapse. Instead, both parties maintain that the cause of damage to the plaintiffs properties was water. The policy specifically excludes damage caused by \u201c[f]lood, surface water ... overflow of any body of water,\u201d \u201c[w]ater that backs up or overflows from a sewer, drain or sump\u201d or \u201c[w]ater under the ground surface pressing on, or flowing or seeping through ... paved surfaces.\u201d Because loss or damage caused by water is an excluded cause of loss, the policy did not cover the damage and the trial court correctly granted Phenix Mutual\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b747-10\">Dalianis, Duggan and Galway, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
