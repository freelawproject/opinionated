She requests an award of $8,614.50 in attorney\u2019s fees and $508.51 in costs. The employer, Wickers Sportswear, Inc., has objected. We grant the employee\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The facts are undisputed. In 2000, a department of labor (DOL) hearing officer determined that the employee had suffered a compensable wrist injury on January 30, 2000, and ordered payment of benefits. After a subsequent hearing resulted in the employee receiving additional benefits, the employer appealed to the New Hampshire Compensation Appeals Board (board). In 2004, the board awarded the employee benefits and payment of certain chiropractic bills. After the board\u2019s decision, the employee sought payment of bills for subsequent chiropractic treatment that she alleged was related to her compensable wrist injury. Her request was denied by the board in 2006. The employee appealed the board\u2019s order to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">By an unpublished order dated May 23, 2007, we vacated the board\u2019s order and remanded the case. We ruled that \u201cthe board\u2019s findings regarding its 2004 order were erroneous and[,] because we [could not] determine whether the board applied the correct test in determining whether the treatment for which reimbursement was sought was compensable,\u201d we remanded the case to the board for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">The employee thereafter moved for fees and costs. In her motion, she relies upon RSA 281-A:44, I (1999) (amended 2003). In its objection, the employer points out that RSA 281-A:44, I, was amended in 2003, and argues that the current version of RSA 281-A:44, I, applies. Under the prior version, RSA 281-A:44,1, provided: \u201cIn any dispute over the amount of the benefit payable under this chapter which is appealed to the board or supreme court or both, the employee, if such employee prevails, shall be entitled to reasonable counsel fees and costs as approved by the board or court____\u201d RSA 281-A:44, I (1999) (amended 2003). In <em>Appeal of Brown, </em>143 N.H. 112, 119 (1998), we held that to \u201cprevail\u201d an employee \u201cmust have secured a legal right or financial benefit greater than he or she had received prior to the appeal.\u201d In 2003, however, RSA 281-A:44, I, was amended to supersede <em>Appeal of Brown </em>by defining \u201cprevail\u201d as \u201creceiving] an award ... which is greater in amount than awarded by the decision which is the subject of the appeal.\u201d RSA 281-A:44, 1(a)(1) (Supp. 2007). Because the employee\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees award may differ depending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>upon the version of the statute applied, we must first determine which version applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">We are the final arbiter of legislative intent as expressed in the language of a statute. <em>Appeal of HCA Parkland Medical Clr., </em>143 N.H. 92, 94 (1998). Although we give undefined language its plain and ordinary meaning, we must keep in mind the intent of the legislation, which is determined by examining the construction of the statute as a whole, and not simply by examining isolated words and phrases found therein. <em>See id. </em>The express language of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law determines the nature and extent of compensation available to the injured employee. <em>See Rooney v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>138 N.H. 637, 638-39 (1994). When construing the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, we give the broadest reasonable effect to its remedial purpose, resolving all reasonable doubts in favor of the injured worker. <em>See Appeal of Cote, </em>139 N.H. 575, 578 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The employer contends that the statute in effect at the time that legal services were rendered governs the employee\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees. As legal services for this appeal did not begin until 2006, the employer maintains that the current version of RSA 281-A:44, I, applies. The employee counters that the date of injury should determine the controlling statutory authority. Because, the employee argues, the law in effect at the time of the injury generally applies in workers\u2019 compensation cases, the version of RSA 281-A:44,1, in effect at the time of injury should apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">As a general rule, the rights and liabilities of the parties in a workers\u2019 compensation case are determined by the law in effect on the date of injury. <em>Lessard v. City of Manchester Fire Dept., </em>118 N.H. 43, 47 (1978); <em>Rivard v. McElwain Co., </em>95 N.H. 100, 103 (1948). For example, in <em>Appeal of Cote, </em>144 N.H. 126, 128-29 (1999), we held that the law in effect on the date of the employee\u2019s injury, rather than at the time of total disability, governs an employee\u2019s entitlement to disability benefits for a recurring injury. <em>See also Burnham v. Downing, </em>125 N.H. 293, 298 (1984) (holding employer\u2019s liability and employee\u2019s rights to benefits are fixed as of the date of injury); <em>Davis v. Manchester, </em>100 N.H. 335, 340 (1956) (ruling amount of compensation to which employee is entitled is determined by law in force at time of injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Moreover, although a permanent impairment award is governed by the law in effect on the date the permanency of loss becomes apparent, <em>Petition of L\u2019Heureux, </em>132 N.H. 498, 500-01 (1989), this conclusion is derived from statutory construction. <em>Appeal of Cote, </em>144 N.H. at 129. There are no comparable statutory provisions or indications of legislative intent in the context of attorney\u2019s fees that would justify a departure from the general rule employed in workers\u2019 compensation cases. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>(rejecting argument that rule applied to permanent impairment awards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>should be adopted in determining the governing law for disability benefits).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The attorney\u2019s fees and costs authorized by RSA 281-A:44, I, are part of an overall legislative scheme. In addition to regulating the type and amount of benefits an injured worker may receive, the legislature has also seen fit to regulate awards of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. We see no principled reason to distinguish an award of attorney\u2019s fees from disability benefits or other rights and liabilities applicable to workers\u2019 compensation cases. <em>See Bateman v. Springer Bldg. Materials Corp., 777 </em>P.2d 383, 385 (N.M. Ct. App. 1989) (finding no reason to distinguish an award of attorney\u2019s fees from any other workers\u2019 compensation benefits to which claimant is entitled); <em>Daub v. Baker Concrete, </em>25 S.W.3d 124, 127 (Ky. 2000) (\u201cThe general rule is that an attorney\u2019s fee is governed by the law in effect on the date of injury because the worker\u2019s benefits, of which the attorney\u2019s fee is a function, are based upon the law in effect on the date of injury.\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>Cadwell v. Bechtel Power Corp., </em>732 P.2d 1352, 1354 (Mont. 1987); 2 R. ROSSI, ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES \u00a7 11:87, at 11-221 (3d. ed. 2001) (\u201cSeveral courts have held that in determining the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees to be awarded to a prevailing claimant in a disputed workers\u2019 compensation case, the statute in effect at the time of injury must be applied.\u201d). Accordingly, we hold that attorney\u2019s fees and costs in workers\u2019 compensation cases are governed by the statute in effect on the date of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">The employer argues, however, that the 2003 amendment to RSA 281-A:44,1, is remedial in nature and, thus, applies retroactively. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">We have long held that statutes are presumptively intended to operate prospectively. <em>Shannon v. Foster, </em>115 N.H. 699, 701 (1975). \u201cWhen the legislature is silent as to whether a statute should apply prospectively or retrospectively, [as is the case here,] our interpretation turns on whether the statute affects the parties\u2019 substantive or procedural rights.\u201d <em>State v. Hamel, </em>138 N.H. 392, 394 (1994). When a statute is remedial or procedural in nature, it may be applied to cases pending at the time of enactment. <em>Gelinas v. Mackey, </em>123 N.H. 690, 695 (1983). If application of a new law would adversely affect an individual\u2019s substantive rights, however, it may not be applied retroactively. <em>LeBarre v. Deneault, </em>123 N.H. 267, 272 (1983); <em>Lozier v. Brown Company, </em>121 N.H. 67, 70-71 (1981). Nevertheless, \u201c[i]n the final [analysis], the question of retrospective application rests on a determination of fundamental fairness, because the underlying purpose of all legislation is to promote justice.\u201d <em>Eldridge v. Eldridge, </em>136 N.H. 611, 613 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>While distinguishing substantive rights and liabilities from procedural rights and remedies is not a simple or formulaic matter, <em>see In the Matter of Goldman &amp; Elliott, </em>151 N.H. 770, 773 (2005), we find that the statute here affects the substantive rights of the parties. We have already noted that, in determining the governing law in effect in workers\u2019 compensation cases, attorney\u2019s fees are indistinguishable from other liabilities and rights \u2014 which are substantive. <em>See, e.g., Burnham, </em>125 N.H. at 298 (amendment increasing maximum compensation not applied retroactively); <em>Lessard, </em>118 N.H. at 367-68 (finding amendment to statute governing disability benefits not retroactive because application would \u201ccreate a new obligation, impose a new duty or attach a new disability in respect to past transactions\u201d). As such, it would be anomalous to hold that the statute governing attorney\u2019s fees is merely procedural. Because attorney\u2019s fees and costs are inextricably intertwined with other substantive benefits in the workers\u2019 compensation setting, we conclude that RSA 281-A:44,1, affects substantive rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Moreover, the amendment to RSA 281-A:44,1, changes the category of claimants entitled to collect attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Under the prior version of RSA 281-A:44,1, \u201cprevailing\u201d claimants included claimants who successfully appealed a board\u2019s decision and obtained a new hearing before the board. <em>See Appeal of Brown, </em>143 N.H. at 118-19. Under the current version, however, the new statutory definition of \u201cprevail\u201d may not apply to such claimants, a difference highlighted by the parties\u2019 dispute in this case. This change in the availability of attorney\u2019s fees and costs for certain claimants bolsters our conclusion that the amendment to RSA 281-A:44,1, substantively affects the respective rights and responsibilities of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Having determined that the prior version of RSA 281-A:44,1, applies to this case, we turn to the merits of the employee\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. As noted above, under former RSA 281-A:44, I, an employee who, on appeal, \u201csecure[s] a legal right or financial benefit greater than ... she had received prior to the appeal,\u201d is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and costs. <em>See Appeal of Brown, </em>143 N.H. at 119. A \u201cbenefit\u201d entitling the employee to fees is \u201cnot limited to payment of compensation,\u201d and it can \u201cinclude the grant of a nonmonetary benefit, such as a new hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 120. Thus, although we did not award medical payments to the employee for her chiropractic treatment, the employee is entitled to fees and costs incurred on appeal to this court because she \u201creceived a right \u2014 the right to have ... a hearing on entitlement to benefits on remand from this appeal \u2014 that [s]he did not possess prior to [this] appeal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>The employer does not dispute the amount of fees or costs. Accordingly, the employee is awarded attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $8,614.50 and costs in the amount of $508.51.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">\n<em>Motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs granted.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b568-6\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis and Galway, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
