We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The record supports the following. According to the petition, in May 2004, the Carriers\u2019 minor son sexually molested the Philbricks\u2019 children while he was babysitting them. The Philbricks subsequently brought a civil action against the Carriers, alleging negligent supervision and negligent entrustment. The Philbricks also brought claims against the Carriers\u2019 son for loss of consortium and assault and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">At the time of the molestation, the Carriers were insured under a homeowner\u2019s policy issued by Liberty Mutual. In response to the Philbricks\u2019 action, the Carriers filed a claim with Liberty Mutual seeking coverage under their policy. Liberty Mutual denied coverage on three grounds: (1) the events that gave rise to the claim for coverage did not constitute an \u201coccurrence\u201d as defined in the policy; (2) the policy excluded coverage for bodily injury \u201cexpected or intended by one or more \u2018insureds\u2019\u201d; and (3) the policy excluded coverage for bodily injury \u201c[ajrising out of sexual molestation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">In response to Liberty Mutual\u2019s denial, the Philbricks and Carriers jointly filed a declaratory judgment action to determine the extent to which Liberty Mutual was obligated to provide coverage. After the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court granted summary judgment for the Philbricks and Carriers, finding that the insurance policy covered the negligence claims. The court concluded that the alleged negligent supervision and negligent entrustment were \u201coccurrences,\u201d and that the intentional act and sexual molestation exclusionary clauses were ambiguous and did not preclude coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">In reviewing the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we consider the affidavits, and all inferences properly drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Marikar v. Peerless Ins. Co., </em>151 N.H. 395, 397 (2004). If there is no genuine issue of material fact, and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the grant of summary judgment is proper. <em>Id. </em>We review the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">Resolution of this dispute requires us to interpret the insurance policy. Interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law. <em>Peerless Ins. v. Vt. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>151 N.H. 71, 72 (2004). We construe the language of an insurance policy as would a reasonable person in the position of the insured based upon a more than casual reading of the policy as a whole. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number><em>Wilson v. Progressive N. Ins. Co., </em>151 N.H. 782, 788 (2005). Where the terms of the policy are clear and unambiguous, we accord the language its natural and ordinary meaning. <em>Id. </em>However, if the policy is reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation and one interpretation favors coverage, the policy will be construed in favor of the insured and against the insurer. <em>Id. </em>Absent a statutory provision or public policy to the contrary, an insurance company is free to limit its liability through an exclusion written in clear and unambiguous policy language. <em>Trombley v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>148 N.H. 748, 751 (2002). For exclusionary language to be considered clear and unambiguous, two parties cannot reasonably disagree about its meaning. <em>Id. </em>Pursuant to RSA 491:22-a (1997), \u201cthe burden of proving lack of insurance coverage is on the insurer.\u201d <em>Maville v. Peerless Ins. Co., </em>141 N.H. 317, 320 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">On appeal, Liberty Mutual argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that the sexual molestation exclusion unambiguously precludes coverage of the negligence claims asserted against the Carriers. The Philbricks counter that the language of the exclusion is ambiguous and, thus, should be construed in their favor. Additionally, the Philbricks argue that it was the Carriers\u2019 negligence that caused the children\u2019s injuries, rather than the sexual molestation, and thus the exclusionary clause is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The sexual molestation exclusion bars coverage for \u201c\u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 ... [a]rising out of sexual molestation, corporal punishment or physical or mental abuse____\u201d The Philbricks contend that this exclusion is ambiguous as applied to the facts of this case. They assert, and the trial court found, that a reasonable person could interpret the exclusion to preclude coverage only where the insured is the perpetrator. As a result, the Philbricks argue, their negligence claims against the Carriers remain covered under the policy because the Carriers did not perpetrate the sexual molestation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">We have consistently interpreted the phrase \u201carising out of\u201d as a \u201cvery broad, general and comprehensive term, which ... mean[s] \u2018originating from or growing out of or flowing from.\u2019\u201d <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Crouch, </em>140 N.H. 329, 332 (1995) (quoting <em>Merrimack School Dist. v. Nat\u2019l School Bus Serv., </em>140 N.H. 9, 13 (1995)). This means that \u201cthe causal connection between the [bodily injury and the tort alleged] must be more than tenuous.\u201d <em>Pro Con Constr. v. Acadia Ins. Co., </em>147 N.H. 470, 472 (2003). More specifically, we interpreted similar exclusionary language in <em>Preferred National Insurance Co. v. Docusearch, Inc., </em>149 N.H. 759 (2003), contrary to the Philbricks\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">In <em>Docusearch, </em>the administratrix of the estate of a homicide victim sued Docusearch for, among other things, causing the victim\u2019s death by negligently disseminating the victim\u2019s social security number and place of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>employment to a third party. <em>Id. </em>at 761. Doeuseareh\u2019s insurance company sought a declaratory judgment, arguing that it was under no obligation to defend or indemnify Docusearch against the negligence claim because of a policy provision that excluded coverage for \u201c[a]ctions and proceedings to recover damages for bodily injuries ... arising from ... assault and battery____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 761-62. We rejected the respondents\u2019 assertion that, under this language, the insurance company\u2019s obligations were determined solely by the actions of the insured. <em>Id. </em>at 763. Instead, we held that because damages are an essential part of a negligence claim, \u201cwhere the damages arise entirely out of an act that would not be covered under an insurance policy, the negligence claim is not one that would be covered under the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the respondents failed to allege any damages other than those suffered by the victim as a result of the assault and battery, we concluded that the assault and battery exclusion precluded coverage. <em>Id. </em>at 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">The Philbricks point out that other courts have reached different conclusions in interpreting similar exclusions. One view holds that such an exclusion does not bar coverage for a claim of negligent supervision because such a claim \u201carises\u201d not from sexual molestation, but from an insured\u2019s negligence. Not surprisingly, the Philbricks rely upon one such case, <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co. v. Schrum, </em>149 F.3d 878 (8th Cir. 1998). In <em>Schrum, </em>after the Schrums\u2019 houseguest sexually molested two minor children, the children\u2019s parents sued the Schrums for negligent supervision. <em>Id. </em>at 879. The court held an exclusion in the Schrums\u2019 insurance policy for \u201cbodily injury or property damage ... arising out of any sexual act, including but not limited to molestation, incest or rape\u201d did not apply because the perpetrator\u2019s alleged conduct was \u201cmerely incidental\u201d to the parents\u2019 negligence claim, and the allegations included \u201cseparate and non-excluded causes\u201d of the children\u2019s injuries. <em>Id. </em>at 880-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">Other courts have interpreted the phrase \u201carising out of\u201d more broadly to exclude claims having \u201csome causal connection\u201d to sexual molestation. <em>See American Commerce Ins. Co. v. Porto, </em>811 A.2d 1185, 1196 (R.I. 2002) (\u201cif the alleged sexual molestation is a cause of the claimed bodily injuries, then the existence of other alleged negligence claims and proximate causes is of no moment \u2014 the bodily injuries alleged are causally connected to or \u2018arise out of\u2019 the sexual molestation, and are thereby excluded from coverage\u201d); <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Bates, </em>185 F. Supp. 2d 607, 613 (E.D.N.C. 2000) (explicitly rejecting the conclusion reached in <em>Schrum, </em>reasoning that \u201c[wjithout the molestation there would be no injury and thus, no basis for the negligence claim\u201d); <em>Hingham Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Smith, </em>865 N.E.2d 1168, 1171-72 (Mass. App. Ct. 2007); <em>Northwest G.F. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Norgard, </em>518 N.W.2d 179, 184 (N.D. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number> The latter view is consistent with our holding in <em>Docusearch. </em>In <em>Docusearch, </em>we rejected the argument that the assault and battery exclusion did not apply to the negligence claim because the damages arose from the insured\u2019s negligence rather than the assault and battery. <em>Docusearch, </em>149 N.H. at 763. Although we note that the language of the insurance policy in <em>Docusearch </em>is slightly different from that in the instant case, the reasoning in <em>Docusearch </em>fully applies. The language of the exclusion in <em>Docusearch </em>places emphasis on whether the \u201cactions and proceedings to recover damages\u201d arose from the assault and battery, whereas here, the language precludes coverage for \u201c \u2018bodily injury\u2019 ... [a]rising out of sexual molestation.\u201d Particularly where, as here, the language of the policy explicitly ties the exclusion to the nature of the injury, the analysis should be directed toward the injuries suffered, rather than the causes of action in the complaint. <em>See Norgard, </em>518 N.W.2d at 184. In both instances, however, the focus is upon whether the alleged harm arose from an act excluded under the policy. <em>Docusearch, </em>149 N.H. at 763. Here, the damages alleged are the \u201cbodily injury to the Philbrick children and emotional distress for all plaintiffs.\u201d There can be no doubt that these injuries \u201coriginated] from or gr[e]w[] out of or flow[ed] from\u201d the sexual molestation. <em>See Crouch, </em>140 N.H. at 332. Although it can be argued that these injuries may, in a sense, have been caused by the Carriers\u2019 negligent acts, it does not follow that these injuries did not \u201carise out of\u201d sexual molestation. Indeed, there would be no injuries and, therefore, no damages under the negligence claims absent the sexual molestation. Thus, the alleged bodily injuries did \u201carise out of\u201d the excluded act of sexual molestation and, therefore, the exclusion applies to preclude coverage. <em>See also Winnacunnet v. National Union, </em>84 F.3d 32, 36 (1st Cir. 1996) (\u201cif underlying plaintiffs cannot prevail on their negligence claims without showing how the murder ... affected them, then their claims must \u201carise out of\u201d the excluded acts of assault, battery, bodily injury and death\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Given our conclusion, we need not consider whether the policy\u2019s intentional act exclusion applies. Accordingly, we find the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the Philbricks and Carriers and in denying summary judgment to Liberty Mutual.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b417-7\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, J., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
