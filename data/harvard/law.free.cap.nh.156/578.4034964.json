We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-19\">The parties stipulated to, or the record reveals, the following facts. On or about January 3,2000, each petitioner purchased the Polaris II variable annuity (Polaris II) sold by Anchor National Life Insurance Company (Anchor). Each annuity cost $350,000, resulting in a total initial investment of $700,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>The Polaris II is a group variable annuity product. Upon purchase of the Polaris II, the petitioners became part of a group comprised of individuals across the country who purchased the Polaris II. The members of this group are covered under the master group annuity contract issued by Anchor to Community First National Bank, Trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-3\">When they purchased the Polaris II, the petitioners were each issued a certificate evidencing coverage under the master group annuity contract. The certificate, entitled \u201cALLOCATED FIXED AND VARIABLE GROUP ANNUITY CERTIFICATE,\u201d provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-4\">ANCHOR NATIONAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY (\u201cWe\u201d, \u201cUs\u201d, the \u201cCompany\u201d, or \u201cAnchor National\u201d) agrees to provide benefits to the Participant under the Group Contract, in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Certif\u00edcate and in consideration of Purchase Payments We receive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">This Certificate is evidence of coverage under the Group Contract. The coverage will begin as of the Certificate Date, shown on the Certificate Data page.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">The value of amounts allocated to the Separate Account during the accumulation and annuity periods is not guaranteed, and will increase or decrease based upon the investment experience of the Variable Portfolios You choose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">RIGHT TO EXAMINE \u2014 You may return this Certificate to Our Annuity Service Center or to the agent through whom the Certificate was purchased within 10 days after You receive it, if You are not satisfied with it. The Company will refund the Purchase Payment(s) paid. Upon such refund, the Certificate will be void. We reserve the right to allocate Your Purchase Payment(s) to the Cash Management Portfolio until the end of the Right to Examine period. Thereafter, allocations will be made as shown on the Certificate Data Page.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">In 1999, the department reviewed and approved this certificate for issuance and delivery in New Hampshire. The department, however, has not reviewed or approved the master group annuity contract for issuance and delivery in New Hampshire. Rather, that contract was reviewed by the Nebraska Department of Insurance and issued in Nebraska to Community First National Bank, Trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>In July 2005, the petitioners requested a copy of the master group annuity contract from the department. They received a letter from the respondent\u2019s deputy, enclosing a copy of Anchor\u2019s 1999 letter seeking the department\u2019s approval to sell the Polaris II in New Hampshire. The deputy\u2019s letter indicated that the approval stamp affixed by the department on Anchor\u2019s letter served as the department\u2019s approval of the Polaris II contract for issuance and delivery in New Hampshire. The letter also explained that the petitioners had purchased a group annuity product, rather than an individual annuity product. The letter informed the petitioners that a group certificate cannot be sold to an individual who is not a member of the group and that the petitioners became members of a group when they purchased the Polaris II. The letter further informed the petitioners that when they invested in the Polaris II, they actually invested in the stock portfolios of the Anchor Series Trust and that the investors in the Trust constituted a group.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">In November 2005, the petitioners wrote to Anchor\u2019s parent company requesting return of their premium investment with three percent interest, alleging that their insurance agent had misrepresented the type of annuity they purchased. In response, the parent company informed the petitioners that they had, in fact, been issued group annuity contracts, as stated in their certificates, and that, pursuant to their certificates, the ten-day period to cancel their contracts and obtain their premium payments had already lapsed. The parent company explained that the petitioners became members of a group when they invested in the Polaris II and its underlying stock portfolios and, as a result, they invested in a group annuity, not an individual annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">In August 2006, the petitioners filed a petition for declaratory judgment, alleging that based upon their agent\u2019s representations and the forms he provided, they thought that they were purchasing individual, not group, annuities. They alleged that when they realized that they had purchased group annuities, they asked the department about its approval of the Polaris II. They brought the declaratory judgment proceeding because they were not satisfied with the answers they received from the department. They sought, among other things, a declaration that the department violated RSA 408:52 (2006) when it approved the Polaris II for issuance and delivery in New Hampshire. Both parties moved for summary judgment. The trial court ruled in the department\u2019s favor, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">We will affirm a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment if, considering the evidence and all inferences properly drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-movant, our review of that evidence discloses no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>judgment as a matter of law. <em>Stewart v. Bader, </em>154 N.H. 75, 87 (2006). We review the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The sole issue for our review is whether the trial court erroneously interpreted RSA 408:52. We review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretation de novo. <em>Bendetson v. Killarney, Inc., </em>154 N.H. 637, 641 (2006). We are the final arbiter of the legislature\u2019s intent regarding the meaning of a statute considered as a whole. <em>Id. </em>We first examine the language of the statute, and, where possible, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meanings to the words used. <em>Id. </em>When a statute\u2019s language is plain and unambiguous, we need not look beyond it for further indication of legislative intent, and we refuse to consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to incorporate into the statute. <em>Id. </em>Finally, we interpret a statute in the context of the overall statutory scheme and not in isolation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">RSA 408:52 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">No registered insurance corporation or its salesmen or agents shall sell or offer for sale any form of variable contract unless the sale of such form of contract has been approved by the commissioner. Such a corporation desiring to qualify such variable contract form shall submit to the commissioner such descriptive statistical, or documentary information as he may require. The commissioner shall after examination of such information approve or disapprove the sale of such variable contract in the said form.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">A variable contract is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-9\">any life insurance policy or annuity contract issued by an insurance company which provides that the dollar amount of benefits or other contractual payments thereunder may vary according to the investment experience of any separate account or accounts maintained by the insurance company in which amounts received in connection with such policies or contracts have been placed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">RSA 408:27 (2006). The petitioners do not dispute that the Polaris II is a \u201cvariable contract\u201d within the meaning of RSA 408:27.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">The petitioners argue that RSA 408:52 required the department to approve the master group annuity contract before allowing the Polaris II to be sold in New Hampshire. They contend that the phrase \u201cform of contract\u201d as used in RSA 408:52 refers to \u201cthe actual master group contract or the form of contract given to individual participants\u201d under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>that contract. They assert that because the department approved only the certificate, and did not approve the master group annuity contract itself, the sale of the Polaris II to them did not comply with RSA 408:52, and was void as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The petitioners err by reading the phrase \u201cform of contract\u201d in isolation. \u201cWe do not read words or phrases in isolation, but rather in the context of the entire statute.\u201d <em>Appeal of Kaplan, </em>153 N.H. 296, 299 (2006) (quotation omitted). RSA 408:52 does not require the respondent to approve the \u201cform of contract\u201d; it requires him to approve <em>\u201cthe sale </em>of such form of contract.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In context, therefore, the use of the word \u201cform\u201d refers to the type or kind of variable contract, rather than the actual paper form. <em>Compare </em>WEBSTER\u2019S Third NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 892 (unabridged ed. 2002) (definition 4(e)(1) defines form as a \u201cprinted or typed document with blank spaces for insertion of required or requested specific information\u201d), <em>with </em>WEBSTER\u2019S, <em>supra </em>(definition 9(a) defines form as \u201cone of the different modes of existence, action or manifestation of a particular thing or substance : KIND, MODIFICATION, SPECIES, VARIETY\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Here, as the trial court found, and as the parties do not dispute, the department approved Anchor\u2019s request to offer the Polaris II for sale in New Hampshire. This approval complied with RSA 408:52. By approving the Polaris II for sale in New Hampshire, the department approved the sale of the Polaris II as a \u201cform of variable contract.\u201d RSA 408:52. Therefore, we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling that the sale of the Polaris II to the petitioners did not violate RSA 408:52.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b606-8\">Dalianis, Duggan, Galway and Hicks, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
