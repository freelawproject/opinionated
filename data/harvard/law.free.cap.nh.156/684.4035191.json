We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-18\">The following facts were found by the trial court for purposes of ruling upon the defendant\u2019s pretrial motion to dismiss or were stipulated to by the parties. At the time he was arrested, the defendant worked as a photographer at a camp in Amherst for children fifteen years old and younger. In that capacity, the defendant took pictures that were to be used to make an end-of-summer video yearbook or scrapbook for the children attending the camp.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>On July 4, 2005, the defendant gave three CD-ROM discs to the camp director. On one of the discs, the director discovered images depicting heads and necks of minor females superimposed upon naked adult female bodies, with the naked bodies engaging in various sexual acts. One image shows an act of sexual intercourse; two images depict a person engaging in or about to engage in cunnilingus; two images depict a person digitally penetrating or touching a female\u2019s genitalia; and four images show comparably explicit sexual activity. The defendant and at least one of his family members appear in some of the images. The parties stipulated that, \u201c[o]ther than necks and heads, there is no specific evidence that the images in question contain the body parts of actual children.\u201d In addition to these images, the CD-ROMs contained the original non-pornographic camp photographs of the minor females.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The camp director identified two of the faces in the images as those of campers from the summer of 2004, who would have been fifteen years old at the time the photographs were taken. He gave the discs to the Amherst Police Department. The parents of all the females involved were able to identify the individuals as girls under sixteen at the time the images were created. When questioned, the defendant told the police that the sexually explicit \u201cphotographs were only his \u2018personal fantasy\u2019 and that they were not real.\u201d The defendant was indicted for possession of child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Before trial, the defendant moved to dismiss, arguing that the prosecution pursuant to RSA 649-A:3,1(e) violated his rights under Part I, Article 22 of the New Hampshire Constitution and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Following the denial of his motion, the defendant was convicted based upon stipulated facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his constitutional challenges to RSA 649-A:3. That statute provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[a] person is guilty of a felony if such person ... (e) Knowingly buys, procures, possesses, or controls any visual representation of a child engaging in sexual activity.\u201d RSA 649-A:3, I (2007). The defendant contends that, under both the Federal and State Constitutions, RSA 649-A:3 is facially overbroad, and as applied to his conduct, violates his right to free speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">For purposes of this appeal, although we acknowledge that the images at issue may more properly be characterized as \u201ccomposite images,\u201d <em>see United States v. Rearden, </em>349 F.3d 608, 613 (9th Cir. 2003) (noting distinction between \u201ccomposite\u201d and \u201cmorphed\u201d images), we adopt the terminology used by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, </em>535 U.S. 234, 242 (2002), and refer to the images in question as \u201cmorphed images.\u201d <em>Ashcroft, </em>535 U.S. at 242. As the Supreme Court explained, in contrast to wholly computer-generated images, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>is a \u201cmore common and lower tech means of creating virtual images, known as computer morphing. Rather than creating original images, pornographers can alter innocent pictures of real children so that the children appear to be engaged in sexual activity.\u201d <em>Ashcroft, </em>535 U.S. at 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">We first address the defendant\u2019s as-applied challenge. We review questions of constitutional law <em>de novo. State v. Decato, </em>156 N.H. 570, 573 (2007). As noted above, the defendant raises his claims under both the State and Federal Constitutions. Our settled rule is to first address the defendant\u2019s claims under the State Constitution, <em>State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231 (1983), and cite federal opinions for guidance only. <em>State v. MacElman, </em>154 N.H. 304, 307 (2006). Here, however, because United States Supreme Court precedents compel us to hold that criminalizing the defendant\u2019s mere possession of the images in question violates his First Amendment rights, and because we are required to follow federal constitutional law, an analysis under the State Constitution is unnecessary. We therefore decide this case under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">\u201cThe First Amendment commands, \u2018Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech.\u2019\u201d <em>Ashcroft, </em>535 U.S. at 244. \u201cAs a general principle, the First Amendment bars the government from dictating what we see or read or speak or hear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245. \u201c[A] law imposing criminal penalties on protected speech is a stark example of speech suppression.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244. If a statute regulates speech based upon its content, application of the statute is subject to strict scrutiny. <em>United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., </em>529 U.S. 803, 813 (2000); <em>see Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, </em>492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989). This places the burden upon the State to prove that the statute is \u201cnarrowly tailored to promote a compelling [state] interest. If a less restrictive alternative would serve the [state]\u2019s purpose, the legislature must use that alternative.\u201d <em>Playboy Entertainment Group, </em>529 U.S. at 813 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The United States Supreme Court has determined that content-based restrictions on certain categories of speech satisfy strict scrutiny, and, thus, are not entitled to absolute constitutional protection. <em>Ashcroft, </em>535 U.S. at 245-46; <em>see People v. Alexander, </em>791 N.E.2d 506, 509 (Ill. 2003). This unprotected speech \u201cinclud[es] defamation, incitement, obscenity, and pornography produced with real children.\u201d <em>Ashcroft, </em>535 U.S. at 246. Obscenity and child pornography are the two categories relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">\u201cThe regulation of child pornography was initially rooted in the Supreme Court\u2019s obscenity doctrine.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>444 F.3d 1286, 1290 (11th Cir. 2006). In <em>Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. 15 (1973), the Supreme Court reaffirmed that distribution of \u201cobscene material is not protected by the First Amendment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 36, and set forth a standard for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>determining what materials may be regulated as obscenity, <em>id. </em>at 24. Under this standard, \u201cthe Government must prove that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, is patently offensive in light of community standards, and lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\u201d <em>Ashcroft, </em>535 U.S. at 246 (citing <em>Miller, </em>413 U.S. at 24).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">While the government has \u201cbroad power to regulate obscenity,\u201d the Supreme Court held in <em>Stanley v. Georgia, </em>394 U.S. 557 (1969), that this \u201cpower ... does not extend to mere possession by the individual in the privacy of his own home.\u201d <em>Stanley, </em>394 U.S. at 568. In so holding, the Court rejected all of Georgia\u2019s justifications for banning the mere possession of obscene materials. <em>Id. </em>at 565-68. First, the Court explained that the asserted \u201cright to protect the individual\u2019s mind from the effects of obscenity\u201d is \u201cwholly inconsistent with the philosophy of the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 565-66. Second, it rejected Georgia\u2019s assertion that \u201cexposure to obscene materials may lead to deviant sexual behavior or crimes of sexual violence,\u201d because there was \u201clittle empirical basis for that assertion\u201d and \u201cthe deterrents ordinarily to be applied to prevent crime are education and punishment for violations of the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 566-67 (quotation omitted). Third, the Court found that, in a possession case, there is no \u201cdanger that obscene material might fall into the hands of children, or that it might intrude upon the sensibilities or privacy of the general public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 567 (citations omitted). Finally, the Court flatly rejected the argument that \u201cprohibition of possession of obscene materials is a necessary incident to statutory schemes prohibiting distribution\u201d as a result of \u201cdifficulties of proving an intent to distribute or in producing evidence of actual distribution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It found that such difficulties, if they existed, did not \u201cjustify infringement of the individual\u2019s right to read or observe what he pleases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 568. Accordingly, the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit making mere private possession of obscene material a crime.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">With respect to child pornography, <em>New York v. Ferber, </em>458 U.S. 747, 764-66 (1982), and <em>Osborne v. Ohio, </em>495 U.S. 103, 111 (1990), together hold that a state may proscribe the distribution and mere possession of child pornography. Both cases recognized that states have a compelling interest \u201cin safeguarding the physical and psychological well-being of a minor.\u201d <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. at 756-57 (quotation omitted); <em>see Osborne, </em>495 U.S. at 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">In <em>Ferber, </em>the Court relied upon three justifications for a proscription on the distribution of child pornography. First, the Court reasoned, \u201cThe distribution of photographs and films depicting sexual activity by juveniles is intrinsically related to the sexual abuse of children in at least two ways\u201d: (1) \u201cthe materials produced are a permanent record of the children\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>participation and the harm to the child is exacerbated by their circulation\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe distribution network for child pornography must be closed if the production of material which requires the sexual exploitation of children is to be effectively controlled.\u201d <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. at 759. Second, the Court determined that \u201c[t]he advertising and selling of child pornography provide an economic motive for and are thus an integral part of the production of such materials, an activity illegal throughout the Nation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 761. Finally, the Court found that \u201c[t]he value of permitting live performances and photographic reproductions of children engaged in lewd sexual conduct is exceedingly modest, if not <em>de minimus.\u201d Id. </em>at 762. It noted that if \u201cvisual depictions of children performing sexual acts ... were necessary for literary or artistic value, a person over the statutory age who perhaps looked younger could be utilized. Simulation outside of the prohibition of the statute could provide another alternative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 762-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Accordingly, because \u201c[rjecognizing and classifying child pornography as a category of material outside the protection of the First Amendment [wa]s not incompatible \"with [its] earlier decisions,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 763, the Court concluded that, generally, \u201c[c]ontent-based restrictions on child pornography satisfy strict scrutiny,\u201d <em>Alexander, </em>791 N.E.2d at 510 (citing <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. at 756-59). The Court noted, however, that there are \u201climits on the category of child pornography which, like obscenity, is unprotected by the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. at 763. Thus, \u201cdistribution of descriptions or other depictions of sexual conduct, not otherwise obscene, which do not involve live performance or photographic or other visual reproduction of live performances, retains First Amendment protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 764-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">In <em>Osborne, </em>the Court extended Ferber\u2019s holding to allow states to proscribe the mere possession of child pornography. <em>Osborne, </em>495 U.S. at 111. The Court noted that, in contrast to <em>Stanley, </em>where Georgia \u201cwas concerned that obscenity would poison the minds of its viewers,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 109 (citation omitted), Ohio did \u201cnot rely on a paternalistic interest in regulating Osborne\u2019s mind,\u201d <em>id. </em>Rather, Ohio proscribed possession of child pornography \u201cto protect the victims of child pornography\u201d by \u201cdestroy[ing] a market for the exploitative use of children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the Court found that \u201cthe interests underlying child pornography prohibitions far exceeded] the interests justifying the Georgia law at issue in <em>Stanley.\u201d Id. </em>at 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\"><em>Osborne </em>additionally found that several interests justified Ohio\u2019s ban upon the possession of child pornography. First, \u201cthe use of children as subjects of pornographic materials is harmful to the physiological, emotional, and mental health of the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 109. Second, it explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>that \u201cpenalizing] those who possess and view\u201d child pornography will decrease its production, \u201cthereby decreasing demand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 109-10. Third, relying upon <em>Ferber, </em>the Court reasoned: \u201cMaterials produced by child pornographers permanently record the victim\u2019s abuse. The pornography\u2019s continued existence causes the child victims continuing harm by haunting the children in years to come. The State\u2019s ban on possession and viewing encourages the possessors of these materials to destroy them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111 (citation omitted). Finally, the Court found that \u201cencouraging the destruction of these materials is ... desirable because evidence suggests that pedophiles use child pornography to seduce other children into sexual activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, \u201c[g]iven the gravity of the State\u2019s interests in this context,\u201d the Court held that Ohio could \u201cconstitutionally proscribe the possession and viewing of child pornography.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">In <em>Ashcroft, </em>the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional as overbroad section 2256(8)(B) of the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 (CPPA), <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2251 <em>et seq., </em>which prohibited \u201cany visual depiction, including any photograph, film, video, picture, or computer or computer-generated image or picture, that is, <em>or appears to be, </em>of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\u201d <em>Ashcroft, </em>535 U.S. at 241 (quotations omitted; emphasis added). This \u201csection capture[d] a range of depictions, sometimes called \u2018virtual child pornography,\u2019 which include computer-generated images, as well as images produced by more traditional means.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It also encompassed pornography \u201ccreated by using adults who look like minors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">In finding section 2256(8)(B) overbroad, the Supreme Court, although not explicitly, applied the strict scrutiny standard described above. <em>See Alexander, </em>791 N.E.2d at 511 (concluding that, in <em>Ashcroft, </em>\u201csection!] 2256(8)(B)... did not pass strict scrutiny because ... [it was] not narrowly tailored to advance the government\u2019s compelling interest in protecting actual children from sexual abuse\u201d); Note, <em>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition: How can Virtual Child Pornography be Banned Under the First Amendment, </em>31 PEPP. L. Rev. 825, 855 (2004) (\u201cthe Justices implicitly applied strict scrutiny\u201d). The Court noted, \u201c[T]he [Government\u2019s] speech ban is not narrowly drawn. The objective is to prohibit illegal conduct, but this restriction goes well beyond that interest by restricting the speech available to law-abiding adults.\u201d <em>Ashcroft, </em>535 U.S. at 252-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">The Government first argued that virtual child pornography fell within the category of child pornography unprotected by <em>Ferber </em>because it is \u201cvirtually indistinguishable from child pornography.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249. The Court rejected this contention for two reasons. First, in <em>Ferber, </em>\u201c[t]he production <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>of the work, not its content, was the target of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, \u201c[w]here the images are themselves the product of child sexual abuse, <em>Ferber </em>recognized that the State had an interest in stamping it out without regard to any judgment about its content.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The Court clarified that <em>Osborne </em>\u201canchored its holding [that possession of child pornography is unprotected] in the concern for the participants, those whom it called the \u2018victims of child pornography.\u2019 It did not suggest that, absent this concern, other governmental interests would suffice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 250 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Second, the Court rejected the Government\u2019s assertion that virtual child pornography \u201ccan lead to actual instances of child abuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It explained that, for virtual child pornography, \u201cthe causal link is contingent and indirect\u201d because \u201c[t]he harm does not necessarily follow from the speech, but depends upon some unquantified potential for subsequent criminal acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court found such indirect harms insufficient because, although \u201cchild pornography rarely can be valuable speech,\u201d <em>id., \u201cFerber\u2019s </em>judgment about child pornography was based upon how it was made, not on what it communicated,\u201d and <em>\u201cFerber </em>did not hold that child pornography is by definition without value,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 250-51. The Court concluded, \u201cIn contrast to the speech in <em>Ferber, </em>speech that itself is the record of sexual abuse, the CPPA prohibits speech that records no crime and creates no victims by its production. Virtual child pornography is not \u2018intrinsically related\u2019 to the sexual abuse of children, as were the materials in <em>Ferber.\u201d Id. </em>at 250. Accordingly, the Court rejected the government\u2019s assertion that virtual child pornography is unprotected speech under <em>Ferber. Id. </em>at 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Given its holding that virtual child pornography is protected speech, the Court went on to apply strict scrutiny to determine whether the Government could constitutionally proscribe this speech. Applying this demanding test, the Court flatly rejected the Government\u2019s justifications for banning virtual child pornography. First, the Government asserted that \u201cthe CPPA [wa]s necessary because pedophiles may use virtual child pornography to seduce children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court disagreed and found that the CPPA was not \u201cnarrowly drawn\u201d to achieve this objective. <em>Id. </em>at 252. It explained, \u201cThe Government cannot ban speech fit for adults simply because it may fall into the hands of children. The evil in question depends upon the actor\u2019s unlawful conduct, conduct defined as criminal quite apart from any link to the speech in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the restriction upon virtual child pornography went \u201cwell beyond\u201d the interest in \u201cprohibiting] illegal conduct\u201d by \u201crestricting the speech available to law-abiding adults.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 252-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>Second, the Government submitted that \u201cvirtual child pornography-whets the appetites of pedophiles and encourages them to engage in illegal conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253. This rationale could not sustain the ban on virtual child pornography because \u201c[t]he mere tendency of speech to encourage unlawful acts is not a sufficient reason for banning it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Quoting <em>Stanley, </em>394 U.S. at 566, the Court explained that \u201c[t]he government \u2018cannot constitutionally premise legislation on the desirability of controlling a person\u2019s private thoughts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>It also \u201cmay not prohibit speech because it increases the chance an unlawful act will be committed at some indefinite future time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Accordingly, because \u201c[t]he Government ha[d] shown no more than a remote connection between speech that might encourage thoughts or impulses and any resulting child abuse,\u201d <em>id., </em>the Court concluded that \u201cthe Government [could] not prohibit speech on the ground that it may encourage pedophiles to engage in illegal conduct,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 253-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Third, the Government \u201cargue[d] that its objective of eliminating the market for pornography produced using real children necessitates a prohibition on virtual images as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 254. The Government submitted that since they are often indistinguishable and exchanged in the same market, the \u201cvirtual images promote the trafficking in works produced through the exploitation of real children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rejecting this market deterrence theory, the Court noted that \u201c[i]n the case of the material covered by <em>Ferber, </em>the creation of the speech is itself the crime of child abuse; the prohibition deters the crime by removing the profit motive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because \u201cthere is no underlying crime at all\u201d with virtual child pornography, the Government\u2019s market deterrence theory did not justify the statute. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Finally, the Government maintained that virtual child pornography needed to be banned because advanced technology makes it difficult to determine whether \u201cpictures were made by using real children or by using computer imaging,\u201d thus making it difficult \u201cto prosecute those who produce pornography by using real children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 254-55. The Supreme Court found that this argument \u201cturn[ed] the First Amendment upside down.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255. It explained: \u201cProtected speech does not become unprotected merely because it resembles the latter. The Constitution requires the reverse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the Government could not ban \u201cunprotected speech if a substantial amount of protected speech [wa]s prohibited or chilled in the process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, because section 2256(8) (B) left \u201cunprotected a substantial amount of speech not tied to the Government\u2019s interest in distinguishing images produced using real children from virtual ones,\u201d and \u201ccover[ed] materials beyond the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>categories recognized in <em>Ferber </em>and <em>Miller,\u201d </em>the Court held that the provision was \u201coverbroad and unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Relying upon the foregoing cases, the defendant argues that applying RSA 649-A:3 to his private possession of morphed images, namely \u201cimages created by combining the head and shoulders of a real, existing child, with images of adult bodies, real or virtual, engaging in sexually explicit conduct,\u201d violates his right to free speech under both the Federal and State Constitutions. The defendant \u201cdoes not claim that the state or federal constitutions preclude the government from criminalizing the <em>distribution </em>of such material.\u201d Rather, he contends that <em>\u201cAshcroft, Ferber </em>and <em>Osborne, </em>read together, mandate the conclusion that morphed images, that depict actual children but depict no children actually engaging in sexually [sic] activity, do not constitute child pornography.\u201d According to the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\">[T]he overall set of rationales and principles relied upon by <em>Ferber, </em>and reinforced by <em>Ashcroft\u2019s </em>discussion of <em>Ferber, </em>support the narrow view that materials cannot be classified as child pornography unless children are involved in the production process \u2014 not the \u201cpost-production\u201d process where images can be cut, pasted, and morphed \u2014 but the production process, the actual, sordid, filming or photography of child sexual abuse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The State counters that because the defendant\u2019s images \u201cincorporate identifiable pictures of real children,\u201d they \u201ccreate harm to those children, even if the original pictures did not involve sexual activity, [since] those children are <em>depicted </em>as participating in such activity through manipulation of their likeness.\u201d The State argues that \u201charm is caused even when only one person views such an image,\u201d and, thus, \u201cthe State has a legitimate interest in preventing that harm, and no right of free speech is violated by prohibiting the possession of such images.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">RSA 649-A:l (2007) declares the legislature\u2019s purpose in criminalizing child pornography. It provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-8\">The legislature finds that there has been a proliferation of exploitation of children through their <em>use as subjects in sexual performances. </em>The care of children is a sacred trust and should not be abused by those who seek to profit through a commercial network based upon the exploitation of children. The public policy of the statute demands the protection of children from exploitation through sexual performances____In accordance with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in New York v. Ferber, this chapter makes the dissemination of visual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>representations of children under the age of 16 engaged in sexual activity illegal irrespective of whether the visual representations are legally obscene.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">(Emphasis added.) Interpreting the identical legislative declaration in New York\u2019s statute, <em>Ferber </em>found that a state has a compelling interest \u201cin safeguarding the physical and psychological health of a minor.\u201d <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. at 756-57 (quotation omitted). As with our legislature\u2019s declaration, the focus in New York\u2019s statute was to combat the harm resulting to children from the distribution of depictions of sexual conduct involving live performance or visual reproduction of live performances by children. <em>Id. </em>at 764-65. Thus, the purpose of RSA 649-A:3 is to prevent harm to children resulting from their \u201cuse as subjects in sexual performances.\u201d RSA 649-A:l.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">While this interest is undoubtedly compelling, <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. at 756-57, criminalizing the <em>possession </em>of materials depicting heads and necks of identifiable minor females superimposed upon naked female bodies, where the naked bodies do not depict body parts of actual children engaging in sexual activity, does not promote this interest. Contrary to the State\u2019s assertion, when no part of the image is \u201cthe product of sexual abuse,\u201d <em>Ashcroft, </em>535 U.S. at 249, and a person merely possesses the image, no demonstrable harm results to the child whose face is depicted in the image.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">In <em>Ashcroft, </em>the Court emphasized that <em>\u201cFerber1 </em>s judgment about child pornography was based upon how it was made, not on what it communicated.\u201d <em>Ashcroft, </em>535 U.S. at 250-51. Unlike the images in <em>Ferber </em>and <em>Osborne, </em>the images in this case do not \u201cpermanently record the [child]\u2019s abuse.\u201d <em>Osborne, </em>495 U.S. at 111. Although they may constitute a \u201cpermanent record\u201d that <em>if distributed, </em>may be harmful to the depicted child, such harm does not necessarily follow from the mere possession of these morphed images. Instead, the harm is contingent upon the occurrence of another arguably unlawful act; to wit, distribution. <em>See Ashcroft, </em>535 U.S. at 250. The State \u201cmay not prohibit speech because it increases the chance an unlawful act will be committed at some indefinite future time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">Further, while <em>Osborne </em>proscribes the mere possession of pornography produced with real children, <em>see Ashcroft, </em>535 U.S. at 245-46; <em>Osborne, </em>495 U.S. at 111, its holding is anchored in \u201cthe concern for the participants, those whom it called the Victims of child pornography,\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft, </em>535 U.S. at 250 (quoting <em>Osborne, </em>495 U.S. at 110). These participants are the children who have been sexually abused or exploited in the production of the materials. <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. at 759. The mere possession of morphed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>images depicting no victims of child pornography cannot \u201chaunt[] the children in years to come,\u201d <em>Osborne, </em>495 U.S. at 111, since the children do not know of their existence and did not participate in their production. Therefore, the foundation for <em>Osborne\u2019s </em>proscription on possession of child pornography is not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Moreover, while a ban upon the possession of these morphed images may encourage possessors to destroy them, besides the indirect harm that may result from the potential distribution of these materials, the State has not advanced any additional narrow justification supporting this interest. As explained above, the possible circulation of these materials is insufficient justification for banning protected speech. <em>Ashcroft, </em>535 U.S. at 250, 253. To the extent the State asserts that these morphed images require destruction because pedophiles use them to \u201cseduce other children into sexual activity,\u201d <em>Osborne, </em>495 U.S. at 111, the Supreme Court explicitly rejected this rationale in <em>Ashcroft. Ashcroft, </em>535 U.S. at 253-54. Additionally, because they are not the product of the crime of child abuse, criminalizing the possession of these morphed images created from \u201cinnocent pictures\u201d of actual children would not eliminate the market for pornography produced through the abuse of real children. <em>Ashcroft, </em>535 U.S. at 254. Therefore, their possession is \u201cnot \u2018intrinsically related\u2019 to the sexual abuse of children, as were the materials in <em>Ferber.\u201d Ashcroft, </em>535 U.S. at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Finally, however distasteful, reprehensible, and valueless this conduct might seem, <em>cf. Ferber, </em>458 U.S. at 762, the First Amendment protects \u201cthe individual\u2019s right to ... observe what he pleases,\u201d <em>Stanley, </em>394 U.S. at 567-68. This protection is central to our long and sacred tradition of prohibiting the government from intruding into the privacy of our thoughts and the contents of our homes. We cannot displace this guarantee simply because the materials at issue may express ideas that are unconventional and not shared by a majority. <em>See id. </em>at 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Although <em>Ashcroft </em>stated, in dicta, that morphed images \u201cimplicate the interests of real children and are in that sense closer to the images in <em>Ferber,\u201d Ashcroft, </em>535 U.S. at 242, <em>Ferber </em>involved the <em>distribution </em>of child pornography, not its possession, <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. at 751-52. Unlike a distribution case, in the private possession realm, neither the real child nor the general public observes the images; only the possessor views them. <em>See Stanley, </em>394 U.S. at 567. Thus, while distribution of these morphed images might implicate the interests of real children, mere possession does not cause harm to the child. Accordingly, applying the standard articulated in <em>Ashcroft, Ferber, </em>and <em>Stanley </em>to the defendant, the statute is not narrowly tailored to achieve the State\u2019s asserted objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>The State cites <em>United States v. Bach, </em>400 F.3d 622 (8th Cir. 2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 901 (2005), in support of its position that these morphed images may be criminalized. In <em>Bach, </em>\u201ca photograph of the head of a well known juvenile, AC, was skillfully inserted onto the body of [a young] nude <em>boy </em>so that the resulting depiction appeared] to be a picture of AC engaging in sexually explicit conduct with a knowing grin.\u201d <em>Bach, </em>400 F.3d at 632 (emphasis added). The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\">Although there is no contention that the nude body actually is that of AC or that he was involved in the production of the image, a lasting record has been created of AC, an identifiable minor child, seemingly engaged in sexually explicit activity. He is thus victimized every time the picture is displayed. Unlike ... virtual child pornography or ... pornography using youthful looking adults ..., this image created an identifiable child victim of sexual exploitation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-6\"><em>Id. </em>The Court noted, however, that \u201c[t]his is not the typical morphing case in which an <em>innocent </em>picture of a child has been altered to appear that the child is engaging in sexually explicit conduct,\u201d and that \u201cthere may well be instances in which the [statute] violates the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 632 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\"><em>Bach </em>is distinguishable for two reasons. First, in <em>Bach, </em>the defendant challenged his conviction \u201cfor <em>receipt </em>of child pornography under [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 2252A(a)(2),\u201d <em>id. </em>at 629 (emphasis added), not <em>possession </em>of child pornography, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5). A conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(2) requires that a person \u201cknowingly <em>receiveB </em>or <em>distributeB ... </em>child pornography [or material that contains child pornography] that has been mailed, or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means, including by computer.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(2) (emphases added); <em>see Bach, </em>400 F.3d at 630. Since these pictures do not remain within the privacy of a person\u2019s home, but instead disseminate into commerce, the interests of real children arguably may be implicated in such cases. Here, the defendant was not charged with receiving or distributing the images. <em>See </em>RSA 649-A:3, I(c)-(f). Therefore, we do not address whether we might reach the same result as <em>Bach </em>if presented with a case involving the receipt or distribution of morphed images.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">Second, unlike these morphed images, the <em>Bach </em>picture depicted a young nude <em>boy </em>engaged in sexually explicit activity. <em>Bach, </em>400 F.3d at 632. Thus, in <em>Bach, </em>the creation of the photograph involved the use and sexual exploitation of a real child. In contrast, the record here contains no evidence indicating that any of these morphed images depict similar conduct by a real child. Accordingly, while we might reach a different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>result if presented with the facts in <em>Bach, </em>this case constitutes one of those instances where application of a statute proscribing the possession of child pornography violates the First Amendment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Our finding that application of RSA 649-A:3, 1(e) to the defendant\u2019s conduct violates his First Amendment right to free speech is limited to the facts of this particular case, where the defendant is charged with mere possession of morphed images that depict heads and necks of identifiable minor females superimposed upon naked female bodies, and the naked bodies do not depict body parts of actual children engaging in sexual activity. Given this finding, we do not reach the defendant\u2019s overbreadth challenge. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s convictions are reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b720-7\">BRODERICK, C.J., concurred; Hicks, J., dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b720-8\">HICKS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AqS\">dissenting. Because I believe that United States Supreme Court precedents do not compel the result the majority reaches and I believe that the State may constitutionally criminalize the defendant\u2019s mere possession of the images in question, I respectfully dissent. I would hold that the images possessed and controlled by the defendant are \u201cvisual representation[s] of a child engaging in sexual activity\u201d as proscribed by RSA 649-A:3 (2007); that the statute is not fatally overbroad; and that its applicability to the defendant\u2019s conduct violates no free speech rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">First, I cannot conclude that <em>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, </em>535 U.S. 234 (2002), compels a finding that the defendant\u2019s morphed images are protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution in part because the Court explicitly left that question open. The respondents in <em>Ashcroft </em>did not challenge the provision of the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 (CPPA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2251 <em>et seq., </em>that prohibits morphed images. <em>Id. </em>at 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">Writing for the majority in <em>Ashcroft, </em>Justice Kennedy explained: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number><em>Id. </em>I believe that this is precisely the case left undecided by <em>Ashcroft. </em>Moreover, in my view, much of <em>Ashcroft </em>and <em>Ferber </em>is <em>dicta, </em>and, as such, does not compel any particular result in this case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>Section 2256(8)(C) [of the CPPA] prohibits a more common and lower tech means of creating virtual images, known as computer morphing. Rather than creating original images, pornographers can alter innocent pictures of real children so that the children appear to be engaged in sexual activity. Although morphed images may fall within the definition of virtual child pornography, they implicate the interests of real children and are in that sense closer to the images in <em>[New York v. Ferber, </em>458 U.S. 747 (1982)]. Respondents do not challenge this provision, and we do not consider it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Although I believe that the majority correctly analyzes the <em>Ferber </em>factors, I would simply draw the opposite conclusion. For instance, the <em>Ferber </em>Court recognized that States have a compelling interest \u201cin safeguarding the physical and psychological well-being of a minor.\u201d <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S at 756-57 (quotation omitted). I believe that this interest is implicated when pictures of identifiable real children are altered to make it appear as though the children are engaging in sexual activity. The <em>Ferber </em>Court noted the legislative and professional opinion that \u201cthe use of children as <em>subjects </em>of pornographic materials is harmful to the physiological, emotional, and mental health of the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 758 (emphasis added). I believe that a child need not actually engage in the sexual activity depicted in morphed child pornography to be a victim of sexual exploitation. <em>See United States v. Bach, </em>400 F.3d 622, 632 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 901 (2005) (concluding that image depicting the head of \u201cAC, an identifiable minor child\u201d on the nude body of an unidentified boy in a sexually explicit pose, \u201ccreated an identifiable child victim <em>[ie., </em>AC] of sexual exploitation\u201d). I also believe that the State has a compelling interest in protecting children from such exploitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The <em>Ferber </em>Court noted that \u201c[t]he distribution of photographs and films depicting sexual activity by juveniles is intrinsically related to the sexual abuse of children in at least two ways:\u201d (1) \u201cthe materials produced are a permanent record of the children\u2019s participation and the harm to the child is exacerbated by their circulation;\u201d and (2) \u201cthe distribution network for child pornography must be closed if the production of material which requires the sexual exploitation of children is to be effectively controlled.\u201d <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. at 759. I acknowledge that the morphed images here do not implicate these concerns as directly as the images at issue in Ferber\u2014 images that the <em>Ashcroft </em>Court described as \u201cspeech that itself is the record of sexual abuse,\u201d <em>Ashcroft, </em>535 U.S. at 250. Because they can be produced from \u201cinnocent pictures of real children,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 242, morphed images do not require the sexual abuse of a child for their production. Nevertheless, such images do produce a permanent record of the children\u2019s apparent participation in sexual activity. <em>Cf. Ferber, </em>458 U.S. at 759. As discussed above, I believe that such images sexually exploit the real child whose image is used and I find the conclusion inescapable that \u201cthe harm to the child is exacerbated by their circulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Additionally, if one accepts the premise that morphed pornographic images of real children exploit those children, it logically follows that the production of such morphed images \u201crequires the sexual exploitation of [those] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>children,\u201d <em>id. </em>Thus, I believe that morphed pornographic images of actual children sufficiently implicate the second <em>Ferber </em>rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Another factor in the <em>Ferber </em>Court\u2019s reasoning was that \u201c[t]he value of permitting live performances and photographic reproductions of children engaged in lewd sexual conduct is exceedingly modest, if not <em>de </em>minimis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 762.1 believe that the value of permitting the exploitation of children by using their images to create virtual depictions of them engaged in sexual activity is <em>de minimis </em>at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Admittedly, not all of the <em>Ferber </em>factors obtain here; in my view, however, the absence of one or more of the <em>Ferber </em>factors is not fatal to this prosecution. The presence of those listed above is sufficient to warrant classifying the images possessed by the defendant as child pornography within the meaning of <em>Ferber. </em>Having reached that conclusion, I would hold that the images in question fall squarely within <em>Osborne v. Ohio, </em>495 U.S. 103 (1990), in which the Supreme Court held that States may constitutionally criminalize the mere possession and viewing of child pornography, <em>id. </em>at 111. In addition, using the above-cited federal opinions for guidance only, <em>see State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 233 (1983), in the absence of controlling state precedent, I would hold that criminalizing the defendant\u2019s mere possession of the images at issue does not violate the State Constitution. Accordingly, I would reject the defendant\u2019s as-applied challenge and reach his facial challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">The defendant argues that this court\u2019s construction of RSA 649-A:3 in <em>State v. Cobb, </em>143 N.H. 638 (1999), renders that statute substantially overbroad under the reasoning of <em>Ashcroft. </em>Although <em>Ashcroft </em>declared two provisions of the CPPA unconstitutional, only the first of those provisions, section 2256(8) (B), is relevant to this case. That section prohibited \u201cany visual depiction, including any photograph, film, video, picture, or computer or computer-generated image or picture, that is, or appears to be, of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\u201d <em>Ashcroft, </em>535 U.S. at 241 (quotations omitted). In concluding that section 2256(8)(B) was unconstitutionally overbroad, the Court declared that \u201c[b]y prohibiting child pornography that does not depict an actual child, the statute goes beyond <em>New York v. Ferber.\u201d Id. </em>at 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">The defendant contends that in <em>Cobb, </em>this court \u201cconstrued [RSA 649-A:3] to extend to visual representations that did not involve any actual child engaging in sexual activity.\u201d The defendant cites the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-9\">There is no statutory requirement that the visual representation involve the use of an actual child. Furthermore, we see little meaningful distinction between sexually explicit material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>produced through the use of an actual child and such material that gives the appearance of having been produced through the use of an actual child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-5\"><em>Cobb, </em>143 N.H. at 644 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">As the trial court similarly concluded, however, the defendant takes the statement out of context. The defendant in <em>Cobb </em>argued that the statute did not apply to his \u201cphotographs because no children were used in sexual performances in order to create them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This court\u2019s response, therefore, was focused upon the \u201cuse\u201d of a child in a sexual performance. Thus, in saying that the statute did not require \u201cthe use of an actual child,\u201d <em>id., </em>the court held that the statute did not require that a child actually engage in the sexual activity depicted. In my view, that statement was not intended to decide whether or not the child depicted must be an actual child, as that question was not before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Because I agree with the State that RSA 649-A:3 can be construed to apply only to images of real children, I would hold that the statute is not unconstitutionally overbroad. RSA 649-A:3, I, provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[a] person is guilty of a felony if such person ... (e) Knowingly buys, procures, possesses, or controls any visual representation of a child engaging in sexual activity.\u201d \u201cChild\u201d is defined to mean \u201cany <em>person </em>under the age of 16 years.\u201d RSA 649-A:2, I (2007) (emphasis added). I conclude that construing the word \u201cperson\u201d in RSA 649-A:2, I, to mean a real person, and the word \u201cchild\u201d in RSA 649-A:3 to mean a real child, is a permissible interpretation of the statute. <em>Cf. Commonwealth v. Simone, </em>No. 03-0986, 2003 WL 22994238, at *15, *14 (Va. Cir. Ct. Nov. 12, 2003) (concluding that plain language of statute \u201cconfines its application to images utilizing actual children\u201d where \u201c[t]he statute specifically requires that the material at issue utilize or have as its subject a \u2018person\u2019\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">When RSA 649-A:2,1, is construed to refer to an actual child, RSA 649-A:3 does not reach the \u201cvirtual\u201d pornography at issue in Ashcroft: images that look like real children but that are in fact wholly computer-generated. <em>See Ashcroft,, </em>535 U.S. at 241. In addition, because \u201c[c]hild\u201d is specifically defined to mean a \u201cperson under the age of 16 years,\u201d RSA 649-A:2, I, RSA 649-A:3 covers only images of actual persons who are, in fact, under sixteen years of age and does not reach images that appear to be of children but that are, in reality, of young-looking adults. <em>Cf. State v. Fingal, </em>666 N.W.2d 420, 424 (Minn. Ct. App. 2003) (\u201c\u2018Minor\u2019 is defined [in the statute] as \u2018any person under the age of 18.\u2019 If the sexual performance depicted does not, in fact, involve a person under the age of 18, possession of the depiction is not prohibited.\u201d). Accordingly, under this construction, RSA 649-A:3 would not suffer the infirmities that rendered section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>2256(8)(B) of the CPPA substantially, and therefore unconstitutionally, overbroad. Other courts have reached similar conclusions. <em>See id. </em>at 425 (concluding that where a statute prohibiting child pornography requires that \u201c[t]he visual depiction must be of an identifiable minor, not a virtual child,\u201d the statute complies with <em>Ashcroft); State v. Tooley, </em>872 N.E.2d 894, 907 (Ohio 2007) (\u201c[M]orphed child pornography that uses images of real children ... is not covered by the <em>Ashcroft </em>definition of protected virtual child pornography.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>128 S. Ct. 912 (2008). I would also hold, using the above-cited federal opinions for guidance only, <em>see Ball, </em>124 N.H. 233 (1983), in the absence of controlling state precedent, that RSA 649-A:3 is not fatally overbroad under the State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The defendant\u2019s final challenge to his conviction alleges insufficiency of the evidence. That challenge is expressly conditioned, however, upon this court having \u201cresolve[d] the constitutional issues by construing RSA 649-A:3 narrowly so that it does not reach [the defendant\u2019s] conduct.\u201d As I would not so construe the statute, I would not reach the defendant\u2019s final argument. Accordingly, I would uphold the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motions and affirm the result below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
