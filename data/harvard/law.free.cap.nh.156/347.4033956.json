We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-14\">The record supports the following. On March 1,2006, the taxpayers filed separate applications for tax abatements with the Town, claiming that the tax assessment, both as to land and buildings, on each of their properties for the tax year 2005 was disproportionately high when compared to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>general level of assessment in the town. Following receipt of the applications, the Town sought to inspect the taxpayers\u2019 homes. To this end, the Town\u2019s tax assessor attempted to contact the taxpayers\u2019 counsel on at least two occasions, including a written request sent on June 22, 2006. The taxpayers never responded to these requests. In mid-August 2006, the Town denied the abatement applications because the taxpayers had neither responded to the requests for inspections nor provided any evidence indicating that their assessments were incorrect. The taxpayers then timely appealed the denials to the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Approximately two months later, the board notified the Town of the appeals and asked for certain information concerning the properties. For each appeal, the Town provided the requested information and further asked the board to deny the appeal for, among other things, \u201clack of local level information.\u201d Specifically, the Town asserted that the taxpayers\u2019 counsel had \u201cnot responded] to numerous requests by the Town for ... inspection^] of the subject properties,]\u201d and attached the June 22, 2006 letter in support of its position. The board treated the Town\u2019s responses as motions to dismiss \u201cpursuant to RSA 74:17.\u201d The taxpayers in turn objected. They denied that the Town contacted them \u201cnumerous times,\u201d but admitted that their counsel had received the June 22, 2006 letter and one telephone call from a Town representative. The taxpayers maintained that, while \u201cthe parties were unable to coordinate a date for the inspection, ... consent to an inspection was never denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">On December 6, 2006, the board ordered the parties to \u201carrange for inspections\u201d of the properties \u201cwithin twenty (20) days\u201d and deferred ruling on the Town\u2019s motions to dismiss. The parties engaged in no further communications until January 2,2007, when the Town\u2019s tax assessor called the taxpayers\u2019 counsel to request inspections of the properties. Receiving no response, the assessor sent a letter that same day asking the taxpayers\u2019 counsel to contact him to schedule the inspections. By letter dated January 9, 2007, the taxpayers\u2019 counsel informed the assessor that he \u201cha[d] asked [his] clients to provide [him] with some dates and [] w[ould] get back to [the assessor] as soon as possible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Meanwhile, on January 8, 2007, the board telephoned the Town for an update on the status of the inspections. The next day, the Town sent a letter to the board advising it of the Town\u2019s January 2, 2007 telephone call and letter to the taxpayers\u2019 counsel. On January 18, 2007, the board dismissed the taxpayers\u2019 appeals because the taxpayers\u2019 counsel \u201cha[d] been unresponsive to the Town and the board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">On January 22, 2007, the taxpayers\u2019 counsel telephoned the Town\u2019s assessor, and, the next day, sent a letter to the assessor confirming this telephone call and informing him that February 1 or 2, 2007, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>convenient dates for the inspections. The letter also states, in pertinent part: \u201cI had previously informed you that the taxpayers would be out of town over the holidays, and that a convenient time for the inspection of their premises would be toward the end of the month.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Also on January 23, 2007, the taxpayers moved for reconsideration of the board\u2019s dismissal of the appeals. The taxpayers asserted two grounds for reconsideration. First, relying primarily upon the information contained in their letter of the same date, the taxpayers argued that they had not been unresponsive to the Town\u2019s request. Second, the taxpayers contended that inspections of their homes were unnecessary because the inspections were irrelevant to determining whether the land was disproportionately assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">On February 6, 2007, before the board ruled upon the motion for reconsideration, the Town inspected the properties. The record contains no evidence indicating that either party notified the board of these inspections. On February 14,2007, the board denied the taxpayers\u2019 motion for reconsideration. First, the board found that the taxpayers and their counsel \u201cwere unresponsive both to its December 6, 2006 letter to arrange inspections \u2018within twenty (20) days\u2019 and to the Town\u2019s attempts to schedule the inspections.\u201d Specifically, the board noted that the taxpayers had not responded to the Town until after the board had contacted the Town to determine the status of the appeals, and after the twenty-day deadline. It emphasized that it was \u201conly after the board dismissed the appeals [that the taxpayers\u2019 counsel] contacted] the Town regarding \u2018convenient\u2019 dates for inspection.\u201d Second, the board found that inspections of the properties were relevant because \u201c[a]ny property tax assessment appeal based on disproportionality requires a review of the market value of the property in its entirety (ie., land and buildings) and the Town\u2019s level of assessment.\u201d According to the board, these inspections \u201cfurther assure[] what is being assessed (the entire property) is accurately depicted on the assessment-record card[s].\u201d On March 15, 2007, the taxpayers filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">RSA chapter 541 governs appeals from BTLA decisions. RSA 71-B:12 (2003 &amp; Supp. 2006); <em>Appeal of Town of Wolfeboro, </em>152 N.H. 455, 458 (2005). Under RSA 541:13 (2007), \u201cwe will not set aside the board\u2019s order except for errors of law, unless we are satisfied, by a clear preponderance of the evidence, that it is unjust or unreasonable.\u201d <em>In re Huston, </em>150 N.H. 410, 411 (2003). \u201cFindings of fact made by the BTLA on questions properly before it are deemed <em>prima facie </em>lawful and reasonable.\u201d <em>Wolfeboro, </em>152 N.H. at 458; <em>see </em>RSA 76:16-a, V (2003); RSA 541:13. \u201cThis presumption may be overcome only by a showing that there was no evidence from which the board could conclude as it did.\u201d <em>Huston, </em>150 N.H. at 411. \u201c[W]e will set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>aside an order of the board if we find that it misapprehended or misapplied the law.\u201d <em>Appeal of Reid, </em>143 N.H. 246, 248 (1998); <em>see </em>RSA 76:16-a, V.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">On appeal, the taxpayers assign five errors to the board\u2019s decision. First, they contend that the Town had no authority to seek inspections of the properties, and even if it did, the board\u2019s finding that the taxpayers were \u201cunresponsive\u201d to the Town\u2019s request for inspections is unsupported by the evidence. Second, the taxpayers maintain that the Town was required to obtain administrative inspection warrants under RSA 74:17, I (2003) before denying their abatement requests based upon their alleged unresponsiveness to the Town\u2019s inspection requests. Third, the taxpayers assert that the board improperly dismissed their abatement requests with respect to the land valuation assessments because inspections of their homes were not required for the board to review these aspects of their appeals. Finally, in their fourth and fifth bases for appeal, the taxpayers argue that with respect to the building valuation assessments, the board erred in dismissing their appeals for lack of inspections because they did not contest their buildings\u2019 characterizations, but rather, only the disproportionality of the assessments within those characterizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Before addressing the merits of the taxpayers\u2019 assignments of error, we first take note of procedural deficiencies that infect the taxpayers\u2019 positions in this appeal. <em>Appeal of White Mtns. Educ. Assoc., </em>125 N.H. 771, 774 (1984). \u201cIn an administrative appeal pursuant to RSA chapter 541, the appealing party must first file a motion for rehearing setting forth fully every ground upon which it is claimed that the decision or order complained of is unlawful or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Appeal of Coffey, </em>144 N.H. 531, 533 (1999) (quotation omitted); <em>see </em>RSA 541:4 (2007); <em>Appeal of Hardy, </em>154 N.H. 805, 809 (2007). \u201cAny ground not set forth in the motion for rehearing is not reviewable on appeal, absent good cause shown to specify additional grounds.\u201d <em>Appeal of Barry, </em>141 N.H. 170, 173 (1996) (citation omitted); <em>see </em>RSA 541:4. \u201cThe reason for these requirements is obvious: administrative agencies should have a chance to correct their own alleged mistakes before time is spent appealing from them.\u201d <em>White Mtns., </em>125 N.H. at 774. \u201c[W]hen a record does not demonstrate that the appealing party has met the requirements of [RSA 541:4] we will refuse the appeal or dismiss it on our own motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 775; <em>see Hardy, </em>154 N.H. at 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">In their motion for reconsideration, the taxpayers asserted two reasons why the board should not have dismissed their appeals: (1) the taxpayers had not been unresponsive to the Town\u2019s request for inspections; and (2) the inspections were irrelevant to determining whether the land itself was disproportionately assessed. The taxpayers have reasserted these two bases for reconsideration in their first and third grounds for appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Therefore, the taxpayers\u2019 appeal as to the first and third issues meets the requirements of RSA 541:4.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The taxpayers, however, failed to move for reconsideration with respect to the remaining issues that they have appealed. RSA 541:4 required the taxpayers to \u201cset forth <em>fully every ground </em>upon which [they] claimed that\u201d the board\u2019s order was unlawful or unreasonable. RSA 541:4 (emphasis added). Because the taxpayers failed to comply with the requirements of RSA 541:4 as to three of the five issues raised on appeal, and because they have not shown good cause to justify this failure, we hold that these claims were not properly preserved for purposes of this appeal and, therefore, we will not consider them. <em>Barry, </em>141 N.H. at 173; <em>see also Hardy, </em>154 N.H. at 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">We now turn to the first of the two remaining issues. The taxpayers contend that the board\u2019s finding that they were \u201cunresponsive\u201d to the Town\u2019s request for inspections is unsupported in the record, and, therefore, the board erred in dismissing their appeals. Specifically, the taxpayers assert that they never \u201crefused to grant consent\u201d to enter the properties for inspections, and further emphasize that the Town did inspect the properties on February 6, 2007. As stated above, the board\u2019s findings of fact are deemed <em>prima facie </em>lawful and reasonable, <em>Wolfeboro, </em>152 N.H. at 458, and the burden is upon the taxpayers to show that the board\u2019s decision was clearly unreasonable or unlawful, <em>Porter v. Sanbornton, </em>150 N.H. 363, 371 (2003). \u2018We must affirm the board\u2019s factual findings unless we determine that there [i]s no evidence from which the board could conclude as it did.\u201d <em>Huston, </em>150 N.H. at 414. Here, the record supports the board\u2019s finding that the taxpayers were \u201cunresponsive\u201d to the Town\u2019s request for inspections.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">When it held the Town\u2019s motion to dismiss in abeyance, the board knew that the taxpayers\u2019 counsel had not responded to at least two earlier requests by the Town for inspections. The taxpayers did not dispute this fact. Rather than dismiss the appeals at the outset for lack of inspections, however, the board provided the taxpayers with another opportunity to allow inspections. Again, the taxpayers failed to act. While the board\u2019s December 6, 2006 order required both parties to arrange for inspections, it was the taxpayers that had the burden of showing that the tax assessments were disproportionate. <em>Gail C. Nadeau 1994 Trust v. City of Portsmouth, </em>155 N.H. 810, 812 (2007). Despite this burden of proof, the taxpayers did not contact the Town\u2019s assessor to schedule inspections within the board\u2019s twenty-day deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Furthermore, even after the <em>Town </em>attempted to schedule inspections a week after the twenty-day deadline, the taxpayers\u2019 counsel did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>respond for another week. When he finally did respond, almost five weeks after the board\u2019s December 6, 2006 order, it was simply to state that he would provide the assessor with convenient dates for the inspections \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d Moreover, as the board noted in its order on the taxpayers\u2019 motion for reconsideration, the taxpayers\u2019 counsel did not inform the assessor that February 1 and 2,2007, were convenient dates for inspection until <em>after </em>the board dismissed the case. Finally, even though the inspections had occurred on February 6,2007, approximately one week before the board denied the taxpayers\u2019 motion for reconsideration, the taxpayers never saw fit to inform the board of this fact. In these circumstances, where the taxpayers had numerous opportunities to schedule inspections but failed to do so, we conclude that the board had sufficient evidence from which it could reasonably find that the taxpayers were \u201cunresponsive\u201d to the Town\u2019s requests for inspections. Accordingly, we affirm the board\u2019s finding that the taxpayers were unresponsive.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Given this finding, we next consider whether the board could properly dismiss the appeals on this basis. \u201cThe powers of the board and the rights of taxpayers appearing before the board are entirely statutory and are limited by the terms of the statute.\u201d <em>Appeal of Land Acquisition, L.L.C., </em>145 N.H. 492, 494 (2000) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">ESA 74:17, II (2003) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">Any person who refuses to grant consent to the selectmen or assessing officials to enter property for the purpose[] [of obtaining information necessary to complete an inventory under RSA chapter 74 or appraisal under RSA chapter 75] shall lose the right to appeal any matter pertaining to the property tax for which such person is liable and the right to appeal any exemptions for which such person may be entitled but has not yet received.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Thus, taxpayers must either allow assessors to inspect their properties when the assessors seek to obtain information necessary to complete inventories or appraisals, or lose their right to appeal any matter pertaining to the properties\u2019 taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">The parties do not dispute that the board based its dismissal of the taxpayers\u2019 appeals upon RSA 74:17. The taxpayers argue, however, that RSA 74:17, II did not authorize the Town to seek inspections of their properties because: (1) the Town did not seek information for an inventory under RSA chapter 74; and (2) RSA chapter 75 does not apply because it does not address tax abatement applications. Assuming without deciding that the Town was not seeking information for an inventory under RSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>chapter 74, we disagree that RSA chapter 75 does not apply simply because it does not specifically refer to tax abatement applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Under RSA 74:11 (2003), selectmen are required to assess a tax against a person \u201cin accordance with <em>their appraisal </em>of the property\u201d at issue, \u201cunless they [are] of the opinion that [their appraisal] does not contain a full and true statement of the property for which such person ... is taxable.\u201d (Emphasis added.) RSA chapter 75, \u2022 entitled \u201cAppraisal of Taxable Property,\u201d outlines the specific methods for appraising property. RSA 75:1 (2003). \u201cThe appraisal of property determines its value. The assessment of property <em>based on the appraisal </em>determines the amount of tax for which a particular piece of property (or taxpayer) is required to pay.\u201d 16 P. Loughlin, New Hampshire Practice, Municipal Law and TAXATION \u00a7 22.01, at 253 (1993 &amp; Supp. 2003) (emphasis added). Because a tax assessment is based upon a property\u2019s appraisal, an inaccurate appraisal would affect the property\u2019s assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Here, the taxpayers asserted that their properties\u2019 assessments, which were based in part upon the Town\u2019s prior appraisals of these properties, were disproportionate. The Town obtained the prior appraisals pursuant to RSA chapter 75 and listed the appraisals on the properties\u2019 tax record cards. The Town sought to inspect the taxpayers\u2019 properties to verify, among other things, that these prior appraisals were accurate and complete so that it could then sensibly determine whether the taxpayers had shown good cause to abate the tax assessments of their properties. RSA 76:16, I (Supp. 2006). In confirming the accuracy of these initial appraisals, the Town\u2019s assessor would have effectively reappraised the properties by using the methods and standards for appraisals listed in RSA chapter 75. Accordingly, we conclude that the Town sought to enter the properties for the purpose of obtaining information necessary to complete appraisals under RSA chapter 75, a purpose delineated in RSA 74:17.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The taxpayers also appear to argue that, even if they were \u201cunresponsive\u201d to the Town\u2019s requests for inspections, they \u201cnever refused a request for an inspection\u201d such that they lost their rights to appeal under RSA 74:17. The taxpayers are correct that, pursuant to RSA 74:17, they would not have lost their rights to appeal the Town\u2019s abatement denials unless they \u201crefuse[d] to grant consent\u201d to the assessors to enter their properties. Here, the board dismissed the appeals under RSA 74:17 because the taxpayers were \u201cunresponsive\u201d to the Town\u2019s requests for inspections. In effect, the board concluded that the taxpayers\u2019 \u201cunresponsiveness\u201d was tantamount to a \u201crefus[al] to grant consent\u201d to the assessors for the inspections. We find no error in this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>In matters of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiters of the legislative intent as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. <em>Petition of State of N.H. (State v. Johanson), </em>156 N.H. 148, 151 (2007). When examining the language of the statute, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meaning to the words used. <em>Id. </em>We interpret legislative intent from the statute as written and will not consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to include. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1910 (unabridged ed. 2002) defines \u201crefuse\u201d as, among other things, \u201cto show or express a positive unwillingness to do or comply with (as something asked, demanded, expected).\u201d Here, as explained above, the taxpayers had numerous opportunities to permit the Town\u2019s assessor to inspect their properties. Rather than affirmatively acting to grant or deny the assessor permission to enter their properties, the taxpayers simply failed to respond to the Town\u2019s multiple requests for inspections. In so doing, the taxpayers expressed an unwillingness to comply with the Town\u2019s request for inspections, and thus \u201crefuse[d] to grant consent\u201d to the assessors to enter their properties. Accordingly, we conclude that the board properly found that the taxpayers lost their right to appeal when they failed to respond to the Town\u2019s requests for inspections.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Finally, the taxpayers argue that the board erred in requiring inspections of their <em>homes </em>before examining their challenges to the land assessments. According to the taxpayers, such inspections were irrelevant to the board\u2019s ability to evaluate the land assessments, and, therefore, the board could have addressed the land assessments independently. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">In their abatement applications, the taxpayers asserted that the assessments of their properties, \u201cboth as to the land and buildings,\u201d were disproportionately high when compared to the general level of assessment in the Town and other similarly situated property. \u201c[T]o carry the burden of proving disproportionality, a taxpayer must establish that the taxpayer\u2019s property is assessed at a higher percentage <em>of fair market value </em>than the percentage at which property is generally assessed in the town.\u201d <em>Verizon New England v. City of Rochester, </em>151 N.H. 263, 272 (2004) (emphasis added); <em>see Nadeau 199) Trust, </em>155 N.H. at 812. The question to be determined is whether the taxpayers are unlawfully or unjustly taxed as between them and other taxpayers. <em>Nadeau 1994 Trust, </em>155 N.H. at 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">In asserting that the land assessments should have been separately addressed, the taxpayers are treating their land as distinct taxable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>properties from their buildings. Assuming this distinction is both plausible and relevant, the taxpayers \u201chad the burden of proving that [their] taxable properties] w[ere] <em>in the aggregate </em>overvalued and the <em>total </em>assessments] excessive.\u201d <em>Crown Paper Co. v. City of Berlin, </em>142 N.H. 563, 569 (1997) (emphases added); <em>see Appeal of Sunapee, </em>126 N.H. 214, 217 (1985); <em>Amoskeag Mfg. Co. v. Manchester, </em>70 N.H. 200, 205 (1899). \u201cIf the assessed value of one property is high, but the average assessment on all properties owned by the taxpayer is proper, the taxpayer will not be entitled to an abatement since justice does not require the correction of errors of valuation whose joint effect is not injurious to the appellant.\u201d Loughlin, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 27.07, at 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Thus, even if the board could have addressed the land assessments separately, it would still have needed to examine those assessments in conjunction with the buildings\u2019 assessments to determine whether the taxpayers were being disproportionately taxed. While the taxpayers attempt to split the assessments into land and buildings, the board correctly found that \u201c[a]ny property tax assessment appeal based on disproportionality requires a review of the market value of the property in its entirety <em>(i.e., </em>land and buildings) and the Town\u2019s level of assessment.\u201d Because the taxpayers do not raise the broader question of whether inspections were necessary for the board to evaluate the abatement applications, we do not address it. Accordingly, we conclude that the board lawfully dismissed the appeals under RSA 74:17.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b380-7\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Galway and Hicks, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
