We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The following facts appear in the record. In April 2004, Kelly purchased a home in Epping, which she intended to renovate and use as her primary residence. She moved into the home in October 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">In the spring of 2005, Kelly hired Alfred Case, proprietor of Al\u2019s Painting and Custom Homes, LLC (Al\u2019s Painting), to paint new windows she had purchased. Kelly asked Case to recommend someone to replace her roof and Case referred her to David Bisson. Kelly hired Bisson, who began work on the roof, but stopped before the job was complete. Kelly contacted Case, who told her that Bisson was now incarcerated. Case referred Kelly to a second roofer, Tom Beesley, who agreed to complete the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">On June 14, 2005, Beesley arrived at Kelly\u2019s home to begin work on the roof. Beesley brought Harry Durgin to assist him. Beesley did not have workers\u2019 compensation coverage for Durgin. Shortly thereafter, Durgin fell and was seriously injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">In November 2005, Durgin filed a notice of accidental injury naming Beesley as his employer. In December, Beesley responded with an employer\u2019s report of injury. In January 2006, Durgin requested a hearing with the New Hampshire Department of Labor (DOL). Following the hearing, the DOL Hearing Officer determined that Al\u2019s Painting was acting as the contractor at Kelly\u2019s home, that Beesley was an employee of Al\u2019s Painting, and that Beesley had hired Durgin at Case\u2019s instruction. The DOL Hearing Officer determined, therefore, that Al\u2019s Painting was responsible for the workers\u2019 compensation benefits of its employee, Durgin. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Company, as the insurer of Al\u2019s Painting, appealed to the CAB.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">After a <em>de novo </em>hearing pursuant to USA 281-A:42-a (Supp. 2007), the CAB ruled that Kelly, rather than Al\u2019s Painting, was acting as the \u201ccontractor.\u201d The CAB further determined that Beesley was a subcontractor of Kelly, and Durgin was Beesley\u2019s employee. Therefore, the CAB concluded that pursuant to RSA 281-A:18 (1999), Kelly was responsible for the workers\u2019 compensation benefits of Beesley\u2019s uninsured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>employee, Durgin. Finally, the CAB ruled that as Kelly\u2019s homeowner\u2019s insurance carrier, Harleysville was responsible for paying the workers\u2019 compensation benefits owed by her. Durgin and Harleysville both moved for rehearing or reconsideration, which the CAB denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">On appeal, Harleysville contends that the CAB erred in ruling: (1) that Kelly was liable as a \u201ccontractor\u201d under RSA 281-A:18; (2) that Harleysville is responsible to pay Durgin\u2019s benefits; and (3) that Al\u2019s Painting was not acting as the general contractor. Al\u2019s Painting agrees that the CAB erred in its interpretation of the statutes and in finding Kelly to be the contractor responsible for Durgin\u2019s benefits, but argues that its determination that Al\u2019s Painting was not the contractor should be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">In matters of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiter of the legislature\u2019s intent as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. <em>Appeal of Town of </em>Bethlehem, 154 N.H. 314, 319 (2006). When examining the language of a statute, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meaning to the words used. <em>Id. </em>We interpret legislative intent from the statute as written and will not consider what the legislature might have said or add words that the legislature did not include. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">RSA281-A-.18 states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">A contractor who subcontracts all or any part of a contract shall bear the liability of the subcontractor of that contract for the payment of compensation under this chapter to the employees of the subcontractor, unless the subcontractor has secured the payment of compensation as provided for in this chapter____For the purposes of this section, a contractor shall be defined as provided in RSA 281-A:2, III____For the purposes of this section, a subcontractor shall be defined as provided in RSA 281-A:2, IV and shall include a subcontractor of a contractor as defined in this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">To impose liability on a contractor under RSA 281-A:18 for the uninsured employees of a subcontractor, there must be a \u201ccontractor who subcontracts all or any part of a contract.\u201d RSA 281-A:18. Thus, there must be at least two contracts. There must be an initial contract between the entity desiring the work be done and the entity who will perform the work, and a second contract that \u201csubcontracts all or any part of\u2019 the initial contract. Here, however, there is but one contract \u2014 the one between Kelly and Beesley. There was no initial contract that Kelly then \u201csubcontracted\u201d in whole or in part to a subcontractor. Therefore, there is no contractor to subcontractor relationship as contemplated by RSA 281-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>A: 18, and no liability for Durgin\u2019s injuries may be transferred to Kelly. We conclude that the CAB\u2019s conclusion to the contrary was legal error.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Harleysville next contends that the CAB\u2019s determination that it was responsible to pay Durgin\u2019s benefits was contrary to RSA 281-A:6 (1999). That determination, however, was contingent upon the CAB\u2019s ruling that Kelly was liable for those benefits. Because we have held that Kelly is not liable to pay Durgin\u2019s benefits, neither is Harleysville. Therefore, we need not address RSA 281-A:6.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Finally, Harleysville contends that the CAB\u2019s determination that Al\u2019s Painting was not the general contractor was contrary to the weight of the evidence. When reviewing the CAB\u2019s decision, we will not disturb it absent an error of law, or unless, by a clear preponderance of the evidence, we find it to be unjust or unreasonable. <em>Appeal of N.H. Youth Dev. Ctr., </em>152 N.H. 86, 87 (2005). We consider the CAB\u2019s findings of fact to be <em>prima facie </em>lawful and reasonable. <em>Appeal of CNA Ins. Co., </em>148 N.H. 317, 319 (2002). Our task is not to determine whether we would have found differently than did the CAB, or to reweigh the evidence, but rather to determine whether the findings are supported by competent evidence in the record. <em>Appeal of Gamas, </em>138 N.H. 487,490 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">During the hearing before the CAB, Case testified that about ninety percent of his business is painting and the remainder is light carpentry work or similar small jobs. He testified that he had been hired to paint windows for Kelly and nothing further. He also testified that while he had recommended Bisson and Beesley, he did not offer any quotes for their work, and did not arrange for Kelly to hire them. The CAB chose to credit Case\u2019s testimony, as well as similar testimony from his employee, David Garey, and not to credit Kelly\u2019s testimony that Case had a more substantial role in arranging the renovations and that he had otherwise acted as a contractor. We conclude based upon this testimony that there was competent evidence to support the CAB\u2019s finding that Al\u2019s Painting was not the contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; reversed, in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b559-9\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Duggan and Hicks, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
