Witness then declined having any thing to do with the place.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-12\">The defendant Hays, introduced by plaintiff, \u201c said he was placed in possession by William Porter, of the land in cultivation. Witness rented the land of William Porter about the 1st of February, 1859. \u201e That at that time one Wilkins was in possession of the tenements.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-13\">On cross-examination, Hays said \u201che only had possession of the land that was cultivated, and never did have possession of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>houses.

That as such administrator he had consented for Wilkins to occupy the tenements, and had rented the cultivated lands to defendants, and had put them in the peaceable possession of the same. That the family of Benjamin Porter was scattered shortly after his death. That plaintiff had not been residing on the premises since 1857. That witness had rented the land as administrator, and as guardian of B. F. Porter\u2019s minor children.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-6\">Wilkins testified that \u201che is now, and has been in the possession of the tenements of the late Benjamin Porter for about five months before March 10th, 1859.

Witness, so far as Mrs. Porter is concerned, was her tenant at will, paying her no rent.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-7\">The judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-8\">\u201cIf the jury are satisfied from the testimony that the plaintiff is the widow of Benjamin F. Porter, and the lands and the tenements in controversy was the homestead of the said Benjamin at the time of his death, then she had the possessory right to the premises, inasmuch as the entire control and management of it devolved upon her, and they will accordingly find for the plaintiff. But if the jury believe from the testimony that the plaintiff had Wilkins or any-other person by her consent in possession of the premises at the time of the institution of this suit, then they will find for the defendants. , It is not necessary that any force should have been used in entering the premises or holding them; if, from the testimony, the jury find that the plaintiff had the right to enter the premises at the time defendants entered, you will find.for the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b105-9\">Verdict for plaintiff.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Axc\">It is a fatal objection to the plaintiff\u2019s action that she does not appear to have been in possession of the premises, nor does it appear that the homestead had been set apart to her by the court. It seems that her tenant was in possession. If his possession was invaded it was for him, and not the plaintiff, to bi\u2019ing the suit. The verdict was contrary to the evidence, and a new trial should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
