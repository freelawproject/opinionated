Tried below before the Hon. George W. Smith.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-10\">Suit by the appellees against the appellants, instituted January 16th, 1857, for the recovery of a negro boy named Bill, and his hires.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-11\">The main facts of this case are identical with those of the case of Lafferty\u2019s Executor v. E. A. Y. Murray and others, ante. 872, The hoy sued for in this case was one of the sons of the woman received by Martha Lafferty under the will of her father, and was-sold by Lafferty and his wife to J. 0. Ragsdale, in October, 1846r and by Ragsdale, in 1849, to A. L. Yail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ak6I\">A. L. Yail being dead, this suit Was brought against the defendants as guardians of his minor son, and against his married daughter and her husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-14\">The pleadings were the same in substance as in the case above referred to. In this case, also, the plaintiffs had verdict and judgment for the boy, or his value, and for his hires since the death of Mrs. Lafferty. A new trial being refused to the defendants, they appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number><em>Tote &amp; Shropshire, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHm\">The facts in this case are similar to those in that of Lafferty's Executor against Murray and others. The only point of material difference is, that in this case Ragsdale, the purchaser from Lafferty and wife, sold to Vail, <em>a </em>stranger, as heirs of whom the appellants claim, whilst, in the ease referred to, Ragsdale sold back to W. D. Lafferty, appellant\u2019s intestate, who was the husband of Mrs. Lafferty, the daughter of Bowdry.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7T\">Should the court decide that Lafferty is not entitled to protection under the statute of frauds, by reason of his being the husband of the owner of the life estate, then we ask the favorable consideration of the court for Vail\u2019s heirs, the appellants in this ease, whose ancestor purchased the slave in controversy in 1849, after three years possession of Ragsdale, the purchaser from Mrs. Lafferty.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b396-7\"><em>W. </em>G. <em>Webb, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b396-8\">Moore, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Adl\">The judgment of the court below is affirmed, upon the authority of the opinion delivered in the case of W.
