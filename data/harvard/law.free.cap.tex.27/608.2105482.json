This has not been done in this recognizance, and it must, therefore, be held insufficient to support the judgment against the plaintiff in error. The recognizance cannot be aided by the note of the clerk opposite to the title of the case. This forms no part of the recognizance in which the plaintiff in error hound himself, and if it could he regarded as sufficient to satisfy the requirement of the law to which we have just referred, provided it had been a part of the recognizance, it cannot he so considered in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Let the judgment be reversed and the recognizance quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
