That decision, however, was rendered without the benefit of <em>State ex rel. Pass v. C.S.T. Extraction Co. </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 373, 658 N.E.2d 1055; <em>State ex rel. DeZarn v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 461, 659 N.E.2d 1259; and <em>State ex rel. Bryant v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 458, 659 N.E.2d 1256. Upon review, we find that those decisions dictate reversal of the judgment rendered below.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\"><em>Gay </em>relief cannot be considered without a preliminary determination that the requirements in <em>State ex rel. Noll v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 203, 567 N.E.2d 245, have not been met. <em>State ex rel. Sebestyen v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 36, 641 N.E.2d 197. The appellate court, however, never made this determination. Its decision to issue a writ of mandamus pursuant to <em>Gay </em>was, therefore, premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">Our analysis of the commission\u2019s order reveals <em>Noll </em>compliance. In so holding, we recognize the significant impediment that claimant\u2019s age presents to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>reemployment. Workers\u2019 compensation benefits, however, were never intended to compensate claimants for simply growing old.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">Age must instead be considered on a case-by-case basis. To effectively do so, the commission must deem any presumptions about age rebuttable. Equally important, age must never be viewed in isolation. A college degree, for example, can do much to ameliorate the effects of advanced age.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\"><em>Pass, DeZam </em>and <em>Bryant </em>support these propositions. Collectively, these cases establish that there is not an age \u2014 ever\u2014at which reemployment is held to be a virtual impossibility as a matter of law. Certainly, it would be remiss to ignore the limitations that age can place on efforts to secure other employment. However, limitation should never automatically translate into prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Each claimant is different, with different levels of motivation, initiative and resourcefulness. The claimant in <em>Bryant </em>is an excellent example of a claimant who was motivated to work well beyond retirement age and was resourceful enough to find a job that valued the experience that his advanced age brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">This underscores the commission\u2019s responsibility to affirmatively address the age factor. It is not enough for the commission to just acknowledge claimant\u2019s age. It must discuss age in conjunction with the other aspects of the claimant\u2019s individual profile that may lessen or magnify age\u2019s effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">In this case, the commission recognized the impediments that claimant\u2019s age imposed on her ability to obtain other work. The commission, however, did not find these limitations to be a complete bar to reemployment. Given claimant\u2019s relatively low level of impairment, the commission reasoned that, with the claimant\u2019s ability to read, write, and do math, sedentary work was not absolutely precluded. This conclusion was within the commission\u2019s prerogative as the exclusive evaluator of disability, and we will not substitute our judgment for that of the commission. <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936; <em>State ex rel. Stephenson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 167, 31 OBR 369, 509 N.E.2d 946.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b575-11\">Moyer, C.J., F.E.
