In particular, the issue certified to this court by the Court of Appeals for Montgomery County is, \u201c[m]ay a court grant summary judgment when <em>neither </em>the movant nor the non-movant provides evidentiary materials demonstrating that there are no material facts in dispute and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law?\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) </em>Resolution of this issue requires an interpretation of Civ.R. 56, a detailed review of <em>Celotex, supra, </em>477 U.S. 317, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265, and an examination of our holding in paragraph three of the syllabus in <em>Wing, supra, </em>59 Ohio St.3d 108, 570 N.E.2d 1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">In <em>Celotex, supra, </em>477 U.S. 317, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265, Myrtle Catrett (\u201cCatrett\u201d), administrator of the estate of her deceased husband, Louis H. Catrett, filed a wrongful death action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against fifteen named corporations. In the complaint, Catrett alleged that her husband\u2019s death had been caused by exposure to products containing asbestos that had been manufactured or distributed by the defendants. Several of the defendants, including the Celotex Corporation (\u201cCelo-tex\u201d), filed motions for summary judgment. In support of its motion, Celotex argued that summary judgment was proper because Catrett had \u201c \u2018failed to produce evidence that any [Celotex] product * * * was the proximate cause of the injuries alleged within the jurisdictional limits of [the District] Court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 319-320, 106 S.Ct. at 2551, 91 L.Ed.2d at 272. In particular, Celotex noted that Catrett had failed to identify, in answering interrogatories specifically requesting such information, any witnesses who could testify about the decedent\u2019s exposure to Celotex\u2019s asbestos products. Catrett responded to the motion for summary judgment and produced three documents to counter Celotex\u2019s assertions. The three documents included a transcript of a deposition, a letter from an official of one of the decedent\u2019s former employers whom Catrett planned to call as a witness at trial, and a letter from an insurance company to Catrett\u2019s attorney. These documents tended to establish that the decedent had been exposed to Celotex\u2019s asbestos products in Chicago in 1970 and 1971. Catrett claimed that the three documents demonstrated that there was a genuine and material factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>dispute concerning the decedent\u2019s exposure to Celotex\u2019s asbestos products. With respect to this evidence, Celotex asserted that the three documents were inadmissible hearsay and thus could not be considered in opposition to Celotex\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The district court in <em>Celotex </em>granted the motion for summary judgment, finding that there was <em>\u201c\u2018no </em>showing that the plaintiff was exposed to the defendant Celotex\u2019s product in the District of Columbia or elsewhere within the statutory period.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id, </em>477 U.S. at 320,106 S.Ct. at 2551, 91 L.Ed.2d at 272. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, in a split decision, reversed the judgment of the district court. <em>Catrett v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp. </em>(C.A.D.C.1985), 756 F.2d 181. The court of appeals\u2019 majority stated, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">\u201cWe need not, however, reach the evidentiary issue [raised by Celotex that none of the evidence produced by Catrett in response to the motion for summary judgment would have been admissible at trial], inasmuch as defendant\u2019s [Celo-tex\u2019s] moving papers were patently defective on their face, rendering inappropriate the grant of summary judgment on the record as it stood before the District Court. Celotex offered <em>no </em>affidavits, declarations or evidence of any sort whatever in support of its summary judgment motion. To the contrary, Celotex\u2019s motion was based solely on the plaintiffs purported failure to produce credible evidence to support her claim. While Celotex may have faced difficulty, to be sure, in \u2018proving the negative\u2019 that plaintiffs decedent had not been exposed to its products, * * * [Celotex] made no effort to adduce <em>any </em>evidence, in the form of affidavits or otherwise, to support its motion. * * * [T]hat undisputed failure renders its motion fatally defective.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic </em>and footnotes omitted.) <em>Catrett, supra, </em>756 F.2d at 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">In <em>Celotex, supra, </em>477 U.S. 317, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265, the United States Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals. Justice (now Chief Justice) Rehnquist authored the lead opinion in <em>Celotex, </em>which mustered the full support of Justices Marshall, Powell and O\u2019Connor. Justice White concurred separately. <em>Id </em>at 328-329, 106 S.Ct. at 2555, 91 L.Ed.2d at 277 (White, J., concurring). Justice Brennan, joined by then Chief Justice Burger and Justice Blackmun, dissented. <em>Id </em>at 329-337, 106 S.Ct. at 2555-2560, 91 L.Ed.2d at 277-282 (Brennan, J., dissenting). Justice Stevens also filed a separate dissenting opinion. <em>Id </em>at 337-339, 106 S.Ct. at 2560-2561, 91 L.Ed.2d at 283-284 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Virtually all of the Justices agreed that the court of appeals had erred in concluding that Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 requires a defendant seeking summary judgment to produce affirmative evidence disproving (\u201cnegating\u201d) the plaintiffs case. We quote, at length, from the lead opinion in <em>Celotex, </em>because, with all due respect to the United States Supreme Court, its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>opinion in <em>Celotex </em>is somewhat confusing as to the appropriate standard for granting summary judgment in cases where the moving party asserts that the nonmoving party has no evidence to establish a material element of the nonmov-ing party\u2019s case. In the lead opinion in <em>Celotex, </em>Justice Rehnquist offered the following analysis of Fed.R.Civ.P. 56<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>:</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">\u201cThe majority of the Court of Appeals held that petitioner\u2019s [Celotex\u2019s] summary judgment motion was rendered \u2018fatally defective\u2019 by the fact that petitioner \u2018made no effort to adduce <em>any </em>evidence, in the form of affidavits or otherwise, to support its motion.\u2019 * * * <em>[Catrett, supra, </em>756 F.2d at 184] (emphasis in original). According to the majority, Rule 56(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and this Court\u2019s decision in * * * <em>[Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co. </em>(1970), 398 U.S. 144, 159, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1609, 26 L.Ed.2d 142, 155], establish that \u2018the party opposing the motion for summary judgment bears the burden of responding <em>only after </em>the moving party has met its burden of coming forward with proof of the absence of any genuine issues of material fact.\u2019 * * * <em>[Catrett, supra, </em>756 F.2d at 184] (emphasis in original; footnote omitted). The majority therefore declined to consider petitioner\u2019s argument that none of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>evidence produced by respondent [Catrett] in opposition to the motion for summary judgment would have been admissible at trial. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">\u201cWe think that the position taken by the majority of the Court of Appeals is inconsistent with the standard for summary judgment set forth in Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Under Rule 56(c), summary judgment is proper \u2018if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 In our view, the plain language of Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. In such a situation, there can be \u2018no genuine issue as to any material fact,\u2019 since a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party\u2019s case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial. The moving party is \u2018entitled to a judgment as a matter of law\u2019 because the nonmoving party has failed to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of her case with respect to which she has the burden of proof. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\"><em>\u201cOf course, a party seeking summary judgment always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of \u2018the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, </em>\u2019 <em>which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. </em>But unlike the Court of Appeals, we find no express or implied requirement in Rule 56 that the moving party support its motion with affidavits or other similar materials <em>negating </em>the opponent\u2019s claim. On the contrary, Rule 56(c), which refers to \u2018the affidavits, <em>if any </em>\u2019 (emphasis added), suggests the absence of such a requirement. And if there were any doubt about the meaning of Rule 56(c) in this regard, such doubt is clearly removed by Rules 56(a) and (b), which provide that claimants and defendants, respectively, may move for summary judgment <em>\u2018with or without supporting affidavits </em>\u2019 (emphasis added). <em>The import of these subsections is that, regardless of whether the moving party accompanies its summary judgment motion with affidavits, the motion may, and should, be granted so long as whatever is before the district court demonstrates that the standard for the entry of summary judgment, as set forth in Rule 56(c), is satisfied. </em>One of the principal purposes of the summary judgment rule is to isolate and dispose of factually unsupported claims or defenses, and we think it should be interpreted in a way that allows it to accomplish this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\u201cRespondent [Catrett] argues, however, that Rule 56(e), by its terms, places on the nonmoving party the burden of coming forward with rebuttal affidavits, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>other specified kinds of materials, only in response to a motion for summary judgment \u2018made and supported as provided in this rule.\u2019 According to respondent\u2019s argument, since petitioner [Celotex] did not \u2018support\u2019 its motion with affidavits, summary judgment was improper in this case. But as we have already explained, a motion for summary judgment may be made pursuant to Rule 56 \u2018with or without supporting affidavits.\u2019 <em>In cases like the instant one, where the nonmoving party will bear the burden of proof at trial on a dispositive issue, a summary judgment motion may properly be made in reliance solely on the \u2018pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file.\u2019 Such a motion, whether or not accompanied by affidavits, will be \u2018made and supported as provided in this rule,\u2019 and Rule 56(e) therefore requires the nonmoving party to go beyond the pleadings and by her own affidavits, or by the \u2018depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\u2019 designate \u2018specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. \u2019</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">\u201cWe do not mean that the nonmoving party must produce evidence in a form that would be admissible at trial in order to avoid summary judgment. Obviously, Rule 56 does not require the nonmoving party to depose her own witnesses. Rule 56(e) permits a proper summary judgment motion to be opposed by any of the kinds of evidentiary materials listed in Rule 56(c), except the mere pleadings themselves, and it is from this list that one would normally expect the nonmoving party to make the showing to which we have referred.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">\u201cThe Court of Appeals in this case felt itself constrained, however, by language in our decision in <em>Adickes </em>* * * <em>[supra, </em>398 U.S. 144, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142]. There we held that summary judgment had been improperly entered in favor of the defendant restaurant in an action brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In the course of its opinion, the <em>Adickes </em>Court said that \u2018both the commentary on and the background of the 1963 amendment conclusively show that it was not intended to modify the burden of the moving party * * * to show initially the absence of a genuine issue concerning any material fact.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 159 [90 S.Ct. at 1609, 26 L.Ed.2d at 155]. We think that this statement is accurate in a literal sense, since we fully agree with the <em>Adickes </em>Court that the 1963 amendment to Rule 56(e) was not designed to modify the burden of making the showing generally required by Rule 56(c). It also appears to us that, on the basis of the showing before the Court in <em>Adickes, </em>the motion for summary judgment in that case should have been denied. But we do not think the <em>Adickes </em>language quoted above should be construed to mean that the burden is on the party moving for summary judgment to <em>produce evidence </em>showing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, even with respect to an issue on which the nonmoving party bears the burden of proof. Instead, as we have explained, the burden on the moving party may be discharged by \u2018showing\u2019 \u2014 that is, pointing out to the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>court \u2014 that there is' an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">\u00ab <em>* % </em>*</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">\u201cIn this Court, respondent\u2019s [Catrett\u2019s] brief and oral argument have been devoted as much to the proposition that an adequate showing of exposure to petitioner\u2019s asbestos products was made as to the proposition that no such showing should have been required. But the Court of Appeals declined to address either the adequacy of the showing made by respondent in opposition to petitioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment, or the question whether such a showing, if reduced to admissible evidence, would be sufficient to carry respondent\u2019s burden of proof at trial. We think the Court of Appeals with its superior knowledge of local law is better suited than we are to make these determinations in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">\u00ab $ $ \u2021</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">\u201cThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\u201d (Emphasis added in part and footnotes omitted.) <em>Celotex, supra, </em>477 U.S. 317, 321-328, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2551-2555, 91 L.Ed.2d 265, 272-277.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">Justice White, who provided the fifth and deciding vote in <em>Celotex, </em>stated, in a separate concurring opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">\u201cI agree that the Court of Appeals was wrong in holding that the moving defendant must always support his motion with evidence or affidavits showing the absence of a genuine dispute about a material fact. I also agree that the movant may rely on depositions, answers to interrogatories, and the like, to demonstrate that the plaintiff has no evidence to prove his case and hence that there can be no factual dispute. <em>But the movant must discharge the burden the Rules place upon him: It is not enough to move for summary judgment without supporting the motion in any way or with a conclusory assertion that the plaintiff has no evidence to prove his case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">\u201cA plaintiff need not initiate any discovery or reveal his witnesses or evidence unless required to do so under the discovery Rules or by court order. Of course, he must respond if required to do so; but he need not also depose his witnesses or obtain their affidavits to defeat a summary judgment motion asserting only that he has failed to produce any support for his case. It is the defendant\u2019s task to negate, if he can, the claimed basis for the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">\u201cPetitioner Celotex does not dispute that if respondent [Catrett] has named a witness to support her claim, summary judgment should not be granted without Celotex somehow showing that the named witness\u2019 possible testimony raises no genuine issue of material fact. * * * It asserts, however, that respondent has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>failed on request to produce any basis for her case. Respondent, on the other hand, does not contend that she was not obligated to reveal her witnesses and evidence but insists that she has revealed enough to defeat the motion for summary judgment. Because the Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to address this aspect of the case, I agree that the case should be remanded for further proceedings.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Celotex, supra, </em>477 U.S. at 328-329, 106 S.Ct. at 2555, 91 L.Ed.2d at 277 (White, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Again, with the utmost respect to the United States Supreme Court, we find the court\u2019s decision in <em>Celotex </em>to be perplexing. As Justice Brennan so ably recognized in his dissenting opinion in <em>Celotex, </em>\u201c[t]he Court clearly rejects the ruling of the Court of Appeals that the defendant [Celotex] must provide affirmative evidence disproving the plaintiffs case. Beyond this, however, the Court has not clearly explained what is required of a moving party seeking summary judgment on the ground that the nonmoving party cannot prove its case.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Celotex, supra, </em>477 U.S. at 329, 106 S.Ct. at 2556, 91 L.Ed.2d at 277 (Brennan, J., dissenting). Justice Brennan went on to suggest that Celotex had failed to meet its burden of establishing that there were no genuine issues of material fact concerning the essential elements of Catrett\u2019s claims and that, therefore, summary judgment was improper. <em>Id., </em>477 U.S. at 329-337, 106 S.Ct. at 2555-2560, 91 L.Ed.2d at 277-282 (Brennan, J., dissenting). He also questioned what the court of appeals was supposed to do on remand, given that Justice White, who provided the court\u2019s fifth vote in <em>Celotex, </em>\u201cplainly believes that the Court of Appeals should reevaluate whether the defendant met its initial burden of production.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 329, 106 S.Ct. at 2556, 91 L.Ed.2d at 277, fn. I.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Our reading of <em>Celotex </em>and of Civ.R. 56<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is that there is simply no requirement that a party who moves for summary judgment must support the motion with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number><em>affidavits </em>negating the opponent\u2019s claims. Accord <em>Mitseff v. Wheeler </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 112, 114, 526 N.E.2d 798, 800-801. See, also, Civ.R. 56(A) and (B), and <em>Celotex, supra, </em>477 U.S. at 323-324, 106 S.Ct. at 2553, 91 L.Ed.2d at 274. Indeed, there is no requirement in Civ.R. 56 that the moving party support its motion for summary judgment with any <em>affirmative evidence, i.e., </em>affidavits or similar materials <em>produced by the movant. </em>However, even <em>Celotex </em>makes clear that the moving party bears the initial responsibility of informing the trial court of the basis for the motion, and identifying those portions of the record before the trial court which demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of fact on a material element of the nonmoving party\u2019s claim. Accord <em>Mitseff, supra, </em>38 Ohio St.3d at 114-115, 526 N.E.2d at 801. That is, the moving party bears the initial burden of <em>demonstrating </em>that there are no genuine issues of material fact concerning an essential element of the opponent\u2019s case. To accomplish this, the movant must be able to point to evidentiary materials of the type listed in Civ.R. 56(C) that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>court is to consider in rendering summary judgment. The evidentiary materials listed in Civ.R. 56(C) include \u201cthe pleading, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence in the pending case, and written stipulations of fact, if any.\u201d These evidentiary materials must show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. While the movant is not necessarily obligated to place any of these evidentiary materials in the record, the evidence must be in the record or the motion cannot succeed. In this regard, <em>Celotex </em>makes clear, especially in light of Justice White\u2019s concurring opinion in that case, that a moving party does not discharge its initial burden under Civ.R. 56 simply by making a conclusory assertion that the nonmoving party has no evidence to prove its case. The assertion must be backed by some <em>evidence </em>of the type listed in Civ.R. 56(C) which affirmatively shows that the nonmoving party has no evidence to support that party\u2019s claims. If the moving party fails to satisfy its initial burden, the motion for summary judgment must be denied. If the moving party has satisfied its initial burden, the nonmoving party has a reciprocal burden outlined in the last sentence of Civ.R. 56(E), which provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\u201cWhen a motion for summary judgment is made <em>and supported as provided in this rule, </em>an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleadings, but his response, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If he does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against him.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Accordingly, we hold that a party seeking summary judgment, on the ground that the nonmoving party cannot prove its case, bears the initial burden of informing the trial court of the basis for the motion, and identifying those portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact on the essential element(s) of the nonmoving party\u2019s claims. The moving party cannot discharge its initial burden under Civ.R. 56 simply by making a conclusory assertion that the nonmoving party has no evidence to prove its case. Rather, the moving party must be able to specifically point to some <em>evidence </em>of the type listed in Civ.R. 56(C) which affirmatively demonstrates that the nonmov-ing party has no evidence to support the nonmoving party\u2019s claims. If the moving party fails to satisfy its initial burden, the motion for summary judgment must be denied. However, if the moving party has satisfied its initial burden, the nonmoving party then has a reciprocal burden outlined in Civ.R. 56(E) to set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial and, if the nonmovant does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against the nonmoving party.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>The foregoing principles have been firmly established in Ohio jurisprudence for some time. In <em>Mitseff, supra, </em>38 Ohio St.3d 112, 114-115, 526 N.E.2d 798, 800-801, we recognized that:</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u201cWhile <em>Celotex [supra, </em>477 U.S. 317, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265] says that a moving party does not have to support its motion with affidavits negating the opponent\u2019s claims, <em>Celotex </em>also plainly states that \u2018a party seeking summary judgment always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,\u201d which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\u2019 <em>Celotex, supra, </em>at 323 [106 S.Ct. at 2553, 91 L.Ed.2d at 274].</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u201cAccordingly, even <em>Celotex </em>makes clear that a party moving for summary judgment has certain obligations that must be met. These obligations are set forth in <em>Massaro v. Vernitron Corp. </em>(D.Mass.1983), 559 F.Supp. 1068. <em>Massaro </em>held that the party seeking summary judgment \u2018 * * * bears the burden of affirmatively demonstrating that, with respect to every essential issue of each count in the complaint, there is no genuine issue of fact.\u2019 <em>Massaro, supra, </em>at 1073 (citing <em>Mack v.

Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 74, 375 N.E.2d 46, 47, citing <em>Hamlin v.

Reading the requirement of <em>Harless, supra, </em>in conjunction with Civ.R. 56 and 7(B)(1), it can readily be seen that the moving party must state specifically which areas of the opponent\u2019s claim raise no genuine issue of material fact and such assertion may be supported by affidavits or otherwise as allowed by Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">\u201cIt should be noted that placing the above-mentioned requirements on the moving party does not mean the nonmoving party bears no burden. Requiring that the moving party provide specific reasons and evidence gives rise to a-reciprocal burden of specificity for the non-moving party [outlined in Civ.R. 56(E) ].\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>However, in <em>Wing, supra, </em>59 Ohio St.3d 108, 570 N.E.2d 1095, paragraph three of the syllabus, a majority of this court held that, \u201cA motion for summary judgment forces the nonmoving party to produce evidence on any issue for which that party bears the burden of production at trial. <em>(Celotex v. Catrett </em>[1986], 477 U.S. 317 [106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265], approved and followed.)\u201d We now believe that this holding in <em>Wing </em>is too broad. Specifically, paragraph three of the syllabus in <em>Wing </em>fails to account for, among other things, the burden Civ.R. 56 places upon a <em>moving </em>party. We therefore limit paragraph three of the syllabus in <em>Wing </em>to bring it into conformity with <em>Mitseff, supra, </em>38 Ohio St.3d 112, 526 N.E.2d 798, <em>Celotex, supra, 477 </em>U.S. 317, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265, the requirements of Civ.R. 56, and our discussion and holdings <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">In the case at bar, SEMC served appellees -with a request for admissions and for production of documents. Specifically, SEMC sought admissions from appel-lees that they possessed no documents or other evidence to support the negligent credentialing claim. In the event that appellees denied the requests for admissions, SEMC sought production of all documents supporting the denials. Appel-lees <em>denied </em>that they possessed no documents or other evidence to substantiate the negligent credentialing claim, and entered specific objections to the requests for production of documents. SEMC never moved to compel production of the requested documents. Rather, SEMC moved for summary judgment, urging that appellees had no evidence to establish essential elements of the negligence cause of action. To support the motion, SEMC relied on appellees\u2019 responses to the request for admissions and for production of documents as proof that appellees had no evidence to substantiate the negligence claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of SEMC on other (unrelated) grounds. However, on appeal, the court of appeals addressed <em>and rejected </em>SEMC\u2019s arguments that SEMC was entitled to summary judgment on the basis that appellees lacked evidence to prove the negligent credentialing claim. The court of appeals found that summary judgment on this issue was not warranted, since neither SEMC nor appellees had submitted any evidence demonstrating the lack of a genuine issue of material fact concerning the essential elements of the negligence credentialing cause of action. We agree with the court of appeals\u2019 conclusion in this regard.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">We find that appellees\u2019 responses to the request for admissions and for production of documents fail to demonstrate that appellees had no evidence to prove the essential elements of the negligent credentialing cause of action. Indeed, we find that appellees\u2019 responses to the request for admissions and for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>production of documents indicate that appellees were in possession of evidence necessary to prove the negligence claim, but that they were unwilling to divulge the evidence unless presented with a proper discovery request. Therefore, SEMC\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that appellees lacked evidence to prove the essential elements of a negligent credentialing cause of action was supported by nothing more than SEMC\u2019s own conclusory assertions in its memorandum in support of the motion. Since the motion was not properly supported by evidence in the record, appellees had no duty under Civ.R. 56(E) to respond to SEMC\u2019s allegations that they lacked proof on essential elements of the negligent credentialing cause of action. See discussion, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The question certified by the court of appeals in this case is, \u201c[m]ay a court grant summary judgment when <em>neither </em>the movant nor the non-movant provides evidentiary materials demonstrating that there are no material facts in dispute and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law?\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) </em>We answer that question in the negative. As stated in our discussion <em>supra, </em>the moving party bears the initial responsibility of informing the trial court of the basis for the motion, <em>and identifying those portions of the record which demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of fact on a material element of the nonmoving party\u2019s claim. </em>The \u201cportions of the record\u201d to which we refer are those evidentiary materials listed in Civ.R. 56(C), such as the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, etc., that have been filed in the case. Here, SEMC could point to no such evidence clearly demonstrating that appellees lacked proof of the negligence claim. Where, as here, the moving party does not satisfy its initial burden under Civ.R. 56, the motion for summary judgment must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">We also agree, in part, with the ultimate conclusion reached by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth District in <em>Miller, supra, </em>Summit App. No. 16493, unreported, 1994 WL 511043. In <em>Miller, </em>the plaintiff, Dorothy Miller, was a school bus driver who applied for re-certification for the 1990-1991 school year. As part of the certification process, Miller submitted to a medical examination, the results of which revealed that Miller suffered from high blood pressure and heart problems. Miller was denied re-certification. She then submitted to a second medical examination (a medical re-examination) and was found unfit to be a school bus driver. Accordingly, Miller was not re-hired for the 1990-1991 school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Miller sued the Summit County Board of Education, the Manchester Local School District Board of Education, and others, alleging that the defendants had breached Miller\u2019s contract of employment by not re-hiring her. In the complaint, Miller conceded that she had received two separate medical examinations and that both doctors had concluded she did not meet the physical requirements for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>driving a school bus. Miller did not allege that either or both of the physicians who had examined her were not proper medical authorities. Eventually, defendants moved for summary judgment. To support their motion, the defendants apparently directed the trial court\u2019s attention to (1) Miller\u2019s pleadings, and (2) relevant portions of the Ohio Administrative Code that defeated Miller\u2019s claims. The defendants also apparently relied on certain affidavits. The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">In <em>Miller, </em>the court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The <em>Miller </em>court observed that Ohio Adm.Code 3301-83-07 establishes the physical qualifications for school bus drivers and the procedures for ascertaining medical fitness. The court specifically cited Ohio Adm.Code 3301-83-07(F)(4), which provides that the results of a medical re-examination \u201cshall be final.\u201d Judge (now Justice) Cook, writing for the court in <em>Miller, </em>stated, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">\u201cWe find that the trial court acted appropriately in granting Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment. In her complaint, Miller conceded that she received two separate medical examinations and that both doctors concluded that she did not meet the physical requirements for driving a school bus. Miller claims that the two medical examinations she received were substandard. However, she produced no evidence cognizable under Civ.R. 56 showing that she was entitled to a third medical examination and that the results of this examination could be used to contradict the results of the prior examinations. Ohio Adm.Code 3301-83-07(A) states that the physical qualifications must be certified by \u2018a proper medical authority.\u2019 Ohio Adm.Code 3301-83-07(B) further requires each county board of education to appoint \u2018[o]ne or more licensed doctors of medicine or osteopathy\u2019 annually. These sections ensure that prospective bus drivers will be examined by competent medical personnel. Miller does not argue that either of the two doctors who examined her were not proper medical authorities. Accordingly, we find that the trial court was correct in granting Appellees\u2019 [the defendants\u2019] motion for summary judgment as to Miller\u2019s declaratory judgment, concluding that she had no right to submit results from a third medical examination in order to advance her breach of contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">\u201cAlthough Miller contests two issues pertaining to Appellees\u2019 affidavits, these arguments do not warrant reversing summary judgment for Appellees. Even if Appellees\u2019 affidavits were defective or non-existent, a party who moves for summary judgment need not support its motion with affidavits, provided that the party does not bear the burden of proof on the issues contained in the motion. Appellees, therefore, are still entitled to summary judgment because they would not bear the burden of proof at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4-5, 1994 WL 511043, at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">We read <em>Miller </em>as standing for the proposition that summary judgment may be rendered where <em>the pleadings </em>and the arguments of the party seeking summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>judgment clearly establish that the nonmoving party has no legally cognizable cause of action.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, in <em>Miller, </em>the defendants were entitled to summary judgment merely by pointing out to the trial judge the applicable provisions of the Ohio Administrative Code which, when read in conjunction with Miller\u2019s complaint, defeated Miller\u2019s claims. In other words, by pointing out the requirements of Ohio Adm.Code 3301-83-07, and those portions of the plaintiffs pleadings that showed plaintiff was entitled to no relief, the defendants succeeded in demonstrating, <em>by evidence permitted under Civ.R. 56(C) (the pleadings), </em>that defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. However, we take issue with the statement in <em>Miller </em>that \u201c * * * a party who moves for summary judgment need not support its motion with affidavits, <em>provided that </em>the party does not bear the burden of proof on the issues contained in the motion.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Again, we note that there is no <em>requirement </em>in Civ.R. 56 that <em>any </em>party submit affidavits to support a motion for summary judgment. See, <em>e.g., </em>Civ.R. 56(A) and (B). There <em>is </em>a requirement, however, that a moving party, in support of a summary judgment motion, specifically point to something in the record that comports with the evidentiary materials set forth in Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment (but not necessarily the reasoning) of the Court of Appeals for Montgomery County on the matter certified for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b456-6\">Resnick and F.E.

I concur in the judgment of the majority, but share some of the same concerns raised in Justice Cook\u2019s dissent regarding the future use of Civ.R. 56. In most cases, Civ.R. 56 serves the interests of the parties and our system of justice well. This was not one of those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">When a summary judgment motion was first filed in this case, the overriding question in the case was the statute-of-limitations issue. Could Dresher even bring a claim this long after her injuries? While summary judgment was well suited for the resolution of that issue, the remainder of the case was undeveloped. Extensive discovery on the factual issues had not yet begun. In short, the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>was immature but for the statute of limitations question \u2014 the issue of whether Dresher had a meritorious case was not yet in full bloom. I believe that summary judgment was improperly granted on that issue \u2014 the time and circumstances were not right. Also, Dresher\u2019s responses and objections to SEMC\u2019s discovery requests could be viewed as creating a genuine issue as to material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Since this case does not present us with a good example of how Civ.R. 56 works or should work, I respectfully decline to join an opinion which may reshape the way the rule is used in Ohio. I do, however, agree with the lead opinion\u2019s limiting of the third syllabus in <em>Wing v. Anchor Media, Ltd. of Texas </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 108, 570 N.E.2d 1095.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b457-7\">Cook, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A-q\">dissenting. Dr. Burt\u2019s conduct in grossly injuring Judy Dresher is reprehensible and Dresher\u2019s suffering great. Neither event, however, should be the basis for curtailing the usefulness of summary judgment, the most important tool Ohio courts have for disposing of issues without a trial. When properly used, the rule embodies all the laudatory goals of tort reform \u2014 early assessment of the merits of cases, pretrial judgments, and dismissal of frivolous claims. It benefits both plaintiffs and defendants and best serves our system of civil justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">In the present clime of cynicism about the effectiveness of our courts, it is absolutely critical that judges retain the full measure of this procedure to accomplish its purpose \u2014 isolating and disposing of factually unsupported claims or defenses. Today\u2019s plurality decision not only severely limits the utility of summary judgment, but also reaches its decision by employing an analysis that the United States Supreme Court considered and rejected ten years ago in the <em>Celotex </em>case. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 317, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Notwithstanding the sympathy Judy Dresher\u2019s case evokes, she never produced any evidence that could render the hospital liable. I, therefore, respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">The new standard for summary judgment announced by today\u2019s plurality erroneously requires the defendant to produce affirmative <em>evidence </em>that the plaintiff has no evidence to support her claim. This is the precise concept that the United States Supreme Court rejected when it reversed the decision of the circuit court of appeals in <em>Celotex.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\"><em>In </em>the lower court opinion to <em>Celotex, Catrett v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp. </em>(C.A.D.C.1985), 756 F.2d 181, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals leveled the same critique as the plurality herein at the moving party \u2014 that \u201cCelotex proffered nothing. It advanced only the naked allegation that the plaintiff had not come forward in discovery with evidence to support her allegations of decedent\u2019s exposure * * <em>Id. </em>at 185. Because Celotex made \u201cno effort to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>adduce <em>any </em>evidence, in the form of affidavits or otherwise, to support its motion\u201d (emphasis <em>sic), </em>the court of appeals concluded that this \u201cundisputed failure\u201d rendered the motion \u201cfatally defective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 184. According to the appellate court, this \u201cbarebones approach\u201d was insufficient to meet Celotex\u2019s burden. <em>Id. </em>at 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">In his dissent to the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision, Judge Bork argued that \u201c[t]he majority errs in supposing that a party seeking summary judgment must always make an affirmative evidentiary showing, even in cases where there is not a triable, factual dispute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 188. The dissent pointed to the problem that the majority approach required the defendant \u201cto prove a negative \u2014 that the plaintiff can never find evidence * * * [which] means that the plaintiff need never proffer evidence until she faces a motion for a directed verdict at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 187. Instead of requiring the movant to prove \u201cin effect the negative of the plaintiffs case, even though the plaintiff has no evidence on an essential element of her claim[,] * * * [t]he majority should have required the defendant only to persuade the trial judge that there is no triable, factual dispute on causation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">In adopting this view, the United States Supreme Court concluded that there is \u201cno express or implied requirement in Rule 56 that the moving party support its motion with affidavits or other similar materials <em>negating </em>the opponent\u2019s claim.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Celotex </em>at 323, 106 S.Ct. at 2553, 91 L.Ed.2d at 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Altogether contrary to the analysis of the Supreme Court, this court with today\u2019s opinion requires a movant to \u201cspecifically point to some <em>evidence </em>of the type listed in Civ.R. 56(C) which affirmatively demonstrates that the nonmoving party has no evidence to support the nonmoving party\u2019s claims.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) </em>In effect, this burden would require SEMC, as the movant, to affirmatively disprove non-existent facts. As acknowledged by the court of appeals, the record contains no evidence from which a jury could infer that SEMC had known or should have known of Dr. Burt\u2019s surgeries. Yet, in order to entitle SEMC to summary judgment, this court requires SEMC, whose basis for seeking summary judgment is that the plaintiff has no basis for her claim, to affirmatively demonstrate the absence of these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">What would the plurality have SEMC put forth to demonstrate that the hospital did not have notice of Dr. Burt\u2019s mistreatment prior to Dresher\u2019s surgery? The plurality concedes that \u201cthere is simply no requirement that a party who moves for summary judgment must support the motion with <em>affidavits </em>negating the opponent\u2019s claims.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) </em>If an affidavit from an SEMC source is not required, what <em>affirmative\u25a0 evidence </em>could SEMC produce to demonstrate the <em>absence </em>of facts supporting Dresher\u2019s claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">While the plurality may find <em>Celotex </em>perplexing, the <em>Celotex </em>court made clear that the moving party\u2019s burden <em>cannot be enhanced </em>to require proof of a negative in this fashion. 477 U.S. at 325-326, 106 S.Ct. at 2554, 91 L.Ed.2d at 275. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>agree that much of the time, defendants will only be able to establish the absence of a factual dispute by producing positive evidence. So long as plaintiffs have some inferential evidence, the defendants will have the burden of attacking it to prove that there is no factual dispute fit for trial. In a case such as this, where the nonmoving party has produced no evidence, the \u201cbarebones\u201d delimiting of the absence of proof on an essential element suffices. See <em>Catrett, </em>756 F.2d at 190-191 (Bork, J., dissenting). See, also, <em>Celotex </em>at 325, 106 S.Ct. at 2554, 91 L.Ed.2d at 275 (\u201c[T]he burden on the moving party may be discharged by \u2018showing\u2019\u2014 that is, pointing out to the district court \u2014 that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party\u2019s case.\u201d); <em>Cray Communications, Inc. v. Novatel Computer Sys., Inc. </em>(C.A.4, 1994), 33 F.3d 390, 393 (The moving party who does not bear the burden of proof at trial is not required to produce evidence but can simply argue that there is an absence of evidence by which the nonmoving party can prove his case.); <em>Street v. J.C. Bradford &amp; Co. </em>(C.A.6, 1989), 886 F.2d 1472, 1478 (\u201c[T]he movant could challenge the opposing party to \u2018put up or shut up\u2019 on a critical issue.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">There seems little reason why Dresher should not have been required to establish the existence of potential evidence to support her factual allegations, when properly challenged by the motion for summary judgment. Approximately one year after Dresher filed her complaint, SEMC \u201cpointed out\u201d to the trial court the specific basis entitling it to summary judgment \u2014 Dresher had no evidence that SEMC had knowledge of Dr. Burt\u2019s now infamous surgeries prior to December 17,1970, and, thus, no evidence of causation. SEMC was not required to support its motion with evidence, since that would require SEMC to negate Dresher\u2019s claims. To the contrary, SEMC\u2019s arguments were specific enough to provide Dresher a meaningful opportunity to respond and shifted the burden upon the nonmovant to show a genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">On five separate occasions, Dresher had the opportunity to produce some evidence of her claim or at least address SEMC\u2019s argument that she had none. On two occasions, SEMC requested that Dresher produce documents to support her claim. Dresher objected to these requests on the ground that they were \u201coverbroad.\u201d As was done in <em>Celotex, </em>SEMC moved for summary judgment, rather than moving to compel responses to the discovery requests. See <em>Catrett, </em>756 F.2d at 184, fn. 8. Dresher altogether failed to address SEMC\u2019s argument that she had no evidence to support her negligent credentialing claim. If Dresher needed more time for discovery in order to respond to this part of the motion, Civ.R. 56(F) provided her such an option. On appeal, Dresher did not even address SEMC\u2019s argument on this point. In fact, Dresher\u2019s brief to this court is the <em>first </em>time she has addressed this aspect of SEMC\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>The plurality focuses on Dresher\u2019s objections to SEMC\u2019s discovery requests as an indication that she was in possession of some evidence but was unwilling to divulge it. Objections to discovery requests certainly ought not obviate the requirement that a party come forward with evidence in response to a targeted motion for summary judgment. Moreover, the analysis of the plurality encourages objections to discovery, a tactic far too regularly used for evasion and delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The Supreme Court expressly endorsed summary judgment practice in <em>Celotex. </em>The court stated, \u201c[s]ummary judgment procedure is properly regarded not as a disfavored procedural shortcut, but rather * * * designed \u2018to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action.\u2019 * * * Rule 56 must be construed with due regard not only for the rights of persons asserting claims and defenses that are adequately based in fact to have those claims and defenses tried to a jury, but also for the rights of persons opposing such claims and defenses to demonstrate in the manner provided by the Rule, prior to trial, that the claims and defenses have no factual basis.\u201d <em>Celotex, </em>477 U.S. at 327, 106 S.Ct. at 2555, 91 L.Ed.2d at 276. And so it should be in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">I would reverse the court of appeals on the negligent credentialing claim and reinstate the summary judgment granted by the trial court to SEMC.</p>\n<judges id=\"b460-7\">Moyer, C.J., and Wright, J., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
