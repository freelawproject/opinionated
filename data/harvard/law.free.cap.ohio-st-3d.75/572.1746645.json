See <em>Avco Broadcasting Corp. v. Lindley </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 64, 7 O.O.3d 145, 372 N.E.2d 350. In <em>Avco, </em>we held that ratings information provided by Nielsen to a television and radio broadcasting company, Avco, was a nontaxable personal service transaction. Specifically, we found that \u201cthe true object of the transactions herein was \u2018the receipt of the information collected by the employees of * * * [Nielsen].\u2019 The written reports were but inconsequential elements of the transactions; hence, the transactions are not taxable. Cf. <em>Andrew Jergens Co. v. Kosydar </em>(1973), 35 Ohio St.2d 120, [64 O.O.2d 72] 298 N.E.2d 519 (reported with <em>Accountant\u2019s Computer Services v. Kosydar, supra).\u201d Avco, supra, </em>53 Ohio St.2d at 69, 7 O.O.3d at 147, 372 N.E.2d at 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">The commissioner suggests, however, that <em>Avco </em>is no longer viable. The commissioner found that our holding in <em>Avco </em>has been \u201cundermined\u201d by <em>Emery Industries, Inc. v. Limbach </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 134, 539 N.E.2d 608, which, according to the commissioner, supports a finding that the purchase of market ratings information by a television station involves a taxable transaction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">In <em>Emery, </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus, a majority of this court redefined \u201cpersonal service,\u201d holding that \u201ca \u2018personal service\u2019 is any intellectual or manual act involving a recognized skill performed by a person who is specifically engaged by the purchaser to perform the act.\u201d This court modified the prior definition of \u201cpersonal service\u201d set forth in <em>Koch v. Kosydar </em>(1972), 32 Ohio St.2d 74, 61 O.O.2d 329, 290 N.E.2d 847, determining that \u201cit is better to separate the consequentiality test from the definition.\u201d <em>Emery, supra, </em>43 Ohio St.3d at 136, 539 N.E.2d at 611. Specifically, the majority in <em>Emery </em>noted that, \u201cUnder the <em>Koch </em>definition, however, if a personal service is identified, a finding that the true object is tangible personal property seems foreclosed: if an economic service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>rather than the saleable product of the skill is found to exist, by definition the true object is the service, and the property must be inconsequential. Conversely, the definition seems to indicate that if the saleable product is purchased, there is no personal service and no further need to determine the consequentiality of the tangible personal property.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The commissioner contends that this court in <em>Emery </em>intended to \u201cnarrow\u201d the definition of \u201cpersonal service.\u201d The commissioner asserts that the language \u201cby a person who is specifically engaged by the purchaser to perform the act\u201d presumes that a transaction cannot constitute a personal service unless the service is \u201ccustomized\u201d for a specific purchaser. In this regard, the commissioner urges that the media research information supplied by Nielsen to WBNS was not a personal service transaction because Nielsen did not produce the reports specifically for WBNS. The commissioner claims that WBNS simply subscribed to a standard ratings publication issued by Nielsen, and that these exact reports are available to other customers within the viewing area.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">The commissioner\u2019s focus is misplaced. <em>Emery </em>does not require that the service be customized for the purchaser in order to qualify as a personal service transaction. The definition of \u201cpersonal service\u201d in <em>Koch, supra, </em>was modified in <em>Emery </em>simply to eliminate the consequentiality component from the definition. The new definition emphasizes that the customer \u201cselects the provider of a personal service because of his or her recognized skill.\u201d <em>Emery, supra, </em>43 Ohio St.3d at 136, 539 N.E.2d at 611. Thus, a service rendered by a person or entity need not be specifically \u201ccustomized\u201d for a particular customer in order to qualify as a personal service transaction excepted from taxation under R.C. 5739.01(B)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">In this ease, WBNS clearly engaged Nielsen to provide an intellectual and manual act involving a recognized skill. Nielsen expended personal effort to identify a pool of participants and to secure their participation in the ratings process. Nielsen developed the procedure and it employed personal effort in telephoning participants, sending diaries to the participants, collecting the information, and analyzing the polling results. Nielsen also examined the demographic nature of the surveyed households and compiled this information for use in a meaningful analysis. Accordingly, we find that Nielsen did indeed perform a personal service for WBNS.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">Having concluded that Nielsen provided a personal service for WBNS, we must now determine whether the \u201coverriding purpose\u201d of WBNS was to receive the service or the actual tangible personal property, <em>i.e., </em>the written reports. The commissioner claims that the overriding purpose of WBNS was to receive the reports provided by Nielsen, not Nielsen\u2019s services. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">In <em>Emery, </em>paragraph four of the syllabus, we held that:</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>\u201cIn a professional, insurance, or personal service transaction in which the charge for the services is not separated from the charge for the property, if the overriding purpose of the purchaser is to obtain tangible personal property produced by the service, the transfer of the property is a consequential element of the transaction and the entire transaction is taxable. If the purchaser\u2019s overriding purpose is to receive the service, the transfer of the personal property is an inconsequential element of the transaction, and the entire transaction is not taxable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">In applying these principles, the BTA concluded, and we agree, that WBNS\u2019s overriding purpose was to receive the service provided by Nielsen. Clearly, \u201c[i]t was the intellectual and manual personal efforts of employees of Nielsen that was sought by [WBNS], and not the inconsequential tangible personal property which was transferred, for purposes of communication, as an incidental element without a separate charge.\u201d <em>Andrew Jergens Co. v. Kosydar </em>(1973), 35 Ohio St.2d 120, 134, 64 O.O.2d 72, 80, 298 N.E.2d 519, 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">For the reasons set forth herein, we find that the acquisition of ratings reports by WBNS from Nielsen is exempt from taxation pursuant to R.C. 5739.01(B)(5). The decision of the BTA is reasonable and lawful and, therefore, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b734-8\">Moyer, C.J., Painter, Resnick, F.E.

I respectfully dissent because I conclude that WBNS TV contracted for a standardized publication from Nielsen and the transaction is thus not a personal service.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-12\">This court\u2019s definition of personal service in <em>Emery Industries, Inc. v. Limbach </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 134, 539 N.E.2d 608, encompassed two parts. The first part of the definition describes what a service is: \u201cAny intellectual or manual act involving a recognized skill.\u201d The second part of the definition details how the service is to be personal, that is, \u201cperformed by a person who is specifically engaged by the purchaser to perform the act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-13\">The majority\u2019s view of personal service places an emphasis on when a service is engaged. Engaging a service provider prior to the performance of the act involving recognized skill renders the service personal, says the majority. This broad definition of personal service serves the function of including many more mixed transactions under the umbrella of \u201cpersonal service,\u201d thereby requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>application of the \u201ctrue object\u201d test to weed out the tangible personal property-transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">The timing of the engagement ought not to bear on the analysis. Where, as here, the service is a standardized compilation to be sold to subscribers, the service does not meet the <em>Emery </em>definition. Nielsen was not specifically engaged by WBNS to do a survey. Whether or not WBNS contracted with Nielsen, Nielsen was going to use its skill to compile its standardized, objective reports for other industry subscribers. While the efforts of Nielsen are a service, those efforts do not qualify as personal service. <em>Emery </em>requires that personal services be customer specific. Using this narrower construction of \u201cpersonal,\u201d the \u201ctrue object\u201d test is applied only to mixed transactions first determined to be \u201cpersonal services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Even accepting the analysis of the majority that the service is personal, when applying the true object test, I would find the transaction taxable. The evidence in this case demonstrated that the physical reports were just as important to WBNS as the information and could not reasonably be dubbed an inconsequential element of the transaction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
