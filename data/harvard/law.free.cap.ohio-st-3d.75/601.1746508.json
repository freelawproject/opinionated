However, we disagree and affirm the BTA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">In <em>Freshwater v. Belmont Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 140, 568 N.E.2d 1215, we held that a reserve for replacements was a proper item to consider in valuing real property. However, we did not mandate that such a reserve be accounted for in all cases. Here, the BTA, essentially, found that the actual expenses of the property, which Kocinski followed closely, contained a reserve for replacements. Thus, it chose not to deduct further amounts for replacements.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">Kocinski\u2019s testimony supports this conclusion. He testified that Fawn Lake did not set aside a replacements reserve, but capitalized replacement items as it needed them. Since this testimony supports the BTA\u2019s finding of fact, we affirm. <em>Hawthorn Mellody, Inc. v. Lindley </em>(1981), 65 Ohio St.2d 47, 19 O.O.3d 234, 417 N.E.2d 1257, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">As to the capitalization rate, the BTA criticized Kocinski\u2019s rate as unsupported. Again, the evidence, the survey of life insurance companies\u2019 mortgage commitments, supports Canitia\u2019s capitalization rate selection. As to Canitia\u2019s obtaining the rate from an annual survey rather than a quarterly study completed near the tax lien date, the BTA \u201cmay consider pre- and post-tax lien date factors that affect the true value of the taxpayer\u2019s property on the tax lien date.\u201d <em>Youngs</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number><em>town Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Mahoning Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 398, 20 O.O.3d 349, 422 N.E.2d 846, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Finally, as to Fawn Lake\u2019s claim that its evidence better evaluated the property than the BOE\u2019s evidence, we do not find that the BTA abused its discretion in believing the testimony that it did. <em>Wolf v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 205, 11 OBR 523, 465 N.E.2d 50. This weighing of evidence and granting of credibility is exactly the BTA\u2019s statutory job.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the BTA because it is reasonable and lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b761-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnigk, F.E.
