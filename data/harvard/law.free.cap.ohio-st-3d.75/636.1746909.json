In the present case, because there was no written objection filed by the prosecutor with the court prior to the hearing, Hamilton argues that it was error for the trial court to consider the facts elicited and arguments presented by the prosecutor at the hearing. To the contrary, we adjudge that R.C. 2953.32(B) does not require the filing of a written objection as a prerequisite to a prosecutor\u2019s participation in the expungement hearing. Rather, <em>as an alternative to appearing at the expungement hearing, </em>the statute permits a prosecutor to contest an expungement by written objection. Accordingly, we affirm the appellate court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">R.C. 2953.32(B) states in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">\u201cUpon the filing of an application under this section, the court shall set a date for a hearing and shall notify the prosecutor for the case of the hearing on the application. The prosecutor may object to the granting of the application by filing an objection with the court prior to the date set for the hearing. The prosecutor shall specify in the objection the reasons he believes justify a denial of the application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Hamilton\u2019s reading of R.C. 2953.32(B), and the interpretation of that provision advanced by the Fourth District Court of Appeals in <em>Stiff, supra, </em>would limit the prosecutor\u2019s participation at an expungement hearing to those facts and arguments set forth in a written objection, filed prior to the date of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">At the outset of this discussion, we note that R.C. 2953.32 does not contain language expressly forbidding participation by the prosecuting attorney at the expungement hearing in the absence of a filed written objection. Instead, Hamilton suggests that such a result should be implied from that portion of R.C. 2953.32(B) allowing the prosecutor to object to an expungement by filing a written objection, prior to the date of the expungement hearing, and R.C. .2953.32(C)(1)(d), which requires a court to consider the reasons against granting the application specified in the prosecutor\u2019s objection. The primary rationale advanced by Hamilton and the <em>Stiff </em>court to support their interpretation is that the filing of such a written objection is intended to give the applicant notice of the state\u2019s basis for opposing the application and the opportunity to prepare a response thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">Given, however, that the language of the statute fails to prescribe any number of days in advance of the hearing for filing of such objection or to mandate service of the objections on the applicant, Hamilton\u2019s reliance on notice and an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>opportunity to prepare a response lacks support in the statutory structure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> By filing written objections on the eve of a scheduled hearing, a prosecutor has filed \u201cprior to the date set for hearing\u201d and yet afforded the applicant no time to prepare a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Moreover, the procedure outlined for an expungement hearing requires the court to direct a probation official \u201cto make inquiries and written reports\u201d regarding information relevant to its inquiry. R.C. 2953.32(B). The statute imposes no duty on such probation officials or the court to disclose this information prior to the expungement hearing. Permissible use of this information without advance notice to an applicant belies Hamilton\u2019s rationale. A probation official who is charged with the duty of making inquiries related to the hearing has the ability to produce information as damning to the applicant as that which the prosecutor can provide. It logically follows that if the purpose of the \u201cwritten objection\u201d language in R.C. 2953.32(B) is to require a prosecutor to give advanced notice of specific information that could be used to justify an expungement denial, similar requirements would apply to all sources of information possibly adverse to the applicant. In the absence of such requirements, we deduce that advance notice to a defendant is not the purpose of the written objection language of R.C. 2953.32(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">We also conclude that advance notice of a prosecutor\u2019s objection is not constitutionally required. \u201c[D]ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\u201d <em>Morrissey v. Brewer </em>(1972), 408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 2600, 33 L.Ed.2d 484, 494. Neither the United States Constitution nor the Ohio Constitution endows one convicted of a crime with a substantive right to have the record of a conviction expunged. <em>Bird v. Summit Cty. </em>(C.A.6, 1984), 730 F.2d 442, 444. Instead, expungement is an act of grace created by the state. Compare <em>Escoe v. Zerbst </em>(1935), 295 U.S. 490, 55 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>S.Ct. 818, 79 L.Ed. 1566.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, the government possesses a substantial interest in ensuring that expungement is granted only to those who are eligible. Expungement is accomplished by eliminating the general public\u2019s access to conviction information. Accordingly, expungement should be granted only when an applicant meets all the requirements for eligibility set forth in R.C. 2953.32.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">As opposed to the adversary posture of a guilt determination, an expungement hearing provides the court with the opportunity to review matters of record and to make largely subjective determinations regarding whether the applicant is rehabilitated and whether the government\u2019s interest in maintaining the record outweighs the applicant\u2019s interest in having the record sealed. The court is permitted to gather information relevant to these inquiries from the applicant, the prosecutor, and through independent court investigation conducted with the aid of probation officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">It is apparent from a study of R.C. 2953.32 that the essential purpose of an expungement hearing is to provide a reviewing court with all relevant information bearing on an applicant\u2019s eligibility for expungement. Advocacy is subordinated to information gathering. As stated, expungement hearings are not structured on the adversary model. As such, an expungement applicant is not entitled to the same type of notice that is afforded one who is accused of a crime, let alone a greater degree of notice as Hamilton now suggests. Compare <em>Greenholtz v. Inmates of Nebraska Penal &amp; Corr. Complex </em>(1979), 442 U.S. 1, 15-16, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 2108, 60 L.Ed.2d 668, 680-681; <em>State v. Sellards </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 169, 171, 17 OBR 410, 411-412, 478 N.E.2d 781, 784. Accordingly, the process due an applicant for expungement does not include advanced notice of the specific issues and facts underlying a prosecutor\u2019s objection or even notice that the state opposes the sealing of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">We approve, instead, the interpretation advanced by the state and adopted by the court of appeals in this case. Under R.C. 2953.32(B), the prosecutor is permitted to file an objection to the application with the court. If an objection is filed, and specifies reasons allegedly justifying denial of the application, the court is required to consider the prosecutor\u2019s objections regardless of whether the prosecutor appears at the hearing. R.C. 2953.32(C)(1)(d). The purpose of requiring specificity in the written objection filed pursuant to R.C. 2953.32(B), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>therefore, is to provide the court with the state\u2019s rationale for opposing the application and not to limit the introduction of relevant information, which the prosecutor possesses or may come to possess, that is not contained in a written objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">On the basis of the foregoing analysis, we hold that a prosecutor\u2019s participation in a hearing on an application to seal the record of a conviction is not limited to issues specified by the prosecutor in a written objection filed pursuant to R.C. 2953.32(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b799-10\">Douglas, M.L.

Brewer </em>(1972), 408 U.S. 471, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484, it is clear that a probationer can no longer be denied due process with respect to revocation of probation in reliance on the <em>dictum </em>in <em>Escoe </em>that probation is an \u201cact of grace.\u201d However, neither <em>Gagnon </em>nor <em>Morrissey </em>questioned the character of probation as an \u201cact of grace\u201d extended by the state as opposed to a fundamental right existing independently under the Due Process Clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b799-13\">Francis E. Sweeney, Sr., J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ag51\">dissenting. I respectfully dissent. In my opinion, R.C. 2953.32 requires a prosecutor who intends to object to the filing of an application to expunge a criminal record to file such objections with the trial court <em>prior </em>to the hearing date. Since the prosecutor did not comply with this procedure and since the trial court mistakenly relied upon oral objections as the basis for denying appellant\u2019s application, I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand for a new hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-14\">According to R.C. 2953.32(B): \u201cThe prosecutor may object to the granting of the application [for expungement] by filing an objection with the court <em>prior to the date set for the hearing. </em>The prosecutor shall specify in the objection the reasons he believes justify a denial of the application.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b799-15\">The majority construes this statute to mean that a prosecutor can either appear at the expungement hearing to contest the application to seal the criminal record or, in the alternative, can file written objections. Contrary to the majority\u2019s interpretation, I believe the clear language of R.C. 2953.32(B) sets forth a single procedure for objecting to an application to seal a criminal record. The statute plainly states that a prosecutor who objects to the application must do so \u201cprior to the date set for the hearing.\u201d Therefore, the wording of the statute does not support the majority\u2019s holding that a prosecutor may object for the first time at the expungement hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-16\">Consequently, I would follow the decision of <em>State v. Stiff </em>(June 21, 1990), Scioto App. No. 1804, unreported, 1990 WL 84843, which was certified as being in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>conflict with the appellate decision in this case, and which held that the language of R.C. 2953.32(B) is mandatory and requires that objections to an application to seal a criminal record be made before the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand for a new hearing.</p>\n<judges id=\"b800-6\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, J.,-concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
