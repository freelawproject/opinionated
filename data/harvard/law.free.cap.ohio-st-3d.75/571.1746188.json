Simpson claims that the sentencing court lacked jurisdiction over him because the indictment on which he was charged, tried, convicted, and sentenced referred to him as \u201cMark Simpson\u201d when his true name was \u201cMarcus Simpson.\u201d As the court of appeals correctly concluded, Simpson merely challenged the sufficiency of the indictment rather than the jurisdiction of the sentencing court. See R.C. 2941.03(C); Crim.R. 7(B); see, also, <em>Lasure v. State </em>(1869), 19 Ohio St. 43, 50 (An indictment serves as an accusation of a person for a crime rather than an accusation of a particular name.).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-12\">Habeas corpus is not available to challenge either the validity or sufficiency of an indictment. <em>Luna v. Russell </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 561, 562, 639 N.E.2d 1168, 1169. Simpson possessed an adequate remedy by direct appeal to raise his contentions. <em>Luna, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 562, 639 N.E.2d at 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-13\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-14\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b729-15\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
