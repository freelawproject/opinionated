Therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"amp-dedup-1\">IT IS ORDERED by the court, <em>sua sponte, </em>effective March 12, 1996, that the motion for delayed appeal be, and hereby is, stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"AGqU\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED by the court, <em>sua sponte, </em>that, in that appellant failed to perfect an appeal pursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. II(2)(A)(1), this case be, and hereby is, dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
