Jones possessed an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law to obtain the requested transcripts, <em>i.e., </em>his motion in the court of appeals in his pending appeal. See, generally, <em>State ex rel. Howard v. Ferreri </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 587, 592, 639 N.E.2d 1189, 1194-1195.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">Jones\u2019s contention-that his mandamus action took precedence over his subsequently filed motion for transcripts is meritless. See <em>State ex rel. Newton v. Court of Claims </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 553, 557, 653 N.E.2d 366, 370, quoting <em>Oregon v. Dansack </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 1, 4, 623 N.E.2d 20, 22 (\u201c[I]n mandamus actions, \u2018a court is not limited to considering facts and circumstances at the time a proceeding is instituted, but should consider the facts and conditions at the time it determines to issue a peremptory writ.\u2019 \u201d). In addition, the mere fact that the court of appeals subsequently overruled Jones\u2019s motion for transcripts did not render that remedy inadequate. See <em>State ex rel. Nichols v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation &amp; Dev. Disabilities </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 205, 209, 648 N.E.2d 823, 827.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b801-12\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
