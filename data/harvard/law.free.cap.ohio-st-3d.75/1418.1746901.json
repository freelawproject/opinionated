Appellant has filed an untimely appeal of the court of appeals\u2019 decision affirming the denial of his post-conviction petition.

Therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"azl-dedup-2\">IT IS ORDERED by the court, <em>sua sponte, </em>that the motion for delayed appeal be, and hereby is, stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"ArA\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED by the court, <em>sua sponte, </em>that, in that appellant failed to perfect an appeal pursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. II(2)(A)(1), this case be, and hereby is, dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
