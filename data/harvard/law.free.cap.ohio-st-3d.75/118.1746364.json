We reject such a proposition in favor of according to pronouns in a contract applicable to more than one person a uniform meaning consistent with policy definitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">It is well-settled law in Ohio that \u201c[w]here provisions of a contract of insurance are <em>reasonably </em>susceptible of more than one interpretation, they will be construed strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>King v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 208, 519 N.E.2d 1380, syllabus; see, also, <em>Buckeye Union Ins. Co. v. Price </em>(1974), 39 Ohio St.2d 95, 68 O.O.2d 56, 313 N.E.2d 844. It is axiomatic that this rule cannot be employed to create ambiguity where there is none. It is only when a provision in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>a policy is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation that an ambiguity exists in which the provision must be resolved in favor of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">In the present case, both State Auto and the Hackers acknowledge that Judith Dickman was a \u201ccovered person\u201d under Gary\u2019s automobile insurance policy and that the Chevrolet truck was not a \u201ccovered auto.\u201d State Auto, therefore, maintains that Judith\u2019s use of the 1973 truck was unambiguously excluded from coverage by the clause in its contract with Gary, denying coverage for the use of a vehicle unlisted in the declaration section of the policy as a \u201ccovered auto\u201d which is \u201cowned by you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The pronouns \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d are defined in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\u201cThroughout this policy, \u2018you\u2019 and \u2018your\u2019 <em>refer </em>to:</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">\u201c1. The \u2018named insured\u2019 shown in the Declarations; and</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">\u201c2. The spouse if a resident of the same household.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">In urging this court to find the (B)(2) exclusion ambiguous, the Hackers argue that the words \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d should be given their ordinary and commonly understood meaning and that each covered person under the policy has a right to read the contract and assume that the word \u201cyou\u201d applies in a particularized way to that person. Thus, the Hackers argue that when Judith read this exclusion, she would have reasonably concluded that the phrase \u201cowned by you\u201d did not exclude her from coverage because Gary and the neighbor owned the truck, and she did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">The Hackers\u2019 argument, however, would obviate the policy\u2019s definition of \u201cyou.\u201d The policy definition requires that \u201cyou\u201d <em>references </em>both Gary as the named insured and Judith as the resident spouse. Judith, therefore, cannot reasonably claim that \u201cowned by you,\u201d when she reads it, does not encompass the circumstance of Gary\u2019s ownership as the named insured which triggers the exclusion. The only reasonable interpretation of the exclusion language with the policy\u2019s definition of \u201cyou\u201d is that State Auto does not cover the use of a vehicle not listed in the declarations which is owned by the named insured, and State Auto does not cover the use of a vehicle not listed in the declarations which is owned by a resident spouse. Judith\u2019s liability arises from the use of a vehicle not declared in the policy but which was owned by Gary, one of the two alternatives listed in the definition of \u201cyou.\u201d Inasmuch as one of the alternatives of the definition of \u201cyou\u201d avails to implicate the exclusion, coverage is not provided for this incident for Judith.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-12\">The derivative nature of Judith\u2019s coverage supports this analysis; that is, she is covered as a consequence of being a resident spouse, and likewise, the application of the exclusion is derivative from Gary as the named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>The Hackers put forth an alternative basis for claiming that this court must interpret the exclusion in her favor. The Hackers argue that under the policy\u2019s definition of \u201cyou,\u201d the named insured and the resident spouse are one entity. In other words, \u201cyou\u201d means Gary and Judith Dickman jointly or collectively. According to that reading, unless the 1973 truck was owned by <em>both </em>Judith and Gary, the exclusion is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">A reasonable reading of the definitions section of the policy belies this interpretation. Instead, in defining \u201cyou,\u201d the policy specifically uses the words \u201cThroughout this policy \u2018you\u2019 and \u2018your\u2019 refer to * * *,\u201d which allows for the reading of the alternatives that follow as being just that, alternatives. If either alternative is applicable, the exclusion must be applied. The Hackers\u2019 argument would result in excluding liability coverage for the named insured alone or for the resident spouse alone. Stretching the policy\u2019s use of \u201cand\u201d to that extreme would not be a reasonable interpretation of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Given that the policy language of the (B)(2) exclusion is susceptible of only one meaning when read with the policy\u2019s definitions, we must reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and find that no coverage is afforded Judith Dickman under Gary\u2019s State Auto contract for the accident with Charles Hacker.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b279-9\">Moyer, C.J., Wright and Farmer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b279-10\">Douglas and Pfeifer, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b279-11\">F.E.
