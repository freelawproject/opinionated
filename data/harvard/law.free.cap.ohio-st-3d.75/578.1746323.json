The facts pertaining to the second issue will be set forth <em>infra. </em>We proceed first to the issue of summary judgment because this issue can be resolved without regard to the further issue of discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">The broad issue here is whether Mauzy presented sufficient evidence to withstand a motion for summary judgment. Ultimately, this issue turns on whether the circumstances surrounding Mauzy\u2019s separation from Kelly can properly be viewed as a \u201cdischarge\u201d under former R.C. 4101.17. However, in light of the opinions below and the arguments advanced by the parties, we find it necessary to clarify certain aspects of the requirements for establishing a prima facie case of age discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Former R.C. 4101.17 (now renumbered R.C. 4112.14) provided in part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">\u201c(A) No employer shall discriminate in any job opening against any applicant or discharge without just cause any employee aged forty or older who is physically able to perform the duties and otherwise meets the established requirements of the job and laws pertaining to the relationship between employer and employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">In <em>Barker v. Scovill, Inc. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 146, 6 OBR 202, 451 N.E.2d 807, we adopted the analytic framework established by the United States Supreme Court in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green </em>(1973), 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668, for use in Title VII cases, and modified the elements of a prima facie case to fit the contours of former R.C. 4101.17. Thus, we held that:</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">\u201cIn order to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination, violative of R.C. 4101.17, in an employment discharge action, plaintiff-employee must demonstrate (1) that he was a member of the statutorily-protected class, (2) that he was discharged, (3) that he was qualified for the position, and (4) that he was replaced by, or that his discharge permitted the retention of, a person not belonging to the protected class. Defendant-employer may then overcome the presumption inherent in the prima facie case by propounding a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for plaintiffs discharge. Finally, plaintiff must be allowed to show that the rationale set forth by defendant was only a pretext for unlawful discrimination.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">In <em>Kohmescher v. Kroger Co. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 501, 575 N.E.2d 439, at the syllabus, we modified <em>Barker, </em>in relevant part, by prefacing the first paragraph of its syllabus with the phrase, \u201cAbsent direct evidence of age discrimination.\u201d In so doing, we explained as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">\u201cResearch indicates that the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>standards borrowed in <em>Barker, supra, </em>were never intended to be applied strictly. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b741-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>\u201cMoreover, as the high court stated in <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston </em>(1985), 469 U.S. 111, 121, 105 S.Ct. 613, 621, 83 L.Ed.2d 523, 533, ***'*** the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test is inapplicable where the plaintiff presents direct evidence of discrimination. * * * \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">\u201c * * * As the court stated in <em>Barnes v. GenCorp., Inc. </em>(C.A.6, 1990), 896 F.2d 1457, 1464: \u2018 * * * the importance of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>\u201ctest\u201d is its discussion of the elements a plaintiff must prove to establish a prima facie case of discrimination <em>absent direct, circumstantial, or statistical evidence of discrimination.\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.) * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">\u00ab * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">\u201cTherefore, based on all of the foregoing, we modify the first sentence of paragraph one of the syllabus in <em>Barker, supra, </em>* * *. Under this modified standard, it should be abundantly clear that direct evidence of age discrimination will be sufficient to establish a prima facie case.\u201d <em>Id., </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 504-506, 575 N.E.2d at 442-443.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">The court of appeals interpreted the words \u201cdirect evidence\u201d to mean \u201c \u2018[evidence that directly proves a fact, without an inference or presumption.\u2019 \u201d Both parties agree that this interpretation, as stated and applied by the court of appeals, amounts to a rendition of a dichotomy between \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201ccircumstantial\u201d evidence. Mauzy argues, however, that the term \u201cdirect evidence,\u201d as used in <em>Kohmescher, </em>\u201crefers to the <em>method </em>of proof and not the <em>type </em>of evidence.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) </em>We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">In order to prevail in an employment discrimination case, the plaintiff must prove discriminatory intent. \u201c \u2018The state of a man\u2019s mind is as much a fact as the state of his digestion. It is true that it is very difficult to prove what the state of a man\u2019s mind at a particular time is, but if it can be ascertained it is as much a fact as anything else.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States Postal Serv. Bd. of Governors v. Aikens </em>(1983), 460 U.S. 711, 716-717, 103 S.Ct. 1478, 1482, 75 L.Ed.2d 403, 411, quoting <em>Eddington v. Fitzmaurice </em>(1885), 29 Ch.Div. 459, 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">The function of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>prima facie test is to allow the plaintiff to raise an inference of discriminatory intent indirectly. It serves to eliminate the most common nondiscriminatory reasons for the employer\u2019s action: lack of qualifications or the absence of a vacancy. <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine </em>(1981), 450 U.S. 248, 253-254, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1094, 67 L.Ed.2d 207, 215-216; Int<em>ernatl. Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States </em>(1977), 431 U.S. 324, 358, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 1866, 52 L.Ed.2d 396, 429, fn. 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters </em>(1978), 438 U.S. 567. 577. 98 S.Ct. 2943, 2949-2950. 57 L.Ed.2d 957, 967:</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>\u201cA prima facie case under <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>raises an inference of discrimination only because we presume these acts, if otherwise unexplained, are more likely than not based on the consideration of impermissible factors. See <em>Teamsters v. United States, supra, </em>at 358 [97 S.Ct. at 1866, 52 L.Ed.2d at 429] n. 44. And we are willing to presume this largely because we know from our experience that more often than not people do not act in a totally arbitrary manner, without any underlying reasons, especially in a business setting. Thus, when all legitimate reasons for rejecting an applicant have been eliminated as possible reasons for the employer\u2019s actions, it is more likely than not the employer, who we generally assume acts only with <em>some </em>reason, based his decision on an impermissible consideration such as race.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Thus, <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>is one method, an indirect method involving the process of elimination, whereby the plaintiff may create an inference that an employment decision was more likely than not based on illegal discriminatory criteria. The process of elimination, however, is not the only method by which such an inference may be created. As the high court explained in <em>Teamsters, supra, </em>431 U.S. at 358, 97 S.Ct. at 1866, 52 L.Ed.2d at 429:</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">\u201c[T]he <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>pattern [is not] the <em>only </em>means of establishing a prima facie case of individual discrimination. Our decision in that case * * * did not purport to create an inflexible formulation. We expressly noted that \u2018(t)he facts necessarily will vary in Title VII cases, and the specification * * * of the prima facie proof required from (a plaintiff) is not necessarily applicable in every respect to differing factual situations.\u2019 The importance of <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>lies, not in its specification of the discrete elements of proof there required, but in its recognition of the general principle that any Title VII plaintiff must carry the initial burden of offering evidence adequate to create an inference that an employment decision was based on a discriminatory criterion illegal under the Act.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) </em>(Citation omitted.) Thus, \u201c[a]s in any lawsuit, the plaintiff may prove his case by direct or circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Aikens, supra, </em>460 U.S. at 714, 103 S.Ct. at 1481, 75 L.Ed.2d at 409, fn. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">This is clearly what we had in mind in <em>Kohmescher, supra, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 505, 575 N.E.2d at 442, when we emphasized the notion that the four-element <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>prima facie test comes into play \u201c <em>\u2018absent direct, circumstantial, or statistical evidence of discrimination.\u2019 \u201d </em>In fact, the dissenting opinion of Justice Holmes, albeit lamenting this conclusion, interpreted the majority opinion in a similar vein. <em>Id., </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 507, 575 N.E.2d at 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">Appellees argue, however, \u201c[t]hat a plaintiff attempting to produce direct evidence to avoid application of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test cannot rely upon the presentation of merely circumstantial evidence.\u201d In support, appellees cite a litany of federal cases which do, indeed, draw a similar conclusion. In reaching <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>such a conclusion, these cases invariably rely upon certain language concerning \u201cdirect evidence\u201d used by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston </em>(1985), 469 U.S. 111, 105 S.Ct. 613, 83 L.Ed.2d 523, and by Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins </em>(1989), 490 U.S. 228, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 104 L.Ed.2d 268. The cases, however, attempt to apply the term \u201cdirect evidence\u201d in a context different from that of its origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">In <em>Thurston, supra, </em>469 U.S. at 121, 105 S.Ct. at 621, 83 L.Ed.2d at 533, the Supreme Court stated that \u201cthe <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test is inapplicable where the plaintiff presents direct evidence of discrimination.\u201d The \u201cdirect evidence\u201d in <em>Thurston </em>was a transfer policy under which airline captains disqualified from serving because of their age were not afforded the same privilege as captains disqualified for reasons other than their age to displace less senior flight engineers. The court found this policy to be discriminatory on its face, thus placing the <em>burden of persuasion </em>on the employer to prove an affirmative defense. <em>Id., </em>469 U.S. at 121-122, 105 S.Ct. at 621-622, 83 L.Ed.2d at 533. The opinion in <em>Thurston, </em>however, does not disclose whether the term \u201cdirect evidence\u201d was being used to refer to the type of evidence required in order to \u201cshift\u201d the burden of persuasion to the employer, or merely to indicate the fact that plaintiff had proven discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">In <em>Price Waterhouse, </em>the plurality opinion concluded that when a plaintiff proves that gender played a motivating part in an employment decision, the <em>burden of persuasion </em>is then upon the employer to prove that it would have made the same decision even if it had not taken plaintiffs gender into account. In concluding that plaintiff proved discrimination, the plurality focused its attention on certain negative gender-related comments made by Price Waterhouse partners in evaluating Hopkins for partnership. In its opinion, the plurality specifically stated that:</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">\u201cBy focusing on Hopkins\u2019 specific proof, however, we do not suggest a limitation on the possible ways of proving that stereotyping played a motivating role in an employment decision, and we refrain from deciding here which specific facts, \u2018standing alone,\u2019 would or would not establish a plaintiffs case, since such a decision is unnecessary in this case.\u201d <em>Id., </em>490 U.S. at 251-252, 109 S.Ct. at 1791, 104 L.Ed.2d at 288-289.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">On the other hand, in her concurring opinion Justice O\u2019Connor indicated that she would require \u201cdirect evidence that decisionmakers placed substantial negative reliance on an illegitimate criterion in reaching their decision.\u201d <em>Id., </em>490 U.S. at 277, 109 S.Ct. at 1805, 104 L.Ed.2d at 305, O\u2019Connor, J., concurring.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>The federal circuits, therefore, were left to grapple with the issue of whether, in light of <em>Thurston </em>and <em>Price Waterhouse, </em>the plaintiff is required to present \u201cdirect evidence\u201d of discrimination as a precondition to \u201cshifting\u201d <em>the burden of persuasion </em>and, if so, what constitutes \u201cdirect evidence.\u201d Not surprisingly, the various federal courts have about as many solutions to this problem as they do employment discrimination cases. See, <em>e.g., Manzer v. Diamond Shamrock Chemicals Co. </em>(C.A.6, 1994), 29 F.3d 1078; <em>Davis v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. </em>(C.A.5, 1994), 14 F.3d 1082; <em>Ostrowski v. Atlantic Mut. Ins. Cos. </em>(C.A.2, 1992), 968 F.2d 171; <em>Tyler v. Bethlehem Steel Corp. </em>(C.A.2, 1992), 958 F.2d 1176; <em>Jackson v. Harvard Univ. </em>(C.A.1, 1990), 900 F.2d 464; <em>Chipollini v. Spencer Gifts, Inc. </em>(C.A.3, 1987), 814 F.2d 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">In this context, however, the term \u201cdirect evidence,\u201d whatever it means and to the extent it is even required, is used to distinguish a <em>Thurston </em>or <em>Price Waterhouse </em>case from a <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>case. See Sullivan, Accounting for <em>Price Waterhouse: </em>Proving Disparate Treatment Under Title VII (1991), 56 Brook.L.Rev. 1107, 1137. In other words, the term is inserted as a precondition to \u201cshifting\u201d the burden of <em>persuasion; </em>it was not fashioned by its proponents to create a dichotomy between two opposing methods of establishing a <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>prima facie case. The caliber of evidence as \u201cdirect\u201d does, indeed, eschew reliance on the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>paradigm, not because it is the sole alternative method by which to create an inference of discrimination, but because it rises to the level of actually proving discrimination. The issue of what is required to \u201cshift\u201d the burden of persuasion, however, is an issue separate and apart from the issue of what is required to raise an inference of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Clearly, in <em>Kohmescher </em>we were not concerned with the issue of when the burden of persuasion should be placed on the employer. We were only concerned \u201cthat direct evidence of discrimination will be sufficient to establish a prima facie cas\u00e9.\u201d <em>Id., </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 506, 575 N.E.2d at 443. In this context, the phrase \u201cdirect evidence of age discrimination\u201d is indicative of a method of proof, not a type of evidence. It is, in a sense, a misnomer. It means that the plaintiff may establish a prima face case directly by presenting evidence, of any nature, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>show that the employer more likely than not was motivated by discriminatory animus. <em>Barnes v. GenCorp., Inc. </em>(C.A.6, 1990), 896 F.2d 1457, 1464; <em>Perry v. Kunz </em>(C.A.8, 1989), 878 F.2d 1056, 1058-1059; <em>Oxman v. WLS-TV </em>(C.A.7, 1988), 846 F.2d 448, 454-455; <em>Wilhelm v. Blue Bell, Inc. </em>(C.A.4, 1985), 773 F.2d 1429, 1432; <em>Equal Emp. Opportunity Comm. v. Electrolux Corp. </em>(D.C.Va.1985), 611 F.Supp. 926, 927-928; <em>Blackwell v. Sun Elec. Corp. </em>(C.A.6, 1983), 696 F.2d 1176, 1180; <em>Lovelace v. Sherwin-Williams Co. </em>(C.A.4, 1982), 681 F.2d 230, 239; <em>Stanojev v. Ebasco Services, Inc. </em>(C.A.2, 1981), 643 F.2d 914, 920-921; <em>Smith v. Univ. of North Carolina </em>(C.A.4, 1980), 632 F.2d 316, 335; <em>Loeb v. Textron, Inc. </em>(C.A.1, 1979), 600 F.2d 1003, 1017.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">Accordingly, we now clarify that the phrase \u201cAbsent direct evidence of age discrimination,\u201d as used in <em>Kohmescher, supra, </em>at the syllabus, refers to a method of proof, not a type of evidence. It means that a plaintiff may establish a prima facie case of age discrimination directly by presenting evidence, of any nature, to show that the employer more likely than not was motivated by discriminatory intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Mauzy further argues that pursuant to <em>Kohmescher, </em>where there is direct evidence of discriminatory animus, \u201csummary judgment is inappropriate, regardless whether the separation from employment is styled a termination, a resignation or a constructive discharge.\u201d Indeed, Justice Holmes similarly characterized the holding of <em>Kohmescher: </em>\u201cThis newly adopted test is that even the slightest bit of evidence of age discrimination adduced by the plaintiff obviates the necessity to prove that the plaintiff was discharged * * <em>Kohmescher, supra, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 507, 575 N.E.2d at 443 (Holmes, J., dissenting). We, however, disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Evidence of discriminatory intent is nothing more than proof of discriminatory thought. Former R.C. 4101.17, like Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, Section 2000e <em>et seq., </em>Title 42, U.S.Code, is not a thought control law. As Justice O\u2019Connor explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">\u201c[Title VII was meant] to eradicate discriminatory actions in the employment setting, not mere discriminatory thoughts. Critics of the bill that became Title VII labeled it a \u2018thought control bill,\u2019 and argued that it created a \u2018punishable crime that does not require an illegal external act as a basis for judgment.\u2019 100 Cong.Rec. 7254 (1964) (remarks of Sen. Ervin). Senator Case * * * responded:</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">\u201c \u2018The man must do or fail to do something in regard to employment. There must be some specific external act, more than a mental act. Only if he does the act because of the grounds stated in the bill would there be any legal consequences.\u2019\u201d <em>Price Waterhouse, supra, </em>490 U.S. at 262, 109 S.Ct. at 1797, 104 L.Ed.2d at 295-296.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Thus, while proof of discriminatory thought is necessary to the establishment of a discrimination claim, it is not sufficient. There must be a consequential prohibited act. The prohibited act under former R.C. 4101.17, as relevant here, is a \u201cdischarge.\u201d Other actions, such as transfers or promotions, are not prohibited unless they amount to a \u201cdischarge.\u201d This is a legislative choice that we cannot disturb.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">It is true, as -Mauzy urges, that direct evidence of discriminatory animus eschews reliance on the prima facie four-element test of <em>Barker </em>and <em>Kohmescher, supra. </em>This does not mean, however, that a mandate of the statute may be ignored simply because it happens to be one of the elements of a prima facie case set forth in those cases. Direct evidence of discriminatory thought no more obviates the statutory requirement that plaintiff be discharged than it does the statutory requirement that the plaintiff fall within the protected age group. To hold as Mauzy suggests would result in rewriting the statute or, worse, prohibiting mere thought.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Thus, irrespective of which method is utilized to establish discriminatory intent, plaintiff must show that she was <em>\u201cdischarged </em>on account of age.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Kohmescher, supra, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 505, 575 N.E.2d at 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Mauzy also contends that her burden to show that she was discharged is satisfied by MacKinnon\u2019s statement that Mauzy \u201cleft us no alternative but to terminate her [Mauzy\u2019s] employment.\u201d According to Mauzy, \u201c[i]t is the termination, not the reason for it, that allows the <em>prima facie </em>case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">In a general sense, Mauzy is correct; disputing the employer\u2019s alleged legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for discharging a plaintiff is not a requirement of the prima facie case. However, when a plaintiff chooses termination in lieu of transfer, her decision is not construed as an actual discharge. Instead, she is required to show as a part of her prima facie case that her choice to be terminated was involuntary or coerced. <em>Kohmescher, supra, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 506, 575 N.E.2d at 443; <em>Barker, supra, </em>6 Ohio St.3d at 148, 6 OBR at 204, 451 N.E.2d at 810. Mauzy can stand on no better footing by refusing her transfer assignment in the face of termination than do employees who elect termination in lieu of transfer. Former R.C. 4101.17 proscribes discriminatory discharges, not transfers. It cannot be transformed into a palliative for every unattractive workplace transfer by the simple expedient of refusing the assignment. See <em>Bristow v. Daily Press, Inc. </em>(C.A.4,1985), 770 F.2d 1251, 1255.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">Since Mauzy in effect chose termination over transfer, she must show that her decision was involuntary or, as the doctrine is more familiarly known, that she was constructively discharged. See <em>Clowes v. Allegheny Valley Hosp. </em>(C.A.3, 1993), 991 F.2d 1159, 1160-1161. Courts generally apply an objective test in determining when an employee was constructively discharged, <em>viz., </em>whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>employer\u2019s actions made working conditions so intolerable that a reasonable person under the circumstances would have felt compelled to resign.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>991 F.2d at 1161; <em>McCann v. Litton Systems, Inc. </em>(C.A.5, 1993), 986 F.2d 946, 951; <em>Stephens v. C.I.T. Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. </em>(C.A.5, 1992), 955 F.2d 1023, 1027; <em>Spulak v.

Stern Entertainment, Inc. </em>(C.A.3, 1988), 860 F.2d 1227, 1230-1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">In applying this test, courts seek to determine whether the cumulative effect of the employer\u2019s actions would make a reasonable person believe that termination was imminent. They recognize that there is no sound reason to compel an employee to struggle with the inevitable simply to attain the \u201cdischarge\u201d label. No single factor is determinative. Instead, a myriad of factors are considered, including reductions in sales territory, poor performance evaluations, criticism in front of coemployees, inquiries about retirement intentions, and expressions of a preference for employees outside the protected group. Nor does the inquiry change solely because an option to transfer is thrown into the mix, lateral though it may be. A transfer accompanied by measurable compensation at a comparable level does not necessarily preclude a finding of constructive- discharge. Our review is not so narrowly circumscribed by the quality and attributes of the transfer option itself. A sophisticated discriminating employer should not be permitted to circumvent the statute by transferring an older employee to a sham position as a prelude to discharge. See <em>Stephens, supra; Guthrie v. J.C. Penney Co., Inc. </em>(C.A.5, 1986), 803 F.2d 202; <em>Crawford v. ITT Consumer Financial Corp. </em>(D.C.Ohio 1986), 653 F.Supp. 1184; <em>Schneider v. Jax Shack, Inc. </em>(C.A.8, 1986), 794 F.2d 383; <em>Goss v. Exxon Office Systems Co. </em>(C.A.3, 1984), 747 F.2d 885; <em>Jacobson v. Am. Home Products Corp. </em>(D.C.Ill.1982), 36 FEP Cases 559; Annotation, Circumstances Which Warrant Finding of Constructive Discharge Under Age Discrimination in Employment Act (29 USCS \u00a7\u00a7 621 <em>et seq.) </em>(1989), 93 A.L.R.Fed. 10, Sections 9-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Applying the law as set forth above to the facts of this case, we conclude that summary judgment was improperly granted in favor of Hart and Kelly because of the existence of a genuine issue of material fact over whether Mauzy was constructively discharged on account of her age. Under the record developed in the trial court, there is evidence showing that Mauzy met with great success over the years in her position as resident branch manager at Kelly\u2019s Mentor branch. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>When Hart took over as Mauzy\u2019s supervisor, she expressed her preference for younger employees, inquired into Mauzy\u2019s plans to retire, and told her to \u201ctake the money and run.\u201d She berated Mauzy in front of her coworkers, gave her negative evaluations, reduced her staff and territory, introduced a younger employee to Mauzy\u2019s key customers, and noted in Mauzy\u2019s final evaluation that \u201cyou can\u2019t teach an old dog new tricks.\u201d Subsequently, she sought to transfer Mauzy to a position that was newly created, and which was never filled following Mauzy\u2019s separation from employment, while replacing Mauzy with a younger employee with a lower rating. Although appellees\u2019 version of the events is markedly different, in our view reasonable minds could conclude from the evidence that appellees were motivated by discriminatory animus and that Mauzy was constructively discharged from her employment. Thus, Mauzy has presented sufficient evidence to raise an inference of age discrimination under former R.C. 4101.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Accordingly, the decision of the court of appeals is reversed as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">The second issue presented for determination involves the trial court\u2019s denial of Mauzy\u2019s requests for further discovery. The facts relevant to this issue are as follows. On February 23, 1993, the trial court entered a pretrial order indicating that discovery had been completed. Following several continuances, appellees filed their motion for summary judgment on April 6, 1993. On April 29, 1993, Mauzy\u2019s previous counsel filed a motion to extend the time to respond to appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment and to withdraw as Mauzy\u2019s counsel of record, which the trial court granted on May 4,1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">On May 13, 1993, Mauzy\u2019s present counsel filed a motion for a stay of proceedings, stating that \u201c[i]n order to properly undertake representation] * * * [he] would require a * * * period of time to become completely familiar with the file and perform certain discovery which is necessary to properly respond to the summary judgment motion.\u201d On June 22, 1993, the trial court granted a stay of sixty days and scheduled a pretrial conference for August 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">During July and August 1993, Mauzy\u2019s new counsel attempted to schedule depositions pursuant to Civ.R. 30(B)(4) and (5), seeking a number of documents and to depose Pamela Vaughn. Appellees responded by filing a motion for a protective order. On August 23, 1993, the trial court entered an order prohibiting Mauzy from proceeding with the depositions, noting that \u201cthe discovery deadlines * * * have long since passed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">On August 24, Mauzy filed a motion pursuant to Civ.R. 56(F) \u201cto complete discovery in this action in order to adequately respond to the pending summary judgment.\u201d She also argued, however, that further discovery \u201cis necessary to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>presentation of the merits of her claim.\u201d In particular, she sought to depose certain individuals, including her replacement, concerning the issues of discriminatory intent, replacement by a younger employee and the closing of the Mayfield office. On August 27, 1993, the trial court denied Mauzy\u2019s request for further discovery on the basis that it had already given Mauzy a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery when it stayed the proceedings on June 22 for sixty days, \u201cthereby allowing Plaintiffs counsel an opportunity to review the file [and] engage in discovery.\u201d The court did indicate, however, that \u201c[d]ue to any misinterpretation of the Court\u2019s prior order, the Court will grant Plaintiff an additional leave to 12:00 noon, September 3, 1993,\u201d apparently to respond to appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Mauzy filed her brief in opposition to appellees\u2019 summary judgment motion on September 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">On September 15, appellees requested a continuance of the trial date along with a motion by their former counsel to withdraw as counsel of record. The motion was necessitated by Mauzy\u2019s allegations that prior counsel for appellees had destroyed a key piece of evidence. See fn. 1. On October 6, the court granted appellees\u2019 counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">On December 29 and 30, Mauzy again requested additional discovery in light of the rescheduling of the trial date until April 1994. On January 18, 1994, the trial court denied this request and entered summary judgment in favor of appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The court of appeals held that:</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">\u201cIt is apparent from the record that appellants were afforded ample time within which to conduct discovery. Furthermore, it does not appear that the requested discovery would have affected the disposition of the summary judgment motion, as that motion was decided upon appellant\u2019s failure to prove that she was discharged, as required by <em>Kohmescher </em>to establish a prima facie case. Appellants\u2019 proffered discovery dealt with the issue of age bias, which is irrelevant under R.C. 4101.17 unless the employee was discharged. See <em>Koh-mescher, supra. </em>As a result, appellants have failed to demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion * *</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">In light of our holding that summary judgment was improper under the record as presently developed, it is no longer of any concern whether \u201cthe requested discovery would have affected the disposition of the summary judgment motion.\u201d Accordingly, the issue of whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying Mauzy\u2019s motion for discovery pursuant to Civ.R. 56(F) is moot. Civ.R. 56(F) operates only when it appears that the nonmoving party cannot present facts essential to justify opposition to a motion for summary judgment. Such a situation can no longer be said to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">Thus, the only issue that confronts us is whether the trial court unreasonably denied Mauzy the pretrial opportunity to fully prepare her case for litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>\u201cIn discovery practices, the trial court has a discretionary power not a ministerial duty.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Daggett v. Gessaman </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St.2d 55, 57, 63 O.O.2d 88, 90, 295 N.E.2d 659, 661. Thus, the standard of review of a trial court\u2019s decision in a discovery matter is whether the court abused its discretion. See <em>Heat &amp; Control, Inc. v. Hester Industries, Inc. </em>(C.A.Fed.1986), 785 F.2d 1017, 1022.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Such discretion, however, is not without limits. Although unusual, appellate courts will reverse a discovery order \u201cwhen the trial court has erroneously denied or limited discovery.\u201d 8 Wright, Miller &amp; Marcus, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure (2 Ed.1994) 92, Section 2006. Thus, \u201c[a]n appellate court will reverse the decision of a trial court that extinguishes a party\u2019s right to discovery if the trial court\u2019s decision is improvident and affects the discovering party\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>Rossman v. Rossman </em>(1975), 47 Ohio App.2d 103, 110, 1 O.O.3d 206, 210, 352 N.E.2d 149, 153-154. See, also, <em>Stegawski v. Cleveland Anesthesia Group, Inc. </em>(1987), 37 Ohio App.3d 78, 86, 523 N.E.2d 902, 910; <em>Smith v. Klein </em>(1985), 23 Ohio App.3d 146, 151, 23 OBR 387, 393, 492 N.E.2d 852, 858; <em>Simmons v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith </em>(1977), 53 Ohio App.2d 91, 97, 7 O.O.3d 65, 69, 372 N.E.2d 363, 368; <em>Toledo Edison Co. v. GA Technologies, Inc. </em>(C.A.6, 1988), 847 F.2d 335, 341; <em>Weahkee v. Norton </em>(C.A.10, 1980), 621 F.2d 1080, 1082 (employment discrimination action); <em>Goldman v.

There is nothing in the record to suggest that this request was interposed as a dilatory tactic. The record discloses that further discovery was warranted in order to fully prepare to litigate the issues of discriminatory animus and constructive discharge, and that the discovery that had already been conducted was not- overburdensome. Moreover, the initial request for additional discovery was not raised, as appellees suggest, at the \u201celeventh hour.\u201d The motion for summary judgment was not ruled upon until January 18, 1994, with trial having been reset for some time thereafter. Under these circumstances, we hold that it is improvident to deny further discovery to Mauzy\u2019s substitute counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">The trial court\u2019s order of August 27, standing alone, creates the illusion that Mauzy\u2019s second counsel was given the opportunity to conduct additional discovery. That order denied Mauzy\u2019s request for further discovery on the purported basis that the court had already granted a sixty-day stay to afford Mauzy\u2019s second counsel \u201can opportunity to * * * engage in discovery.\u201d Yet, when Mauzy\u2019s substitute counsel had attempted discovery during that period, he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>met by the trial court\u2019s August 23 order prohibiting the attempted discovery on the basis that \u201cthe discovery deadlines * * * have long since passed.\u201d These incongruous orders effectively denied Mauzy the opportunity to fully prepare her cause for litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in denying Mauzy further discovery, and the decision of the court of appeals is reversed as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">In light of all the foregoing, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b751-8\">Douglas, Hildebrandt, F.E.

The fourth element for the establishment of the prima facie case set forth herein is questionable in light of the recent United States Supreme Court decision in <em>O\u2019Connor v. Consol. Coin Caterers Corp. </em>(1996), 517 U.S.-, 116 S.Ct. 1307, 134 L.Ed.2d 433.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b743-9\">.

The shift in the burden of persuasion occurs only where a plaintiff proves by direct evidence that an unlawful motive was a substantial factor actually relied upon in making the decision.\u201d Price <em>Waterhouse, </em>490 U.S. at 280, 109 S.Ct. at 1806, 104 L.Ed.2d at 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">Justice White, however, unlike Justice O\u2019Connor, did not indicate a preference for \u201cdirect evidence\u201d in his concurring opinion. Thus, only four Justices (three dissenting and one concurring) have indicated a preference for \u201cdirect evidence.\u201d Moreover, in light of the changed composition of the high court, it is impossible to gauge a majority position on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b747-7\">. Not all of the federal circuits agree on the legal standards by which to determine whether a constructive discharge has occurred. See <em>Levendos v. Stern Entertainment, Inc. </em>(C.A.3, 1988), 860 F.2d 1227, 1230-1231. The objective standard appears to be more consonant with the purpose of the prima facie case to raise an inference of discrimination. To require proof that the employer\u2019s actions were deliberately aimed at forcing resignation transcends the design of the prima facie case. We note, however, that the result we reach in this ease would not be affected by the application of a subjective standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b751-11\">Cook, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AZI\">dissenting. I respectfully dissent. My disagreement is particularly with the stated proposition that \u201cdirect\u201d evidence is a method of proof rather than a type of evidence, and with the conclusion that it is a factual question whether Mauzy\u2019s lateral transfer can amount to a constructive discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">DIRECT EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b751-13\">The law is settled that direct evidence of discrimination obviates the necessity of raising an inference of discrimination through a <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>showing of a prima facie case. The court of appeals was correct in referring to Black\u2019s Law Dictionary to define the term \u201cdirect evidence\u201d as used in the <em>Kohmescher </em>syllabus. <em>Kohmescher v. Kroger Co. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 501, 575 N.E.2d 439. That case had it right in terms of the relationship between direct evidence of discrimination (such as documents disclosing the employer\u2019s use of age as a criterion for employment decisions) and the alternative, prima facie showing through a <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>presentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-14\">CONSTRUCTIVE DISCHARGE</p>\n<p id=\"b751-15\">Mauzy chose to sue her employer under R.C. 4101.17, which prohibits discharges on the basis of age. Taking all of Mauzy\u2019s testimony on the issue of her termination as true, as a matter of law, Mauzy was not discharged. The majority concedes that in order to establish that she was constructively discharged, Mauzy must show that her employer made working conditions so intolerable that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>reasonable person under the circumstances would have felt compelled to resign. The evidence, construed in Mauzy\u2019s favor, amounts to the following: Hart had an unjustified, negative, discriminatory attitude toward Mauzy which motivated the transfer decision. That is it. Hart\u2019s discriminatory attitude is not actionable under R.C. 4101.17. Hart\u2019s <em>action </em>is the transfer. This action is not prohibited by R.C. 4101.17, even if it is motivated by a discriminatory animus. What is prohibited is a discriminatory transfer that equates to a discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">As a matter of law, Mauzy\u2019s transfer cannot be said to equate to a discharge. She must show that the transfer rendered the working conditions so intolerable that a reasonable person under the circumstances would have felt compelled to resign. The transfer was to a new position in a different branch office, in the same locale (ie., greater Cleveland), at the same compensation level. Indeed, Mauzy never even worked one day under the working conditions of the new job to which she was assigned. The majority seems to go beyond the evidence presented in the summary judgment proceedings in implying that the new position offered to Mauzy was a sham, just a prelude to discharge. Under the circumstances of this case, involving no change of residence or other such \u201cdetrimental reliance,\u201d it would be pure speculation to label the voluntary relinquishment of the transfer a constructive discharge on the untested assessment that the position was a sham.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Although Mauzy may have legitimately resented the overtones of her dealings with Hart, Hart did not fire her, did not insist Mauzy accept a transfer across the country as in <em>Kohmescher, </em>and did not even reduce Mauzy\u2019s pay or her status as a management employee. Whatever unlawful attitude Hart may have harbored and displayed, it- is only her decisions as to Mauzy\u2019s employment that are actionable, and under R.C. 4101.17, only discharge decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">DISCOVERY</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals on the discovery issue because, like that court, I find that the requested discovery would not have affected the issue of whether or not Mauzy was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">For the foregoing reasons, summary judgment was properly granted and I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b752-9\">Moyer, C.J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
