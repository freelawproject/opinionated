(See Appendix, <em>infra.) </em>We have carefully considered each of appellant\u2019s propositions of law and have independently reviewed appellant\u2019s death sentences for appropriateness and proportionality. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and uphold the sentences of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">R.C. 2929.05 requires this court to review capital cases in a certain manner. However, we have held, in a series of prior cases, that R.C. 2929.05 does not require this court to address and discuss, in opinion form, each and every proposition of law raised by the parties in a capital case. See, <em>e.g., State v. Scudder </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 263, 267, 643 N.E.2d 524, 528. We continue to adhere to our position on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">Here, we have conducted an exhaustive review of the record and have carefully considered each of appellant\u2019s twenty-eight propositions of law. Many of the issues raised by this appellant have been addressed and rejected under analogous circumstances in a number of our prior cases. Additionally, several of appellant\u2019s arguments have been waived. Upon review of appellant\u2019s propositions of law and a careful examination of the record, we fail to detect any errors that would undermine our confidence in the outcome of appellant\u2019s trial. We are convinced that appellant received a fair trial by an impartial jury, that he was competently represented by trial counsel, and that he received a fair and reliable sentencing determination. We address, in opinion form, only those issues that merit some detailed discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">After the jury had returned its verdicts in the penalty phase of appellant\u2019s trial, the trial court <em>sua sponte </em>ordered the preparation of a presentence investigation report. Additionally, the trial court ordered the preparation of victim impact statements from the victims\u2019 family members. Specifically, the trial judge stated, on the record and in open court, \u201cAt this time, I am going to order a presentence investigation be done * * * and I\u2019m also going to order a victim impact statement from Mrs. Berry, both for herself and on behalf of Aaron and Jay Allard.\u201d Appellant raised no objection, and a presentence report and victim impact statements were prepared for the trial court\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">At the subsequent sentencing hearing, the trial court, in handing down appellant\u2019s death sentences, stated, \u201c[a]s required by Section 2929.03(D)(3), this Court has now considered all the relevant evidence introduced at both proceedings; the testimony, the exhibits, the statement of the defendant not given under oath, the arguments of counsel, <em>the presentence report, the victim impact statements, </em>and the mental examination reports as they pertain to Counts 1 and 2 of the indictment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Appellant raised no objection to the trial court\u2019s consideration of the presentence investigation report and victim impact statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">In his first proposition of law, appellant contends that the trial court committed reversible error by <em>sua sponte </em>ordering and considering a presentence investigation report that had not been requested by appellant. We find no reversible error in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Crim.R. 32.2(A) provides that \u201c[i]n felony cases the court shall, and in misdemeanor cases may, order a presentence investigation and report before granting probation.\u201d R.C. 2929.03(D)(1) states that where death may be imposed as a penalty for aggravated murder, \u201c[a] pre-sentence investigation * * * shall not be made except upon request of the defendant.\u201d Here, appellant was found guilty of two non-capital felony offenses (felonious assault and attempted aggravated murder), as well as two capital offenses. Thus, while the trial court could have ordered a presentence investigation report in sentencing appellant for the non-capital felony offenses, the trial court clearly erred to the extent that it ordered and considered the presentence report for purposes of sentencing appellant on the two counts of capital murder. See <em>State v. Campbell </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 38, 41, 630 N.E.2d 339, 345, fn. 3. However, appellant never objected to the compilation or consideration of the presentence investigation report. Thus, appellant\u2019s contentions of error based upon the report have been waived. Accordingly, our discretionary review of appellant\u2019s contentions must proceed, if at all, under the plain-error analysis of Crim.R. 52(B). See <em>Campbell, supra, </em>at 41-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>43, 630 N.E.2d at 345-346.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plain error does not exist unless it can be said that but for the error, the outcome of the trial would clearly have been otherwise, <em>ie., </em>that but for the presentence investigation report, appellant would clearly have been sentenced to life imprisonment as opposed to death. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Here, there is no question that the trial court considered the presentence investigation report in sentencing appellant on the two counts of capital murder. The trial court specifically said that it had done so at the sentencing hearing. In addition, the trial court, in its written sentencing opinion, stated that \u201c[bjefore imposing sentence [for the capital crimes], the Court reviewed the relevant evidence from both trials, the testimony, the exhibits admitted, the defendant\u2019s unsworn statement, the arguments of counsel, <em>the presentence report, </em>victim impact statements and the psychological reports concerning the defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) However, we are not persuaded that any prejudice occurred as a result of the trial court\u2019s consideration of the presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">In an attempt to demonstrate prejudice, appellant notes that the presentence investigation report contained a detailed account of the facts of this case and quotes, at length, from a portion of appellant\u2019s videotaped confession which was not admitted into evidence at trial. In this regard, appellant points to a portion of the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion entitled \u201cFindings of Fact,\u201d wherein the trial court adopted, verbatim, the statement of fact contained in the report. However, the statement of fact contained in the presentence report was generally accurate in setting forth the facts of appellant\u2019s crimes. Moreover, there is nothing in the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion to suggest that the trial court placed any undue reliance on factual matters not in evidence in determining that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the evidence presented in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Appellant also cites two instances in which the trial court allegedly \u201cexpressly referenced\u201d the presentence investigation report in imposing the sentences of death. Appellant contends that the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion \u201cspecifically referred to the portion of the P.S.I. in which Jerry [appellant] is described as unable to accept responsibility for his actions.\u201d However, the portion of the sentencing opinion to which appellant refers actually contains no specific reference to the presentence investigation report. Moreover, the evidence adduced at trial clearly established that appellant was unable to accept responsibility for his acts of violence. Appellant also contends that the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion \u201crelies upon information in the P.S.I. that suggests the victims\u2019 deaths were prolonged even though no such evidence was admitted at trial.\u201d However, such evidence was admitted at trial in the form of death certificates indicating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>there were \u201cseveral minutes\u201d between the onset of the victims\u2019 wounds and their ultimate demise.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">The presentence report also contained a summary of appellant\u2019s prior criminal history. In his sentencing opinion, the trial court referred to appellant\u2019s criminal history in finding that the R.C. 2929.04(B)(5) mitigating factor (lack of significant criminal history) had no applicability in this case. However, the R.C. 2929.04(B)(5) mitigating factor was absent in this case with or without the presentence investigation report, since appellant had never raised that factor in mitigation. In any event, the information concerning appellant\u2019s past criminal history was contained in certain defense exhibits that were admitted into evidence during the penalty phase, and in certain medical reports that were at issue during the penalty phase proceedings. Thus, the information in the report merely duplicated information that was already contained in the record before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">W\u00e9 find that the case at bar is analogous to the situation presented in <em>Campbell, supra, </em>69 Ohio St.3d 38, 630 N.E.2d 339. In <em>Campbell, </em>a trial judge presiding over a capital jury trial <em>sua sponte </em>ordered the preparation of a presentence investigation report after the jury had returned its verdicts recommending imposition of the death sentence. The presentence investigation report was considered by the trial judge in sentencing the defendant to death. The trial judge never cited any portion of the report as having any particular impact on the sentencing determination, and there was nothing in the record to indicate that the trial court gave any particular weight to the matters contained in the report. Further, both the trial jury and the court of appeals in <em>Campbell </em>unanimously found that the statutory aggravating circumstance the defendant was found guilty of committing outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, even though neither the jury nor the court of appeals had considered the presentence report. Under these circumstances, we found that the defendant had failed to establish that the trial court had committed plain error in ordering and considering the report. <em>Id., </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 43, 630 N.E.2d at 346. The same analysis applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Nevertheless, appellant attempts to distinguish <em>Campbell </em>on the basis that the trial judge in the case at bar specifically stated in the written sentencing opinion that he had considered the presentence investigation report. However, like the situation in <em>Campbell, </em>appellant has failed to demonstrate that the presentence report had any significant impact on the trial court\u2019s ultimate decision to impose the death penalty. Here, as in <em>Campbell, </em>there has been no showing that but for the presentence investigation report, the result of the sentencing hearing would clearly have been different. See, also, <em>State v. Cook </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 516, 528-529, 605 N.E.2d 70, 83-84, in which we found no prejudice to a capital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>defendant where the trial court <em>sua sponte </em>ordered and considered a presentence report and cited in his opinion, among other things, information contained in the presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">Appellant also contends that the trial court converted certain matters contained in the presentence report into \u201cnonstatutory aggravating circumstances.\u201d However, contrary to appellant\u2019s assertions, there is absolutely no indication in the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion that any nonstatutory aggravating circumstances were considered and weighed against the evidence presented in mitigation. In this regard, we reject appellant\u2019s contentions that <em>State v. Davis </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 361, 528 N.E.2d 925, mandates reversal of the death sentences, and that this court\u2019s independent review is incapable of curing the trial court\u2019s err in ordering and considering the presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">In his second proposition of law, appellant contends that the trial court committed reversible error by ordering and considering victim impact statements in sentencing appellant on the two counts of aggravated murder. However, appellant never objected to the compilation or consideration of the victim impact statements. Thus, the plain-error analysis of Crim.R. 52(B) applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Here, the trial court considered two letters, both of which discussed the impact of the deaths on the victims\u2019 family. One of the letters indicated that death was the only appropriate sentence for appellant. In this regard, we have previously held that expressions of opinion in victim impact statements regarding the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon the offender clearly exceed the scope of permissible victim impact evidence. See <em>State v. Fautenberry </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 435, 439, 650 N.E.2d 878, 882. However, there is no indication that the trial court was influenced by or specifically relied upon the letters in sentencing appellant to death. Under these circumstances, we are not persuaded that the trial court\u2019s consideration of the victim impact statements had any effect on the sentencing determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">To establish plain error, appellant must be able to demonstrate that but for the victim impact statements, the trial judge would clearly have sentenced appellant to terms of life imprisonment for the aggravated murders of Karen and Rachael Allard. We find that appellant has failed to make this showing. Our finding is bolstered by the fact that both the trial jury and the court of appeals found that the aggravating circumstance for each killing outweighed the evidence presented in mitigation, even though neither the jury nor the court of appeals considered the victim impact statements in weighing the aggravating circumstance against the mitigating factors. Given this, we can hardly be certain that the trial judge would have sentenced appellant to life imprisonment but for the victim impact statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we reject appellant\u2019s first and second propositions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">At the outset of the jury\u2019s penalty phase deliberations, the jurors sent a note to the trial judge requesting an answer the following question: \u201cIf sentenced to life in prison on both counts, will the sentences be concurrent or consecutive?\u201d In response, the trial judge stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">\u201cConcurrent and consecutive are legal terms, and I don\u2019t remember them even being used throughout the trial, which ought to be a good indicator that it\u2019s nothing for you to be concerned with. Your role at this stage is to consider the aggravating circumstances, the mitigating factors, and make a recommendation to the Court on each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">\u201cConsider the counts separately. You are not to speculate as to what sentence the Court is actually going to impose or whether the sentences will be run concurrent or consecutive. That is not something for you to even consider in this matter. Your role is to make a recommendation as to what you think the Court ought to do, not to speculate on what the Court will do under certain circumstances. Is that clear?</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">\u201cOkay. Resume your deliberations. Thank You.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">In his third proposition of law, appellant contends that the trial court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s question impermissibly diminished the reliability of the jury\u2019s sentencing determination. Specifically, appellant contends that the jurors were seeking some assurance from the trial judge that appellant would remain in jail for the rest of his life if the jurors returned verdicts recommending imposition of life sentences. Appellant contends that \u201c[b]y failing to inform the jury that it [the trial court] was statutorily bound to impose a life sentence if the jury * * * [recommended imposition of a life sentence] and what the consequences of that sentence were, the trial court permitted the jury to sentence Appellant while laboring under a fear that Appellant might possibly be turned loose upon society at some point in the <em>near </em>future.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">Our response to appellant\u2019s contention is twofold. First, appellant\u2019s assertions regarding the jury\u2019s possible motives for asking about consecutive and concurrent sentences are purely speculative. Second, the trial court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s question was proper, since a jury has no option of recommending whether life sentences should run consecutively or concurrently. <em>State v. Grant </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 465, 482, 620 N.E.2d 50, 69. The trial court properly instructed the jury in the penalty phase as to the jury\u2019s possible sentencing recommendations: death, life with parole eligibility after twenty years, and life with parole eligibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>after thirty years. The question concerning consecutive or concurrent sentences was not a matter for the jury to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Therefore, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s interrogatory and, accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s third proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Appellant\u2019s fourth proposition of law concerns the death-qualification process used during jury selection. In <em>State v. Rogers </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 174, 17 OBR 414, 478 N.E.2d 984, paragraph three of the syllabus, vacated and remanded on other grounds (1985), 474 U.S. 1002, 106 S.Ct. 518, 88 L.Ed.2d 452, this court held that \u201c[t]he proper standard for determining when a prospective juror may be excluded for cause based on his views on capital punishment is whether the juror\u2019s views would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and oath. <em>(Wainwright v. Witt </em>[1985], [469 U.S. 412, 105 S.Ct. 844] 83 L.Ed.2d 841, followed.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">During <em>voir dire, </em>the trial judge asked prospective jurors the following question: \u201cIf in a proper case where the facts warrant it and the law permits it, could you join in signing a verdict form which might recommend to the Court the imposition of the death penalty?\u201d Appellant contends that this question was insufficient to ferret-out those prospective jurors who would automatically vote for the death penalty. Appellant suggests, and rightly so, that the defense in a capital case is entitled during <em>voir dire </em>examination of prospective jurors to inquire whether the jurors would automatically vote to impose the death sentence, <em>i.e., </em>to determine whether the jurors hold views concerning capital punishment that would preclude them from fairly considering a sentence other than death. See <em>Morgan v. Illinois </em>(1992), 504 U.S. 719, 112 S.Ct. 2222, 119 L.Ed.2d 492. What appellant fails to recognize is that the trial court in this case permitted defense counsel wide latitude to inquire into each prospective juror\u2019s beliefs and opinions concerning the death penalty. Further, defense counsel exercised that right and questioned jurors extensively regarding their views on capital punishment. Thus, there was no reversible error in the death qualification process used in jury selection.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">Appellant also contends that the trial court erred in failing to excuse prospective juror Carolyn Sisley for cause. With respect to this issue, the court of appeals stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">\u201cAppellant next argues that the [trial] court erred in not excusing Juror Sisley for cause when she initially stated that it was not probable that she would vote to impose a life sentence, as her brother had been murdered. Appellant argues that she should have been immediately excused for cause, and that the court erred in rehabilitating her, citing <em>Morgan, supra </em>[504 U.S. 719, 112 S.Ct. 2222, 119 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>L.Ed.2d 492]. Appellant also argues that the court foreclosed him from making adequate inquiry into this juror\u2019s ability to remain impartial.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">\u201cThe court did not err in failing to excuse Sisley immediately upon her response that it was possible, but not probable, that she could vote for a life sentence. Her statement was not an unequivocal statement \u25a0 that she would automatically vote to impose a death sentence. Rather, the response invited a further inquiry into her ability to decide the case based on the evidence and instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">\u201cCounsel for appellant questioned Sisley for thirteen pages in the transcript regarding her ability to listen to mitigating evidence. Ultimately, appellant rehabilitated the juror, as she responded that having heard the mitigating evidence and the court\u2019s instructions as to the law, she could return a verdict of life. * * * Contrary to appellant\u2019s claim that the court impermissibly foreclosed specific questioning regarding her ability to consider mitigating evidence, the court suggested that counsel for appellant explain to the juror the nature of mitigating evidence and give her examples, such as social history and psychological evidence. * * * The court did not err in failing to exclude this juror for cause, and we read nothing in <em>Morgan </em>which dictates a different result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">We agree with the court of appeals\u2019 analysis of this issue. During <em>voir dire, </em>Sisley indicated that she would listen to mitigating evidence and legitimately weigh the evidence in accordance with the trial court\u2019s instructions. She indicated that despite her personal tragedy involving the loss of her brother, she could fairly listen to mitigating evidence and return a verdict of life imprisonment as opposed to a sentence of death. Defense counsel specifically asked Sisley the following question: \u201cHaving heard the facts of the case with regard to mitigation and as instructed by the Court as to the law, can you return a verdict of life imprisonment as opposed to imposing or voting to impose the death penalty?\u201d Sisley responded in the affirmative. Upon a careful review of the <em>voir dire </em>examin\u00e1tion of prospective juror Sisley, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to excuse Sisley for cause. Moreover, we note that appellant ultimately exercised a' preemptory challenge to remove Sisley from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">In his fifth proposition of law, appellant contends that he was required to exhaust all of his preemptory challenges during <em>voir dire </em>to remove biased and impartial jurors from the jury when, according to appellant, each of the prospective jurors removed by preemptory challenge should have been removed for cause. Specifically, appellant exercised his six preemptory challenges to remove prospective jurors Sisley, Black, Brokaw, Sheets, Ohde and Hawk. Appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his challenge for cause with respect to prospective juror Sisley, and that the trial court should have, <em>sua </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number><em>sponte, </em>excused prospective jurors Black, Brokaw, Sheets, Ohde and Hawk. Appellant\u2019s contentions are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">R.C. 2313.42(J) clearly contemplates that \u201cgood cause\u201d exists for the removal of a prospective juror when \u201che discloses by his answers that he cannot be a fair and impartial juror or will not follow the law as given to him by the court.\u201d Additionally, a prospective juror who has been challenged for cause should be excused \u201cif the court has any doubt as to the juror\u2019s being entirely unbiased.\u201d R.C. 2313.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Again, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting appellant\u2019s challenge for cause against prospective juror Sisley. Sisley stated during <em>voir dire </em>that she could set her personal feelings aside and follow the trial judge\u2019s instructions in this case. Sisley indicated that she could fairly assess the evidence and, if the facts and law dictated, recommend a verdict of life imprisonment. See discussion, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">During <em>voir dire, </em>prospective juror Black mentioned that he had formed opinions concerning appellant\u2019s case based upon what he had previously read in a newspaper. Black also indicated that he was bothered by the fact that a small child had been murdered. However, Black stated that he could impartially decide the case based on the law. Prospective juror Sheets indicated during questioning that he had read about the case in the newspaper. However, Sheets indicated that he would decide the case based solely on what he saw and heard in the courtroom. Likewise, prospective juror Ohde indicated during questioning that he might have formed a \u201clittle bit\u201d of an opinion about the case based on what he had read in the newspaper. However, Ohde indicated that he would decide the case based upon what he saw and heard in the courtroom, and that his exposure to the newspaper accounts of the murders would not be a factor in his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Prospective juror Brokaw had read about the murders in the newspaper and had been exposed to certain information about the case by co-workers. However, Brokaw indicated that his conversations with co-workers and his prior exposure to the media would not affect his ability to hear the case. Brokaw was bothered by the fact that a small child had been murdered. Nevertheless, Brokaw indicated that he could set these feelings aside. At one point, Brokaw indicated that he would not give psychological testimony the same weight as other evidence. However, Brokaw ultimately stated that he would weigh the evidence in accordance with the trial court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Prospective juror Hawk stated that he had read about the case in the newspaper but that he had not formed an opinion based on what he had read. Hawk stated that he believed that not every person who commits a murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>should receive the death penalty, and that he would follow the trial court\u2019s instructions in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertions, we find that none of these prospective jurors met the standard for challenges for cause. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling appellant\u2019s challenge concerning prospective juror Sisley, and did not err in failing to <em>sua sponte </em>remove prospective jurors Black, Sheets, Ohde, Brokaw and Hawk. Moreover, in this proposition, appellant incorrectly asserts that nine biased jurors actually sat on his jury, namely, jurors Miller, McDonald, Nugent, Mills, Connell, Gallwitz, Pritchett, Reese and Wells. However, we have also carefully reviewed the <em>voir dire </em>examination of each of these members of the jury, all of whom indicated through responses to questioning that they could give appellant a fair trial and make a decision based solely on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we reject appellant\u2019s fourth and fifth propositions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">In his sixth proposition of law, appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that Aaron Allard was competent to testify at trial. Evid.R. 601 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">\u201cEvery person is competent to be a witness except:</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">\u201c(A) Those of unsound mind, and children under ten years of age, who appear incapable of receiving just impressions of the facts and transactions respecting which they are examined, or of relating them truly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">In <em>State v. Frazier </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 247, 574 N.E.2d 483, syllabus, we held that \u201c[i]n determining whether a child under ten is competent to testify, the trial court must take into consideration (1) the child\u2019s ability to receive accurate impressions of fact or to observe acts about which he or she will testify, (2) the child\u2019s ability to recollect those impressions or observations, (3) the child\u2019s ability to communicate what was observed, (4) the child\u2019s understanding of truth and falsity and (5) the child\u2019s appreciation of his or her responsibility to be truthful.\u201d A determination of competency is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be reversed on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 250-251, 574 N.E.2d at 486-487. See, also, <em>Schulte v. Schulte </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 41, 43, 641 N.E.2d 719, 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">Aaron was five years old at the time of trial. Before Aaron testified, the trial court conducted a <em>voir dire </em>examination of Aaron to determine competency. The interview with Aaron took place in chambers where defense counsel and the prosecutor had an opportunity to question Aaron. During the interview, Aaron <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>indicated that he knew the difference between telling the truth and telling a lie. He stated that people who do not tell the truth \u201cget in trouble.\u201d He was able to relay his full name, his age, the name of his school, and the names of his friends and his school teacher. At the conclusion of the interview, the trial court found Aaron competent to testify. At trial, Aaron explained what had happened on the night of March 30, 1992. Aaron\u2019s testimony concerning the murders was consistent with the other evidence produced at trial concerning appellant\u2019s crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Appellant contends that Aaron incorporated some facts into his description of the murders which were uncorroborated by other evidence or testimony. For instance, Aaron testified at trial that someone named \u201cElizabeth\u201d was babysitting for him on the night of the crimes. However, even if true, these additional matters to which Aaron testified were largely immaterial to his testimony concerning the murders. Appellant also suggests that some or all of Aaron\u2019s testimony was based on what his grandmother had told him. However, there is no evidence that Aaron spoke to his grandmother concerning the facts of the case. Additionally, Aaron\u2019s testimony does not read as though it were a recapitulation of facts told to him by his grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Aaron\u2019s competency is adequately demonstrated on the record before us. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s determination that Aaron was competent to testify and, therefore, we reject appellant\u2019s sixth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">In his twelfth proposition of law, appellant contends that he was deprived of the effective assistance of trial counsel. We find that appellant has failed to meet his burden of establishing ineffective assistance under the standards set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Our finding in this regard applies to all of the instances of alleged ineffectiveness set forth in appellant\u2019s brief. However, one of the alleged instances of attorney ineffectiveness is deserving of some further comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">Appellant contends that the \u201cpremier example\u201d of attorney ineffectiveness occurred when defense counsel allegedly failed to adequately argue for the suppression of appellant\u2019s entire, videotaped confession with the resulting prejudice that the state was able to introduce a portion of the confession into evidence at trial. Appellant\u2019s argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">On March 31, 1992, appellant confessed to the killings by making a lengthy statement to police. The statement was recorded on two videotapes, <em>ie., </em>appellant\u2019s initial statements to police, and a second statement. Prior to trial, appellant moved to suppress the entire videotaped confession (both videotapes). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>However, at a hearing on the motion, the state indicated that it would not offer the first statement into evidence at trial, even though the trial court found that appellant\u2019s first statement had been voluntarily given. With respect to appellant\u2019s second statement, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, finding that the second statement would be admissible at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">At trial, the defense and prosecution agreed to submit the second statement as a joint exhibit to be played for the jury during the state\u2019s case-in-chief. Appellant\u2019s attorneys prepared a seven-page memorandum to explain their rationale for so doing. The memorandum was submitted to the court and placed under seal. We have reviewed this memorandum and are completely satisfied that the defense attorneys had a sound and objectively reasonable basis for agreeing to the submission of the joint exhibit which, it appears, would not have been introduced into evidence but for the agreement between the state and the defense. Further, the prosecutor\u2019s brief in this case sets forth the following persuasive arguments why the record before us simply does not support a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel:</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">\u201cWhile the State has not seen the \u2018Internal Memorandum\u2019 containing the defense attorney\u2019s rationale for seeking the admission of the tape, the record confirms that counsel employed sound trial strategy in seeking admission of the second video tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">\u201cThe State presented overwhelming evidence that appellant committed two premeditated and calculated murders. Before committing those atrocities, appellant discussed with no less than twelve civilians how, when, and why he was going to kill his wife and children. All twelve testified for the prosecution. Loaded down with overwhelming civilian testimony, a decision was made by the prosecution to jettison anything that might pose a Constitutional snag on appeal. This included appellant\u2019s confessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">\u201cAppellant sought admission of the tape [the second statement] because in light of the overwhelming evidence against him, he had nothing to lose. Through the tape, he would be able to tell the jury his side of the story without having to subject himself to cross-examination. Although appellant made two recorded statements, he was ultimately permitted to select the one which he thought portrayed him in the most favorable light. The defense used the statement to refute the State\u2019s theory that appellant planned his murders. In his final argument during the guilt phase, defense counsel raised as his first line of defense, T can suggest to you that there is evidence, the Joint Exhibit [Number] 83, which raises a question as to whether it was purposeful or intentional or whether it was a reaction, a panic situation * * *.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b657-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>\u201cMoreover, as the proof of prior calculation and design was overwhelming, appellant cannot show that the outcome of the trial would have been different but for admission of the second tape.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">Again, we find that appellant has failed to meet his burden of establishing ineffective assistance of counsel under the standards set forth in <em>Strickland, swpra. </em>Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s twelfth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">In his fourteenth proposition of law, appellant contends that the trial court committed reversible error by allowing the state to introduce into evidence an exhibit that was irrelevant, prejudicial and misleading. Specifically, the subject of appellant\u2019s fourteenth proposition of law concerns a handwritten note found in appellant\u2019s kitch\u00e9'n that contained mail-order information for a set of \u201cMiracle Blade\u201d knives that carried a \u201clifetime no fault guarantee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">During opening statements in the guilt phase, the prosecutor referred to the handwritten note as \u201cone of the most horrifying things\u201d found in appellant\u2019s apartment. However, the handwriting on the note was never analyzed, no investigation was ever conducted to establish that appellant had ordered these knives, and no evidence was presented at trial to link the knives to the murders. The trial court allowed the note to be introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">The court of appeals found that the handwritten note was \u201conly marginally relevant to the issue of prior calculation and design,\u201d but that the evidence was not unfairly prejudicial or misleading. Given the staggering, overwhelming evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt, we agree with the court of appeals\u2019 conclusion that appellant suffered no unfair prejudice from the admission of the handwritten note. Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s fourteenth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">In his fifteenth proposition of law, appellant contends that the trial court erred in allowing the state to present victim impact testimony during the guilt phase. Specifically, appellant complains that several witnesses for the prosecution were permitted to testify that Karen Allard feared appellant. Additionally, appellant claims that the testimony of Bruce Bartley, who had planned to marry Karen, should have been excluded as unduly prejudicial victim impact evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">In <em>Fautenberry, supra, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 440, 650 N.E.2d at 882-883, we stated that \u201c[t]rue victim impact evidence * * * shall be considered by the trial court prior to imposing sentence upon a defendant, not during the guilt phase of the proceedings. Evidence relating to the facts attendant to the offense, however, is clearly admissible during the guilt phase. As a result, we find that evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>which depicts <em>both </em>the circumstances surrounding the commission of the murder and also the impact of the murder on the victim\u2019s family may be admissible during <em>both </em>the guilt and the sentencing phases.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) </em>Here, the testimony concerning Karen\u2019s plan to remarry was relevant to appellant\u2019s motive to commit the murders. The testimony that Karen feared appellant was relevant to the issue of prior calculation and design because it tended to rebut appellant\u2019s assertions that he never intended to harm Karen and that his threats against her were essentially meaningless. In sum, we find that the evidence at issue in this proposition related to the facts attendant to the offenses. Thus, the evidence was clearly admissible, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the testimony at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s fifteenth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">The subject of appellant\u2019s sixteenth proposition of law involves the parade of witnesses \u2014 Wanda Shrimplin, Maude Etler, Cathy Miller, Helen Vance, Bruce Bartley, Carol Slayton, Dawn Schaade, Kenneth Overholt, Mary Martin, and Deborah and Glenn Van Houten \u2014 who testified concerning the threatening and incriminating statements appellant had made prior to the murders. Appellant contends that the testimony was cumulative and unfairly prejudicial, and that the trial court should have excluded the evidence under Evid.R. 403(A). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">Appellant concedes that he failed to object to the testimony of the various witnesses. Thus, his arguments have been waived. Further, appellant\u2019s arguments lack merit. The defense admitted in its opening statement that appellant had killed Karen and Rachael. However, the defense maintained that the murders had not been planned and that appellant had simply panicked when the police had arrived at his door. Thus, the issue at trial was whether appellant had committed the murders with prior calculation and design. In this regard, each of the state\u2019s witnesses testified concerning his or her unique encounters with appellant in the days, weeks, or months preceding the killings. Each witness heard appellant make some statement or comment that had a direct bearing on the issue of prior calculation and design. These statements and comments were highly probative of appellant\u2019s plan to kill, and the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s sixteenth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">X</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">In his seventeenth proposition of law, appellant contends the trial court erred by allowing the state to present evidence of appellant\u2019s bad character where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>appellant had offered no evidence of his good character. See Evid.R. 404. Appellant\u2019s arguments lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">In this proposition, appellant essentially contends that the testimony complained of in his sixteenth proposition of law was not offered to prove any element of the crimes charged but was offered to portray appellant as \u201cmean spirited.\u201d However, the testimony at issue in appellant\u2019s sixteenth proposition of law was clearly offered to demonstrate the element of prior calculation and design. Appellant\u2019s attempt to categorize the testimony as impermissible character evidence is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Additionally, appellant argues that the testimony of fellow inmate William Noel Strouse was particularly damaging evidence of appellant\u2019s bad character. Appellant told Strouse that he (appellant) had cut Aaron\u2019s throat and that Aaron \u201ctalks funny now\u201d as a consequence of the neck wound. Strouse testified that appellant refers to Aaron as \u201csqueaky\u201d because of the way Aaron talks. Appellant also told Strouse that he never intended to kill Aaron. According to appellant, Strouse\u2019s testimony was evidence of appellant\u2019s bad character. We disagree. At trial, the state was required to prove the charge of attempted aggravated murder. As the court of appeals ably recognized, \u201c[ejvidence that appellant later callously referred to Aaron as \u2018Squeaky\u2019 tended to rebut his [appellant\u2019s] claim that he did not intend to kill Aaron.\u201d Moreover, appellant never objected to Strouse\u2019s trial testimony and, thus, the claims of error based upon Strouse\u2019s testimony have been waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s seventeenth proposition of law is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">XI</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">Having considered appellant\u2019s propositions of law, we must now review the death sentences for appropriateness (also raised in appellant\u2019s twenty-fifth proposition of law) and proportionality. Appellant planned to kill his ex-wife and his children. He stabbed Karen to death, slashed Rachael\u2019s throat and stabbed her repeatedly, resulting in Rachael\u2019s death, and then attempted to kill Aaron by slicing Aaron\u2019s throat. Again, we find that the R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) aggravating circumstance of which appellant was found guilty in connection with each count of aggravated murder was proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">In mitigation, appellant presented evidence that he never knew his natural father. Appellant\u2019s natural mother gave appellant up for adoption when he was nineteen months old. Between 1962, at the age of four, and the date of the mitigation hearing, appellant had no contact with his natural mother. Appellant was placed in a series of different foster homes during the first six and one-half years of his life. During this time, appellant was mistreated and physically abused by one of his foster fathers. Appellant also claims that he was sexually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>abused as a child. Records indicate that appellant was a seriously maladjusted child in deep psychological turmoil at the age of two. Appellant lived with one foster family, Mary and John Hall, from the time he was six and one-half years old until he reached adulthood. Appellant was one of four children who lived with the Halls during this period, and three of the four (including appellant) ended up in prison. We assign these elements of appellant\u2019s history and background some, but very modest, weight in mitigation. (R.C. 2929.04[B].)</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Appellant was diagnosed as a diabetic at age sixteen. As an adult, appellant was voluntarily hospitalized at the psychiatric unit of the Knox Community Hospital. He was diagnosed as suffering from a bipolar affective disorder, depressed type, with mood congruent psychotic features, and with antisocial personality traits. Additionally, appellant was diagnosed as suffering from hyperthyroidism. Dr. James Eisenberg, appellant\u2019s court-appointed psychologist, testified that appellant suffers from a manic depressive mood disorder and a borderline personality disorder. Eisenberg opined that appellant was not insane at the time of the murders and that appellant appreciated the wrongfulness of his conduct. According to Eisenberg, appellant\u2019s love/hate relationship with women helps to explain the violence he perpetrated against Karen and Rachael on the night of March 30, 1992, and the violence inflicted on Aaron, who appellant considered to be his former mother-in-law\u2019s favorite grandchild. Eisenberg testified that appellant\u2019s marriage and relationship with Karen was bound to self-destruct, partially based on Karen\u2019s personality disorders.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The evidence in mitigation clearly does not establish the existence of the mitigating factor that appellant lacked a substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law due to a mental disease or defect. See R.C. 2929.04(B)(3). However, we find that appellant\u2019s manic depressive mood disorder and borderline personality disorder as testified to by Dr. Eisenberg are entitled to some weight in mitigation. (R.C. 2929.04[B][7].)</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">In an unsworn statement, appellant apologized for having taken the lives of his ex-wife and his two-year-old daughter, but claimed that he had never intended to kill them. Appellant expressed his love for both of the victims. Appellant stated that he wanted Karen to love him, and that he would never be able to forgive himself for what he had done to Rachael and Aaron. Appellant asked God\u2019s forgiveness, and begged the jury, \u201cplease don\u2019t kill me.\u201d Additionally, appellant made a desperate plea to the jury that he had been denied his rights to a speedy trial. We assign these various matters no weight in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">The evidence at the mitigation hearing also indicated that appellant would be able to adapt to prison life and function well within the conf\u00ednes of the penal system. We assign this evidence very minimal weight in mitigation. (R.C. 2929.04[B][7].)</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>For each of the killings, we have weighed the aggravating circumstance against the evidence presented in mitigation. We find that the aggravating circumstance far outweighs the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Indeed, we find that the evidence presented in mitigation absolutely pales in significance to the weight of the aggravating circumstance at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Finally, we have undertaken a comparison of the death sentences imposed in this ease to those in which we have previously imposed the death penalty. We find that appellant\u2019s death sentences are neither excessive nor disproportionate in comparison. See, <em>e.g., State v. Kinley </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 491, 651 N.E.2d 419; <em>State v. Montgomery </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 410, 575 N.E.2d 167; and <em>State v. Moreland </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 58, 552 N.E.2d 894.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b661-9\">Moyer, C.J., Tyack, Resnick, F.E.
