Since <em>Sturges v. Longworth </em>(1853), 1 Ohio St. 544, we have approved of a court of common pleas\u2019 appointing a guardian <em>ad litem, </em>literally a guardian for the case, who has no duties prior to the institution of a suit or after its termination but whose sole duty is to defend in a particular cause. Civ.R. 17(B) authorizes a court, as incident to its power to try a case, to order the appointment of a guardian <em>ad litem. </em>Robinson\u2019s remedy was appeal from that order. Mandamus will not issue where, as here, there was an adequate remedy at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-15\">The judgment of the court of appeals is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-16\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
