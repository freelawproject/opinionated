S.Ct.Prac.R. X(5). A decision of a board of elections will be set aside and a writ of mandamus -will issue to compel placement of Hawkins\u2019s name on the March 19 ballot if the board engaged in fraud, corruption, abuse of discretion or clear disregard of statutes or applicable legal provisions. <em>State ex rel. Rife v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 632, 633-634, 640 N.E.2d 522, 523-524. Hawkins asserts that the board abused its discretion and acted in clear disregard of R.C. 311.01 in determining that he was not eligible to be a candidate for sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">The board determined that Hawkins did not satisfy R.C. 311.01(B), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">\u201cOn and after January 1, 1988, except as otherwise provided in this section, no person is eligible to be a candidate for sheriff and no person shall be elected or appointed to- the office of sheriff unless that person meets all of the following requirements:</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\"><em>(6 </em>\u2021 <em>%</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">\u201c(9) Has at least five years of full-time law enforcement experience in which the duties were related to the enforcement of statutes, ordinances, or codes and <em>has at least two years of supervisory experience or its equivalent * * </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">The paramount consideration in construing a statute is legislative intent. <em>State ex rel. Zonders v. Delaware Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 5, 8, 630 N.E.2d 313, 315. In determining legislative intent, courts review the statute\u2019s language and the purpose to the accomplished. <em>State ex rel. Herman v. Klopfleisch </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 581, 584, 651 N.E.2d 995, 997.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-13\">At issue here is the R.C. 311.01(B)(9) requirement that candidates for sheriff have \u201cat least two years supervisory experience or its equivalent.\u201d Words used in a statute must be accorded their usual, normal or customary meaning. <em>Id., </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 584, 651 N.E.2d at 998. \u201cSupervisor\u201d is defined, \u201c[i]n a broad sense, [as] one having authority over others, to superintend and direct.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6 Ed.1990) 1438. \u201cExperience\u201d is a \u201cword implying skill, facility, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>or practical wisdom gained by personal knowledge, feeling, and action, and also the course or process by which one attains knowledge or wisdom.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">In applying these definitions to the case at bar, we are further guided by the precept that courts must liberally construe in favor of the person seeking to hold office R.C. 311.01(B)\u2019s limitation on the right to be an eligible candidate for sheriff, so as not to restrict the right of electors to choose from all qualified candidates. <em>State ex rel. Altiere v. Trumbull Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 164, 165, 602 N.E.2d 613, 614; <em>State ex rel. Hayburn v. Kiefer </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 132, 134, 624 N.E.2d 699, 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The evidence introduced at the hearing indicates that Hawkins directed the actions of others when he was a patrolman, deputy sheriff, and security supervisor. Several of Hawkins\u2019s co-workers stated in affidavits that he performed supervisory duties at his various jobs. Conversely, the protestors relied on evidence which suggested that Hawkins never held a rank or position denoting that he was a supervisor when he was a patrolman and deputy sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">However, the mere fact that Hawkins failed to hold a \u201crank\u201d specifying supervisor status did not preclude him from performing duties which constituted supervisory experience or its equivalent when he was a patrolman and deputy sheriff. Hawkins directed the actions of inmate trustees, auxiliary police officers, and, on occasion, other police officers, although his jobs as patrolman and deputy sheriff were not supervisory, based solely on his position or rank. R.C. 311.01(B)(9) also does not require that Hawkins\u2019s two years of supervisory experience or its equivalent be full-time. If the General Assembly had intended that the supervisory experience requirement be full-time, it would have so specified as it did for R.C. 311.01(B)(9)\u2019s \u201cfive years of full-time law enforcement experience\u201d requirement. See <em>State ex rel. Kelly v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 413, 639 N.E.2d 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">In that Hawkins met the R.C. 311.01(B)(9) \u201ctwo years of supervisory experience or its equivalent\u201d requirement, the board abused its discretion and clearly disregarded R.C. 311.01(B)(9) in sustaining the protests. Contrary to the view of Buckeye State Sheriffs Association, there was no \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d that successfully rebutted the evidence introduced by Hawkins. Hawkins possesses no adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law to rectify the board\u2019s action. He is entitled to a writ of mandamus to compel the board to certify his candidacy for the Republican Party nomination for Pickaway County Sheriff and placement on the March 19 primary election ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">Based on the foregoing, it is unnecessary to resolve Hawkins\u2019s alternative claim that the R.C. 311.01(B) requirements for candidates for sheriff are unconstitutional. See <em>State ex rel. Fenley v. Kyger </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 164, 166-167, 648 N.E.2d 493, 495. In that the Secretary of State was named as a respondent only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>as to the constitutional claim, his motion to dismiss the claim against him is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">Accordingly, we grant a writ of mandamus compelling the board to place Hawkins\u2019s name on the March 19 primary election ballot for the office of Sheriff of Pickaway County.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">\n<em>Writ granted in part and cause dismissed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b437-6\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b437-7\">Resnick and Cook, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b437-8\">Cook, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A8f\">dissenting. I respectfully dissent. I construe the two requirements in R.C. 311.01(B)(9) (at least five years of full-time law enforcement experience <em>and </em>two years of supervisory experience or its equivalent) to reflect the legislative intent that the candidate have full-time experience supervising law enforcement officers, as will be required of a sheriff, if elected. Relator\u2019s evidence did not meet the requirements and, thus, the board acted properly in declining to certify his candidacy.</p>\n<judges id=\"b437-9\">Resnick, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
