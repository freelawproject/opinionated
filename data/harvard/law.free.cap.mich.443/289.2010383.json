Three bank tellers, the branch manager, and a customer witnessed the robbery and gave descriptions of the robber and his car to investigators. In addition, photographs of the robber were taken by the bank\u2019s surveillance camera. The photographs matched the descriptions given by the eyewitnesses: The perpetrator was a heavy, white man wearing a baseball cap, a short-sleeved shirt, and jeans, and he had a wallet attached to a chain extending from a belt or belt loop, commonly referred to as a trucker\u2019s wallet.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">After two of the surveillance photographs were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>published in a local newspaper a few days after the crime, the St. Clair County Sheriff\u2019s Department received several phone calls regarding the robbery. At least one caller identified defendant Albin Kurylczyk as the man in the photographs. This information prompted a detective and an fbi agent to visit defendant at his home on August 17, 1988. At their request, defendant permitted the officers to search his house and his car, which was similar to the getaway car described by the eyewitnesses. He also agreed to accompany the investigators to the local police station for further interviews. Once there, he consented to be photographed by the detective. At that time, he was not represented by counsel, nor did he make any request for counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">On the same day that defendant was being interviewed, other deputies responded to a call from the bank. Two of the tellers believed the robber may have returned when a customer, dressed like the robber, entered the bank and attempted to exchange some Canadian currency. The tellers detained him by delaying his transaction until the deputies arrived. However, after an investigation, the law enforcement authorities were satisfied that this customer was not the bank robber. He was not included in any of the subsequent identification procedures that are challenged in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Two days later, on August 19, the detective assembled an array of six photographs, including the photograph he had taken of defendant and one of another suspect. The array was shown to two of the five eyewitnesses, bank tellers Mary Kamendat and Cindy Dortman. Both identified defendant Kurylczyk as the bank robber. As a result, defendant was arrested and arraigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Following the arraignment on August 20, 1988, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>as he was being led from the courthouse, defendant\u2019s photograph was taken by a news reporter. This photograph, a close-up shot of defendant\u2019s face, later appeared in color on the front page of the local newspaper.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">On August 26, 1988, after publication of the color photograph in the newspaper, defendant participated in a corporeal lineup, at which he was represented by counsel. All six men in the lineup wore \"jail greens\u201d \u2014 standard issue pants for individuals being held in jail \u2014 and light blue short-sleeved shirts. The five witnesses from the bank were taken separately into the lineup room to view the men. Each witness identified defendant as the robber, and each provided in writing her reasons for making that identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Before trial, defendant moved to exclude the identification testimony of the eyewitnesses. A <em>Wade </em>hearing was conducted,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> at which defendant first argued that the photograph identification procedure was tainted. He claimed that the arrangement and size of the pictures caused his photograph to stand out from the others. Pointing to the publication in the newspaper of the bank\u2019s surveillance photograph, defendant argued that the witnesses had relied on the published photograph, rather than on their own memories of the actual robbery. Finally, defendant contended that the photographic lineup was defective because he was not then represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Defendant next argued that the corporeal lineup was also tainted. As with the array of photographs, he claimed that he was singled out from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>the others by his clothing and appearance. In addition, he asserted that publication in the local newspaper of the surveillance photographs and the postarraignment photograph had rendered defective the identifications made by witnesses at the corporeal lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The trial court denied the motion, finding that neither the photographic lineup nor the corporeal lineup was impermissibly suggestive; indeed, the trial judge stated that he was \"astounded\u201d at the similarity of the individual participants in both lineups and concluded that the pretrial identification process had not been improperly affected by the published photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">At trial, all five eyewitnesses testified regarding their pretrial identifications of defendant, and each also identified defendant in court as the person who robbed the bank. Defendant testified in his own defense and presented testimony by neighbors and business acquaintances in support of an alibi defense and his reputation for truthfulness. Defendant also presented expert testimony regarding the nature of eyewitness identifications and the likelihood of erroneous identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">The jury convicted defendant of the bank robbery and felony-firearm charges. Subsequently, he pleaded guilty to a second felony habitual offender charge,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and was sentenced to ten to forty years imprisonment and to a two-year consecutive term for the felony-firearm conviction. The Court of Appeals affirmed in an unpublished per curiam opinion. This Court then granted leave to appeal. 439 Mich 1002 (1992).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>__</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Defendant presents two challenges to the photographic lineup that was conducted before his arrest. First, he contends that he was entitled to the assistance of counsel during the photographic lineup. Second, he argues that the photographic lineup was impermissibly suggestive in violation of his Fourteenth Amendment right of due process. We shall consider each of these challenges in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees one who has been criminally accused the right \"to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d This right is not limited to the formal trial, but extends to all \" 'critical\u2019 stages\u201d of the criminal proceeding. <em>United States v Wade, </em>388 US 218, 224; 87 S Ct 1926; 18 L Ed 2d 1149 (1967). For example, a person accused of a crime has the right to counsel at certain pretrial arraignments, <em>Powell v Alabama, </em>287 US 45; 53 S Ct 55; 77 L Ed 158 (1932), or during custodial interrogations, <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966). Indeed, \"the accused is guaranteed that he need not stand alone against the State at any stage of the prosecution, formal or informal, in court or out, where counsel\u2019s absence might derogate from the accused\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>Wade, </em>388 US 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">In <em>Wade, </em>the Court referred to the postindictment corporeal lineup as a \"confrontation compelled by the State between the accused and the victim or witnesses to a crime,\u201d 388 US 228, and ruled that it is a critical stage of the prosecution at which the accused is as much entitled to the aid of counsel as at the trial itself. 388 US 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Six years later, the Court determined that \"the Sixth Amendment does not grant the right to counsel at photographic displays conducted by the Government for the purpose of allowing a witness to attempt an identification of the offender.\u201d <em>United States v Ash, </em>413 US 300, 321; 93 S Ct 2568; 37 L Ed 2d 619 (1973). Noting that the accused is not present at such a photographic display, the Court compared this procedure to \"the prosecutor\u2019s other interviews with the victim or other witnesses before trial.\u201d 413 US 325. The Court was \"not persuaded that the risks inherent in the use of photographic displays are so pernicious that an extraordinary system of safeguards is required.\u201d 413 US 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">Although the United States Supreme Court decisions do not require counsel at a photographic lineup, defendant argues that decisions of this Court do impose such a requirement. He maintains that Michigan courts have been more suspicious of photographic identifications than the federal courts, and have therefore imposed greater safeguards regarding their use.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Defendant relies primarily on our decision in <em>People v Franklin Anderson, </em>389 Mich 155; 205 NW2d 461 (1973). There, this Court extensively reviewed numerous cases from other jurisdictions, as well as the psychological literature regarding photographic identifications and concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">there are serious problems concerning the accuracy of eyewitness identification and that real prospects for error inhere in the very process of identification completely independent of the subjective accuracy, completeness or good faith of witnesses. [389 Mich 180.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Because of the Court\u2019s distrust of photographic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>identification procedures, two rules were established regarding their use:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-4\">1. <em>Subject to certain exceptions, identification by photograph should not be used where the accused is in custody.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-5\"><em>2. Where there is a legitimate reason to use photographs for identification of an in-custody accused, he has the right to counsel as much as he would for corporeal identification procedures. </em>[389 Mich 186-187. Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">As clearly indicated, these rules are triggered when a defendant is in custody. In this case, defendant was not in custody; however, he argues that the requirement of counsel applies to the photographic lineup conducted before his arrest. He asserts that subsequent decisions of this Court and the Court of Appeals have extended the <em>Franklin Anderson </em>counsel requirement to a defendant who is the focus of a police investigation, regardless of whether he is in custody.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Various Court of Appeals decisions have held that counsel is required at a photographic lineup when the suspect is the focus of a police investigation. See, e.g., <em>People v DeMeyers, </em>183 Mich App 286; 454 NW2d 202 (1990); <em>People v Johnson (On Remand), </em>180 Mich App 423; 447 NW2d 800 (1989); <em>People v McFadden, </em>159 Mich App 796; 407 NW2d 78 (1987). These decisions stem from an earlier Court of Appeals decision, <em>People v Cotton, </em>38 Mich App 763; 197 NW2d 90 (1972). In <em>Cotton, </em>the Court of Appeals considered a challenge to a pretrial photographic identification on the basis that the defendant was not represented by counsel. Relying on prior federal and state cases, the Court held that an accused being <em>held in custody </em>is entitled to counsel at any photographic identification proceeding. 38 Mich App 768. However, the Court was careful to note that this right normally was limited \"to situations where the accused is in custody at the time.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Despite its conclusion that the counsel requirement usually was limited to in-custody lineups, the Court refused to \"exclude the possibility that under unusual circumstances a suspect may have a right to counsel during a pretrial photographic identification though at the time he is not in custody.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 769. It concluded that such \"unusual circumstances\u201d were presented in the case before it: Although the defendant was not in custody at the time of the challenged lineup, he previously had been arrested and had been taken into custody. Further, two lineups had been conducted while h\u00e9 was in custody, and he had been given the advice of counsel during those lineups. Finally, his car had been impounded for inspection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>by investigators. Under those circumstances, the Court determined that the police could not strip the defendant of his right to counsel by releasing him from custody just before the photographic display:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-5\">Turning to the photographic display in the present case, we are of the opinion that this was no longer an in-the-field identification. Its purpose was to build a case against the defendant by eliciting identification evidence, not to extinguish a case against an innocent bystander. <em>[Id. </em>at 769-770.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The focus test articulated in <em>Cotton </em>has never been applied by this Court to a precustodial, investigatory photographic identification. In a nonbinding opinion signed by only two justices, <em>People v Kachar, </em>400 Mich 78; 252 NW2d 807 (1977),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the focus test from <em>Cotton </em>was adopted; however, in that case, the defendant already had been arrested, bound over for trial, and placed in custody before the contested lineup. In contrast, defendant Kurylczyk was not taken into custody before the photographic array. Although, clearly, he was a prime suspect, he was not the only suspect. Moreover, at that point no one had made a positive identification of defendant as the robber.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Defendant Kurylczyk\u2019s situation more closely resembles the situation of the defendant in <em>People v Lee, </em>391 Mich 618; 218 NW2d 655 (1974). There, we considered the necessity of counsel at a precustodial photographic lineup conducted as part of an ongoing investigation. The defendant was selected as the robber from an eight-photograph display shown to an eyewitness several days after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>robbery. Police suspected that Lee was the robber because the clothing he was wearing in a police photograph matched the clothing reported to have been worn by the robber. On appeal, Lee argued that the <em>Franklin Anderson </em>requirement of counsel at a photographic lineup attached at the moment that he became the focus of the police investigation. We disagreed. In a unanimous decision, we refused to apply the requirement of counsel to the \"pre-custody, pre-questioning, mere suspicion phase that was evidenced here.\u201d 391 Mich 625. We reiterated that \"[i]t is the fact of custody that requires implementation of the <em>Franklin Anderson </em>rule . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>citing <em>People v James Anderson, </em>391 Mich 419, 422; 216 NW2d 780 (1974). Because Lee had not been detained by the police, we concluded that it simply was \"not feasible to require appointment of counsel . . . .\u201d 391 Mich 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">The facts of <em>Lee </em>are similar to the facts in this case. On the basis of various sources of information, defendant Kurylczyk, like defendant Lee, was a primary suspect in a police investigation of a robbery. As in <em>Lee, </em>defendant Kurylczyk had not previously been arrested, had not yet been identified by any witness as the robber, and was not the only suspect whom the police were investigating. Although the police had more inculpatory evidence against Kurylczyk at the time of his photographic array than the police in <em>Lee </em>had against their suspect, the detectives in this case had not narrowed their investigation only to Kurylczyk. In the photographic array shown to the witnesses, the photograph of another suspect was included in addition to the photograph of defendant Kurylczyk. Moreover, on the very day that defendant was being interviewed, police were called back to the bank to investigate another potential suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Under these circumstances, the appointment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>counsel is neither necessary nor feasible. At the early stage of an investigation of an unsolved crime, investigators cannot predict whether a witness will recognize a particular suspect as the perpetrator of that crime. Thus, it is impossible to know whether a photographic array will help to \"build a case against the defendant\u201d or will \"extinguish a case against an innocent bystander.\u201d <em>Cotton, supra, </em>38 Mich App 769-770. Often, the distinction between those two courses of action is apparent only after an eyewitness has made, or failed to make, an identification. For this reason, we agree with the unanimous decision in <em>Lee </em>that counsel is not required at precustodial, investigatory photographic lineups like the one that was used in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">Defense counsel\u2019s argument that the right to counsel attaches once \"an investigation has focused\u201d on a particular suspect is an inaccurate one, insofar as it is supposed to refer to \"precustody\u201d investigations. [391 Mich 625.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">In the case of photographic identifications, the right of counsel attaches with custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Defendant next argues that the photographic array shown to the witnesses was unduly suggestive violating his right of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Stovall v Denno, </em>388 US 293; 87 S Ct 1967; 18 L Ed 2d 1199 (1967); <em>Franklin Anderson, supra </em>at 169; <em>Wade, supra, </em>388 US 228. In order to sustain a due process challenge, a defendant must show that the pretrial identification procedure was so suggestive in light of the totality of the circumstances that it led to a substantial likelihood of misidentification. <em>Neil v Big</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number><em>gers, </em>409 US 188, 196; 93 S Ct 375; 34 L Ed 2d 401 (1972); see also <em>Lee, supra, </em>391 Mich 626. If the trial court finds that the pretrial procedure was impermissibly suggestive, testimony concerning that identification is inadmissible at trial. However, in-court identification by the same witness still may be allowed if an independent basis for in-court identification can be established that is untainted by the suggestive pretrial procedure. <em>Franklin Anderson, supra, </em>389 Mich 168-169.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">On review, the trial court\u2019s decision to admit identification evidence will not be reversed unless it is clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 169; <em>People v Burrell, </em>417 Mich 439, 448; 339 NW2d 403 (1983). Clear error exists when the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Id. </em>at 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Defendant Kurylczyk argues that the pretrial photographic array used to identify him was impermissibly suggestive because various characteristics of his photograph caused him to be singled out from the other men. He argues that he is the only man in the photographic array who was dressed in clothing that matches the clothing reported to have been worn by the robber. Particularly obvious in defendant\u2019s photograph is a chain attached to his belt and extending to a wallet in the rear pocket of his jeans. None of the others in the photographic lineup wore a trucker\u2019s wallet. Moreover, this wallet was plainly visible in the bank\u2019s surveillance photographs that were published in the local paper. In addition, defendant complains that his photograph was taken from a closer distance, so that his image appears larger than the others, and the background appears to be a different color. Finally, defendant points out that three of the men in the array have mustaches; defendant does not have a mustache, and none of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>witnesses described the robber as having a mustache. According to defendant, these features created a substantial likelihood of misidentification precluding the admission of any testimony regarding the photographic array. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">\"Generally, the photo spread is not suggestive as long as it contains some photographs that are fairly representative of the defendant\u2019s physical features and thus sufficient to reasonably test the identification.\u201d Sobel, Eyewitness Identification, \u00a7 5.3(a), pp 5-9 to 5-10. Thus, differences in the composition of photographs,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in the physical characteristics of the individuals photographed,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or in the clothing worn by a defendant and the others pictured in a photographic lineup<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>found not to render a lineup impermissibly suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">However, a court will find that a witness\u2019 identification of a defendant was the product of an improper photographic identification if differences in the photographs led to a substantial likelihood of misidentification. In such cases, witnesses typically select a defendant on the basis of some external characteristic, rather than on the basis of the defendant\u2019s looks. For example, in <em>Commonwealth v Thornley, </em>406 Mass 96; 546 NE2d 350 (1989), the defendant was the only man of thirteen men depicted in a photographic array who was wearing glasses. The court found that the array was impermissibly suggestive because the witnesses admitted selecting the photograph on the basis of the glasses.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Similarly, in <em>Henry v State, </em>519 So 2d 84 (Fla App, 1988), the witness testified that a patch on the defendant\u2019s clothing was a factor in his selection of the defendant from the photographic array. The patch, combined with other factors, \"created an unnecessarily suggestive identification procedure and so taints the lineup ... as to give rise to a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d 519 So 2d 86. See also <em>State v Davis, </em>176 W Va 454; 345 SE2d 549 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>In analyzing defendant\u2019s claim, we do not question his contention that his photograph stood out from the others in a suggestive fashion. It is obvious from examining the photographs that defendant\u2019s photograph was distinct, particularly because he is wearing a trucker\u2019s wallet in the photograph. However, a suggestive lineup is not necessarily a constitutionally defective one. Rather, a suggestive lineup is improper only if under the totality of the circumstances there is a substantial likelihood of misidentification. <em>Lee, supra </em>at 626. The relevant inquiry, therefore, is not whether the lineup photograph was suggestive, but whether it was unduly suggestive in light of all of the circumstances surrounding the identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">When examining the totality of the circumstances, courts look at a variety of factors to determine the likelihood of misidentification. Some of the relevant factors were outlined in <em>Neil v Biggers, supra </em>at 199-200:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">As indicated by our cases, the factors to be considered in evaluating the likelihood of misidentification include the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness\u2019 degree of attention, the accuracy of the witness\u2019 prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of time between the crime and the confrontation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Analyzing the relevant factors in this case, we hold that the trial court did not clearly err when it found that there was no substantial likelihood of misidentification during this photographic array.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">First, although neither Ms. Kamendat nor Ms. Dortman saw defendant before the day of the robbery, both had ample opportunity to view the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>robber during the offense. Mary Kamendat testified that she viewed the robber for a period of three to four minutes, from a distance of as little as one and one-half feet. She did not lose sight of the robber, saw both a front and a side view of him, and watched him as he walked out of the bank. Cindy Dortman occupied the teller station next to Mary Kamendat. She testified at the <em>Wade </em>hearing that she also had a good look at the robber and that she watched him as he left the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">Second, both witnesses provided a detailed description of the robber to the police shortly after the crime was committed. Ms. Kamendat described the robber as approximately forty-five or forty-six years old, almost six feet tall, weighing about 210 pounds, with dust or some other substance on his face. She also described him as either wearing a wig or needing a haircut. Cindy Dortman noticed that the robber was wearing a light-colored shirt, a baseball cap, dark sunglasses, and had longer hair than normal for a man of his age. She also described him as wearing flared jeans, with a chain hanging out of his pocket and his shirt pulled over his pants. She noted that the robber had a \"long, very distinguished\u201d nose. These descriptions comport with the image of the robber as seen in the surveillance photographs, and with the image of defendant as he appears in the photographic array.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Third, both Kamendat and Dortman testified that they were certain that defendant was the robber.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Fourth, the photographic array was conducted within two weeks of the bank robbery. Courts have held that delays as long as eighteen months after a crime do not invalidate an eyewitness identifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>tion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The relatively short span of time between the robbery and the lineup in this case does not reduce the reliability of the lineup identifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Finally, there is no evidence that the tellers were panicked or otherwise psychologically debilitated by the crime. Carolyn Schultz, branch manager of the bank, testified that the tellers were trained to react in this type of situation and that they did react calmly to the robbery:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">They have a description sheet that they have to write down what they remember and they did not talk to one another before they did this. They wrote down anything they could remember about the suspect and remained very quite [sic: quiet] and very calm until the police got there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">One factor that tends to undermine the reliability of the photographic array identification is the misidentification several days after the robbery of a bank customer as the robber. As already noted, for a brief period, Dortman and Kamendat thought the robber had returned to the bank. However, the record indicates that, at most, their identification of the customer as the robber was tentative. Neither Kamendat nor Dortman ever positively identified this customer as the man who robbed the bank. Rather, Kamendat testified that she was caught off guard and overreacted when she saw a man who appeared to be the size of the robber, and who was dressed like the robber, with a chain on his belt that reached into a bag. However, after reviewing the incident in her mind later that day, she came to the conclusion that the customer was not the robber. At trial she testified that she never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>told investigators that he was the robber \u2014 <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> only that she and the other tellers felt \"he looked alike [sic: a lot] like him, it would be worth looking into.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Dortman testified that she told a deputy that the customer was the same size as the robber and had other similarities to the robber, including the chain hanging out of his pocket. Her primary concern, however, was that this customer\u2019s transaction involved the exchange of Canadian currency.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Where there are other indicia of reliability, an initial inability to identify the defendant or a tentative false identification of another person will not invalidate a witness\u2019 identification of the defendant. See <em>Carter, supra, </em>415 Mich 600; <em>People v Pennington, </em>113 Mich App 688, 694; 318 NW2d 542 (1982); <em>United States v Briggs, </em>700 F2d 408, 413 (CA 7, 1983), cert den 462 US 1110 (1983); <em>Clements v State, </em>521 So 2d 1378 (Ala Crim App, 1988). In this case, the opportunities afforded these witnesses to view the perpetrator, the accuracy of their descriptions of the robber, and the confidence with which they identified defendant as the robber provided sufficient indicia of reliability to allow submission of the evidence to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">It is also argued that the identification at the photographic lineup of defendant by the five eyewitnesses was improperly influenced by the publication in the local newspaper of the surveillance photographs. Generally, the use of such surveillance photographs to identify a subject is not impermissibly suggestive, \"since such films provide a memory-refreshing device, showing 'the man who actually committed the robbery\u2019 as opposed to the picture of 'some possible suspect in the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>files.\u2019 \u201d Sobel, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5.3(g), p 5-44. However, in this case, Kamendat did not remember seeing the chain attached to the trucker\u2019s wallet during the robbery. She saw it for the first time in the surveillance photographs. Thus, the appearance of the surveillance photographs served not only to refresh her memory of the robbery, but to enhance it. More important, when Kamendat earlier misidentified a bank customer as the robber, her mistake was based primarily on the fact that the customer wore a trucker\u2019s wallet. Likewise, Dortman also saw the surveillance photographs in which the robber\u2019s trucker\u2019s wallet was plainly visible.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Despite the potential suggestive influence of the surveillance photographs, as well as the suggestiveness of the defendant\u2019s lineup photograph, we conclude that defendant has not demonstrated clear error by the trial court. Nothing in the record supports a conclusion that there was a substantial likelihood of misidentification at the photographic array as a result of any suggestive influences. For example, there is no testimony by either teller that her identification of defendant\u2019s photograph was made on the basis of her examination of the surveillance photographs. In fact, each witness testified that the photographs had no effect on her ability to identify defendant as the robber.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Just as important, in contrast to the cases cited earlier, no testimony was elicited from the witnesses indicating that they chose defendant\u2019s photograph because of the suggestive features of his photograph. See <em>Commonwealth v Thornley </em>and <em>Henry v State, supra. </em>Instead, the record contains the sworn testimony of two trained bank tellers who stated that they were certain that they recognized defendant as the man who robbed the bank. Surely this testimony, along with the other factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>noted above, permitted the trial court to conclude that the tellers would have recognized defendant as the robber, regardless of the suggestive features of his photograph or the publication of the surveillance photographs. Therefore, the identification testimony of the tellers regarding the photographic array was properly admitted as evidence at trial. Because the photographic array was not impermissibly suggestive, it did not taint the subsequent in-court identifications by the tellers.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Defendant also argues that the corporeal lineup was impermissibly suggestive because he was singled out from the other participants by his appearance. As earlier noted, five eyewitnesses viewed the corporeal lineup \u2014 Mary Kamendat, Cindy Dortman, Shirley Smith, Gladys Caris, and Carolyn Schultz. Each identified defendant as the bank robber. The participants in this lineup wore similar attire \u2014 -jail greens and short-sleeved shirts. Defendant complains that he appeared more disheveled than the others because he had been wearing the same clothing for several days in jail and because he had not been allowed to shave while in jail. In addition, he challenges the lineup because three of the participants had mustaches, despite the fact that none of the witnesses described the bank robber as having a mustache. He also argues that it was improper that only three of the lineup participants (including defendant) had appeared in the photographic array. Finally, he argues that the lineup was tainted by the publication of the surveillance and postarraignment photographs in a local newspaper.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Like a photographic lineup, the suggestiveness of a corporeal lineup must be examined in light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>the totality of the circumstances. <em>Stovall, supra </em>at 302. As a general rule, \"physical differences between a suspect and other lineup participants do not, in and of themselves, constitute impermissible suggestiveness . . . .\u201d <em>People v Benson, </em>180 Mich App 433, 438; 447 NW2d 755 (1989), rev\u2019d in part on other grounds 434 Mich 903 (1990). Differences among participants in a lineup</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\">are significant only to the extent they are apparent to the witness and substantially distinguish defendant from the other participants in the lineup. ... It is then that there exists a substantial likelihood that the differences among line-up participants, rather than recognition of defendant, was the basis of the witness\u2019 identification. <em>[People v James, </em>184 Mich App 457, 466; 458 NW2d 911 (1990), vacated on other grounds 437 Mich 988; 469 NW2d 294 (1991).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Thus, in <em>People v Holmes, </em>132 Mich App 730, 746; 349 NW2d 230 (1984), where the defendant was the second tallest participant in the lineup and heavier than others, the lineup was not impermissibly suggestive because the defendant\u2019s appearance was substantially similar to that of the other participants. In <em>People v Horton, </em>98 Mich App 62, 67-68; 296 NW2d 184 (1980), the lineup was not impermissibly suggestive despite alleged age and height differences between the defendant and the other participants and despite the fact that the defendant was the only participant with a visibly scarred face. A lineup in which the defendant was the only participant with both a mustache and a goatee was found to be not impermissibly suggestive in <em>People v Hughes, </em>24 Mich App 223; 180 NW2d 66 (1970).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Like the viewing of surveillance photographs, the publication of photographs of a defendant does not taint a subsequent lineup where the witness\u2019 identification is not unduly influenced by the published photographs. See <em>People v Barnett, </em>163 Mich App 331; 414 NW2d 378 (1987); <em>People v Prast (On Rehearing), </em>114 Mich App 469; 319 NW2d 627 (1982).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Upon review of the record, we conclude that the trial court did not err when it found that testimony regarding the identifications made by Mary Kamendat, Cindy Dortman, Shirley Smith, and Gladys Caris was admissible. A photograph of the corporeal lineup shows six men of approximately the same age, height, and weight. None of the men stands out from the others in an impermissibly suggestive fashion. Moreover, according to their written notes at the lineup, none of these four witnesses chose defendant because she saw the surveillance or postarraignment photographs that were published in the newspaper or because of his disheveled appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Mary Kamendat wrote that defendant was the \"[s]ame size, height. Looks like the man from what I remember. Stands like him.\u201d Cindy Dortman based her selection of defendant on other factors: \u201d[N]ose size appears large, pointed. Shape of face <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>from side view, height about the same, about six foot. Stomach same size. I put beer belly type.\u201d In describing her reasons for selecting defendant, Gladys Caris wrote: \"[T]he hair length was the same, he\u2019s barreled chested, height, his body build and his facial features . . . those were the items that I felt were the same as the bank robber.\u201d Shirley Smith wrote that defendant \"looked like the same man, same weight, facial hair. Side profile looked very much like I remember from the day of the robbery. You know when you\u2019ve seen someone before. None of the others were even close. With the hat and sunglasses on he looked like an exact match.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Nothing in the record demonstrates a clear error by the trial court when it concluded that the corporeal lineup was not impermissibly suggestive to these four witnesses. Thus, their testimony regarding the corporeal lineup was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The identification testimony of branch manager Schultz requires a separate analysis. Defendant argues, relying on <em>People v Prast, supra, </em>that her lineup and in-court identifications were improperly admitted because they were premised upon her viewing of the bank\u2019s surveillance photographs, rather than upon her observation of the crime. The prosecution agrees on appeal that her testimony should have been disregarded for this reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">On the other hand, the trial court found that the surveillance photographs were not \"unduly influential\u201d in her selection of the defendant. The record reveals that Schultz viewed prints from the surveillance film as well as the surveillance and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>postarraignment photographs published in the newspaper. Although she testified at the <em>Wade </em>hearing that her identification of defendant was not premised upon her viewing of the newspaper photographs, she stated that \"because I did not get a clear view of him, I identified him from the picture my camera took.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">It is not clear from the record whether the surveillance photographs were shown to Mrs. Schultz by law enforcement personnel. Although government conduct in the display of such photographs may be a factor in determining whether due process protection has been violated, see <em>United States v Stubblefield, </em>621 F2d 980, 983 (CA 9, 1980); <em>Commonwealth v Otsuki, </em>411 Mass 218, 235; 581 NE2d 999 (1991), we do not explore that issue because we determine that the error, if any, with respect to the identification of defendant by Schultz was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">MCR 2.613(A) provides that an error in the admission of evidence will not be grounds for setting aside a verdict \"unless refusal to take this action appears to the court inconsistent with substantial justice.\u201d See also MCL 769.26; MSA 28.1096. Accordingly, when testimony is erroneously admitted, we must determine the probable effect of that testimony on the \" 'minds of an average jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>People v Banks, </em>438 Mich 408, 430; 475 NW2d 769 (1991), quoting <em>Schneble v Florida, </em>405 US 427, 432; 92 S Ct 1056; 31 L Ed 2d 340 (1972). Reversal is required if the minds of an average jury would have found the prosecution\u2019s case \" 'significantly less persuasive\u2019 \u201d without the erroneously admitted testimony. <em>Banks, </em>438 Mich 430. However, if it can be shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the testimony did not affect the jury\u2019s verdict, then the erroneous admission of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>testimony is considered to be harmless. <em>People v Robinson, </em>386 Mich 551, 563; 194 NW2d 709 (1972); <em>People v </em>Watkins, 438 Mich 627, 667; 475 NW2d 727 (1991); <em>Franklin Anderson, </em>389 Mich 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Our review of the record in this case demonstrates that the persuasiveness of the prosecutor\u2019s case was unaffected by Schultz\u2019 testimony. The jury heard the testimony of four other eyewitnesses who identified defendant as the robber both before trial and in court. Carolyn Schultz was the least important witness for the prosecution\u2019s case. She observed the robber only from a distance, and only for a few moments. At most, her identification testimony was cumulative of more compelling eyewitness testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">More important, any defects in . the eyewitness identifications were brought out by defendant\u2019s counsel. He vigorously cross-examined the witnesses and attacked their credibility. In addition, he presented the testimony of Harvey Schulmann, Ph.D., a psychologist who specializes in human memory, attention, and perception, to discredit the reliability of eyewitness identifications. Dr. Schulmann claimed that between twenty and fifty percent of all eyewitness identifications are incorrect, and that a number of factors, such as the passage of time, poor viewing conditions, and age of the witness, may increase the error rate. He also testified that the confidence of an eyewitness bears no relationship to the accuracy of an identification. In light of the jury\u2019s decision to convict despite the vigorous defense presented by defendant, we conclude that the exclusion of identification testimony of relative unimportance would have had no effect on the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Our conclusion of harmless error is strongly supported by evidence presented that did not relat\u00e9 to identification. For example, defendant offered the testimony of three alibi witnesses who stated that he was with them at the time of the robbery; however, the alibi was weakened by the admission that he originally lied to investigators concerning his whereabouts at the time of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Similarly, defendant\u2019s testimony regarding his car was suspect. Evidence was presented that defendant owned a car virtually identical to the car described by the eyewitnesses as the robber\u2019s car. Defendant admitted that he stopped driving his car shortly after the robbery. He claimed that the car was malfunctioning, but evidence at trial showed that defendant\u2019s car had no mechanical problems. In addition, evidence was presented that the license plate on defendant\u2019s car was on a hinge which allowed the plate to be lifted up when filling the gas tank. Defendant\u2019s license plate would stick in this position, just as the robber\u2019s license plate was stuck in this position during the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Finally, the jury was allowed to examine various pieces of physical evidence \u2014 the bank\u2019s surveillance photographs, the photograph of defendant that appeared in the photographic array, and the defendant\u2019s clothing, which the state alleged he wore during the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">This untainted evidence is sufficient to support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury\u2019s verdict was not affected by admission of the identification testimony of Carolyn Schultz. The prosecutor\u2019s case would have been equally persuasive with or without this testimony. For this reason, any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">In conclusion, we hold that the trial court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to exclude evidence of the photographic and corporeal lineup identifications. We also hold that any error in the identification testimony of Carolyn Schultz was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

While it is arguable that the police could have compelled defendant\u2019s participation in a corporeal lineup by arresting him, defendant does not advance such an argument. In fact, defendant concedes that there would be numerous problems with a rule requiring police officers to arrest a suspect as soon as probable cause is established simply because they wanted to obtain some sort of identification.

First, defendant has, minimally, the burden of coming forward on this issue, and there is no record basis indicating impermissible police conduct. <em>Commonwealth v Otsuki, </em>411 Mass 218, 233; 581 NE2d 999 (1991). Defendant contends that the witness\u2019 statement implies that she was shown photographs. However, the witness merely stated, \"I identified [the defendant] from the picture my camera took.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">Second, even assuming that law enforcement officials showed Mrs. Schultz the picture that \"her camera took,\u201d due process would be offended only if the police had done something that \"was so suggestive in light of the totality of the circumstances that it led to a substantial likelihood of misidentification,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 302, citing <em>Neil v Biggers, </em>409 US 188, 196; 93 S Ct 375; 34 L Ed 2d 401 (1972). Unlike situations where the police are alleged to have manipulated a photographic display or photo opportunity to persuade the witness to misidentify a targeted subject, in the instant case, there is no record basis indicating \"pressure on the witness to acquiesce\u201d in the identification of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>the defendant. <em>Manson v Brathwaite, </em>432 US 98, 116; 97 S Ct 2243; 53 L Ed 2d 140 (1977). The surveillance photograph was of the actual perpetrator. \"Little possibility of misidentification arises from the use of photographs depicting 'the likeness not of some possible suspect in the police files, but of the [person] who actually committed the robbery.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v Stubblefield, </em>621 F2d 980, 983 (CA 9, 1980). The identification by the witness was based on her appraisal of the defendant\u2019s resemblance to the surveillance photograph image of the true perpetrator. Thus, the risk that Mrs. Schultz would misidentify the defendant was no greater than the risk that the jurors, comparing the defendant with the same surveillance photographs, would misidentify the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">While the foundation for Mrs. Schultz\u2019 testimony may have been deficient in that it was not based on an actual observation of the robber, no lack-of-foundation objection was made in the trial court.

The United States Supreme Court has also recognized the dangers inherent in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>eyewitness identification evidence. In <em>United States v Wade, </em>388 US 218, 228; 87 S Ct 1926; 18 L Ed 2d 1149 (1967), the majority noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">[T]he confrontation compelled by the State between the accused and the victim or witnesses to a crime to elicit identification evidence is peculiarly riddled with innumerable dangers and variable factors which might seriously, even crucially, derogate from a fair trial. The vagaries of eyewitness identification are well-known; the annals of criminal law are rife with instances of mistaken identification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">One commentator has noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">Scientific evidence concerning the unreliability of eyewitness identification has continued to mount since the <em>Wade </em>trilogy. Contrary to popular understanding, our eyes and memories do not operate like a camera on which events are accurately recorded subject to retrieval at any time, but in fact memory can be altered to a significant extent by information perceived after the fact. Also, through a process known as \"unconscious transference,\u201d a person seen briefly in one context may be erroneously \"recognized\u201d in another time and place. Thus, a crime victim may select someone from a lineup because he or she has seen that person in ... a previous photo lineup, rather than at the scene of the crime. Despite such dangers, however, juries find eyewitness testimony to be highly persuasive. [Sobel, Eyewitness Identification, \u00a7 1.1, pp 1-2 to 1-3.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">It is important to keep in mind the widely acknowledged dangers inherent in identification procedures. Witnesses are capable of making mistaken identifications, but yet may be certain that they have correctly selected the perpetrator of the crime. Because of the possibility of such errors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>law enforcement agencies and courts must carefully guard against creating situations in which there is a high likelihood that witnesses will be led to identify an innocent person as being a perpetrator of a crime. Furthermore, they must guard against the danger that, once a witness has identified a person depicted in a photograph as the perpetrator of a crime, they may be likely to base later identifications of the suspect upon that photograph, rather than on their recollection of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">In determining whether pretrial photographic arrays violate the constitutional rights of the accused, courts must determine whether the array creates a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. <em>Simmons v United States, </em>390 US 377, 383; 88 S Ct 967; 19 L Ed 2d 1247 (1968); <em>Neil v Biggers, </em>409 US 188, 196; 93 S Ct 375; 34 L Ed 2d 401 (1972), <em>Anderson, supra, </em>p 169. In this case, tellers Mary Kamendat and Cindy Dortman were presented with a photographic array containing six pictures. All the photographs showed men wearing short-sleeved shirts and baseball hats, all wore sunglasses and all were potbellied. In addition, all were positioned against similar backgrounds and all pictures were cropped to roughly the same size. However, the image of the defendant appears larger than the images of the other subjects, and the background in the picture is a slightly different color. He is standing at a different angle than the others. In addition, three of the other subjects had mustaches. Finally, and perhaps most noteworthy, the defendant\u2019s picture clearly reveals that he has a \"trucker\u2019s wallet\u201d in his back pocket that is attached to his belt with a chain. No such wallet appears in the photographs of the other subjects.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The general consensus among the eyewitnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>was that the suspect was about six feet tall with a potbelly, wearing a short-sleeved shirt, a baseball cap, sunglasses and a chain wallet on his belt. He was not described as having facial hair. In this photographic array, only one subject met this description: defendant Kurylczyk.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Furthermore, as the lead opinion notes, the chain wallet worn by the robber is prominently visible in the surveillance photographs of the robbery. Both Kamendat and Dortman testified to having seen the surveillance photograph in the paper. Thus, this feature was reemphasized for them. Most certainly, the chain wallet was an important facet of the robber\u2019s appearance. Along with the other features that distinguished the defendant\u2019s photograph, I think that the fact that he was the only one that was obviously wearing such a wallet makes this array impermissibly suggestive. I think there is no doubt that this lineup was suggestive, and that it suggested to the witnesses that the defendant was the perpetrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">The lead opinion states that in order to find that a lineup is <em>unduly </em>suggestive, however, a court must determine whether the <em>Neil v Biggers </em>criteria are satisfied. <em>Ante, </em>p 306. I do not agree that these criteria indicate that there was no substantial likelihood of misidentification.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the lighting in the bank was good, the robbery only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>l\u00e1sted three to four minutes. Neither of the two tellers were looking at the robber for the entire duration of the robbery. Further, the evidence showed that Dortman only observed the robber for approximately one minute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, another factor undermines the reliability of their identification. As the lead opinion notes, some of the employees had identified another person as the robber. One of these employees was Kamendat, the witness who was directly confronted by the robber, and thus had the best view of him. In explanation of this event, she testified that she thought that this other person was the robber in part <em>because he was wearing a chain on his belt. Ante, </em>p 308. The fact that the best witness identified another person as the robber, in part on the basis of the fact that he was wearing a chain wallet shows how important this feature was to the identification of the suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Although I acknowledge that it is rare for courts to find photographic arrays impermissibly suggestive, some examples are in accord with the conclusion I reach here. In <em>Commonwealth v Thornley, </em>406 Mass 96, 97, 99-100; 546 NE2d 350 (1989), the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts found a photographic array impermissibly suggestive. The array consisted of photographs of thirteen men, with only the defendant wearing glasses. Both witnesses had originally described the perpetrator as wearing glasses, and stated that they chose the defendant because of his glasses. In <em>State v Iron Thunder, </em>272 NW2d 299 (SD, 1978), the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>described the perpetrator as having a big belly. She was presented with a photographic array that included five photographs of other subjects, and two photographs of the defendant, one showing only his bare chest and stomach, and another picture of his face and shirt open at the collar. Furthermore, the five other subjects had identification boards around their necks. The court found that this was impermissibly suggestive. <em>Id., </em>p 301.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See also <em>Butler v State, </em>544 So 2d 1115 (Fla App, 1989) (a photographic array was found to have been impermissibly suggestive because only the defendant wore the distinctive clothing described by witnesses, the picture had a different background, and the police required one of the witnesses to narrow her two choices to one); <em>People v Shea, </em>54 AD2d 722; 387 NYS2d 477 (1976) (a photographic array was found to have been impermissibly suggestive because the defendant\u2019s picture was in color and was smaller in size than the others, the defendant\u2019s picture appeared more than once, and he was the only one depicted as possessing the identifying characteristic of a blond afro).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">I acknowledge that it appears that these cases are distinguishable because the witnesses chose each of the photographs in question on the basis of the characteristic that distinguished it from the other photographs. However, although these two witnesses did not testify that they based their identification of the defendant\u2019s photograph on the chain wallet that he wore, it was clearly an important part of his appearance. It was a part of the original description by Cindy Dortman. In addition, as I noted above, when Mary Kamendat mistakenly identified the bank customer as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>robber, she testified that she did so in part because he, too, wore a chain wallet.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">Given the suggestiveness of the photographic array and the lack of reliability of the identifications under the totality of the circumstances, I would hold that this photographic array was impermissibly suggestive. Thus, I believe that the trial court erred in allowing Kamendat and Dortman to testify regarding their identification of the defendant\u2019s photograph in the array.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Although I find this lineup to be impermissibly suggestive, I would not reach the issue whether the exposure of Kamendat and Dortman to this lineup tainted their subsequent identifications. Even if it did, I find the error to be harmless in light of the other evidence against the defendant, including the identifications made by witnesses Shirley Smith and Gladys Caris. I agree with the lead opinion that the corporeal lineup is not constitutionally impermissible, and I agree that the exposure of the witnesses to the surveillance photograph of the robber and postarraignment photograph of the defendant did not violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. Thus, I concur with the lead opinion\u2019s result.</p>\n<judges id=\"b451-6\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Levin, J., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-5\"> The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has noted that, in order to be constitutionally valid, \"[t]he array must not be so limited that the defendant is the only one to match the witness\u2019s description of the perpetrator.\u201d <em>United States v Maldonado-Rivera, 922 </em>F2d 934, 974 (CA 2, 1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b448-6\"> In addition, I question how helpful some of these criteria actually are in determining whether an identification is reliable. Although the lead opinion finds support in the fact that both witnesses testified that they were certain that the defendant was the robber, some studies have indicated that there is little correlation between the confidence that witnesses express in their certainty and the accuracy of their observations. See Zalman &amp; Siegel, <em>The psychology of perception, eyewitness identification, and the lineup, </em>27 Crim L Bull 159 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b449-5\"> In addition, some studies support the conclusion that the fact that the robber was carrying a gun makes it less likely that the witnesses were focused on the robber\u2019s face for the entire duration of the robbery. Experimental data has shown that in situations in which a weapon was visible, subjects called upon to describe the facial features of the carrier were much less able to do so than in situations where a weapon was hidden. See Kramer, <em>Weapon focus, arousal, and eyewitness memory, </em>14 Law &amp; Human Behavior 167 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b450-7\"><em> </em>The court went on to find that the identification had an independent basis. <em>Id., </em>p 302.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
