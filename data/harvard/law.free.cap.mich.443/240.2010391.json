The foia covers any \"contested case,\u201d as defined by the apa. The hearing handbook\u2019s<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> definition of department disciplinary hearings falls within the apa definition of \"contested case.\u201d In its brief to this Court, the department states that it \"does not contest that a prison disciplinary hearing meets the parameters\u201d of the apa definition. The Court of Appeals held that because the apa, \u00a7 115,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> exempts department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>disciplinary hearings from the apa, chapters 4 and 8, the hearings are exempt from the apa\u2019s definition of \"contested case.\u201d Therefore, the foia does not apply. We hold that the Freedom of Information Act does apply to Department of Corrections disciplinary hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Pursuant to MCL 15.233(1); MSA 4.1801(3)(1), plaintiff, a Michigan prisoner, requested permission to inspect various final orders and decisions of the Department of Corrections hearings and records on which the decisions were made. Plaintiff instituted the present action after the department denied his request. The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition, holding that the foia publication requirement did not apply to department disciplinary hearings, and that only the affected prisoner could mandate a copy of the proceeding.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The Court of Appeals affirmed in a two to one decision,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> holding that the Legislature exempted disciplinary hearings from the publication requirement when it enacted MCL 24.315; MSA 3.560(215). We granted leave to appeal and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">A review of the statutes shows that the foia applies to department disciplinary hearings. Because the statutes do not conflict, and the language is plain and unambiguous, interpreting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>statutes is unnecessary.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Jones v Grand Ledge Public Schools, </em>349 Mich 1, 9-10; 84 NW2d 327 (1957). See also <em>Gilroy v General Motors Corp (After Remand), </em>438 Mich 330, 341; 475 NW2d 271 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">We must first examine the foia provisions<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that require disclosure of records to the public. The foia, \u00a7 ll(l)(a),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> requires state agencies to \"publish and make available to the public all of the following: (a) Final orders or decisions in contested cases and the records on which they were made.\u201d The foia does not define the term \"contested case,\u201d but defers to the term\u2019s meaning as ascribed in the apa, chapters 1 through 7.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">The apa, chapter 1, defines \"[contested case\u201d as \"a proceeding, ... in which a determination of the legal rights, duties, or privileges of a named party is required by law to be made by an agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>after an opportunity for an evidentiary hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The hearing handbook explains that the department must conduct all hearings that \"may result in the loss by a prisoner of a right . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The department admits and the Court of Appeals held that \"a prison disciplinary case falls within the definition of a 'contested case.\u2019 \u201d 189 Mich App 373, 376; 473 NW2d 722 (1991). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The apa, chapter 8, \u00a7 122,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> states that for purposes of chapter 8, a contested case \"does not include a case that is settled or a case in which a consent agreement is entered into or a proceeding for establishing a rate or approving, disapproving, or withdrawing approval of a form.\u201d Chapter 8, however, does not apply here. The foia only requires the court to apply the definition of \"contested case\u201d as used in the first seven chapters of the apa. Additionally, the apa, chapter 7, \u00a7 115, states that department disciplinary hearings are exempt from chapter 8 of the apa.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The remaining provisions of the apa do not redefine \"contested case,\u201d but merely defer to the chapter 1 definition. If the Legislature intended to define \"contested case\u201d for department disciplinary hearings differently from the express apa definition, then the Legislature could have adopted explicit language expressing that intent or amending MCL 15.241(6); MSA 4.1801(H)(6). See <em>Gordon SelWay, Inc v Spence Bros, Inc, </em>438 Mich 488, 506; 475 NW2d 704 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">The apa, chapter 7, \u00a7 115, also exempts department disciplinary hearings from the apa\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>tested case procedures, chapter 4. Although exempt from those procedures, department disciplinary hearings are not exempt from the <em>definition </em>of \"contested case.\u201d We believe the Legislature intended only to remove department disciplinary hearings from the apa\u2019s procedural requirement for contested cases. This is evidenced by the fact that such hearings are not exempt from the remaining chapters of the apa. The Court of Appeals recognized that the hearings are subject to chapter 6 of the apa, which applies only to a \"contested case:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">When a person has exhausted all administrative remedies available within an agency, and is aggrieved by a final decision or order in a <em>contested case, </em>whether such decision or order is affirmative or negative in form, the decision or order is subject to direct review, by the courts as provided by law. [MCL 24.301; MSA 3.560(201). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Since department disciplinary hearings are subject to chapter 6, it must be because they are \"contested cases.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">The Court of Appeals believes \"that the reason the Legislature did not simply define 'contested cases\u2019 as not including prison disciplinary hearings was the fact that for the purposes of judicial review, the apa still applied. However, this is not true for disclosure requirements.\u201d 189 Mich App 377. There is no evidence that would draw this Court to that conclusion. We will not hold that department disciplinary hearings meet the defini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>tion of a \"contested case\u201d for one provision, but not another, absent evidence that the Legislature intended that result. The House Legislative Analysis, HB 4105, June 19, 1979, does not suggest that removing department disciplinary hearings from the foia was even considered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">The manner in which these disciplinary hearings are conducted has been the subject of a great deal of controversy in recent years, and the issue of how best to structure the hearings has been highlighted by a recent Michigan Court of Appeals decision. In that decision, <em>Lawrence v Michigan Department of Corrections </em>[88 Mich App 167; 276 NW2d 554 (1979)], the court ruled that disciplinary hearings in Michigan correctional facilities fall within the definition of contested cases in the Administrative Procedures Act (a.p.a.), and must be conducted according to its provisions. These provisions include a number of rights which have not been part of the department\u2019s disciplinary hearings policy, such as the right to counsel, and the right to cross-examine witnesses. Many people feel that some of the a.p.a. requirements are inappropriate to the prison disciplinary hearings process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The Legislature refused to exempt department disciplinary hearings from the apa altogether<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> because \"the quality of prison disciplinary hearings could be improved by incorporating some of the a.p.a. due process provisions.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>By allowing department disciplinary hearings to remain subject to the definition of \"contested case\u201d for pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>poses of the apa, the Legislature also intended to allow the hearings to remain subject to \u00a7 11 of the foia. It is a well-known principle that the Legislature is presumed to be aware of, and thus to have considered the effect on, all existing statutes when enacting new laws. <em>Malcolm v East Detroit, </em>437 Mich 132, 138; 468 NW2d 479 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">A recent amendment to the doca also provides evidence that the Legislature did not intend to exempt department disciplinary hearings from the foia. MCL 791.230; MSA 28.2300 specifically describes prison-related documents that are exempt from disclosure under the foia if requested by or on behalf of a prisoner. Exempt items include log books and daily reports of department employees, staffing charts and daily assignment sheets. Final orders or decisions of prison disciplinary hearings are not exempt under this section.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> If the Legislature intended to exempt final orders or decisions, then those items could certainly have been included in the list of exempted material.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">The Court of Appeals also suggests that the \"creation of the procedure to obtain information on prison misconduct hearings evidences the legislative intent that prison misconduct hearings are not 'contested cases\u2019 for the purposes of the foia.\u201d 189 Mich App 377. We disagree. The procedure to which the Court of Appeals referred is exclusively for the prisoner who was the subject of the hearing. The hearing handbook requires sending a copy of the decision to the subject of the hearing. It also requires the decision to be posted for the reporting officer to examine. The foia does not discuss send<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>ing a copy to the subject of the hearing, but applies to the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Together, the provisions ensure that the subject of the hearing automatically receives a copy and that the records are made available to the public, unless otherwise exempt from disclosure. The intent behind requiring publication to the public and requiring the subject of the hearing to receive a copy differ, but the distinction does not suggest an intent to exempt department disciplinary hearings from the foia.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Defendant requests prospective application of our decision because retrieving the requested documents would be an onerous task.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We stated in <em>Washtenaw Co v State Tax </em>Comm, 422 Mich 346, 378-379; 373 NW2d 697 (1985), that a \"considerable administrative burden\u201d can justify limiting a holding to a prospective application.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Whether there is an onerous burden in this case cannot be determined until after the trial court decides whether the records are exempt by any provision within the foia. Only then can it be determined what course of action the department would be required to take and whether that action creates an onerous burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">Section 11 of the foia compels the Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>of Corrections to \"publish and make available to the public\u201d the final orders and decisions of disciplinary hearings. Section 11 explicitly defines the term publish:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">Publications may be in pamphlet, looseleaf, or other appropriate form in printed, mimeographed, or other written matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">\"[M]ake available to the public\u201d simply means that members of the public can obtain access to documents required to be published by following the procedures set forth in \u00a7 3. In short, \u00a7 11 describes what is to be published and the acceptable form of publication, while \u00a7 3 describes the rights and opportunities publication creates.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">The foia is composed of eleven sections,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> each serving as a piece of the foia puzzle. Section 3 explains how a person may utilize his right to <em>inspect </em>the public record, but explicitly \"does not require a public body to create a new public record, except as required in sections 5 and 11 . . . .\u201d MCL 15.233(3); MSA 4.1801(3X3). Only these sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>tions, and primarily \u00a7 11, require a state agency to create a public record. It follows from the structure of the statute that \u00a7 11, which offers no explanation about how inspection will take place, is essentially concerned with compelling agencies to create certain records. A contrary construction would render \u00a7 3 meaningless.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The Department of Corrections conceded in its brief that the requested final orders and decisions are in written form and are retained in prisoner files. The \u00a7 11 publication requirement permits records to be maintained in such written form, thus the agency has satisfied the publication requirement. Nonetheless, the agency still must allow the public access to the documents-pursuant to \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Therefore, on remand, the question should be whether the prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 3 request is sufficiently descriptive to allow the Department of Corrections to find the desired public record in light of the extensive redaction the \u00a7 13 exemptions will doubtlessly require.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> If the request is not sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>descriptive, the prisoner\u2019s request should be denied.

In <em>Nowack v Auditor General, </em>243 Mich 200, 203-204; 219 NW 749 (1928), this Court explained that the citizens of Michigan possess a common-law right to access government documents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">If there be any rule of the English common law that denies the public the right of access to public records, it is repugnant to the spirit of our democratic institutions. Ours is a government of the people. Every citizen rules. . . . Undoubtedly, it would be a great surprise to the citizens and taxpayers of Michigan to learn that the law denied them access to their own books for the purpose of seeing how their money was being expended and how their business was being conducted. There is no such law and never was either in this country or in England. Mr. Justice Morse was right in saying:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">\"I do not think that any common law ever obtained in this free government that would deny to the people thereof the right of free access to, and public inspection of, public records.\u201d <em>Burton v Tuite, </em>78 Mich 363, 374 (7 LRA 73) [44 NW 282 (1889)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-9\">There is no question as to the common-law right of the people at large to inspect public documents and records. The right is based on the interest which citizens necessarily have in the matter to which the records related.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>The foia was enacted to continue this tradition of openness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-4\">It is the public policy of this state that all persons are entitled to full and complete information regarding the aifairs of government and the official acts of those who represent them as public officials and public employees, consistent with this act. The people shall be informed so that they may fully participate in the democratic process. [MCL 15.231(2); MSA 4.1801(1X2).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Hence, the foia mandates disclosure and publication of public records. Section 3(1) of the act, in pertinent part, mandates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">Upon an oral or written request which describes the public record sufficiently to enable the public body to find the public record, a person has a right to inspect, copy, or receive copies of a public record of a public body, except as otherwise expressly provided by section 13.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Section 5<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> delineates the specific mechanics of obtaining a \u00a7 3 request, and provides that members of the public may file an action in circuit court, pursuant to \u00a7 10 of the act,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to compel an agency to disclose records when in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5._</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Furthermore, \u00a7 11 mandates that \"[a] state agency shall publish and make available to the public\u201d public records.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Such publication \"may be in pamphlet, looseleaf, or other appropriate form in printed, mimeographed, or other written matter.\u201d Not unlike \u00a7 5, \u00a7 11 authorizes a cause of action \"to compel a state agency to comply with this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">As found by the majority, disciplinary hearings by the Department of Corrections clearly fall within the foia\u2019s mandate of public access. The majority also found that \" 'make available to the public\u2019 simply means that members of the public can obtain access to documents required to be published by following the procedures set forth in \u00a7 3. In short, \u00a7 11 describes what is to be published and the acceptable form of publication, while \u00a7 3 describes the rights and opportunities publication creates.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">The role of this Court regarding statutory analysis is to determine and enforce the Legislature\u2019s intentions. <em>People ex rel Platt v Oakland Co Bank, </em>1 Doug 282, 287 (Mich, 1844). Because the Legislature is presumed to understand the meaning of its statutes, \"[statutory analysis necessarily begins with the wording of the statute itself.\u201d <em>Carr v General Motors Corp, </em>425 Mich 313, 317; 389 NW2d 686 (1986). Each word of an act, therefore, is \"presumed to be made use of for some purpose,\u201d and \"so far as possible, effect must be given to every clause and sentence.\u201d <em>Univ of Michigan Bd of Regents v Auditor General, </em>167 Mich 444, 450; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>132 NW 1037 (1911).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, unless circumstances dictate otherwise,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Court should utilize the common understanding of words and phrases. <em>Oakland Co Bank, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Accordingly, the Court may not substitute or redefine a word. <em>People v Crucible Steel Co of America, </em>150 Mich 563, 567; 114 NW 350 (1907).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, a cardinal rule of statutory construction is that \"[legislative intent is to be derived from the actual language of the statute, and when the language is clear and unambiguous, no further interpretation is necessary.\u201d <em>Storey v Meijer, Inc, </em>431 Mich 368, 376; 429 NW2d 169 (1988).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Hence, \"[p]ossible or even probable meanings, when one is plainly declared in the instrument itself, the courts are not at liberty to search for elsewhere.\u201d 1 Cooley, Constitutional Limitations (8th ed), pp 125-127.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>If, however, the plain meaning of a statutory provision is unclear, then legislative intent may be determined by an examination of the statute\u2019s purpose, <em>In re Forfeiture of $5,264, </em>432 Mich 242, 248; 439 NW2d 246 (1989), as well as the entirety of the statute\u2019s structure and framework. <em>Joslin v Campbell, Wyant &amp; Cannon Foundry Co, </em>359 Mich 420, 426; 102 NW2d 584 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The unambiguous language of \u00a7 11 provides that \"[a] state agency shall publish and make available to the public\u201d certain records. The majority\u2019s analysis distorts the common meaning of \"publish\u201d by interpreting it as the mere retention of records. <em>Ante </em>at 250. If the Legislature intended to so tailor \u00a7 11, it certainly could have utilized more precise terms such as \"store,\u201d \"maintain,\u201d \"keep,\u201d or \"retain.\u201d The Legislature, however, chose and enacted the term \"publish.\u201d Because the Legislature did not define \"publish\u201d in its definition section of the foia,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> an examination of its common meaning is appropriate. <em>The Random House Dictionary of the English Language: Second Unabridged Edition, </em>p 1563, defines \"publish\u201d as: \"to issue (printed or otherwise reproduced textual or graphic material, computer software, etc.) for sale or distribution to the public,\u201d \"to issue publicly the work of,\u201d \"to announce formally or officially; proclaim; promulgate,\u201d and \"to make publicly or generally known.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Similarly, <em>Roget\u2019s International Thesaurus </em>(New York: 1961), 531.7 publication, p 363, notes \"propagate, promulgate, circu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>late, spread, spread about or abroad, broadcast, diffuse, disseminate,\u201d \"divulge,\u201d \"make known, make public,\u201d \"put forth,\u201d \"issue,\u201d \"declare,\u201d \"announce,\u201d \"proclaim,\u201d et al., in the primary listing for the term. Common legal definitions do not differ. For instance, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed), p 1233, includes \"[t]o make public; to circulate; to make known to people in general,\u201d \"[t]o issue; to put into circulation,\u201d \"[a]n advising of the public or making known of something to the public for a purpose.\u201d The vast array of legal authorities compiled in Corpus Juris Secundum concur.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> None of these sources define the term as mere storage or retention. The common understanding of \"publish\u201d certainly includes at least the production of information that is readily available for public review, if not the outright binding or distribution of materials for public consumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">More important, the majority misconstrues \"make available to the public\u201d to mean \"make available to the public as solely delineated in \u00a7 3.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> No such limitation exists in the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>language of \u00a7 11 or elsewhere in the foia. Each section is independent, and neither refers to the other for definition \u2014 there simply is no statutory language to justify intertwining the sections.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Moreover, examining the statute as a whole, the majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 3 renders the phrase superfluous: \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 already ensure that records are available to the public through a specific request to a governmental agency. Furthermore, both \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 11 provide for a cause Of action to compel an agency to disclose information unlawfully withheld from the public, evidencing a scheme intended to grant \u00a7 11 an independent mechanism for public access to documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The public, therefore, may gain public access to public records independent of \u00a7 3 by obtaining documents published as mandated under \u00a7 11. Hence, the foia permits public review of records in two fashions: (1) through a specific search utilizing \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5, and (2) through general access utilizing \u00a7 11. A member of the public may gather information through a \u00a7 3 request that relates to a specific person or topic, or he may perform wide-ranging general research by examining materials published through \u00a7 11. For example, a reporter wishing to gather information regarding the dnr\u2019s activities regarding Detroit\u2019s Belle Isle could file a \u00a7 3 foia request specifically asking for such information. On the other hand, another reporter wishing to thoroughly research dnr practices, perhaps to search for a pattern of corruption or abuse,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> could examine published materials via \u00a7 11. Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>trary to the assertions of the majority, this construction of the statute does not render \u00a7 3 meaningless. In fact, this interpretation is the only one that maintains the integrity of both sections by preserving the meaning of the phrase \"publish and make available to the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Furthermore, the majority\u2019s interpretation conflicts with the broad mandate of the foia, which is to ensure that \"all persons are entitled to full and complete information regarding the affairs of government ... so that they may fully participate in the democratic process.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The inability of a citizen to formulate a specific \u00a7 3 request should not deny him the ability to examine records, otherwise government practices unknown to the general populace could never be exposed to public scrutiny because no member of the general public could possess the exact knowledge to formulate a specific \u00a7 3 request.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Hence, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b386-8\">Levin, J., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b378-12\"> MCL 15.231 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 4.1801(1) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b379-10\"> See also <em>Int\u2019l Business Machines Corp v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>71 Mich App 526, 542; 248 NW2d 605 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b380-8\"> The section continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\">This act does not require a public body to make a compilation, summary, or report of information, except as required in section 11.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-10\">This act does not require a public body to create a new public record, except as required in sections 5 and 11, and to the extent required by this act for the furnishing of copies, or edited copies pursuant to section 14(1), of an already existing public record.
