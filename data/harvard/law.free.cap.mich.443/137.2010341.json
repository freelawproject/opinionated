Thus, we vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand to the board to determine whether plaintiff sustained any disabling personal injury that is separate and apart from any disability caused by his alcoholism.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">Plaintiff, born January 11, 1942, began his em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>ployment with defendant in May 1963. In his petition for hearing, plaintiff claimed disability in the form of personal injury or disablement from occupational disease resulting from repeated and injurious harassment in the course of employment. The nature of the disability was indicated as nerves and a nervous disability. Before the hearing referee, plaintiff testified that when he began working for defendant he drank moderately and experienced no nervous problems. Plaintiff testified further, however, that he developed a nervous condition in 1967 or 1968.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">During his employment, plaintiff took several sick leaves, citing \"nerves\u201d as his complaint. The record establishes that he was hospitalized several times for acute alcoholism and associated nervous problems, including once, in September 1981, after he discontinued working for defendant. Plaintiff alleged several general incidents of harassment, such as being given work outside his job assignment, being blamed for the malfunction of defective machines, and not being properly trained to operate the larger trucks. Plaintiff alleges that this harassment provoked him to drink and caused him to develop a nervous disorder. He testified that until the last year of his employment, he was able to drink, control his nervous condition, and still function at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Plaintiff asserts that his last year at work with defendant was the most devastating, and was the cause of the ultimate permanent disability that \u25a0 precludes him from working. In January 1981, just before his final disability leave, plaintiff was involved in a mishap while operating a plant truck. The truck tipped over because of improper loading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>and unloading. Plaintiff blamed his supervisor for the mishap, alleging a failure to instruct him regarding the proper loading of a truck. Plaintiff\u2019s last day of work was January 9, 1981. The hearing referee determined the date of the disability to be January 19, 1981. Plaintiff retired with permanent disability effective September 1, 1981. At the time of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board decision, plaintiff was still a drinking alcoholic.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The hearing referee granted plaintiff\u2019s claim for an open award on the basis of a nervous disability. The wcab, in a two to one decision, affirmed the hearing referee\u2019s decision. The wcab majority found that \"plaintiff\u2019s disability stems from emotional problems and drinking, such that we cannot extract one from the other.\u201d Slip op at 1. The board majority further found that plaintiff\u2019s father was an alcoholic, that plaintiff began drinking at age thirteen or fourteen, that he is presently unable to control his drinking, <em>id. </em>at 9, and then proceeded to analyze the facts under <em>Deziel v Difco Laboratories, Inc (After Remand), </em>403 Mich 1; 268 NW2d 1 (1978):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0n\">[I]f plaintiff\u2019s <em>emotional </em>problems are linked to his work and were caused or aggravated by his work, contributing to his disability, in our view, plaintiff is entitled to compensation .... <em>[Id. </em>at 9.][<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The board majority concluded that 1) plaintiff is totally disabled; 2) although plaintiff\u2019s testimony is vague with respect to dates, his testimony regarding job transfers, consultations with his union, and a work mishap establish the existence of work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>incidents triggering his emotional condition, and constitute personal injuries; and 3) that plaintiff honestly believes that work caused his disability. The wcab majority refused to utilize the analysis of <em>Gacioch v Stroh Brewery Co, </em>426 Mich 612; 396 NW2d 1 (1986), finding the circumstances in <em>Gacioch </em>to be so unique as to limit the decision to its facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">In a separate opinion, the dissenting board member stated that she would find that plaintiff failed to establish a sufficient causal nexus between his employment and his chronic alcoholism. WCAB, slip op at 13. The dissent concluded that a work nexus was not established because plaintiff\u2019s nervous condition began in 1967, but plaintiff continued to work until 1981, and by plaintiff\u2019s own admission, he could drink alcohol and still work.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the findings and decision of the wcab.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court identified plaintiff\u2019s illness as a psychiatric disability that caused or aggravated plaintiff\u2019s alcoholism. It distinguished <em>Gacioch </em>on the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s allegation in <em>Gacioch </em>of a disability due solely to alcoholism, while in the present case plaintiff alleges a psychiatric disability that is only partially linked to alcoholism.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court then opined that the test established in <em>Deziel </em>was applicable, and that there was sufficient, competent evidence to support the board\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We then granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">It is unclear from the findings of the wcab<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> whether plaintiff\u2019s alcoholism stemmed from an underlying psychiatric disorder or whether the psychiatric disorder arose out of an increase in plaintiff\u2019s alcoholic condition.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Hence, we disagree with the Court of Appeals identification of plaintiff\u2019s illness as a psychiatric illness that caused plaintiff\u2019s alcoholism. We also disagree with plaintiff\u2019s assertion on appeal that it has been established that plaintiff\u2019s alcoholism is a sequela of his nervous disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The deposition testimony of the medical experts produced by both defendant and plaintiff demonstrates the ambiguity of plaintiff\u2019s disability. From their testimony, it is not evident which disorder precipitated the other, or if either could have existed independently. Plaintiff was a moderate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>drinker before beginning work in 1963 for defendant, and before 1963, he did not suffer from any nervous condition. Plaintiff testified that his nervous condition developed about 1967 or 1968, and his drinking became progressively heavier during his employment with defendant. Plaintiff further testified that until his last year he could function at work despite his drinking and nervous condition. Although ambiguous with regard to the exact etiology of plaintiff\u2019s disability, the factual findings made by the board and other evidence in the record clearly demonstrate that alcoholism played a primary role in plaintiff\u2019s claimed injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">We reject the invitation by plaintiff to expand the chapter three personal injury analysis of workers\u2019 compensation claims to cover diseases of addiction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In order to be awarded benefits under a chapter three personal injury analysis, the claimant must show that he suffered a personal injury arising out of and in the course of his employment. Although no compensation is awarded for a disability caused by an ordinary disease of life, a claimant may recover workers\u2019 compensation benefits when his employment aggravates, accelerates, or combines with a preexisting condition to produce a personal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Alcoholism is a progressive disease.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The compulsion and the consumption will accelerate until it is interrupted.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is in the nature of the disease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>that its victims will find conditions and circumstances at home, at work, and in between to justify the increased need for alcohol.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It is not work and its attendant stresses that aggravate alcoholism; it is alcohol.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It is not a job or occupation that compels alcoholics to consume alcohol; it is the disease from which they suffer.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Individuals who suffer from alcoholism hold the most essential key to their recovery.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It defies logic and what is now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>known about the nature of alcoholism to declare that a job or occupation is responsible for accelerating or aggravating a worker\u2019s alcoholism when alcoholism is a progressive disease, and aggravation of which is caused by the alcohol itself rather than by employment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">In <em>Gacioch, </em>we recognized that chronic alcoholism is a disease. <em>Id. </em>at 618.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We remanded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>case to the wcab for a determination whether the plaintiff satisfied his burden of proving his claim: that the claimant, as a brewery worker, was more prone to develop alcoholism than the general public because of conditions characteristic of and peculiar to the business of the defendant. The <em>Gacioch </em>analysis confined compensation for diseases of addiction into a chapter four occupational disease analysis. Justice Brickley, writing separately, favored denial of compensation for aggravation of preexisting diseases where the \"aggravating conditions are not required by the job and the disease is one from which recovery primarily depends upon personal motivation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 629. Where a personal addiction plays a significant role in a claimed mental or emotional injury, a finding that such an injury is work related should be precluded.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Justice Boyle, in a concurring opinion joined by Justice Riley, indicated that she was not convinced that \"alcoholism or a predisposition thereto, whether or not aggravated or accelerated by the conditions of employment, was contemplated as a compensable injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Because there is no indication that the Legislature intended to include alcoholism as a chapter three personal injury or a preexisting condition that is aggravated, accelerated, or combined with conditions of employment resulting in disability or death, and because there exists persuasive evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>dence to the contrary, we adhere to the view that alcoholism is not a \"personal injury\u201d that arises out of and in the course of employment for purposes of a workers\u2019 compensation disability. In this case, we conclude that alcoholism is not a compensable personal injury under chapter three of the Workers\u2019 Disability Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">In the present case, the wcab found that plaintiff\u2019s disability resulted from emotional problems <em>and </em>alcoholism. Because the plaintiff\u2019s alcoholism was a significant factor in the board\u2019s decision that the plaintiff was disabled, we vacate the Court of Appeals decision and remand to the board to determine whether the plaintiff suffered a disabling personal injury that is separate and apart from his alcoholism. If there is insufficient evidence of an independent disabling personal injury, plaintiff has failed to carry his burden of proof, and compensation should therefore be denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b274-7\">Brickley, Boyle, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-9\"> The workers\u2019 compensation statutes applicable at the time this claim was filed are: MCL 418.301(1); MSA 17.237(301X1) which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-10\">An employee, who receives a personal injury arising out of and in the course of his employment by an employer who is subject to the provisions of this act, at the time of such injury, shall be paid compensation in the manner and to the extent provided in this act, or in case of his death resulting from such injuries the compensation shall be paid to his dependents as defined in this act.

This is so because a worker who is an alcoholic has the \"most essential key\u201d \u2014 abstinence\u2014to the avoidance of disability, and thus could avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>the progression of the disease and resulting disability by eliminating consumption of alcohol.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The majority thus transforms a factual issue, within the exclusive province of the wcab, into a question of law, within the exclusive province of this Court, premised on the majority\u2019s findings of fact and conclusion that the sole cause of what it acknowledges is the \"disease\u201d of alcoholism<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is always the worker\u2019s failure to abstain from drinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The essence of the majority\u2019s analysis is that, to the extent alcoholism plays a \"significant\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> role in the worker\u2019s personal injury and disability, the <em>worker is </em>\"responsible\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> for his personal injury and disability \u2014 the personal injury and disability is the worker\u2019s <em>fault </em>\u2014 because he did not stop drinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Workers\u2019 compensation is, however, the paradigmatic no-fault liability act.

A person who is subject to liability is not absolved of responsibility although, as it is generally put, the victim has an eggshell head. A person with a weak back, a weak heart, or a mental disorder may recover workers\u2019 compensation benefits if the stress of work accelerates or aggravates to the point of disability the back, heart, or mental condition. The majority does not adequately explain why a person who comes to the job with a tendency to alcoholism <em>and </em>mental problems, should not also be entitled to recover benefits if the stress of work accelerates or aggravates his alcoholism <em>and </em>mental condition, in combination, to the point of disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">It is well established that, where an injury or disability arises from a preexisting physical or mental condition and events at work, the worker need not establish that the work connection is \u201cprimary,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and thus it is not material, and com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>pensation cannot properly be denied because Pierce\u2019s alcoholism played a \"significant role.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">When employment and personal risks concur to produce injury, the injury arises out of the employment, since <em>the employment need not be the primary cause, </em>but need only contribute to the injury.

The majority cites authorities stating that \" '[o]nce the alcoholic begins to drink, he <em>may </em>be no more able to control the compulsion to continue drinking than the tuberculosis patient can voluntarily control his coughing\u2019 \u201d and that alcoholism is \"often progressive.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)

The worker in <em>Beames v Warren Co Sheriff\u2019s Dep\u2019t, </em>190 AD2d 877; 593 NYS2d 127 (1993), was a correction officer for a sheriff\u2019s department. The worker\u2019s son, then sixteen years old, was incarcerated in the facility in which the worker was employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">The worker was apparently subjected to constant harassing and taunting about his son\u2019s incarceration, both from inmates and fellow correction officers. His fears about the future imprisonment of his son, as well as the taunting, caused considerable stress. The worker had a physical confrontation with an inmate who allegedly threatened to sodomize the claimant\u2019s son. Following this incident, the worker was fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">Although the worker had longstanding problems with alcohol abuse, depression, and marital difficulties, these were apparently under control until the imprisonment of his son.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>The New York court held that there was substantial evidence to support the finding that the worker\u2019s disability was causally related to an accident arising out of and in the course of employment.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">An Oregon appellate court after de novo review affirmed awards of compensation for injuries in which alcoholism and mental disorders combined. The worker in <em>Adsitt v Clairmont Water </em>Dist, 79 Or App 1; 717 P2d 1231 (1986), was a billing clerk in a three-person office who felt harassed by what she considered to be a continuous barrage of unfair criticism about her job performance. She was found to have a long history of alcohol abuse accompanied or caused by depression and low self-esteem, superimposed upon an hysterical personality. The worker claimed that work stress aggravated her mental disorders and alcoholism.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The court found that while work stress did not cause her mental illness and alcoholism, \"an exacerbation of an underlying condition caused by work activities is itself a compensable occupational disease if it reflects a worsening of the condition and involves an increase in pain which produces disability or requires medical services.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 6. The court further found that work conditions were the major contributing cause of the worker\u2019s physical condition. It added that it \"does not matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>who is responsible for the work conditions or whether claimant\u2019s perceptions of those conditions is the same as an objective outside observer\u2019s. The conditions could produce stress and did produce a worsening of claimant\u2019s condition.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">A similar result was reached by the Oregon court in <em>Globe Machine v Yock, </em>79 Or App 9; 717 P2d 1235 (1986), decided contemporaneously with <em>Adsitt. </em>The court affirmed an award finding that the worker\u2019s disabling psychological breakdown and alcohol abuse were the result of stress experienced on the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The worker was the president of a Globe Machine subsidiary that had filed for bankruptcy. He had presided over the liquidation of the company, including laying off employees and dealing with creditors. The worker had been a heavy drinker before his job at Globe Machine, but had always been able to work. He began to drink even more heavily after several months on the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The Oregon court was convinced by the evidence that work caused a worsening of the worker\u2019s condition. \"If his alcohol abuse is a symptom of underlying depression and anxiety, the work stress produced or exacerbated those problems. If alcoholism is in itself a disease, he lost control of the disease because of work stress.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 15. The court further concluded that \"[cjlaimant\u2019s loss of control over his alcoholism together with his depression. and anxiety constituted a compensable worsening of his underlying disorder.\u201d <em>Id., </em>pp 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">A Louisiana appellate court, in <em>Proyer v Monsanto Co, </em>606 So 2d 1307 (La App, 1992), affirmed an award of compensation where work stress, alcoholism, and mental injuries were interrelated. The worker was a production technician operating a control board processing the mixing and manu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>facturing of chemicals. Mishandling could lead to spontaneous reactions called fusions. A number of fusions occurred while the worker was at the controls, for which he was blamed. One evening he received a telephone call from a co-worker informing him that he was being blamed for a fusion that did not occur on his watch.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Feeling stressed by his work situation, the worker began to envision a plan to kill his boss. He suffered a severe breakdown or psychotic episode upon being sent home,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> becoming delusional, suicidal, and homicidal. The worker was admitted to a substance abuse clinic five days later. Monsanto appealed a finding of total and permanent disability due to mental stress from work.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The worker\u2019s expert witness testified that the worker was suffering from depression, alcohol abuse, a borderline personality disorder, and paranoia, and that alcohol aggravated the situation, but was not the primary problem. Rather, work stress was primary. Monsanto\u2019s expert witness testified that the worker\u2019s problem was chiefly the result of alcoholic hallucinosis, although he acknowledged that the worker was under work stress. The Louisiana court affirmed an award of benefits under a standard of review that permitted reversal only for manifest error, and declined to set aside the award because alcohol played a role in the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">The majority\u2019s citation of <em>Darnell v North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, </em>450 NW2d 721, 726 (ND, 1990),<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> is misplaced. There, the court wrote that \"we determine only whether a reasoning mind could have reasonably determined that the agency\u2019s factual conclusions were sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>ported by the weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 723. The court thus was bound to affirm the denial of benefits to the worker because it found the decision denying benefits to be reasonable on the factual record.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The standard applied in <em>Darnell </em>is similar to the standard that limits this Court\u2019s powers of judicial review, and which requires that this Court affirm wcab findings of fact unless there is no evidentiary support.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">In the instant case, the wcab found from the evidence that Pierce\u2019s employment activities <em>were not </em>an excuse for voluntarily drinking. Rather, work stress aggravated Pierce\u2019s alcoholism and combined with or caused emotional disorders, leading to his disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">A related group of cases from other jurisdictions involves claims that the worker drank or used drugs to ease the pain of compensable physical injury. The workers sought to recover the costs of substance abuse treatment.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> None of these cases adopts a blanket rule denying benefits for alcohol treatment. Some deny benefits because statutes mandate a denial, while at least one court, for public policy reasons, has refused to award benefits for treatment for addiction to an <em>illegal </em>drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">In <em>Hansen v Weyerhaeuser, </em>89 Or App 349; 749 P2d 1183 (1988), the claimant had injured his knee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>in June, 1981, was awarded permanent partial disability, and returned to work in a different capacity. He subsequently injured his back in May, 1983. Two weeks into his second stay at a pain center, in November, 1984, it was discovered that the worker was an alcoholic. The employer denied responsibility for the cost of an alcohol rehabilitation program as well as the second stay at the pain center.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The worker contended that the pain of his injuries caused him to drink heavily and that, as a result, he became an alcoholic needing treatment. The Oregon court, after review de novo, affirmed the denial of benefits. The court, relying in part on <em>Globe Machine, </em>wrote that \"[treatment for the alcoholism would be compensable if the injury caused it to become symptomatic, or caused a preexisting psychological condition to become symptomatic in the form of alcoholism.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 352. The worker proved neither of these conditions.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The Nebraska Supreme Court in <em>Elliott v Midlands Animal Products, </em>229 Neb 823; 428 NW2d 920 (1988), reviewed an award of benefits to a worker who sought payment for alcohol abuse treatment. He contended that he drank to ease the pain of a compensable hand injury.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The court affirmed an award of benefits for treatment occurring after a 1979 hand injury because there was testimony that he drank heavily after the injury, when before he only drank socially. The court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>however, denied payment for alcohol treatment occurring after a 1982 hand injury, because there was no testimony that the worker\u2019s alcoholism had been aggravated by the 1982 injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Benefits have been denied when statutes explicitly so require. In <em>Milmir Construction v Smith, </em>582 So 2d 52 (Fla App, 1991), the worker had an alcohol and drug abuse problem subsequent to suffering a work-related back injury. The Florida statute specifically excluded from the definition of injury arising out of employment \"disability or death due to the accidental acceleration or aggravation of a venereal disease or of a disease due to the habitual use of alcohol or . . . narcotic drug . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> A Georgia statute provides that \"alcoholism or disabilities attributable thereto shall not be deemed to be 'injury\u2019 or 'personal injury\u2019 by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">One court has denied benefits for drug abuse treatment for public policy reasons. In <em>Dumas v Hartford Ins Co, </em>583 So 2d 31 (La App, 1991), the worker claimed that his attempts to relieve the pain of a compensable back injury caused him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>turn to street drugs (cocaine) when medical attention failed to provide relief. The court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">[T]he defendants cannot be held liable for payment of the costs of plaintiff\u2019s drug abuse therapy, even if the cocaine use was precipitated by the work-related accident. As a matter of public policy, the plaintiff\u2019s decision to forego legal medical treatment in preference for the use of illegal drugs cannot be sanctioned.-Other avenues for relieving the pain of the back injury were available. <em>[Id., </em>p 35.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Denying benefits as a matter of public policy for a disability resulting from the illegal use of drugs is clearly different than denying benefits for disability resulting from the legal, albeit unwise, consumption of alcohol.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">The largest group of cases in which courts have considered alcoholism is that in which alcohol or drug abuse was claimed to have been or was found to be an intervening or actual cause of the disability for which the claimant sought workers\u2019 compensation benefits. In those cases, workers claimed that work injury caused disabilities unrelated to alcohol or drug use. The issue discussed by the courts was whether the board correctly found that the use of alcohol or drugs was an intervening cause in the nexus between the work-place injury and the disability for which benefits were sought. Typically, the appellate courts affirmed findings of fact on a narrow standard of appellate review.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>At the heart of the majority\u2019s reasoning is its belief that Pierce should not be compensated because alcoholism is a self-inflicted disorder. Alcoholism, according to the majority, is an addictive disorder for which the only person at fault is the alcoholic.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">As the cases from other jurisdictions demonstrate, this is not a position that has been generally adopted. Further, the federal courts have awarded social security disability and supplementary income benefits in cases in which alcoholism played a role in claimant\u2019s disability.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">At least two jurisdictions have considered a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>worker\u2019s alcoholism in assessing the <em>amount </em>of disability caused by a compensable, physical work injury.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals and the award of the wcab.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-9\"> Unpublished opinion per curiam, decided May 10, 1991 (Docket No. 125457).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b275-10\"> <em>Scroggins v Corning Glass Co, </em>382 Mich 628; 172 NW2d 367 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b275-11\"> The majority acknowledges that in reviewing the findings of the wcab, the judicial role is to \"decide whether there is <em>any </em>competent evidence to support the findings of fact made by the board,\u201d but does not observe this limitation on the judicial function in deciding this case. <em>Ante, </em>p 143, n 8.
