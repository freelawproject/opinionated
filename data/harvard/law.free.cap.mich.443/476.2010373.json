We hold that Michigan may exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction over acts committed outside Michigan when the acts are intended to and do have a detrimental effect within the state. Here, the prosecutor claims that defendant was involved in a conspiracy and aided and abetted the commission of a crime in Michigan because he knew that the person to whom he sold cocaine was from Michigan. We disagree. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>\"knowledge\u201d to which the prosecutor refers only is part of the evidence necessary to support a conviction for conspiracy or aiding and abetting. But knowledge alone is not enough to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The prosecutor must present evidence that defendant intended to commit an act <em>with the intent to have a detrimental effect within this state. </em>That intent does not exist in this case. Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals decision,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and reinstate the district court\u2019s dismissal of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Defendant, Michael Blume, is a Florida resident who is charged in Michigan with conspiracy to deliver or possession with intent to deliver more than 650 grams of cocaine<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and with aiding and abetting the manufacture or possession with intent to manufacture or deliver 650 grams of cocaine.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The complaint alleges that in June, 1988, defendant sold cocaine to Randall Hoyt, a Michigan resident. The entire transaction took place in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">After purchasing cocaine from defendant, Hoyt returned to Michigan. The Michigan State Police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>subsequently arrested Hoyt upon discovering a kilo of cocaine during a search of Hoyt\u2019s apartment. Hoyt informed the police that he purchased the cocaine from defendant while in Florida. The prosecutor filed a complaint charging defendant. After being arraigned, defendant moved to quash the complaint and charges for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Officer Palenick was the only prosecution witness who testified at the hearing on the motion to quash for lack of jurisdiction. He explained that Hoyt told him that he traveled to Florida intending to purchase cocaine from a prearranged supplier. Unable to find his connection, Hoyt began looking for a new supplier. Hoyt met up with defendant. Apparently, the two had met each other previously through a gym at which both exercised. Hoyt and defendant made arrangements for the sale of cocaine. The entire transaction took place in Florida. Defendant did not have any contact with Hoyt while Hoyt was in Michigan before the sale. Officer Palenick testified that Hoyt said that defendant was aware that he was from Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">After Officer Palenick and defendant testified at the hearing, the trial court dismissed the charges for lack of jurisdiction, finding that if any conspiracy occurred involving defendant, it occurred in Florida, and that defendant did not give aid or encouragement in Michigan. The circuit court reversed and ordered reinstatement of the charges upon finding that defendant\u2019s acts were intended to and actually did produce detrimental effects in Michigan. The Court of Appeals affirmed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We granted leave to appeal, and, upon finding the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction in this case inappropriate, we reverse and order reinstatement of the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The general rule is that jurisdiction is proper only over \"offenses as may be committed within its jurisdiction.\u201d <em>People v Devine, </em>185 Mich 50, 52-53; 151 NW 646 (1915). The authority to exercise jurisdiction over acts that occur outside the state\u2019s physical borders developed<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as an exception to the rule against extraterritorial jurisdiction. That exception, however, is \"limited to those acts that are intended to have, and that actually do have, a detrimental effect within the state.\u201d <em>Strassheim v Daily, </em>221 US 280, 285; 31 S Ct 558; 55 L Ed 735 (1911); <em>Deur v Newaygo Sheriff, </em>420 Mich 440, 446-447; 362 NW2d 698 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">This state has not defined the boundaries of the exception,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but consistently has required a finding that the actor intended a detrimental effect to occur <em>in this state. </em>See, e.g., <em>Deur, supra. </em>The two key elements of that requirement are specific in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>tent to act and the intent that the harm occur in Michigan.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">A proper analysis for this Court is to determine whether a conspiracy or aiding and abetting charge could be established by the evidence. Then, the Court must determine whether the conspiracy or crime that was aided and abetted was intended to occur in Michigan.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">\" 'A conspiracy is a partnership in criminal purposes.\u2019 \u201d <em>People v </em>Atley, 392 Mich 298, 310; 220 NW2d 465 (1974) (quoting <em>United States v Kissel, </em>218 US 601, 608; 31 S Ct 124; 54 L Ed 1168 (1910). \"The gist of the offense of conspiracy lies in the unlawful agreement between two or more persons.\u201d <em>Atley </em>at 311.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Establishing a conspiracy requires evidence of specific intent to combine with others to accomplish an illegal objective. <em>Atley </em>at 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">First, the intent to combine with others for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>unlawful purpose must exist. Even if one party intends to combine to pursue an unlawful purpose, \" '[t]o prove the crime of conspiracy, ... it must further be proven that that intent, <em>including that knowledge, </em>was possessed by more than one individual since there can be no conspiracy without a combination of two or more[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] persons.\u2019 \u201d <em>People v Sutherlin, </em>116 Mich App 494, 500; 323 NW2d 456 (1982) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">In <em>Atley, </em>this Court held that there was insufficient evidence to support convicting the defendant of conspiracy to deliver an illegal substance because there was insufficient evidence that two or more parties agreed to sell the marijuana. Atley, along with two other defendants, was arrested for possession of 127 pounds of raw marijuana. He was charged with conspiracy to sell a narcotic drug. The prosecutor alleged that the defendants were going to harvest a marijuana field in Kansas and sell the marijuana in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Regarding the evidence, the trial judge explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">\"I have some difficulty in bridging the gap between being hired [to] harvest a crop for delivery to a person who has expressed an intention that he was going to dry it and sell it, but without any agreement or any conversation as to participation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>in the actual sale, being sufficient to establish a conspiracy, which is an agreement or an understanding to make a sale.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 313.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">This Court explained that the evidence was not \"strong enough to sustain[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>] the conviction for conspiracy to sell marijuana.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">The \"prior combination and agreement\u201d to harvest plus the testimony that defendant Atley intended to sell the marijuana do not directly establish in logic that the defendant and Eaton or any other person <em>agreed to sell </em>the marijuana. There was, in fact, no testimony . . . that Eaton <em>agreed </em>with defendant <em>to sell </em>the marijuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-8\">. . . From the established fact of acquisition of 127 pounds of marijuana, we can infer an intent to sell, but that is as far as inference may take us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-9\">It is not \"a fair inference,\u201d <em>[People v Beller, </em>294 Mich 464; 293 NW 720 (1940)]; <em>People v Sobczak, </em>344 Mich 465; 73 NW2d 921 (1955), to infer the ultimate fact of conspiracy to sell from the fact of joint acquisition. The ultimate fact of intent to sell might be inferred, but not agreement to sell. What they actually intended to do insofar as payment was concerned, or insofar as where the marijuana was to be sold, whether in Michigan or elsewhere, is on this record a matter of conjecture. <em>[Id. </em>at 314.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">A defendant may become a member of an already existing conspiracy if he \" <em>'cooperates know</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number><em>ingly to further the object of the conspiracy People v Huey, </em>345 Mich 120, 125; 75 NW2d 893 (1956) (emphasis added). The \"knowledge\u201d is a part of the crime only because \"[w]ithout the knowledge, the intent cannot exist. <em>United States v Falcone </em>[311 US 205; 61 S Ct 204; 85 L Ed 128 (1940)].\u201d <em>Direct Sales Co v United States, </em>319 US 703, 711; 63 S Ct 1265; 87 L Ed 1674 (1943). Mere knowledge that someone proposes unlawful action alone is not enough to find involvement in a conspiracy, however. \"Those having no knowledge of the conspiracy are not conspirators, <em>United States v Hirsch, </em>100 US 33, 34 [25 L Ed 539 (1879)]; <em>Weniger v United States, </em>47 F2d 692, 693 [CA 9, (1931)]; and one who without more furnishes supplies to an illicit distiller is not guilty of conspiracy even though his sale may have furthered the object of a conspiracy to which the distiller was a party but of which the supplier had no knowledge.\u201d <em>Falcone </em>at 210-211.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The dissent cites <em>Direct Sales </em>to support the proposition that defendant can become involved in the conspiracy through informed or interested cooperation. But the dissent relies on one short sentence of that opinion in so holding. In <em>Direct Sales, </em>the United States Supreme Court also recognized that \"[t]here may be circumstances in which the evidence of knowledge is clear, yet the further step of finding the required intent cannot be taken. Concededly, not every instance of sale of restricted goods, harmful as are opiates, in which the seller knows the buyer intends to use them unlawfully, will support a charge of conspiracy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">There are circumstances, however, such as in <em>Direct Sales, </em>that jurisdiction is appropriate. For example, if \"the evidence discloses such a [distribution] system, working in prolonged cooperation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>with a physician\u2019s unlawful purpose to supply him with his stock in trade for his illicit enterprise, there is no legal obstacle to finding that the supplier not only knows and acquiesces, but joins both mind and hand with him to make its accomplishment possible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 713. It was under those circumstances that the United States Supreme Court said there was \"informed and interested cooperation, stimulation, instigation [of the conspiracy] [a]nd there is also a 'stake in the venture\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The United States Supreme Court also provided additional guidance about what amount of evidence is required by explaining <em>Falcone:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">That decision comes down merely to this, that one does not become a party to a conspiracy by aiding and abetting it, through sales of supplies or otherwise, unless he knows of the conspiracy; and the inference of such knowledge cannot be drawn merely from knowledge the buyer will use the goods illegally. <em>[Id. </em>at 709.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Clearly, the prosecutor must present more evidence than the seller\u2019s knowledge of the buyer\u2019s proposed illegal purpose. For intent to exist, the defendant must know of the conspiracy, must know of the objective of the conspiracy, and must intend to participate cooperatively to further that objective. \" '[T]o establish the intent, the evidence of knowledge must be clear, not equivocal . . . because charges of conspiracy are not to be made out by piling inference upon inference ....\u2019\u201d <em>Atley </em>at 310, quoting <em>Direct Sales Co, </em>supra.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"ApF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\">Because of the jurisdictional dispute, the prosecutor also must establish an intent to combine with others for the unlawful purpose of possessing cocaine or possessing with the intent to deliver the cocaine <em>in Michigan. </em>The \"threshold question for assertion of the state\u2019s jurisdiction is whether there is a showing sufficient to permit the court to conclude that the defendant intended to produce a detrimental effect in the forum state.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">In <em>United States v Baker, </em>609 F2d 134 (CA 5, 1980), the court applied extraterritorial jurisdiction to a case involving conspiracy and illegal possession with intent to distribute narcotics. But the <em>Baker </em>court specifically held that if \"it is clear that the intended distribution would occur within\u201d the jurisdiction attempting to punish the defendant, then \"jurisdiction may be maintained . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">This state will not surrender a person charged with a crime in another state unless the defendant clearly committed a crime with the intent that the crime occur in the demanding state.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In <em>Deur, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number><em>supra </em>at 449, this Court refused to surrender the defendant because he \"did not commit any act in the State of Michigan intentionally resulting in the crime with which he is charged in the State of Maryland.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, this Court should not approve the exercise of jurisdiction over a person who committed a crime outside Michigan when this state cannot prove that the person intended the crime to occur in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">A thorough review of the testimony fails to disclose evidence sufficient to support exercising jurisdiction over this defendant.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The prosecutor did not present evidence that defendant<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> acted with the intent to have a detrimental effect in Michigan. Conversely, defense counsel introduced testimony that negated the existence of such intent. Similarly, the prosecutor did not present sufficient evidence that defendant knew of or cooperated knowingly to further the objectives of a conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">This case involves defendant\u2019s sale of cocaine to Randy Hoyt. Hoyt traveled to Florida, intending to purchase cocaine from someone other than defendant,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and defendant\u2019s only prior contact with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Hoyt was through a gym.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Although defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>knew that Hoyt was from Michigan and that Hoyt eventually would return to Michigan, defendant only was involved in the initial delivery of cocaine to Hoyt.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The transaction was completed in Flor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>ida as evidenced by the fact that delivery was complete and the financial aspects of the sale were concluded.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Although we may infer from the amount of the cocaine purchased that the buyer intended to possess or sell the cocaine somewhere, <em>Atley, supra, </em>the prosecution\u2019s only witness, Officer Palenick, was unable to testify that Hoyt told defendant that the drugs would be distributed in Michigan.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The officer did testify that Hoyt could have disposed of the cocaine in any manner and no agreement would have been breached.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> For that to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>true, there must not have been an agreement regarding what Hoyt would do with the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Also relevant is that the defendant did not have an interest in the cocaine beyond the initial sale. Defendant was not concerned with Hoyt\u2019s use of the cocaine, and was not concerned with where Hoyt took the cocaine. More importantly, defendant did not intend that the cocaine go to Michigan, and did not intend that the drugs be sold in Michigan.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Mere knowledge that Hoyt would return to Michigan sometime after completing the transaction with defendant is insufficient to support finding that defendant specifically intended to have a detrimental effect in this state.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Although an inference may be drawn, and in some cases knowledge and the surrounding circumstances may be sufficient to support a finding of intent, <em>Direct Sales, supra, </em>the dissent\u2019s conclusion<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> here violates the principle that inference is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>not to be created upon inference to support a conspiracy charge. <em>Direct Sales Co, supra. </em>The inference upon inference the dissent built includes an inference that defendant knew Hoyt was going to sell the drugs, an inference that Hoyt had a plan to sell the drugs, an inference that the plan involved another person so as to create a conspiracy, an inference that Hoyt\u2019s plan or conspiracy was to sell the drugs in Michigan, and an inference that defendant, by the mere delivery of the cocaine to Hoyt and knowledge that Hoyt was <em>from </em>Michigan, knew of and cooperated <em>knowingly </em>with these inferred states of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">But the prosecutor failed to introduce evidence that defendant and Hoyt agreed, or even discussed, that the cocaine would be distributed in Michigan.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The prosecutor also failed to introduce evidence that defendant was aware that Hoyt was involved in a conspiracy.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> There is no evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>that defendant knew Hoyt had a plan. It is questionable whether Hoyt knew he had a plan. There is no evidence that defendant knew Hoyt was going to sell the cocaine in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">After reviewing <em>Direct Sales, Falcone, Deur, Atley, </em>and <em>Huey, </em>we can only conclude that the facts do not provide a sufficient basis for concluding that defendant knew of or cooperated knowingly with a conspiracy to further its objectives.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">The reasoning used in the conspiracy discussion applies to the substantive charge brought under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>the aiding and abetting theory. Consistent with <em>Strassheim, supra, </em>the defendant must have intended a detrimental effect to occur in Michigan and the effect actually must have occurred in Michigan before this Court can exercise jurisdiction over a defendant who aided and abetted outside Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">One who aids and abets the commission of a substantive crime that occurs in Michigan is not automatically subject to trial in Michigan. Defendant must have intended to aid and abet a crime in Michigan. Mere knowledge is not enough to exercise jurisdiction.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Because there is an insufficient factual basis to assert extraterritorial jurisdiction over this defendant, we reverse the Court of Appeals decision, and reinstate the district court\u2019s dismissal of the charges.</p>\n<judges id=\"b620-7\">Levin, Brickley, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-9\"> As discussed below, knowledge alone in this case similarly is not enough to convict defendant of conspiracy or aiding and abetting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b604-10\"> It must be noted that the Court of Appeals misstated the facts, which it found \"sufficient to establish that defendant\u2019s conduct in Florida was done with intent to produce and did produce detrimental effects within Michigan.\u201d Unpublished opinion per curiam, decided January 15, 1992 (Docket No. 129818), p 1.

Therefore, this state may prosecute Blume for conspiracy. The dissent confuses the evidence necessary to support exercising extraterritorial jurisdiction with the evidence necessary to support a conviction for conspiracy. <em>Post </em>at 506. The dissent relies on discussions between defendant and Hoyt regarding potential future sales of cocaine to establish the existence of facts contributing to the conspiracy. This reliance is inappropriate, however, because the officer admitted that \"[tjhere was not any firm commitment according to Mr. Hoyt.

The problem here, which bars jurisdiction, is that the defendant did not act alone, but the involvement with Hoyt was not enough to permit transferring Hoyt\u2019s intentions, whatever they were, to this defendant. Quite simply, neither conspiracy nor aiding and abetting can be made out here. This does not mean jurisdiction will never be obtained in such unique circumstances. For example, if someone stood blindfolded at the point connecting Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado, and fired a machine gun while making a 360 degree turn, then whatever state in which the defendant may murder a person, that state should have jurisdiction over defendant. In that case, the defendant\u2019s intent is sufficient under criminal laws addressing murder. But here, the defendant\u2019s sale of cocaine is insufficient under criminal law regarding conspiracy or aiding and abetting. Defendant\u2019s intent was to sell cocaine in Florida. He did not commit an act that forced or encouraged the cocaine to leave Florida, did not encourage Hoyt to take the cocaine outside Florida, and did not engage in a continuous distribution network with Hoyt. The facts here indicate that defendant was a fill-in seller for Hoyt\u2019s regular scheme, about which defendant had no knowledge. Without additional facts, jurisdiction is inappropriate. The outcome certainly would be different if defendant was Hoyt\u2019s regular supplier, was involved beyond this one transaction, or had discussed Hoyt\u2019s conspiracy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b620-9\"> Interestingly, the record is devoid of evidence that the drugs actually were sold in Michigan, which directly confronts the prosecutor\u2019s statement that \"anybody that intentionally sends drugs to Michigan, <em>have them sold here, </em>is just as liable for having the drugs in our State as those that bring them here and those that sell them . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b620-8\">Boyle, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApRq\">(dissenting). The principle issue that divides the majority and minority opinions is whether the state must show, as a jurisdictional fact, that the defendant intended the drugs he sold in Florida to be distributed in Michigan. Because the harmful consequence that defendant intended and that actually occurred in Michigan was possession of the drugs in Michigan, we would hold that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>the defendant may be tried in a Michigan court for conspiracy to possess and for the possession of cocaine in Michigan on an aiding and abetting theory, where the alleged agreement with, and aid to, the Michigan resident occurred in Florida.

After the arraignment, the district court held an evidentiary hearing on his motion to quash the warrant and complaint for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Regarding the conspiracy charge, the court found that Hoyt and another resident of Michigan agreed that Hoyt would travel to Florida, purchase one kilogram of cocaine, and return to Michigan to divide the cocaine with his friend. The court found that \"the Defendant did have [a] discussion with Randy Hoyt, [and] that they did discuss the sale of cocaine by Defendant to Randy Hoyt for the purpose of transporting it to Michigan to be delivered, sold, possessed . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">In addition, the record reflects that in his statement to police investigators, Hoyt indicated that a later conversation with Blume contemplated the purchase of more cocaine for delivery in Michigan or Chicago, Illinois. The record also indicates that Blume acknowledged having had prior contacts with Hoyt, and that Blume admitted to phone contact with Hoyt in July or August, 1988, a conversation apparently instigated by law enforcement officers some time after the search warrant had been executed in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Regarding the substantive count brought under an aiding and abetting theory, the district court found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">that Mr. Hoyt had possession of cocaine, that he intended to deliver it, sell it, that he obtained that cocaine in Florida from Mr. Blume, that Mr. Blume sold it to him knowing that he was going to transport it to Michigan and sell it. . . ._</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>The Defendant, under the facts as I understand them, did aid and assist Mr. Hoyt in having cocaine in the State of Michigan for the purpose of delivering it.

It held that both charges could be brought because they were the result of acts done in one state that were intended to produce and actually did produce detrimental effects in Michigan. The Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court\u2019s decision in an unpublished opinion per curiam, decided January 15, 1992 (Docket No. 129818) at 1. We granted leave to appeal. 441 Mich 880 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">The majority\u2019s analysis of the evidence obscures the fact that the defendant\u2019s motion to quash the complaint and warrant challenged only the magistrate\u2019s determination of jurisdiction. As such, it is only necessary to determine here whether the warrant was supported by sufficient probable cause to believe that \"(1) an offense has been perpetrated; (2) defendant has committed it; and (3) the magistrate has jurisdiction to act in the case.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Defendant bears the burden of establishing a ground for quashing the complaint and warrant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Thus, while the initial questions presented are the power of the Legislature to proscribe conduct that occurs outside its borders and the intent of the Legislature to give the conspiracy and aiding and abetting statutes extraterritorial effect, the ultimate inquiry is whether the magistrate properly determined jurisdiction to act in the case, which in turn rests on whether the defendant intended to produce a detrimental effect in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">On review of the grant or denial of a motion to quash, we do not weigh the evidence but only determine whether there is any evidence supporting the charge. Where the challenge is to the magistrate\u2019s jurisdiction to act, we review only to determine whether there is any evidence to support the magistrate\u2019s determination that probable cause existed to believe the defendant intended to produce a detrimental effect in Michigan. Disputed issues of fact are to be resolved by a properly instructed jury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ai7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Although discussion of the Legislature\u2019s power to proscribe conduct that occurs outside its borders frequently occurs in the international law arena, the theories of legislative jurisdiction are the same whether applied between the United States and other sovereign nations or between the sovereign states.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Unless a legislature has the power to enact the statute that seeks to proscribe extraterritorial conduct, the state may not enforce it for acts committed outside its territory. Whether the legislature possesses that power depends on various recognized principles on which the power to proscribe extraterritorial conduct is based.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">While neither courts nor commentators agree on the number or names assigned to the principles governing the exercise of legislative criminal jurisdiction,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the most often recognized bases for exercise are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>(1) territorial, where[] jurisdiction is based on the place where the offense is committed; (2) national, where[ ] jurisdiction is based on the nationality of the offender; (3) protective, where[] jurisdiction is based on whether the national interest is injured; (4) universal, which amounts to physical custody of the offender; and (5) passive personality, where[ ] jurisdiction is based or the nationality or national character of the victim. <em>[United States v Smith, </em>680 F2d 255, 257 (CA 1, 1982).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">At common law, criminal jurisdiction was based primarily on the territorial principle. Under this view, because \"each crime has only one situs (or locus) . . . only the place of the situs has jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, if the situs is within the physical borders of a state, the state may subject the perpetrator to prosecution.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>As an aid in pinpointing the situs of the crime, courts divided the territorial principle into \"objective\u201d and \"subjective\u201d bases.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Under the objective territorial principle, the situs \"include[s] the state whose rights have been assailed, including the state\u2019s 'political integrity\u2019 and the 'life, safety, and property of its subjects.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, where the \"life, safety and property\u201d of a state\u2019s citizens are endangered, the Legislature may proscribe conduct that occurs outside the state\u2019s physical borders.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Conversely, under the subjective territorial principle, the situs of the crime for legislative jurisdictional purposes is \"the state in which the offender is located at the time the crime is committed . . . [because] it is that state to which the offender looks in governing his conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, where an actor\u2019s conduct produces detrimental effects in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>another state, the state where the actor was physically located at the time of his conduct would be able to proscribe the conduct. The principles are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, more than one principle may be applicable to a given set of facts.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">As the majority acknowledges, we have recognized exceptions to the general rule against extraterritorial application of state statutes \"as populations and technology progressed and travel between countries and among the states increased to an everyday occurrence . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We have approved the objective territorial principle of criminal jurisdiction,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and have recognized that Michigan may give extraterritorial effect to its criminal laws , where the acts committed outside the state that sought to punish them were intended to have a detrimental effect in our state. In <em>Deur v Newaygo Sheriff, </em>420 Mich 440; 362 NW2d 698 (1984), the plaintiff, a Michigan resident who owned a tractor-trailer rig that lost braking control and fatally injured three persons in Maryland, was indicted by a Maryland grand jury for manslaughter by motor vehicle. The plaintiff was arrested in Michigan, but resisted extradition to Maryland.

In reversing an order on habeas corpus discharging Daily, Justice Holmes, writing for the Court, stated, pp 284-285:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">\"If a jury should believe the evidence and find that Daily did the acts that led Armstrong to betray his trust, deceived the Board of Control, and induced by fraud the payment by the State, the usage of the civilized world would warrant Michigan in punishing him, although he never had set foot in the State until <em>after </em>the fraud was complete. <em>Acts done outside a jurisdiction, but intended to produce and producing detrimental effects within it, justify a State in punishing the cause of the harm as if he had been present at the effect, if the State should succeed in getting him within its </em>power.\u201d (Emphasis added.)[<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Because Michigan\u2019s nonfugitive extradition statute<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> requires an act in Michigan that \"intentionally result[s] in a crime\u201d in the state requesting extradition, and because the Maryland statute allowed prosecution for grossly negligent conduct, the plaintiff was entitled to habeas corpus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Because we have recognized the objective territorial principle of criminal jurisdiction in a different context, we agree with the majority that the Legislature may proscribe conduct that occurs outside our physical borders that is intended to produce, and actually produces, a detrimental effect in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">The conclusion that the Legislature has the authority to enact a statute with extraterritorial effect does not end the inquiry. The statute may only be enforced against conduct that occurs out of state if the Legislature\u2019s intent to give the statute extraterritorial effect is clear.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The statutes in question are silent with regard to their extraterritorial application. We therefore look to their purpose and subject matter to determine the relevant legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">The United States Supreme Court described the appropriate analysis as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-9\">We have in this case a question of statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>construction. The necessary locus, when not specially defined, depends upon the purpose of Congress as evinced by the description and nature of the crime and upon the territorial limitations upon the power and jurisdiction of a government to punish crime under the law of nations. Crimes against private individuals or their property, like assaults, murder, burglary, larceny, robbery, arson, embezzlement and frauds of all kinds, which affect the peace and good order of the community, must of course be committed within the territorial jurisdiction of the government where it may properly exercise it. If punishment of them is to be extended to include those committed outside of the strict territorial jurisdiction, it is natural for Congress to say so in the statute, and failure to do so will negative the purpose of Congress in this regard. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-5\">But the same rule of interpretation should not be applied to criminal statutes which are, as a class, not logically dependent on their locality for the Government\u2019s jurisdiction, but are enacted because of the right of the Government to defend itself against obstruction, or fraud wherever perpetrated, especially if committed by its own citizens, officers or agents. Some such offenses can only be committed within the territorial jurisdiction of the Government because of the local acts required to constitute them. Others are such that to limit their locus to the strictly territorial jurisdiction would be greatly to curtail the scope and usefulness of the statute and leave open a large immunity for frauds as easily committed by citizens on the high seas and in foreign countries as at home. In such cases, Congress has not thought it necessary to make specific provision in the law that the locus shall include the high seas and foreign countries, but allows it to be inferred from the nature of the offense. <em>[United States v Bowman, </em>260 US 94, 97-98; 43 S Ct 39; 67 L Ed 149 (1922).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Construction of criminal statutes to determine extraterritorial application has not been limited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>construction of statutes proscribing fraud or obstruction. For example, the federal courts have applied this method in cases involving conspiracy and illegal possession with intent to distribute narcotics,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and conspiracy to kill a member of Congress and aiding and abetting the killing of a member of Congress.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> However, this Court has held that the Legislature\u2019s power to do so is limited to intentional acts that are intended to have, and that actually do have, a detrimental effect within the state. When detrimental effects are intended and actually occur, the state may punish the actor as if he had been present in the state at the time the acts were performed.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">We conclude that the nature of both conspiracy to commit an offense and aiding and abetting in the commission of an offense is such that inclusion of language making them specifically applicable to conduct that occurred outside the state\u2019s borders is unnecessary. Moreover, neither conspiracy nor aiding and abetting logically require that the conduct that constitutes the agreement or the aid be committed within Michigan\u2019s physical borders.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The textbook definition of conspiracy is a mutual agreement or understanding, express or implied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>between two or more persons to commit a criminal act or to accomplish a legal act by unlawful means.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">An overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is unnecessary<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> because the crime is complete when the agreement is reached. However, to say that the crime is complete when the agreement is reached does not mean that the agreement must occur within Michigan. The crime of conspiracy continues while the parties are engaged in the unlawful enterprise. In other words, it exists until arrest, abandonment, or success.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The crime of conspiracy requires a dual intent: an \"intent to combine with others, and [an] intent to accomplish the illegal objective.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Because intent may be inferred from evidence of the circumstances, acts, and conduct of the parties, \" '[d]irect proof of an agreement is not required, nor is it necessary that a formal agreement be proven.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Furthermore, while \"knowledge is the foundation of intent,\u201d and mere knowledge of a conspiracy or its illegal objective, without more, is not enough to prove intent,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> we may examine the defendant\u2019s conduct to determine whether the defendant pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>vided \"informed and interested cooperation, stimulation, [or] instigation.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ADC\">The agreement to commit a criminal act that is the gist of the offense of conspiracy is punished because of the \"special danger to society presented by group as opposed to individual activity.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-4\">\"Concerted action both increases the likelihood that the criminal object will be successfully attained and decreases the probability that the individuals involved will depart from their path of criminality. Group association for criminal purposes often, if not normally, makes possible the attainment of ends more complex than those which one criminal could accomplish.\u201d <em>[People v Carter, </em>415 Mich 558, 570; 330 NW2d 314 (1982), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>quoting <em>Callanan </em>v <em>United States, </em>364 US 587, 593-594; 81 S Ct 321; 5 L Ed 2d 312 (1961).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Thus, the nature of the offense is clearly not situs based. The agreement to pursue an illegal goal need not occur in Michigan. Moreover, the increased danger to society posed by group association, and its continuing quality, compel the conclusion that the Legislature intended the conspiracy statute to be applied to an agreement that was reached in Florida with intended consequences in Michigan. A contrary result ascribes an intent to the Legislature to abandon protection of Michigan citizens and \"leave open a large immunity for [conspiracies] as easily committed by citizens\u201d in other states as in Michigan.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">The same reasoning applies to the substantive charge brought under the aiding and abetting theory. The aiding and abetting theory is used to connect one person to the illegal action of another.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> It seeks to proscribe \"all words or deeds which may support, encourage or incite the commission of a crime.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Like the agreement in a conspiracy, the aid or encouragement need not logically occur in Michigan, especially where the crime that is aided or encouraged will be committed in Michigan. Thus, the nature and purpose of the statute proscribing aiding and abetting a crime support our conclusion that the Legislature intended it to apply to aid or encouragement given outside our physical borders.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Moreover, pursuant to the statute, one who aids and abets is to be treated in all respects as if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>had directly committed the substantive crime.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> To say that the state may prosecute Hoyt for the substantive offense, but may not prosecute Blume for that offense under an aiding and abetting theory, would be, in effect, to treat Blume as if he had not directly committed the crime. Such an anomalous result is not required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">We reiterated in Deur<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> that an intentional act intended to cause and causing harmful consequences in the forum state is within the reach of the state\u2019s authority. As Deur indicates, the threshold question for assertion of the state\u2019s jurisdiction is whether there is a showing sufficient to permit the court to conclude that the defendant intended to produce a detrimental effect in the forum state. This question is separate from whether the elements of the crime can be made out at the preliminary examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Defendant\u2019s motion to quash the complaint and warrant challenges the magistrate\u2019s conclusion regarding the jurisdiction of the court to issue the warrant and ultimately try him for the offenses charged. As noted, a Michigan court has jurisdiction to try a defendant charged with acts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>occurred outside the geographical boundaries of the state where the defendant intended to cause, and actually caused, a detrimental effect in Michigan. Thus, on review rather than weigh the evidence, we must determine whether there was any evidence to support the issuing magistrate\u2019s conclusion that probable cause existed to believe that the magistrate possessed jurisdiction to act. In other words, was any evidence presented to show that the defendant intended to cause a detrimental effect in Michigan and was any evidence presented to show that a detrimental effect did, in fact, occur in Michigan.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> We believe there was.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">By contrast with the jurisdictional facts in <em>Deur, </em>in the instant case, as in <em>Strassheim, </em>the record supports the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that defendant committed an intentional act, with an intent to produce detrimental effects in Michigan, which did produce such detrimental effects.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The investigating officer testified that defendant knew that Hoyt lived in and intended to return to Michigan. At the very least, defendant\u2019s knowledge, coupled with his alleged delivery of cocaine, supports an inference that the defendant intended that Hoyt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>possess cocaine in Michigan. Because it is unlawful to possess cocaine in Michigan, and because criminal activity is detrimental to the citizens of Michigan, it can fairly be said that the defendant intended a detrimental result in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">However, as defendant\u2019s brief acknowledges, the officer further testified that defendant knew that it was possible that Hoyt would split the cocaine with another person upon his return to Michigan. This additional knowledge supports the inference that the intended detrimental effect was distribution of the cocaine in Michigan by Hoyt. Either way, an intended detrimental effect may be inferred from the evidence presented. Defendant\u2019s conduct allows us to conclude, for the purposes of asserting jurisdiction, that he intended to produce detrimental effects in Michigan. Moreover, officers found cocaine at Hoyt\u2019s apartment and at his business. Hoyt told officers that he had purchased the cocaine from Blume. Thus, evidence was presented to show that Blume\u2019s conduct resulted in Hoyt\u2019s possession of cocaine in Michigan, a detrimental effect. Therefore, evidence to support the magistrate\u2019s determination of jurisdiction to act in the case existed, and it was error for the district court to quash the complaint and warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Whether the defendant introduced evidence for the purpose of negating the existence of the required intent is not dispositive of the motion to quash. Thus, the majority\u2019s observation that it does not appear that defendant knew or intended that Hoyt was going to \"sell\u201d the cocaine in Michigan is a non sequitur. To determine the magistrate\u2019s jurisdiction to act, it is not required that the defendant specifically intended that the drugs be \"sold\u201d in Michigan. All that is required is that the defendant perform an intentional act with knowledge of its harmful consequences, in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>case possession of drugs in Michigan. Therefore, we would hold that under the facts as found by the district court,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> there was subject matter jurisdiction to hear and decide the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">In sum, we would hold that the Legislature possesses the power to proscribe conduct that occurs outside the state where that conduct is intended to produce and actually produces detrimental effects in the State of Michigan. Because statutes proscribing conspiracy and statutes proscribing aiding or encouraging the commission of a crime have as their purpose prevention of dangerous concert of action, and because the nature of each statute is such that the conduct that constitutes a violation of the statute need not logically occur within the physical borders of the State of Michigan, we would hold that the Legislature intended to allow application of the statute to acts that occurred outside the state.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> We would also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>hold that the evidence supports the magistrate\u2019s determination of jurisdiction to act in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">We would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals, reinstate the charges, and remand the case to the district court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b640-6\">Riley and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-8\"> MCL 750.157a; MSA 28.354(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b621-9\"> MCL 333.7401(2)(a)(i); MSA 14.15(7401)(2)(a)(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b621-10\"> Contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, <em>ante, </em>p 482, n 11, defendant has not been charged with conspiracy to deliver narcotics to Hoyt in Florida or in Michigan.

Similarly, if the jury in this case believes that Blume knew that Hoyt would be returning to Michigan to split the cocaine with another, and armed with that knowledge, supplied the cocaine to be split to Hoyt, then the intent to create a detrimental effect in Michigan, here the further distribution of cocaine, would be shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">We also note a conflict among the various states regarding quantum of proof necessary to prove jurisdiction.

For example, courts have created the doctrine of constructive presence in order to allow a state to punish an offender not located within the state when the offender set in motion the events which culminated in a harm in the prosecuting state. <em>Id. </em>The classic formulation of the doctrine of constructive presence is found in <em>Simpson v State, </em>92 Ga 41; 17 SE 984 (1893). In affirming the conviction of a defendant who had been standing in the State of South Carolina at the time he shot at a person in Georgia, the Georgia Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">Of course, the presence of the accused within this State is essential to make his act one which is done in this State; but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>the presence need not be actual. It may be constructive. . . . So, if a man in the State of South Carolina criminally fires a ball into the State of Georgia, the law regards him as accompanying the ball, and as being represented by it, up to the point where it strikes. . . . [T]he act of the accused did take effect in this State. He started across the river with his leaden messenger, and was operating it up to the moment when it ceased to move, and was therefore, in a legal sense, after the ball crossed the State line up to the moment it stopped, in Georgia. <em>[Id. </em>at 43, 46; quoted in Berge, <em>supra </em>at 243-244.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Justice Holmes, dissenting in <em>Hyde v United States, </em>225 US 347, 384; 32 S Ct 793; 56 L Ed 1114 (1912), cautioned against the circular reasoning resulting from the constructive presence fiction. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">To speak of constructive presence is to use the language of fiction, and so to hinder precise analysis.

However, if we were to require that an overt act occurred in Michigan before Michigan could punish the conspiracy designed to have a detrimental effect in Michigan, we \"would have the anomalous requirement that more be shown for jurisdiction than is necessary for conviction of the crime.\u201d <em>United States v Williams, </em>589 F2d 210, 213 (CA 5, 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b633-8\"> See LaFave &amp; Scott, n 11 <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 6.5(e), p 555.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b633-9\"> <em>People v Carter, </em>415 Mich 558, 568; 330 NW2d 314 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b633-10\"> <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>People v Atley, </em>392 Mich 298, 311; 220 NW2d 465 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b633-11\"> <em>Direct Sales Co v United States, </em>319 US 703, 711-712; 63 S Ct 1265; 87 L Ed 1674 (1943); <em>United States v Falcone, </em>109 F2d 579 (CA 2, 1940), aff\u2019d 311 US 205; 61 S Ct 204; 85 L Ed 128 (1940); <em>Atley, </em>n 30 <em>supra </em>at 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">The majority cites <em>Direct Sales </em>and <em>Falcone </em>for the proposition that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>\" ' \"the evidence of knowledge must be clear, not equivocal\u201d \u2019 \u201d and that \"' the inference of such knowledge cannot be drawn merely from knowledge the buyer will use the goods illegally.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 485. What the majority, itself, fails to acknowledge is that in <em>Falcone, </em>the government argued that knowledge of the conspiracy to operate illicit stills and informed cooperation in it could be inferred from sales of goods not illegal in themselves \u2014 sugar, yeast and cans \u2014 to known distillers of alcoholic beverages during prohibition. The court in <em>Falcone </em>disagreed. The suppliers of the unrestricted goods could not be held to be part of the conspiracy without knowledge of the conspiracy to operate the illicit stills and active participation in that goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Later, in <em>Direct Sales, </em>the Court noted that the quantity of proof required to show knowledge of the buyer\u2019s unlawful use of a product was different where the product is inherently harmful. Thus, the Court permitted an inference of knowledge of the misuse of a prescription mail-order narcotic to be drawn from the mail-order company\u2019s quantity sales and sales tactics to a physician who was illegally dispensing the narcotics. In this respect the Court noted that \"[a]ll articles of commerce may be put to illegal ends. But all do not have inherently the same susceptibility to harmful and illegal use. <em>Nor, by the same token, do all embody the same capacity, from their very nature, for giving the seller notice the buyer will use them unlawfully.\u201d Id. </em>at 710. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Both further possession of a kilogram of cocaine and further distribution of a kilogram of cocaine are unlawful. Thus, unlike sales of a prescription narcotic, the nature of cocaine and the quantity allegedly sold, allow the inference that Blume knew of Hoyt\u2019s intended unlawful use.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b634-8\"> <em>Direct Sales Co, </em>n 31 <em>supra </em>at 713.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b634-9\"> <em>Carter, </em>n 29 <em>supra </em>at 569-570.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b635-9\"> <em>United States v Bowman, </em>260 US 94, 98; 43 S Ct 39; 67 L Ed 149 (1922).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b635-10\"> <em>Carter, </em>n 29 <em>supra </em>at 575.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b635-11\"> <em>People v Palmer, </em>392 Mich 370, 378; 220 NW2d 393 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b636-7\"> <em>Carter, </em>n 29 <em>supra </em>at 576.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b636-8\"> The objective territorial principle embraced in <em>Deur </em>\"has been asserted successfully where there was proof that defendant\u2019s actions either produced some effect within the [forum seeking to prosecute], or even if the defendant never performed any act within the [forum], that he was part of a conspiracy in which some coconspirator\u2019s activities took place within [the forum].\u201d <em>Baker, </em>n 24 <em>supra </em>at 138. In other words, if the conspiracy is designed to result in a crime in the forum, and if there is proof of an overt act committed in the forum by at least one coconspirator, the forum will have jurisdiction over the conspiracy. <em>Winter, </em>n 27 <em>supra </em>at 982. \"Under conspiracy doctrine, the forum state has jurisdiction over all conspirators involved in a conspiracy and all criminal acts committed in furtherance of it if any overt act is committed within its bounds by any of the conspirators.\u201d George, n 10 <em>supra </em>at 623.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b637-6\"> The majority would have the prosecutor prove, beyond a reasonable doubt that this intent existed and would have the magistrate act as the trier of fact where intent is disputed.

It reasoned that, under Criminal Procedure 20.20(2)(b), jurisdiction was proper if \" 'the statute defining the offense is designed to prevent the occurrence of a particular effect in this state and the conduct constituting the offense committed was performed with intent that it would have such effect herein.\u2019 \u201d \" '[Particular effect\u2019 \u201d means that the consequences of the conduct \" 'have a materially harmful impact upon the governmental processes or community welfare of a particular jurisdiction . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Possible sales in New York did not satisfy the requirement of a particular effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b639-7\"> This Court has the benefit of a record created on the jurisdictional issue. The United States Supreme Court in <em>Strassheim, supra, </em>looked only to the facts alleged in the indictment for obtaining money by false pretenses. It assumed that if a jury believed the evidence, the defendant could be tried in Michigan, because the facts as alleged in the indictment showed that the defendant intended to produce, and actually produced, a detrimental effect in the state seeking to prosecute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b639-8\"> Defendant argues that before reversing the decision of the district court, the circuit court must first have found that the district court abused its discretion in its findings of fact. We agree with the Court of Appeals: \"[T]he circuit court did not dispute the district court\u2019s findings of fact, but accepted them as valid. The circuit court decision was exclusively based on the finding that the district court erred as a matter of law on the jurisdiction issue.\u201d Slip op, p 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">Defendant also argues that it was error for the circuit court to find that the elements of a conspiracy were established. Again we agree with the Court of Appeals: \"[T]he circuit court hearing was not a preliminary examination but was, as defense counsel conceded, held only to address the issue of whether the district court erred in determining the legal question regarding jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
