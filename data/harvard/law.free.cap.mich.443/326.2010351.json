We are persuaded by the strong precedent favoring arbitration as being consensual that an agreement to arbitrate does not survive expiration of a collective bargaining contract statutorily as a term or condition of employment under the public employment relations act. The obligation to arbitrate grievances postcontract encompasses grievances involving employee rights that accrue or vest under the contract, or situations in which the parties expressly provided for arbitration beyond the term of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">We affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">The Gibraltar school transportation employees, as well as its custodial and maintenance employees, were previously represented in bargaining with the school district by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. Each unit\u2019s contract contained a four-step grievance procedure with arbitration as the final step to resolve \"[a]ny grievance or dispute which may arise between the parties concerning the application, meaning or interpretation\u201d of the agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>ment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although each contract contained a broad automatic renewal clause,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> neither included any specific language providing for survival of arbitration in the event the entire contract expired. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>transportation unit\u2019s contract expired on June 30, 1984, and the custodial and maintenance unit\u2019s contract terminated on June 30, 1985. Although the record is void of any evidence that the contracts were renewed by virtue of the contracts\u2019 automatic renewal provisions, we make the logical inference that they were not, in light of the subsequent election and certification of a new bargaining agent for both labor units.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The Michigan Education Support Personnel Association (mespa) petitioned the Michigan Employment Relations Commission for recognition as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>exclusive bargaining agent for both labor units. The mespa prevailed over the afscme in an August 26, 1985, consent election and was certified as the sole bargaining representative by the merc on September 9, 1985. Negotiations for new contracts between the school district and the mespa began the following day. According to the union\u2019s representative, the school district\u2019s representative verbally assured them that they would \"extend the contracts,\u201d despite the fact that both parties acknowledged that the afscme contracts had expired and both units were currently working without contracts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">On October 18, 1985, the school district offered the mespa a written contract that included a four-step grievance procedure with arbitration as the final step. The provision was conditioned on the union\u2019s agreement to a no-strike clause. At that time, the school district proposed an interim grievance procedure that did not contain arbitration. After the mespa objected to the interim plan, the school district withdrew its proposal and indicated it would adhere to the grievance procedure established under the expired afscme contract, with the exception of arbitration as a final step. The parties continued to negotiate without reaching impasse on any subject of bargaining. Ultimately, agree-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>merits for both units were reached and the contracts ratified by the Gibraltar School Board on October 14, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Meanwhile, the mespa filed several grievances with the school district during the period between October 24, 1985, and February 3, 1986. Citing the provisions of the expired afscme contract, the grievances alleged violations concerning bus run assignments, payment for runs, working hours, payment for layover time, schedule changes, outside employees performing bargaining unit work, and the assignment of a bargaining unit position. Unable to achieve resolution after processing* the grievances through the initial three steps of the afscme procedure, the union filed a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association, claiming a right to arbitration, pursuant to the expired afscme contract.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The school district refused the demands for arbitration, stating that no current labor contract existed between the parties granting the association or any third party the authority to process such demands. It also complained that the written arbitration provisions attached to the union\u2019s arbitration demands were excerpts from the expired afscme contract to which the mespa was not a party. Arbitration of the grievances was stayed pending resolution of the issue of the right to arbitration itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">On February 20 and May 13, 1986, the mespa filed unfair labor practice charges against the school district pursuant to \u00a7 10 of the public employment relations act, 1965 PA 379, as amended, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>MCL 423.210; MSA 17.455(10). Specifically, the union claimed that the parties, by agreement, had been working under the last \"mutually agreed to collective bargaining agreement, dated February 9, 1982, while the parties engage[d] in negotiations for a successor agreement.\u201d The mespa charged that the school district\u2019s refusal to arbitrate grievances were unilateral actions \"without notice and were effectuated in contravention of its statutory duty under the pera to bargain in good faith with Charging Party with respect to wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment and constitute^] a continuing effort by [the Gibraltar School District] to undermine the status of [the mespa] as bargaining representative for the employees represented by [the mespa].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">The charges were consolidated and a hearing conducted before a hearing referee who found that the mespa had no standing to file the charges. He rejected the mespa\u2019s theory that the employer repudiated its contractual obligation to arbitrate, because, by its own terms, the contract had expired before the union was certified as the employees\u2019 bargaining representative. Finding no present or past contractual obligation to be owed by the school district to arbitrate the grievances at issue, the hearing referee dismissed the charges. The merc upheld the hearing referee\u2019s findings and dismissal order.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The mespa appealed as of right in the Court of Appeals, which affirmed in an unpublished per curiam opinion, decided October .17, 1991 (Docket No. 116964). The Court found that the expired agreements were never formally extended by the parties and that the school district had no contractual obligation with the newly certified union to submit the grievances to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">We granted leave to appeal. 440 Mich 889 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"AmI\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"A7y\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\">Before turning to the central issue in this case, we deal briefly with the contention that the mespa lacked standing to enforce the arbitration provisions of the expired contract. We conclude that such a contention is inappropriate for the issue of the statutory obligation to arbitrate. In this context, \"standing\u201d refers to the authority of a newly certified union to litigate rights originally acquired by the predecessor union, usually under a collective bargaining agreement or because of actions or omissions relating to the predecessor union\u2019s status as collective bargaining representative of the unit. In this case, the charging parties were certified after the expiration of the collective bargaining agreements. During this period, the terms and conditions of employment are continued because of the statutory obligation to bargain, <em>Detroit Police Officers Ass\u2019n v Detroit, </em>391 Mich 44, 54-55; 214 NW2d 803 (1974). Grievances that arise after certification of the new union depend on the statutory obligation, not the expired collective bargaining agreement. Any question concerning the authority of the newly certified union to enforce rights granted by the expired agreement is irrelevant. Thus, we reject the claim that the mespa does not have standing to claim a statutory violation and file an unfair labor practice charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The central question posed is the extent to which an arbitration clause of a collective bargaining agreement survives the expiration date of a collective bargaining agreement. This issue was recently addressed by the United States Supreme Court in the context of private sector disputes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>under the National Labor Relations Act, 29 USC 151 <em>et seq.; Litton Financial Printing Div v NLRB, </em>501 US 190; 111 S Ct 2215; 115 L Ed 2d 177 (1991). We have long recognized that Michigan\u2019s public employment relations act, MCL 423.201 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 17.455(1) <em>et seq., </em>is modeled on the nlra. Although not controlling, we look to federal precedent developed under the nlra for guidance in our interpretation of the pera, <em>Central Michigan Univ Faculty Ass\u2019n v Central Michigan Univ, </em>404 Mich 268; 273 NW2d 21 (1978); <em>Pontiac Police Officers Ass\u2019n v Pontiac (After Remand), </em>397 Mich 674; 246 NW2d 831 (1976); <em>Detroit Police Officers Ass\u2019n v Detroit, supra </em>at 53. Thus, <em>Litton </em>is an appropriate place to begin our inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">In <em>Litton, </em>the expired collective bargaining agreement contained a two-step grievance procedure with arbitration as the final step. During the hiatus between contracts, and without consulting the union, the employer eliminated a portion of its operations and laid off workers. The union demanded grievance procedures and arbitration concerning the layoffs pursuant to the terms of its prior contract with the employer. The employer refused to process or arbitrate the grievances. The nlrb upheld the union\u2019s charge of an unfair labor practice and ordered grievance procedures and arbitration. The Supreme Court granted the employer\u2019s petition limited to the issue of the right to arbitration postcontract.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Justice Kennedy\u2019s opinion for the Court differentiates two sources for imposing an obligation on an employer to arbitrate a dispute arising after the expiration date of one collective bargaining agreement but before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>effective date of any successor agreement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> These sources might be called the statutory obligation and the contract obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The statutory obligation is found in \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(5) and 8(d) of the nlra, 29 USC 158(a)(5) and (d), which require an employer to bargain \"in good faith with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As the Court stated in <em>Litton:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">The [nlrb] has determined, with our acceptance, that an employer commits an unfair labor practice if, without bargaining to impasse, it effects a unilateral change of an existing term or condition of employment. See <em>NLRB v Katz, </em>369 US 736; 82 S Ct 1107; 8 L Ed 2d 230 (1962). In <em>Katz </em>the union was newly certified and the parties had yet to reach an initial agreement. The <em>Katz </em>doctrine has been extended as well to cases where, as here, an existing agreement has expired and negotiations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>on a new one have yet to be completed. See, e.g., <em>Laborers Health and Welfare Trust Fund v Advanced Lightweight Concrete Co, </em>484 US 539, 544, n 6; 108 S Ct 830; 98 L Ed 2d 936 (1988). <em>[Litton, </em>111 S Ct 2221.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Among the mandatory subjects of bargaining is grievance resolution, including arbitration, <em>United States Gypsum Co v Int\u2019l Woodworkers of America, CIO, </em>94 NLRB 112, 131 (1951).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While the nlrb has ruled that most mandatory subjects of bargaining are within the <em>Katz </em>rule, it has created several exceptions, among which is grievance arbitration, <em>Hilton-Davis Chemical Co v Int\u2019l Chemical Workers Union, </em>185 NLRB 241 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The United States Supreme Court, with significant deference to the nlrb\u2019s interpretation of the nlra, likewise extended by this Court to the merc,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> summarized and quoted from <em>Hilton-Davis </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">[T]he Board determined that arbitration clauses are excluded from the prohibition on unilateral changes, reasoning that the commitment to arbitrate is a \"voluntary surrender of the right of final decision which Congress . . . reserved to the parties. . . . [Arbitration is, at bottom, a consensual surrender of the economic power which the parties are otherwise free to utilize.\u201d <em>[Hilton-</em>Davis] at 242. The Board further relied upon our statements acknowledging the basic federal labor law policy that \"arbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>tration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.\u201d <em>United Steelworkers of America v Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co, </em>363 US 574, 582; 80 S Ct 1347; 4 L Ed 2d 1409 (1960). See also 29 USC 173(d) (phrased in terms of parties\u2019 agreed upon method of dispute resolution under an existing bargaining agreement.) <em>[Litton, </em>111 S Ct 2222.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">A unanimous court in <em>Litton</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>agreed that there is no statutory right to arbitration under the nlra and refused the invitation to reject the nlrb\u2019s decision, relying almost totally on the consensual nature of arbitration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">We think the Board\u2019s decision in <em>Hilton-Davis Chemical Co, </em>is both rational and consistent with the Act. The rule is grounded in the strong statutory principle, found in both the language of the nlra and its drafting history, of consensual rather than compulsory arbitration. See <em>Indiana &amp; Michigan [Electric Co v Local Union No 1392, Int\u2019l Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, </em>284 NLRB 53, 57-58 (1987)]; <em>Hilton-Davis Chemical Co, supra. </em>The rule conforms with our statement that \"[n]o obligation to arbitrate a labor dispute arises solely by operation of law. The law compels a party to submit his grievance to arbitration only if he has contracted to do so.\u201d <em>Gateway Coal Co v Mine Workers, </em>414 US 368, 374; 94 S Ct 629; 38 L Ed 2d 583 (1974). We reaffirm today that under the nlra arbitration is a matter of consent, and that it will not be imposed upon parties beyond the scope of their agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">In the absence of a binding method for resolution of postexpiration disputes, a party may be relegated to filing unfair labor practice charges with the Board if it believes that its counterpart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>has implemented a unilateral change in violation of the nlra. If, as the Union urges, parties who favor labor arbitration during the term of a contract also desire it to resolve postexpiration disputes, the parties can consent to that arrangement by explicit agreement. Further, a collective-bargaining agreement might be drafted so as to eliminate any hiatus between expiration of the old and execution of the new agreement, or to remain in effect until the parties bargain to impasse. Unlike the Union\u2019s suggestion that we impose arbitration of postexpiration disputes upon parties once they agree to arbitrate disputes arising under a contract, these alternatives would reinforce that statutory policy that arbitration is not compulsory. <em>[Litton, </em>111 S Ct 2222-2223.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">Federal authority is not the only source of guidance on this question. We have the benefit of the decision of the merc in this case, which was decided before the Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>Litton.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The merc was forced to use the principles announced in <em>Nolde Bros, Inc v Local 358, Bakery &amp; Confectionery Workers Union, AFL-CIO, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>430 US 243; 97 S Ct 1067; 51 L Ed 2d 300 (1977), the lead case on contract obligation post collective bargaining agreement, as well as nlrb authority implementing <em>Nolde Bros, </em>and our decision in <em>Ottawa Co v Jaklinski, </em>423 Mich 1; 377 NW2d 668. (1985), which also drew on <em>Nolde Bros. </em>However, the merc, as a matter of interpreting the pera, reached a conclusion that matches Litton\u2019s interpretation of the nlra. Citing with approval <em>Indiana &amp; Michigan, supra, </em>an nlrb decision applying <em>Nolde Bros, </em>the merc stated, \"[A]n employer\u2019s obligation to arbitrate post-contract extends only to those hiatus grievances which involve 'vested or accrued rights,\u2019 \u201d that is, rights under the contract obligation. See part II(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Recognizing our historical inclination to be favorably influenced by decisions of the merc applying the pera, and the persuasive force of federal authority applying the nlra, appellants seek to distinguish the circumstances present in private employment from those of the public sector. They contend:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">While it is true that in the private sector both parties are free to utilize economic power, such a balance does not exist in public employment in Michigan. Under federal law, arbitration is considered the <em>quid pro quo </em>for an agreement not to strike.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Michigan public employees have no legal right to strike, even after the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement, MCL 423.202; MSA 17.455(2). While we acknowledge this truism, we are persuaded both by the structure of the statute and the realities of public sector employment that the merc\u2019s conclusion is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">First, the consideration of the power to strike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>was not the basis for Litton\u2019s adherence to <em>Hilton-Davis Chemical. </em>Rather, the Court was influenced hy \"the strong statutory principle, found in both the language of the nlra and its drafting history, of consensual rather than compulsory arbitration.\u201d <em>Litton, </em>111 S Ct 2222. The consensual nature of grievance arbitration is no less important in this state, as Justice Riley has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-4\">The legal basis underlying [the] policy of judicial deference [in reviewing the merits of an arbitration award] is grounded in contract: the contractual agreement to arbitrate and to accept the arbitral decision as \"final and binding.\u201d Labor arbitration is a product of contract, and, therefore, its legal basis depends entirely upon the particular contracts of particular parties. Arbitration contracts may vary, according to their specific terms, in the scope of the matters entrusted to final and binding arbitration, and in the arbitral authority conferred to resolve disputes concerning such matters. An arbitrator\u2019s jurisdiction and authority to resolve a particular dispute concerning the appropriate interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement derives exclusively from the contractual agreement of the parties; an arbitrator possesses no general jurisdiction to resolve such matters independent of the arbitration contract. <em>[Port Huron Area School Dist v Port Huron Ed Ass\u2019n, </em>426 Mich 143, 150-151; 393 NW2d 811 (1986).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Second, the consideration of the power to strike was only one of three rationales in <em>Hilton-Davis Chemical, supra. </em>The other two were the consensual nature of arbitration and \"the right of final decision which Congress . . . reserved to [the] parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 242. The essential nature of both the nlra and the pera is that the acts provide only a process by which the parties might reach agreement, the power to agree to a proposal remains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>with each party, MCL 423.215; MSA 17.455(15), 29 USC 158(a)(5) and (d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Additionally, and most importantly, the Legislature has made the determination when, after expiration of a collective bargaining agreement, public employees\u2019 lack of the right to strike creates an imbalance of power that is contrary to public interest. It determined that an imbalance affected only certain types of public safety employees, whom it gave the right to interest arbitration in 1969 PA 312; MCL 423.233; MSA 17.455(33). It thus appears that the Legislature did not believe that a purported imbalance in other public sector employment required adjustment. The dissent\u2019s suggestion that we have failed to acknowledge that Act 312 supplements the pera is thus wide of the mark. We do not dispute or fail to acknowledge the purpose of Act 312. Rather, we draw the inference that the Legislature did not intend arbitration to be part of the statutory contract from the fact that it concluded that the danger of strikes required only a limited response not extended to public employees in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Turning to the context of general public sector employment, while the balance of negotiating power is different than in the private sector, we reject the implication that public employees are as disadvantaged by the differences as the charging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>parties suggest. Public employees possess certain rights not enjoyed by private employees. They have the protection of the Due Process Clause in many attributes of their employment, <em>Bd of Regents of State Colleges v Roth, </em>408 US 564; 92 S Ct 2701; 33 L Ed 2d 548 (1972); <em>Perry v Sindermann, </em>408 US 593, 601-602; 92 S Ct 2694; 33 L Ed 2d 570 (1972). Public employers and employee pensions are financially secure in ways not always realized in the private sector. Additionally, employer decisionmakers in the public sector either are popularly elected officials or persons who answer to popularly elected officials. The nature of public service is such that citizens are more likely to have an active interest in a labor dispute involving the education of their children or the collection of the trash than they are in a dispute involving one of many alternate suppliers of commercial goods or services. This public concern, plus access to the decisionmakers, gives the employees a source of direct influence not generally found in the private sector bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">Nor are public employees left without a means of resolving grievances. Grievances can go to the bargaining table to be resolved during negotiations, or perhaps by a retroactivity clause in the new agreement.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In some instances, as suggested in <em>Litton, </em>a grievance itself might be pursued as an unfair labor practice charge._</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>The public employer\u2019s situation, like the public employee\u2019s, is .different from that of the private sector employer. The public employer frequently has less control than its private sector counterpart over its income and expenses. The public employer is dependent on the electorate to approve new revenues from taxes. This frequently results in a situation in which the public employer and its employees find themselves aligned in proposing and supporting requests to the electorate to approve additional tax millages. One salutary effect of these alliances is that the affected public employers and employee unions have additional incentive to negotiate mutually satisfactory resolutions to postexpiration grievances.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Finally, despite the fact that the pera prohibits strikes by public employees, MCL 423.202; MSA 17.455(2), we would be less than candid if we did not acknowledge that in the real world of public employment, public employees occasionally assume the power to strike.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, from the employer\u2019s perspective, there is value in securing a more stringent contractual agreement with the union prohibiting the employees from striking during the term of the contract while affording it more remedies for breach of that agreement than those provided by the pera.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">In summary, while the nature of the balance of negotiating power in the public sector is different than that in the private sector, we find no evidence of legislative intent to strike a different balance regarding arbitration as essentially consensual. Nor can we agree with the charging par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>ties that public employees are so clearly disadvantaged as to compel a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">The accusation that we are abandoning established precedent, <em>post, </em>p 352, is simply wrong. The instant case is one of first impression. The only Michigan authority on this point is the decision of the Court of Appeals and the decision of merc in this and other cases, all of which reach the conclusion that there is no statutory obligation to arbitrate. Moreover, the general state authority relied on by the dissent are decisions of this Court adopting federal labor law in Michigan. The dissent erroneously cites <em>CMU, Jaklinski, DPOA, </em>and <em>PPOA </em>for the proposition that established Michigan precedent exists interpreting the pera and reliance on federal labor interpretations is therefore inappropriate. However, we note that <em>CMU </em>and <em>DPOA </em>relied on <em>NLRB v Borg-Warner Corp, </em>356 US 342; 78 S Ct 718; 2 L Ed 2d 823 (1958), and <em>Fibreboard Paper Products Corp v NLRB, </em>379 US 203; 85 S Ct 398; 13 L Ed 2d 233 (1964). <em>Jaklinski </em>followed <em>Nolde Bros, </em>and <em>PPOA, </em>in which there was no majority opinion, followed <em>DPOA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Nor do we discern in the dissent, any attempt to weigh or explain how the policy considerations underlying the decision in <em>Litton </em>and that of the merc, can be harmonized with its result. These considerations, strongly supported by precedent in state law, are the consensual nature of arbitration and adherence to the essential nature of the nlra and the pera that provide a process by which the parties might reach agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Thus on the basis of legislative intent, a weighing of the policy considerations underlying arbitration, and federal and state precedent, we find that the Court in <em>Litton, </em>and the merc in this case,reached the correct conclusion that there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>statutory duty to arbitrate after expiration of a collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Finally, the syllogism on which the dissent rests, requires additional response. Stripped of the inaccurate observations that precedent and \"the Legislature\u2019s command,\u201d post, p 353, require its result, the dissent rests on the following propositions. Grievance arbitration is a mandatory subject of bargaining. An employer must bargain to impasse regarding mandatory subjects of bargaining. Therefore arbitration survives expiration of the collective bargaining agreement as a statutory term of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">It should be obvious that it does not necessarily follow from the fact that arbitration is a mandatory subject of bargaining, that arbitration is one of those mandatory subjects of bargaining that is a part of the statutory contract. That is the question presented by this case, and the syllogism posed does not address it. Thus, the dissent offers no explanation why it would eliminate the duty imposed by the pera to bargain in good faith over grievances that arise in the absence of a collective bargaining agreement, in favor of resolution by a third-party arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The dissent buttresses its syllogism with reference to the lack of an employer \"quid\u201d for the employees \"quo,\u201d that is historically inaccurate. The pera represents an enlightened legislative approach to public employment that amended prior law. Previously, any public employee who went on strike was deemed to have abandoned the position and all attendant benefits. Criminal sanctions were imposed for inciting, influencing, coercing, or urging another to strike, MCL 423.201 <em>et </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number><em>seq.; </em>MSA 17.455(1) <em>et seq. </em>The pera granted public employees the right to organize and to insist that public employers bargain in good faith over wages, hours, and conditions of employment, while retaining the prohibition on strikes. Thus, if there is any bargain concerning the loss of the power to strike, the \"quid\u201d is the public employer\u2019s obligation to bargain in good faith in return for the continued prohibition of strikes.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The <em>Litton </em>decision and the merc decision are consistent with this approach. Public employers and employees have to bargain in good faith about grievances that arise while there is no collective bargaining agreement and employees have a potential unfair labor practice charge against the employer for unilateral change in working conditions. The pera does not, however, impose arbitration, which is merely a method of determining a dispute involving some other substantive right, on the bargaining process as a term of the statutory contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The second source of an obligation to arbitrate discussed in <em>Litton </em>is the collective bargaining agreement itself. The seminal case on this topic is <em>Nolde Bros, supra. </em>The Court in <em>Nolde Bros </em>held that there may be some disputes that arise after the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement that involve rights granted under the agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>ment. These disputes, governed by the agreement, would still be arbitrable under an arbitration clause of the otherwise expired agreement. The rights are those that the parties intended to last beyond the expiration date of the agreement. The scope of those rights was subject to debate among the lower federal courts, see <em>Ottawa Co v Jaklinski, supra </em>at 15-21, explaining the various approaches. <em>Jaklinski </em>was decided during the debate. For reasons discussed in <em>Jaklinski, </em>a majority of this Court decided that the proper application of <em>Nolde Bros </em>to the pera was that \"the right to grievance arbitration survives the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement when the dispute concerns the kinds of rights which could accrue or vest during the term of the contract.\u201d 423 Mich 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">In <em>Litton, </em>the Court ended at least the initial round of the debate on the scope of <em>Nolde Bros </em>in a fashion identical to our decision in <em>Jaklinski. </em>The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">A postexpiration grievance can be said to arise under the contract only where it involves facts and occurrences that arose before expiration, <em>where an action taken after expiration infringes a right that accrued or vested under the agreement, </em>or where, under normal principles of contract interpretation, the disputed contractual right survives expiration of the remainder of the agreement.[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>] [111 S Ct 2225. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">The charging parties invite us to \"declare that <em>Jaklinski\u2019s </em>concept of 'accrued\u2019 or 'vested\u2019 rights extends to all provisions of an expired agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>which represents the core of the relationship between the parties.\u201d They do not, however, indicate where to draw the line on which rights are or are not \u201ccore,\u201d choosing only to point to rights found by lower federal courts to be accrued or vested, such as vacation days, pensions, health and disability insurance, and seniority. Leaving aside whether these are the types of rights that would be vested in a given case, we note that they are not the types of rights subject to the grievances in this case. The grievances filed on behalf of the transportation unit involved assignment of runs, payment for runs, working hours, payment for layover time, and schedule changes. The grievances filed on behalf of the custodial-maintenance unit involve out-contracting, failure to have a unit member in attendance at a school sponsored event, and assignment of one position. These involve the traditional areas of wages, hours and working conditions, in other words, the mandatory subjects of bargaining. This is identical to one of the approaches we rejected in <em>Jaklinski </em>and the approach for the statutory obligation that we reject above.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The charging parties also argue that the testimony of their witness shows that the parties intended that the collective bargaining agreements were to continue in effect throughout the negotiations. The evidence relates to events that occurred after the expiration of the agreement. It does not show any intent by the signers of the agreements that the agreements provided for any terms to last beyond the expiration date. Thus, any right to arbitrate grievances in this case did not derive from the original agreement in the manner of <em>Nolde Bros. </em>At most, there may have been a temporary side agreement made during negotiations, but the charges filed in this case did <em>not </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>allege a violation of any side agreement and the charging parties did not take exception to the hearing referee\u2019s failure to find such an agreement. We do not believe any contention about a separate agreement is preserved for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The charging parties have not argued that the grievances filed meet the \"accrued or vested\u201d test of <em>Litton </em>and <em>Jaklinski. </em>Thus, we do not discuss that question.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">We hold that the pera does not create a statutory duty to arbitrate grievances arising after the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement. We also find that the grievances filed in this case were not the type that accrued or vested under the previous collective bargaining agreement. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b476-8\">Brickley, Riley, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b455-4\"> AFSCME Custodial and Maintenance Agreement, art 7, p 4 and Transportation Agreement, art VII, \u00a7 1, p 4.

There, a deputy sheriff lost her position after expiration of a contract and after impasse in negotiations led to a petition for interest arbitration under 1969 PA 312, MCL 423.233; MSA 17.455(33). The facts led to three possible sources for an obligation to arbitrate after expiration. The first was that an employer had to maintain mandatory subjects of bargaining, including arbitration, during negotiations until impasse. We stated that \"this line of reasoning . . . logically follows\u201d but rejected the argument because the parties had bargained to impasse. <em>Id. </em>at 13. This statement about the logic of the argument was not an acceptance of the doctrine into Michigan law. The second possible source of the obligation in <em>Jaklinski </em>was the requirement of 1969 PA 312, \u00a7 13, MCL 423.243; MSA 17.455(43), that wages, hours, and other conditions of employment not be changed without consent of the parties during the pendency of Act 312 interest arbitration proceedings. This discussion prompted a dissent. However, it is not relevant to the present case, because Act 312 only applies to certain public safety employees. The third possible source of the obligation discussed in <em>Jaklinski </em>is the <em>Nolde Bros, Inc v Local 358, Bakery &amp; Confectionery Workers Union, AFL-CIO, </em>430 US 243; 97 S Ct 1067; 51 L Ed 2d 300 (1977), contract obligation.
