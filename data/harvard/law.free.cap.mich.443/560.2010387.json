The document was the culmination of months of work, through the 1961 Constitutional Convention, restructuring Michigan\u2019s government to make it more efficient and accountable. Perhaps the biggest need for restructuring was in the executive branch, which, before the new constitution, was composed of so many boards, commissions, and departments that the executive branch lacked any kind of effective coordination or supervision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Indeed, the general consensus at the convention was that there was \"absolutely no rhyme or reason to the structure of the state government.\u201d 2 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, p 1836 (statement of Delegate Martin).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">\u2022 To give the Governor, as its head, some real control over the executive branch, the convention delegates agreed that the executive branch had to be given some logical structure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To provide such structure, the constitution included a provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>mandating that all entities within the executive branch be allocated among and within not more than twenty principal departments.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Legislature was given primary responsibility for this task, but, if it failed, the Governor was given authority to effect the allocation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Governor was also given authority to make changes after the initial organization.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Governor serving at that time did not participate in the initial organization, however, because the Legislature, within its allotted time, enacted the Executive Organization Act (eoa), MCL 16.101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.29(1) <em>et seq., </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>provided the required organization of the executive branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">This case requires us to determine the scope of authority given to the Governor to effect subsequent changes in the structure of the executive branch. Specifically, we are asked whether the Governor, through an executive order not disapproved by the Legislature, may constitutionally transfer the authority, powers, duties, functions, and responsibility of the legislatively created Department of Natural Resources to a new, gubernatorially created dnr. We are also asked whether this issue concerning the Governor\u2019s authority presents a nonjusticiable political question and whether the plaintiffs in the consolidated lawsuit have standing to raise these issues. Finally, we have been asked to determine the validity of Executive Order No. 1992-19 that created the Michigan Environmental Science Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">For the reasons that follow, we hold that the not-for-profit corporate plaintiffs have standing to pursue this lawsuit and that the issues presented are not political questions. We then hold that, under Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7 2, the Governor has the authority to transfer all the authority, powers, duties, functions, and responsibilities of a legislatively created principal department to a gubernatorially created principal department. The constitutional validity of Executive Order No. 1991-31 therefore is sustained. Additionally, we sustain the validity of Executive Order No. 1992-19, which created the Michigan Environmental Science Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">On November 8, 1991, Governor John Engler issued Executive Order No. 1991-31, which essentially abolished the existing dnr and created a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>\"new\u201d department.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The head of the \"new\u201d dnr continued to be the Commission of Natural Resources, but the order gave the Governor exclusive authority to appoint the commission chairperson, who served in that position at the Governor\u2019s will.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Additionally, the order abolished eighteen legislatively established boards and commissions relating to the state\u2019s natural resources and vested their authority in the director of the gubernatorially created \"new\u201d dnr.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-3\">Also on that date, Governor Engler issued Executive Order No. 1991-33, which established the Michigan Environmental Science Board as an independent, autonomous entity within the Department of Management and Budget. The board\u2019s general duties included advising the Governor, the commission, the dnr, and other state agencies about issues affecting the state\u2019s natural resources, assisting the Governor in reviewing state or federal environmental impact statements and coordinating reviews of other state agencies, reviewing the establishment of new standards for permits or operating licenses, reviewing the methodology for establishing permit or operating license conditions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>and reviewing staff recommendations for the approval or denial of permit and license applications. Executive Order No. 1991-33(3)(a)-(e). The board also was given authority to \"make inquiries, studies and investigations, hold hearings and receive comments from the public.\u201d Executive Order No. 1991-33(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">By its terms, Executive Order No. 1991-31 was to become effective sixty days after its issuance.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Before that date, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and other legislators filed a complaint, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the ground that the order exceeded the Governor\u2019s limited legislative authority under the constitution as implemented by the eoa.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Similarly, complaints were filed by the Michigan United Conservation Clubs and the Michigan Environmental Protection Foundation, alleging that the Governor overstepped his authority in issuing Executive Order No. 1991-31. Additionally, the mepf alleged that Executive Order No. 1991-33 was unconstitutional and unlawful because it usurped and intruded upon the rights of the people to an open, accessible, and accountable government. The board, the mepf alleged, would enable the dnr director to make environmental and resource management decisions in the privacy of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>office, without being guided by the principles of the public interest and relevant statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-3\">By stipulation of the parties, the circuit court consolidated the three complaints.. On competing motions for summary disposition, the court ruled almost completely in favor of the plaintiffs and permanently enjoined the Governor from enforcing Executive Order No. 1991-31. Initially, the court ruled that all the plaintiffs had standing to bring their lawsuits. It found beyond challenge the notion that the House Speaker and other legislators have a substantial interest in the orderly administration of government, the funding of principal departments, the administrative checks upon disbursing those funds, and the possible usurpation of legislative power by the executive branch. Furthermore, the court found that the mucc and the mepf had standing pursuant to the court rule that allows a \"domestic nonprofit corporation organized for civic, protective, or improvement purposes\u201d to bring an action to prevent the illegal expenditure of state funds. See MCR 2.201(B)(4)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">In discussing the Governor\u2019s authority to issue Executive Order No. 1991-31, the circuit court noted that the Separation of Powers Clause specifically prohibits one branch of government from exercising powers belonging to another branch unless such an exercise is expressly provided in the constitution. See Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2. The court found that, while the Governor argued that art 5, \u00a7 2 provided the authority for Executive Order No. 1991-31, that provision does not expressly authorize the Governor to create new departments. Therefore, the court found, the Governor had no express authority to exercise the powers that ordinarily belong to the Legislature. As a result, the court concluded, Executive Order No. 1991-31 violated the Separation of Powers Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Moreover, the court pointed out that art 4, \u00a7 52 referring to the powers of the Legislature, lists the conservation and promotion of the state\u2019s natural resources as a \"paramount public concern\u201d within the Legislature\u2019s responsibilities to protect. This reference, the court asserted, provided further evidence to support the conclusion that Executive Order No. 1991-31 was beyond the Governor\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Finally, the court noted that because art 5, \u00a7 2 is not self-executing, it is limited by the bounds of the eoa limiting transfers of departments, boards, commissions, and functions to other \"principal departments) established by this act.\u201d See MCL 16.103(d); MSA 3.29(3)(d). The court was convinced that nothing in the eoa could possibly suggest that the Governor had the authority to abolish an existing department and create a completely new one.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The circuit court concluded that Executive Order No. 1991-31 violated the Separation of Powers Clause and was authorized neither by the state constitution nor the eoa.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Apparently, however, the court did not discuss the viability of Executive Order No. 1991-33.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">The Court of Appeals affirmed in a divided opinion. 195 Mich App 376; 491 NW2d 832 (1992). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>For the same reasons espoused by the trial court, the Court of Appeals held that all the plaintiffs had standing. <em>Id. </em>at 381-383. The Court also agreed with the trial court that, by issuing Executive Order No. 1991-31, the Governor violated the separation of powers doctrine and exceeded his constitutional authority because no provision expressly authorized him to create a new principal department. <em>Id. </em>at 385-389. In making such a ruling, the Court distinguished the case at bench from our decision in <em>Soap &amp; Detergent Ass\u2019n v Natural Resources Comm, </em>415 Mich 728; 330 NW2d 346 (1982), in which we upheld a gubernatorial transfer of the Water Resources Commission\u2019s rule-making power to the dnr. 195 Mich App 388. <em>Soap &amp; Detergent </em>was distinguishable, the Court found, because the Governor was merely transferring functions and, here, the Governor eliminated whole functions and created an entirely new dnr. Such activity, the Court continued, clearly disregards the limited nature of the executive branch\u2019s legislative authority recognized in <em>Soap &amp; Detergent. </em>195 Mich App 388, citing <em>Soap &amp; Detergent, </em>415 Mich 752. Essentially, the Court of Appeals agreed with the results and reasoning of all the trial court rulings.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-3\">The Court of Appeals also addressed two issues the trial court did not really confront.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> First, the Court rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 issues raised nonjusticiable political questions. 195 Mich App 383-384. The defendants had argued that the doctrine of equitable discretion should be applied because the legislative plaintiffs could obtain substantial relief from fellow legislators through the enactment, repeal, or amendment of a statute. <em>Id. </em>at 383. However, the Court found that the plaintiffs could not obtain substantial relief because, even if the Legislature rejected, overturned, or reduced the effectiveness of Executive Orders Nos. 1991-31 and 1991-33, there was nothing to prevent the Governor from attempting another executive reorganization. <em>Id. </em>at 384. Moreover, the Court found, the question presented, whether the Governor exceeded his authority to exercise limited legislative powers, was a matter of constitutional interpretation and, as such, was a proper matter for the Court\u2019s consideration because it was the ultimate interpreter of the constitution. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Second, the Court considered the validity of Executive Order No. 1991-33. The Court noted that part of the board\u2019s duties included reporting its findings to the \"new dnr\u201d and advising it on issues affecting the management of the state\u2019s natural resources. See, generally, Executive Order No. 1991-33(3). Having found Executive Order No. 1991-31 unconstitutional, the Court noted that there was no \"new dnr\u201d to which the board could report or advise. As a result, the Court concluded that Executive Order No. 1991-33 contemplated and assumed the implementation of Executive Order No. 1991-31 and, having found Executive Order No. 1991-31 to be unconstitutional, it ruled that Executive Order No, 1991-33 could not be implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Judge Reilly dissented from that portion of the Court of Appeals holding that the Governor exceeded his constitutional authority in issuing Executive Order No. 1991-31. 195 Mich App 396. She argued that there was no basis for the majority\u2019s position that provisions of the eoa could limit the Governor\u2019s authority under art 5, \u00a7 2. She asserted that this Court in <em>Soap &amp; Detergent, supra, </em>did not hold that the Governor\u2019s legislative power to reorganize the executive branch could be limited or denied by an act of the Legislature. <em>Id. </em>at 400. On the contrary, notwithstanding the separation of powers doctrine, the Governor was given broad concurrent legislative power in the limited area of organizing and reorganizing the executive branch. <em>Id. </em>at 401-402. The Legislature\u2019s remedy, if it disapproved of the executive proposal, was to exercise its veto powers. <em>Id. </em>at 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-3\">Judge Reilly also disagreed with the majority\u2019s decision that Executive Order No. 1991-33 could not be implemented. <em>Id. </em>at 415-416. She noted that the language of Executive Order No. 1991-33 made it clear that the board\u2019s role was strictly advisory in nature. <em>Id. </em>The board was only authorized to make findings and recommendations to the dnr director. <em>Id. </em>at 416. As a result, the Governor had not delegated decision-making powers to the board because, notwithstanding the advice and recommendations from the board, only the dnr director had final decision-making authority. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">This Court granted defendants\u2019 motion for leave to appeal on January 6, 1993. The order limited the issues on appeal to the plaintiffs\u2019 standing, the existence of a political question, and the constitutionality of Executive Order No. 1991-31. The mepf\u2019s cross appeal was limited to the issue of the constitutionality of Executive Order No. 1991-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The concept of standing represents a party\u2019s interest in the outcome of litigation that ensures sincere and vigorous advocacy.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, a commitment to vigorous advocacy alone is not enough. Rather, \"[standing requires a demonstration that the plaintiff\u2019s substantial interest will be detrimentally affected in a manner different from the citizenry at large.\u201d <em>House Speaker v State Administrative Bd, </em>441 Mich 547, 554; 495 NW2d 539 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals found that the mucc and mepf had standing to sue under MCR 2.201(B)(4). We agree. The court rule allows a domestic nonprofit corporation organized for civic, protective, or improvement purposes to bring an action to prevent the illegal expenditure of state funds.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The mepf is a nonprofit Michigan corporation whose purposes are to evaluate legal issues and bring environmental litigation on issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>of statewide importance. The mucc is a nonprofit Michigan corporation whose purposes are to further the cause of the environment and conservation in all its phases, to promote and encourage the intelligent use of resources, to promote conservation education programs, and to protect and defend the rights of citizens to keep and bear arms. We find that these corporations are organized for civic, protective, or improvement purposes and, as such, are the type of plaintiff the court rule envisioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-3\">Moreover, it fairly can be said that this lawsuit was brought to prevent the illegal expenditure of state funds. For purposes of determining standing, we must \"accept as true all material allegations of the complaint, and must construe the complaint in favor of the complaining party.\u201d <em>Warth v Seldin, </em>422 US 490, 501; 95 S Ct 2197; 45 L Ed 2d 343 (1975). Therefore, for this limited purpose, we assume that the Governor had no authority to create a \"new\u201d dnr, and any money spent by such an agency would be done illegally. As a result, we find that the plaintiffs can be said to have brought this lawsuit to prevent the expenditure of state funds by a group having no lawful authority to make such expenditures. On this basis, plaintiffs mucc and mepf have standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">Because we find that the mucc and mepf have standing to bring this lawsuit, we need not decide whether the remaining plaintiffs have legislator standing.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In view of the fact that the organizational standing allows us to decide all the issues raised by all the parties, our standing discussion need go no further._</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The political question doctrine requires analysis of three inquiries: \"(i) Does the issue involve resolution of questions committed by the text of the Constitution to a coordinate branch of Government? (ii) Would resolution of the question demand that a court move beyond areas of judicial expertise? (iii) Do prudential considerations [for maintaining respect between the three branches] counsel against judicial intervention?\u201d <em>Goldwater v Carter, </em>444 US 996, 998; 100 S Ct 533; 62 L Ed 2d 428 (1979) (Powell, J., concurring) (citing <em>Baker v Carr, </em>369 US 186, 217; 82 S Ct 691; 7 L Ed 2d [1962]). The fact that this case involves \"political\u201d issues is not determinative of the need for this Court to defer to the Governor on political question grounds. Rather, as noted in <em>Baker, </em>\"[t]he doctrine of which we treat is one of 'political questions,\u2019 not one of 'political cases.\u2019 The courts cannot reject as 'no law suit\u2019 a bona fide controversy as to whether some action denominated 'political\u2019 exceeds constitutional authority.\u201d 369 US 217.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">First, the language of the constitution alone cannot resolve the issues this case presents. The state constitution does not mention gubernatorial authority to completely abolish the existing dnr and create a new department, nor does it commit to one branch of government the power to determine the scope of such authority. We cannot, therefore, look at the language in isolation, but must apply the rules of constitutional construction to the express language. Second, resolution of this case would not require this Court to move beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>its areas of expertise. On the contrary, \"[deciding whether a matter has in any measure been committed by the Constitution to another branch of government, or whether the action of that branch exceeds whatever authority has been committed, is itself a delicate exercise in constitutional interpretation, and is a responsibility of this Court as ultimate interpreter of the Constitution.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>369 US 211. Of course, this statement is true not only for the branches of the federal government, but for the branches of Michigan\u2019s state government as well.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Determining whether the state constitution impliedly authorizes the Governor to abolish the DNR-and create a new department may not be easy, \"but it only requires us to apply normal principles of interpretation to the constitutional provisions at issue.\u201d See <em>Goldwater, </em>444 US 999 (Powell, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">Finally, there are no prudential considerations that keep us from resolving the issues this case presents. Interpreting the constitution does not imply a lack of respect for another branch of government, even when that interpretation differs from that of the other branch. <em>Id. </em>Where it is otherwise proper, virtually no court, including this Court, is hesitant to render its interpretation of a constitutional or statutory provision, even though another branch of government has already issued a contrary interpretation. See, e.g., <em>United States v Nixon, </em>418 US 683; 94 S Ct 3090; 41 L Ed 2d 1039 (1974); <em>Senate Select Comm on Presidential Cam</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number><em>paign Activities v Nixon, </em>162 US App DC 183; 498 F2d 725 (1974); <em>Soap &amp; Detergent, supra. </em>On the basis of our analysis of these inquiries, we are convinced that the issues presented in this case are justiciable political questions. Moreover, because our authority to reach the merits of this case is not based on the standing of the legislator plaintiffs, we find it unnecessary to discuss the doctrine of equitable discretion.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> There is, therefore, nothing to preclude us from reaching the merits of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The plaintiffs argue that Executive Order No. 1991-31 goes beyond the limited grant of authority from art 5, \u00a7 2 and represents an unconstitutional usurpation of legislative powers. On the contrary, on the basis of the rules of constitutional construction, we find that Executive Order No. 1991-31 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>represents the type of legislative authority expressly given to the Governor. Moreover, neither the separation of powers doctrine nor the eoa can be interpreted to prevent the Governor from exercising his constitutionally mandated legislative powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">There are two very important rules that must be considered when construing constitutional provisions. The first rule requires that the interpretation given the provision be \" 'the sense most obvious to the common understanding\u2019 the one that \" 'reasonable minds, the great mass of people themselves, would give it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Soap &amp; Detergent, </em>415 Mich 745, quoting <em>Traverse City School Dist v Attorney General, </em>384 Mich 390, 405; 185 NW2d 9 (1971); <em>Council No 11, AFSCME v Civil Service Comm, </em>408 Mich 385, 405; 292 NW2d 442 (1980). The provision relevant here, the second paragraph of art 5, \u00a7 2, clearly provides: \"the governor may make changes in the organization of the executive branch or in the assignment of functions among its units which he considers necessary for efficient administration.\u201d As Judge Reilly pointed out in dissent in the Court of Appeals, this provision is clear and unambiguous. The Governor has been given express authority to effect something as limited as a transfer of functions among executive branch entities or as broad as alterations in the very structure of the executive branch. Assuming additional requirements are met, such changes may be made even if they involve changes in the law.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The only constitutional limitation placed on the Governor is that the change cannot have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>effect of exceeding the limit of twenty departments within the executive branch.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">We find that the types of changes the Governor made in Executive Order No. 1991-31 are the types contemplated by the clear language of art 5, \u00a7 2. By transferring all the authority, powers, duties, functions, and responsibilities of the dnr into a new dnr, the Governor made a change in the organization of the executive branch. Granted, the change is a significant one, but a constitutional change nonetheless. Executive Order No. 1991-31 represents changes in the manner in which the executive branch handles a vast array of natural resource concerns. We conclude that interpreting Executive Order No. 1991-31 as a \"change[ ] in the organization of the executive branch\u201d gives the meaning to art 5, \u00a7 2 that is most consistent with the \"common understanding\u201d of the provision and is the interpretation that \"reasonable minds, the great mass of people themselves, would give it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The plaintiffs concede that had the Legislature not initially allocated the executive branch into the twenty constitutionally mandated departments the Governor would have had the authority to do so under \u00a7 12 of the Schedule and Temporary Provisions.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The plaintiffs acknowledge that the Governor\u2019s authority in this respect was coequal with that of the Legislature. Because the Legislature acted within its allocated time, however, the plaintiffs contend that the Governor\u2019s legislative authority was significantly diminished. On the contrary, the very language of art 5, \u00a7 2 enables the Governor to enact laws affecting the executive branch, just as the Legislature can. Article 5, \u00a7 2 provides that \"[subsequent to the initial allocation . . . [w]here [the Governor\u2019s] changes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>[in the organization of the executive branch or in the assignment of functions among its units] require <em>the force of law, </em>they shall be set forth in <em>executive orders </em>and submitted to the legislature.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The constitution, then, specifically recognizes that, where the Governor feels compelled to make certain changes within the executive branch, he has authority, through the executive order procedure, in effect, to enact laws to carry out those changes. The only way to preclude such changes is through a properly supported legislative veto.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In other words, after the initial executive branch organization, the Governor\u2019s reorganization powers are equal to the Legislature\u2019s initial and subsequent reorganization powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-3\">The various plaintiffs would also have us believe that the types of changes the constitution envisioned are limited to changes like the ones made in <em>Soap &amp; Detergent, supra. </em>In that case, we found that the Governor, by executive order, had the authority to transfer the Water Resources Commission\u2019s rule-making authority to the nrc. 415 Mich 765. This represents, however, only a change \"in the assignment of functions among its units . . . .\u201d To say that <em>Soap &amp; Detergent </em>is an example of the only type of authority the Governor has to effectuate changes in the executive branch is to completely ignore the remaining part of art 5, \u00a7 2, which allows the Governor to make changes \"in the organization of the executive branch . . . .\u201d Such an interpretation would violate the constitutional construction rule that requires that a provision be interpreted to give reasonable effect to all, not just some, of its parts. Alan v Wayne <em>Co, </em>388 Mich 210, 277; 200 NW2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>628 (1972), citing <em>People v Mahaney, </em>13 Mich 481 (1865).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\">The plaintiffs also argue that the constitution clearly and unambiguously vested in the Legislature the authority to preserve and protect the state\u2019s natural resources.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> While this argument is true, it is also true, as Judge Reilly pointed out, that \"[t]he language does not state that the organization and administration of an executive agency, having the responsibility for effectuating legislation protecting our natural resources, is placed under the <em>sole </em>control of the Legislature.\u201d 195 Mich App 407 (emphasis added). The importance of protecting the state\u2019s natural resources does not mean that such protection should be dominated by one branch of government rather than another. Because we find that the common understanding of art 5, \u00a7 2, encompasses the Governor\u2019s actions in Executive Order No. 1991-31, we also find that art 4, \u00a7 52 must be understood as not being a limitation on the Governor\u2019s concurrent legislative authority to reorganize the executive branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Our interpretation of art 5, \u00a7 2 is strengthened by the second important rule of constitutional construction, which requires consideration of \" 'the circumstances surrounding the adoption of the constitutional provision and the purpose sought to be accomplished ....\u2019\u201d <em>Soap &amp; Detergent, </em>415 Mich 745, quoting <em>Traverse City School Dist, supra, </em>384 Mich 405. Of course, the most instructive tool for discerning the circumstances surrounding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>the adoption of the provision is the floor debates in the Constitutional Convention record. However, we have noted previously that consideration of the debates is limited because \"[t]hey are individual expressions of concepts as the speakers perceive them (or make an effort to explain them). Although they are sometimes illuminating, affording a sense of direction, they are not decisive as to the intent of the general convention (or of the people) in adopting the measures.\u201d <em>Regents of the Univ of Michigan v Michigan, </em>395 Mich 52, 59-60; 235 NW2d 1 (1975). Nevertheless, we have said that they are particularly helpful \"when we find in the debates a recurring thread of explanation binding together the whole of a constitutional concept.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">The Convention Record documents the extensive discussion among delegates of art 5, \u00a7 2, particularly that portion of the provision, the second paragraph, dealing with the Governor\u2019s authority to effect subsequent changes in the executive branch. The delegates generally agreed that there needed to be an executive reorganization procedure, but they did not agree about how easy it should be for the Legislature to disapprove a reorganization plan.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The discussion deals specifically with what was called the \"Bentley amendment,\u201d which would have made it easier for the Legislature to reject an executive reorganization proposal.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In a general sense, the discussion recognized that, without the amendment, the Governor would have tremendous legislative authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>enact changes in the executive branch.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>amendment\u2019s proponents, then, recognized the amendment as a significant check upon that authority.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> We find that the fact that the Bentley <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>amendment was subsequently defeated<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> evidences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>the convention\u2019s recognition, as well as that of the general population that ratified the constitution without the amendment, that art 5, \u00a7 2 was intended to and did in fact bestow upon the Governor considerable authority to reorganize the executive branch.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The Convention Record, therefore, is a recurring thread of explanation that strengthens our conclusion that art 5, \u00a7 2 encompasses the types of changes the Governor made in Executive Order No. 1991-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-3\">A third rule of constitutional construction requires us, if possible, to avoid an interpretation that creates a constitutional invalidity. <em>Council No 11, supra, </em>408 Mich 405; <em>Traverse City School Dist, supra, </em>384 Mich 406, citing <em>Marbury v Madison, </em>5 US (1 Cranch) 137, 175; 2 L Ed 60 (1803) (\"If any other construction would render the clause inoperative, that is an additional reason for rejecting such other construction\u201d). If we interpret art 5, \u00a7 2 to prohibit the Governor from effecting a reorganization plan involving more than merely transferring functions between units, we would invalidate that part of the second paragraph that allows him to \"make changes in the organization of the executive branch.\u201d On the contrary, an interpretation that allows the Governor to make such changes avoids constitutional invalidity and is consistent with other rules of constitutional construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The plaintiffs argue that, by enacting Executive Order No. 1991-31, the Governor has violated the separation of powers doctrine, as articulated in art 3, \u00a7 2. They argue that the Governor has attempted to exercise powers that were given by the constitution exclusively to the Legislature. We find this argument to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2 provides: \"[T]he powers of government are divided into three branches: legislative, executive and judicial. No person exercising powers of one branch shall exercise powers properly belonging to another branch <em>except as expressly provided in this </em>constitution.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Having already decided that art 5, \u00a72 gives the Governor authority to make the types of changes made in Executive Order No. 1991-31, we find that this provision allows the Governor to come within the exception emphasized above. See <em>Soap &amp; Detergent, </em>415 Mich 752 (\"where, as in art 5, \u00a7 2, the constitution explicitly grants powers of one branch to another, there can be no separation of powers problem\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">We are simply unpersuaded that allowing the Governor to make the kinds of changes contemplated in Executive Order No. 1991-31 violates the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>separation of powers doctrine.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Rather, we find that art 5, \u00a7 2 authorizes the Governor to make relatively broad changes, as long as those changes are made within the executive branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">As a final matter, there seems to be some confusion between the parties and in the courts below regarding whether art 5, \u00a7 2 is self-executing or whether it requires some sort of legislative implementation. Plaintiffs and the lower courts rely primarily on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>McDonald v Schnipke, </em>380 Mich 14; 155 NW2d 169 (1968), for their assertion that art 5, \u00a7 2 is not self-executing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>This assertion is only partially correct. All of the significant discussion of art 5, \u00a7 2 in <em>McDonald </em>related to the first paragraph, that is, the Legislature\u2019s initial organization of the executive branch into twenty departments. It must be assumed, therefore, that the Court\u2019s conclusion that art 5, \u00a7 2 is not self-executing related only to the Legislature\u2019s initial organization. Significantly, we did not find that the eoa applied to the second paragraph of art 5, \u00a7 2, relating to subsequent gubernatorial reorganizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Plaintiffs also argue that in <em>Soap &amp; Detergent, supra, </em>we reaffirmed the implication that all of art 5, \u00a7 2 requires legislative implementation. Admittedly, because that case dealt with subsequent gubernatorial changes, our statement that the <em>McDonald </em>Court held that art 5, \u00a7 2 required legislative implementation could extend the requirement to the second paragraph of art 5, \u00a7 2. However, our decision in <em>Soap &amp; Detergent </em>did not intend such an extension. Such a conclusion is clear from our recognition that the Governor should, but need not, follow the eoa procedures when issuing a reorganization plan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-6\">The fair implication of <em>[McDonald] </em>is that the Governor, in exercising his powers, <em>should </em>use the transfer mechanism established in the Executive Organization Act, i.e., the provisions regarding Type i through Type m transfers and the relationship between the departments and the transferred agencies. [415 Mich 750. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">In support of the conclusion that the Governor should utilize the eoa, we cited in <em>Soap &amp; Detergent </em>several examples of reorganization plans in which the Governor utilized the eoa\u2019s different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>types of transfers.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> However, former Governor Romney\u2019s amicus curiae brief cites several examples of reorganization plans in which the Governor did not utilize the eoa\u2019s transfer mechanisms.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>conclude that this Court has never held that the second paragraph of art 5, \u00a7 2, requires legislative implementation. While the Governor should utilize the transfer mechanisms of the eoa, and in the case of Executive Order No. 1991-31, he did, he is not bound to follow such procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">We believe that the constitution itself supports the conclusion that the <em>second </em>paragraph of art 5, \u00a7 2 <em>is </em>self-executing. The first paragraph, providing for the initial organization, provides that \"[a]ll executive and administrative offices, agencies and instrumentalities of the executive branch of state government .... shall be allocated <em>by law </em>among and within not more than 20 principal departments\u201d (emphasis added). There is, however, no similar requirement for legislative implementation in paragraph 2. We must conclude, therefore, that the Governor needs no legislative implementation to effect his executive branch reorganization plans under art 5, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> As we have previously stated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>the Governor may, and maybe even should, follow the procedures outlined in the eoa, but he is not constitutionally bound to do so.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aa9\">In any event, even if all of art 5, \u00a7 2 was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>self-executing and the eoa was the necessary implementing legislation, it could not constitutionally be interpreted as limiting the Governor\u2019s authority under art 5, \u00a7 2. Once the constitution has granted specific authority to one branch of government, the Legislature cannot subsequently take it away. <em>Council No 11, </em>408 Mich 408 (\"Since that grant of power is from the Constitution, any executive, legislative or judicial attempt at incursion into that 'sphere\u2019 would be unavailing\u201d); <em>Pillon v Attorney General, </em>345 Mich 536, 547; 77 NW2d 257 (1956) (\"Neither the legislature, nor this Court, has any right to amend or change a provision in the Constitution\u201d). For this reason, to the extent that the plaintiffs argue that the eoa prohibits the Governor from enacting Executive Order No. 1991-31, plaintiffs\u2019 argument is completely without merit.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> If constitutional integrity is to be maintained, the Governor must be allowed to exercise his constitutional authority to reorganize the executive branch free from interference other than a properly supported legislative veto.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The Court of Appeals ruled that Executive Order No. 1991-33 could not be implemented b\u00e9cause it assumed the implementation of Executive Order No. 1991-31. The Governor did not appeal this ruling, but instead issued Executive Order No. 1992-19, which rescinded the earlier order. The subsequent order is only different from Executive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Order No. 1991-33 in that it added terms of office for the board members, and the word \"new\u201d no longer appears before \"dnr.\u201d Technically, the rescission of Executive Order No. 1991-33 moots the question of its validity. See <em>McBroom v City of Flint, </em>266 Mich 679, 681; 254 NW 468 (1934). The mepf persists in its cross appeal, however, and argues that Executive Order No. 1991-33 is unconstitutional and illegal for reasons not addressed by the Court of Appeals, and that these reasons similarly support the invalidation of Executive Order No. 1992-19. Even though this order is not technically before us, the overall issue is, and, in the interest of judicial economy and resolving an important public question, we find that the validity of Executive Order No. 1992-19 should be resolved in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-3\">For the same reason the Court of Appeals found it invalid, we sustain the validity of Executive Order No. 1992-19. Having decided that Executive Order No. 1991-31 properly creates a \"new\u201d dnr, Executive Order No. 1992-19 properly establishes an advisory board designed to advise that department. Whatever the wisdom of allowing such a potentially strong political influence over the dnr and its director is an issue not properly before this Court. Suffice it to say that, not only is Executive Order No. 1991-31 a constitutional expression of the Governor\u2019s authority, but, a fortiori, Executive Order No. 1992-19 similarly represents a legitimate exercise of gubernatorial authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">Even if the board, engaged in illegal activity, however, such activity would not affect the validity of the board\u2019s creation. See <em>Harrington v Tate, </em>435 Pa 176, 181; 254 A2d 622 (1969).<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> On the contrary, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>it should be assumed that an otherwise properly established board will carry out only those functions that were assigned to it. Moreover, contrary to the mepf\u2019s argument, simply because the board may not be subject to the Open Meetings Act or the Freedom of Information Act,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> this is not a basis for invalidating the board. Whether such executive advisory bodies should be subjected to greater public scrutinj^ is a matter of legislative, not judicial, concern. For present purposes, the fact that Executive Order No. 1992-19 represents a legitimate expression of the Governor\u2019s authority to create advisory bodies for executive branch entities sufficiently compels the conclusion that the Governor has not wrongfully delegated rule-making authority to the Environmental Science Board. As a result, the board is a proper advisory body, and the validity of the order is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">We conclude that the not-for-profit corporate plaintiffs have standing to pursue this lawsuit to prevent the illegal expenditure of state funds. The issues in this case are justiciable political questions and are matters properly before this Court. We also conclude that Executive Order No. 1991-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>31 makes the kinds of \"changes in the organization of the executive branch\u201d contemplated by art 5, \u00a7 2 of the state constitution. Finally, we conclude that Executive Order No. 1992-19 is a properly issued executive order and does not wrongfully delegate rule-making authority to the advisory board created by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-3\">The decisions of the circuit court and Court of Appeals are reversed and the injunction permanently enjoining the Governor from enforcing Executive Order No. 1991-31 is dissolved.</p>\n<judges id=\"b721-4\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Levin, Boyle, Riley, Griffin, and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b688-7\"> Indeed, Delegate Bentley noted that \"[t]he structure [of the executive branch] is incredibly and unnecessarily complex and, in terms of direct authority and administrative control, the governor is chief executive in name only.\u201d 2 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, p 1837.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b688-8\"> As one convention delegate stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-9\">[Reorganization is a must if the governor is to have a structure of government such that he can maintain contact with the heads of his principal departments in such a way as to not only know what is going on but to be able to give some supervision and direction to the functioning of state government.

It seems to me if you try to depend on the legislature to accomplish rational administrative reorganization you are never going to get it done.

[2 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, p 1846.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\"><em>Mr. Hutchinson: </em>[T]his is a tremendous political power, this power to reorganize. And I am not willing to agree, offhand, that just because the governor thinks that a particular reorganization is in the best interests of the government, that that necessarily makes it so. I think that the governor also can make some mistakes or be misled, or be influenced by groups or be influenced by considerations, which, in the minds of other people, might not be in the best interests of the state.

I am not here to say that that would customarily happen, but I can envision that it might. It was such kinds of concentration of political power in the hands of people overseas in Europe which completely destroyed liberty. I don\u2019t think that the people of Michigan would let it go that far, knowingly, but I would hate to see you write into our state constitution a system where constitutionally such strange things could be brought about under the guise of governmental reorganization.

It is the complete subjugation of democracy. On the other hand, when the legislative gets all powerful \u2014 we have examples in the world of that \u2014 democracy is not destroyed, it is preserved. ... I cannot vote for anything that would be voting against democracy, against the opportunity of the people to express themselves, and they can express themselves much more readily through the legislature than they can through the governor.
