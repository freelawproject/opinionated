For the reasons stated below, we hold that the subsequent prosecutions are not barred by the United States or Michigan Constitutions; however, we also hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>that the defendants are entitled to relief from the convictions resulting from the first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Defendants were convicted of armed robbery,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> assault with intent to commit murder,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and two counts of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in December 1983. The robbery occurred in the City of Troy on May 5, 1983. The victim was able to produce only one dollar. He was shot once in the heart and once in the abdomen, and then thrown headfirst into a sewer to die. The victim survived.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">More than four years later, after numerous surgeries, the implementation of a number of pacemakers, many tests, and medication, the victim, Mr. Jeffrey Dudley, was apparently attempting to lead a \"normal\u201d life.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At a family gathering on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>June 28, 1987, the victim was participating in a two-on-two, half-court basketball game for between sixty and ninety minutes. During the course of the game an argument ensued and turned to fisticuffs, quickly ending when Mr. Dudley began having convulsions. He died shortly thereafter._</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>An autopsy revealed that the cause of death was a result of the permanent damage to Mr. Dudley\u2019s heart caused by the gunshot wound inflicted in May 1983.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendants Harding and Bush were then charged with statutory felony murder<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and another count of felony-firearm. Motions to dismiss the charges on the basis of double jeopardy were denied in the district and circuit courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">During a joint trial with separate juries, defense counsel vehemently argued that there were intervening events that broke the chain of causation, namely, the passage of time and the failure to refrain from engaging in strenuous activity. Harding was found guilty of felony murder and not guilty of felony-firearm. Bush was found guilty of felony murder and felony-firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">The Court of Appeals consolidated both, appeals. It held, inter alia, that the prosecution and conviction of defendants of felony murder were not precluded by double jeopardy, but that Bush\u2019s second conviction and sentencing for felony-firearm were. The Court further held that both defendants\u2019 prior convictions and sentences for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>armed robbery and assault with intent to commit murder, in light of the felony murder conviction, were violative of the protection from double punishment and were to be vacated and set aside, and that the time served by defendants as a result of their earlier convictions was to be credited to the sentences imposed for felony murder.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">The double jeopardy provision of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution states that \"[n]o person shall ... be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb . . . .\u201d This provision is applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Benton v Maryland, </em>395 US 784; 89 S Ct 2056; 23 L Ed 2d 707 (1969). The double jeopardy guarantee protects against successive prosecutions for the same offense and protects against multiple punishments for the same offense. <em>North Carolina v Pearce, </em>395 US 711, 717; 89 S Ct 2072; 23 L Ed 2d 656 (1969). The protection of each interest has operated in distinct ways, and the analysis utilized in fashioning each protection has differed.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">This case involves both protections. We first address the question whether it was a violation of the Fifth Amendment to prosecute these defendants for felony murder after they had been convicted of crimes involving the same conduct, and then address the question of multiple punishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">A. SECOND PROSECUTION FOR SAME OFFENSE</p>\n<p id=\"Ag8\">1. FEDERAL CONSTITUTION</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">The purpose of the double jeopardy provision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>the Fifth Amendment has been stated by the United States Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-4\">[T]he State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty. <em>[Green v United States, </em>355 US 184, 187-188; 78 S Ct 221; 2 L Ed 2d 199 (1957). See also <em>People v Grimmett, </em>388 Mich 590, 597; 202 NW2d 278 (1972).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">The general rule for determining whether two offenses are materially indistinguishable so as to prevent a double punishment or successive prosecution under the United States Constitution was set forth in <em>Blockburger v United States, </em>284 US 299, 304; 52 S Ct 180; 76 L Ed 306 (1932).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Brown v Ohio, </em>432 US 161, 166; 97 S Ct 2221; 53 L Ed 2d 187 (1977), <em>Garrett v United States, </em>471 US 773, 778-779; 105 S Ct 2407; 85 L Ed 2d 764 (1985), and <em>United States v Dixon, </em>509 US \u2014; 113 S Ct 2849; 125 L Ed 2d 556 (1993). However, the general rule of <em>Blockburger </em>does not operate without its exceptions, and, in fact, its application in recent years has been called into question in certain circumstances. See <em>Brown </em>at 166, n 6, and <em>Whalen v United States, </em>445 US 684, 709; 100 S Ct 1432; 63 L Ed 2d 715 (1980) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">In the present case, but for the subsequent death of the victim, it would appear that we are faced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>with a clear double jeopardy violation;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> however, because of the subsequent death, the cases are easily distinguishable. <em>Diaz v United States, </em>223 US 442; 32 S Ct 250; 56 L Ed 500 (1912), presented similar facts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant, \"by blows and kicks,\u201d inflicted bodily injuries upon the victim and was charged with assault and battery, tried, and found guilty. Subsequently, the victim died, and the defendant was charged with homicide. Relying on the testimony from the assault and battery hearing, the statement of the defendant, and the autopsy report, the defendant was convicted by \"the court of first instance.\u201d The United States Supreme Court affirmed and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-4\">The homicide charged against the accused in the Court of First Instance and the assault and battery for which he was tried before the justice of the peace, although identical in some of their elements, were distinct offenses in law and in fact. The death of the injured person was the principal element of the homicide, but was no part of the assault and battery. At the time of the trial for the latter the death had not ensued, and not until it did ensue was the homicide committed. Then, and not before, was it possible to put the accused in jeopardy for that offense. <em>[Diaz </em>at 448-449.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">This exception to the bar against double jeopardy has been cited with approval for years in a variety of circumstances. In <em>Brown, </em>the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>Court, while interpreting the <em>Blockburger </em>rule and holding that the Fifth Amendment forbids successive prosecutions and cumulative punishments for greater and lesser included offenses, regardless of their sequence, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-6\">An exception may exist where the State is unable to proceed on the more serious charge at the outset because the additional facts necessary to sustain that charge have not occurred or have not been discovered despite the exercise of due diligence. <em>[Brown </em>at 169, n 7 (citing <em>Diaz </em>and <em>Ashe v Swenson, </em>397 US 436, 453, n 7; 90 S Ct 1189; 25 L Ed 2d 469 [1970] [Brennan, J., concurring]).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">In another double jeopardy case decided the same term as <em>Brown, </em>the Court, while discussing the rule established in <em>Brown, </em>stated that it \"does have some exceptions. One commonly recognized exception is when all the events necessary to the greater crime have not taken place at the time the prosecution for the lesser is begun.\u201d <em>Jeffers v United States, </em>432 US 137, 151; 97 S Ct 2207; 53 L Ed 2d 168 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">Similarly, in a \"continuing criminal enterprise\u201d case, where three predicate crimes are required to establish the continuing criminal enterprise, the Supreme Court held that there was no double jeopardy violation where the facts underlying a prior conviction served to prove one of the predicate crimes. <em>Garrett, supra. </em>The Court determined that Congress intended a continuing criminal enterprise to be a separate offense and to authorize prosecution and punishment for both the predicate crimes and the continuing criminal enterprise. In ruling on the constitutionality of the prosecution of the continuing criminal enterprise after a previous prosecution for a predicate offense, the Court compared the case with <em>Diaz. </em>Just as the homicide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>had not occurred at the time of the trial for the assault and battery, the continuing criminal enterprise had not been completed at the time of the prosecution for the predicate crime. As a result, the Court held that there was no double jeopardy violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">Defendant Bush argues that <em>Diaz </em>does not apply because \"the analysis in <em>Diaz </em>is based upon the elements of the crimes involved and not the criminal conduct upon which a prosecution would be based.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We read this statement as distinguishing between the <em>Blockburger </em>\"statutory elements\u201d test and the <em>Grady </em>\"same conduct\u201d test, which is no longer a viable distinction.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Because the facts of this case fit squarely within the very exception developed in <em>Diaz,</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we hold that the subsequent prosecution of these defendants does not violate the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">2. STATE CONSTITUTION</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">The double jeopardy provision of the Michigan Constitution provides that \"[n]o person shall be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy.\u201d Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15. Although <em>People v White, </em>390 Mich 245; 212 NW2d 222 (1973), in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>which this Court seemed to give a broader interpretation of the Michigan Double Jeopardy Clause by holding that <em>Blockburger </em>is not the test for determining double jeopardy violations under the Michigan Constitution in the successive prosecution context and instead adopting the \"same transaction\u201d test, we nonetheless recognized the <em>Diaz </em>exception.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-6\">In adopting the same transaction test, we limit our holding to the facts of the present case and to similar factual situations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-7\">We are aware that in certain situations, strict application of the same transaction test could lead to the anomalous result of foreclosing prosecution for an oifense where the state had made a diligent and good faith eifort to protect the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-8\">\"For example, where a crime is not completed or not discovered, despite diligence on the part of the police, until after the commencement of a prosecution for other crimes arising from the same transaction, an exception to the 'same transaction\u2019 rule should be made to permit a separate prosecution.\u201d <em>Ashe v Swenson, </em>397 US 436, 453, n 7; 90 S Ct 1189, 1199; 25 L Ed 2d 469, 481 (1970) (Brennan, J., concurring) [citing <em>Diaz]. </em>We emphasize that our primary objective in adopting the same transaction test is to insure that a criminal defendant receives meaningful protection under the double jeopardy clause. If actual situations should arise in which application of the same transaction test would not serve that objective, we will, in such case, consider the adoption of limited exceptions to the same transaction test. <em>[White </em>at 258, n 6.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">Therefore, it is clear the exception set forth by this Court in <em>White </em>duplicates the exception outlined by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Diaz, </em>restated in <em>Brown </em>and <em>Jeffers, </em>and applied in <em>Garrett. </em>Accordingly, we hold that it was not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause of either the United States or the Michigan Constitution to charge, try, and convict these defendants of felony murder after the prosecution for the other crimes arising out of the same conduct. Having so held, it is now necessary to analyze the constitutional implications of the penalties imposed on these defendants for the previous crimes in light of the statutory felony murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">B. MULTIPLE PUNISHMENTS FOR THE SAME OFFENSE</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The principal thrust of double jeopardy protection by the very terms of our federal and state constitutional provision is protection from repeated prosecutions for the same criminal offense arising out of the same conduct. The concept of multiple punishment in double jeopardy jurisprudence has as its purpose the avoidance of more than one punishment for the same offense arising out of a single prosecution. This occurs most often in dealing with lesser included and compound offenses. In the case before us the multiple punishment challenge is made more difficult by the fact that the punishment exacted has resulted from successive prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">1. FEDERAL CONSTITUTION</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">In the cases in which the United States Supreme Court has addressed the issue of multiple punishments in successive prosecutions, its analysis has remained consistent with the cases involving multiple punishments in single prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">In <em>Jeffers, supra, </em>the Court faced the successive prosecutions of conspiring to distribute controlled substances and conducting a continuing criminal enterprise to violate drug laws. After a majority of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>the Court found that the defendant could constitutionally be tried separately by his request, it then reached the issue of multiple punishment. In so discussing, four justices adhered to the view that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-6\">[t]he critical inquiry is whether Congress intended to punish each statutory violation separately. . . . If some possibility exists that the two statutory offenses are the \"same offense\u201d for double jeopardy purposes, however, it is necessary to examine the problem closely, in order to avoid constitutional multiple-punishment difficulties. <em>[Id. </em>at 155.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">The Court continued by performing a legislative intent analysis and found that Congress did not intend to impose cumulative penalties for committing the crimes at issue. Interestingly, the opinion cited all single prosecution-multiple punishment cases for the above proposition, indicating that the two related issues are to be analyzed similarly. Compare <em>Brown </em>at 166-167.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">The most recent decision of the United States Supreme Court applying a legislative intent analysis to a successive prosecution-multiple punishment case occurred in Garrett, <em>supra. </em>A majority of the Court, after holding that prosecuting a continuing criminal enterprise offense after a prior conviction for one of the predicate offenses does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause, reconfirmed the plurality in <em>Jeffers </em>by relying on still other single prosecution-multiple punishment cases for the proposition that legislative intent controls the imposition of multiple penalties. <em>Garrett </em>at 793.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>The United States Supreme Court, as evidenced in the foregoing cases, although not abandoning the <em>Blockburger </em>test but veritably cutting back on its application as the rule, now views it as simply a method of determining legislative intent.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-5\">The <em>Blockburger </em>test is a \"rule of statutory construction,\u201d and because it serves as a means of discerning congressional purpose the rule should not be controlling where, for example, there is a clear indication of contrary legislative intent. <em>[Albernaz v United States, </em>450 US 333, 340; 101 S Ct 1137; 67 L Ed 2d 275 (1981). See also <em>Missouri v Hunter, </em>459 US 359, 367; 103 S Ct 673; 74 L Ed 2d 535 (1983), and <em>Garrett </em>at 778-779.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">The United States Supreme Court must accept a state court\u2019s interpretation of the intent of state legislation. See <em>Ohio v Johnson, </em>467 US 493, 499; 104 S Ct 2536; 81 L Ed 2d 425 (1984).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, we need not interpret the statutes at issue if the Michigan Constitution provides relief to these defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">2. STATE CONSTITUTION</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">In <em>People v Robideau, </em>419 Mich 458; 355 NW2d 592 (1984), we traced the development of this concept and the standards for determining the parameters of double jeopardy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>Different interests are involved when the issue is purely one of multiple punishments, without the complications of a successive prosecution. The right to be free from vexatious proceedings simply is not present. The only interest of the defendant is in not having more punishment imposed than that intended by the Legislature. The intent of the Legislature, therefore, is determinative. Under neither the federal nor the Michigan double jeopardy provisions does this Court sit as a superlegislature, instructing the Legislature on what it can make separate crimes. As previously described, prior decisions of this Court have applied a factual test in single-trial multiple-punishment cases, creating areas in which arguably the Legislature cannot now act. To the extent that those decisions interpret the prohibition against double jeopardy as a substantive limitation on the Legislature, we now disavow them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-5\">We are therefore left only with the question of what the Legislature intended in cases such as those at bar. As a means of determining that end, we find the <em>Blockburger </em>test to have questionable status in the Supreme Court of the United States and find the propriety of its use in any case to be questionable. <em>[.Bobideau </em>at 485-486.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Thus, in cases involving the double jeopardy protection against double punishment, although we have not decided a case involving both successive prosecutions and multiple punishment as in <em>Garrett, </em>it is clear that we have interpreted the Michigan Constitution consistently with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the federal constitution \u2014 legislative intent controls. We now turn to the task of determining what the Legislature intended regarding the statutes in this case. We note, however, that the analysis is complicated by having convictions for armed robbery and assault with intent to commit murder, and it is further complicated by the felony-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>firearm charges accompanying each felony. We will address each crime separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">a. ARMED ROBBERY</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">In <em>Robideau, </em>while confirming that legislative intent controls, we abandoned the <em>Blockburger </em>test, favoring the more traditional means of determining the intent of the Legislature. <em>Robideau </em>at 486. For determining legislative intent, in addition to any other indicative sources, we set forth two general principles to be considered. However, we noted that if \"conclusive evidence of legislative intent [cannot] be discerned, the rule of lenity requires the conclusion that separate punishments were not intended.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">In determining legislative intent a court must identify the type of harm the Legislature was intending to prevent,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and the amount of punishment authorized by it.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Accordingly, in applying the foregoing to <em>Robideau, </em>which involved first-degree criminal sexual conduct, and the underlying felony required to establish that charge which also served as the basis for another conviction of the same felony, we held that, although the compound crime of first-degree criminal sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>conduct incorporates all the elements of the predicate felony when that is the method used to establish the charge, the focus of first-degree criminal sexual conduct is on penetration, which involves the violation of social norms distinct from the norms protected by the predicate felony.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">While discussing the severity of the punishments for the crimes at issue in <em>Robideau, </em>we noted that both first-degree criminal sexual conduct and the predicate felonies carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. Unlike traditional lesser included offenses, which subsume into the greater like robbery and armed robbery, the compound and predicate crimes in <em>Robideau </em>had the same penalties. We surmised that the Legislature would not have intended to have the predicate felony subsume into the compound felony because such a construction would provide no reason for having the compound felony apply in that instance. Accordingly, we held that it was not a violation of double jeopardy to convict and punish the defendants in <em>Robideau </em>for the compound crime of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and the underlying predicate felony used to sustain the compound crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">We harmonized the result reached in <em>Robideau </em>with the result in <em>People v Wilder, </em>411 Mich 328; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>308 NW2d 112 (1981), in which we held that it was a violation of the state Double Jeopardy Clause to be convicted of felony murder based on armed robbery and also to be convicted of that same armed robbery in a single prosecution context.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-4\">This analysis is consistent with the result reached in <em>People v Wilder, </em>prohibiting dual convictions of first-degree felony murder and the predicate felony. Since felony murder is punishable by a mandatory life sentence, while the predicate felonies are punishable by no more than a term of years up to life, it may be inferred that the Legislature intended to punish a defendant only once for committing both crimes. While someone in the process of committing a predicate felony has a real disincentive to commit murder (mandatory life) even absent the threat of dual convictions, the same person, assuming the predicate felony carries an up-to-life maximum penalty, would have no such disincentive to commit criminal sexual conduct unless dual convictions are imposed. <em>[Robideau </em>at 489, n 8.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">This is the pinnacle distinction between the present case and <em>Robideau. Robideau </em>involved two crimes that carried the same possible sentence, which persuaded us that the Legislature intended to punish the crimes separately. For statutory felony murder, the punishment is mandatory imprisonment for life without parole. MCL 750.316; MSA 28.548. The prosecutor must still prove malice aforethought, but the statute serves to raise what would otherwise be second-degree murder to first-degree murder \u2014 for the sole purpose of increasing punishment. See <em>People v Aaron, </em>409 Mich 672, 719; 229 NW2d 304 (1980). The punishment for armed robbery is life imprisonment with the possibility of parole in ten years, MCL 791.234(4); MSA 28.2304(4), or any term of years\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>the same as for second-degree murder. MCL 750.529; MSA 28.797.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Because statutory felony murder based on the predicate crime of armed robbery carries with it a greater penalty than the predicate crime, we hold that the Legislature did not intend to impose punishments for both crimes, even under the facts of this case, and thus, it is a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and Michigan Constitutions to sentence the defendants for both crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">b. ASSAULT WITH INTENT TO COMMIT MURDER</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">We must now address the effect of the apropos felony murder conviction on the previous assault with intent to commit murder conviction. The Court of Appeals properly labeled this an issue of first impression. It is now settled law that legislative intent determines claims of multiple punishment-double jeopardy violations in either successive or single prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">Just as <em>Blockburger </em>has become a \"rule of statutory construction\u201d and, in applying federal law, is implemented only to assist in determining the intent of the Legislature, our previous cases utilizing the factual lesser included offense analysis should be similarly treated.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Although those cases have been disavowed as far as stating the controlling test for double jeopardy-double punishment cases,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the test is not extinct when it is helpful in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>discerning legislative intent. See <em>Wilder, supra </em>at 359 (Ryan, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">The rationale for why the traditional lesser included offense test should not be used in the compound-predicate crime scenario is instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-6\">[T]hat a predicate-based offense requires proof of a predicate offense does not mean that the two offenses are greater and lesser included offenses in the traditional sense. \"[T]he concept of included offenses reflects a continuum of culpability.\u201d Offenses lie on- the same continuum, and are therefore greater and lesser included offenses, when \"the elements shared by the two offenses coincide in the harm to the societal interest to be protected.\u201d <em>People v Ora Jones, </em>395 Mich 379, 390; 236 NW2d 461 (1975). These offenses then are tied together by logic. In contrast, predicate-based offenses and their predicates are tied together by the Legislature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-7\">In our cases that have used the lesser included offense test, the implicit assumption has been that, for committing a single criminal act, the Legislature did not intend a person to be convicted of and punished for two or more offenses lying on a single continuum of culpability. This is because each continuum comprises those offenses that serve to vindicate the same social norm. Thus, if one commits a criminal act that violates a single social norm, conviction of and punishment for a single offense would seem to vindicate the interests infringed by that act. <em>[Wilder </em>at 360-361 (Ryan, J., concurring).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">In the preceding section, we discussed the structure of some of our criminal statutes, indicating that many of them have base crimes setting forth the fundamental elements for their completion, and then increase in penalty as the crime gets more complex in elements and severe in nature. For these types of crimes, the Legislature did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>intend concurrent or subsequent prosecution, or multiple punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Similarly, in the present case, the defendants were convicted of assault with intent, to commit murder and then subsequently actual murder. The Court of Appeals held that assault with intent to commit murder is a lesser included offense of felony murder.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Had the death of Mr. Dudley occurred before the first conviction, it is without doubt that upon the finding of guilt for felony murder, the assault with intent to commit murder would have merged into the more serious crime.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">It is clear in applying the <em>Robideau </em>analysis that had these defendants originally been prosecuted for felony murder, they could not have been sentenced both for felony murder and armed robbery, or for felony murder and the lesser included offense of assault with intent to murder. If they had been, the remedy would have been to affirm the conviction of the higher charge and to vacate the lower conviction. <em>People v Jankowski, </em>408 Mich 79, 96; 289 NW2d 674 (1980), citing <em>People v Martin, </em>398 Mich 303, 313; 247 NW2d 303 (1976).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>Because the appeal before us does not include the original convictions and sentences, that remedy is possibly beyond our control in this case.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> See <em>United States v Reed, </em>980 F2d 1568, 1581 (CA 11, 1993). On the other hand, if we were to hold that the instant sentence for felony murder could not be imposed on these defendants, it would nullify the purpose of the constitutionally acceptable <em>Diaz </em>exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">We conclude that double jeopardy protection dictates that defendants not receive a form of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>multiple punishment that could not have been exacted had their felonious intentions been realized sooner and had they been prosecuted to the extent of their ultimate culpability in the first trial. They were not placed in jeopardy twice by the second prosecution under <em>Diaz; </em>rather, they were subjected to punishment for offenses arising out of a single transaction that could not have been exacted in a single proceeding. Thus we conclude that the defendants are entitled to relief from their convictions of assault with intent to murder and armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">Before the Court of Appeals decision, the defendants had been convicted and sentenced for two counts of felony-firearm based on assault with intent to commit murder and armed robbery. Defendant Bush was then convicted of a third charge of felony-firearm based on the felony murder. Defendant Harding was acquitted of the subsequent felony-firearm charge. The problem is that Bush has been convicted of three counts of felony-firearm based on three separate felonies, but punishment for two of those felonies violates double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">It has been settled by this Court that a defendant can be charged, convicted, and sentenced for felony-firearm for each felony committed in a spree of criminal activity. <em>People v </em>Morton, 423 Mich 650; 377 NW2d 798 (1985). The corollary is: If the substantive crime underlying a felony-firearm conviction must be vacated, then that accompanying felony-firearm conviction also must be vacated. A defendant can be convicted for only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>one charge of felony-firearm for each convicted felony.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Felony-firearm can only attach to individual felonies.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In view of our holding that the felony murder conviction does not amount to a double jeopardy violation, it follows that the accompanying felony-firearm conviction is valid. It also stands to reason that the prior felony-firearm convictions are no more valid than the convictions to which they are attached. Therefore, because the previous felonies may be vacated, the felony-firearm convictions accompanying those felonies may similarly be vacated; however, consistent with our analysis above, credit for time served for one of the previous felony-firearm convictions is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">Defendant Harding argues for the first time that he has been denied under both the state and federal constitutions due process of law, equal protection of the laws, and the right to present a defense, because more than four years had elapsed between the assault with intent to commit murder and the actual death of Mr. Dudley.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">This Court has previously abrogated the common-law \"year and a day\u201d rule, which required that in order to bring murder charges against a defendant, the victim must have died within a year and a day of the assault. <em>People v </em>Stevenson, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>416 Mich 383; 331 NW2d 143 (1982).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In so holding we were warned of the potential for abuse of other important rights like speedy trial, cruel and unusual punishment, and double jeopardy; however, in reassuring the appellee in that case we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-6\">Recognizing that such rights may be implicated in long-delayed prosecutions, we will continue to be vigilant in the enforcement of those rights where they are shown to have been abridged or denied under the facts of a particular case. <em>[Stevenson </em>at 393, h 3.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">As in <em>Stevenson, </em>we have been called upon many times to exercise our authority to modify the common law when changes in public policy or technology so dictate. See <em>Stevenson </em>at 390 for a list of cases.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> This case continues where <em>Stevenson </em>left off, because now we are presented with the situation in which a victim, although injured, had resumed a somewhat \"normal\u201d life and possibly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>would have lived longer had he followed the instructions of his doctor.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">In making the catchall constitutional pleas, Mr. Harding is basically arguing for fairness, and although those pleas are without merit,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> he also urges us to consider adopting a languishing factor to be part of the crime to be proven by the prosecution or as a legal question to be decided by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">We resisted establishing such a test in <em>Stevenson </em>with the foresight that the causation inquiry would continue to be the screen through which the questionable cases would be filtered out.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-6\">Of course, abolition of the rule would not relieve the prosecution of its duty to prove all of the elements of the crime, including proximate causation, beyond a reasonable doubt. A murder conviction which rests upon uncertain medical speculation as to the cause of death is not a case which has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Fears about murder convictions for death 5, 10, or even 20 years after the injury are therefore unfounded where proximate cause is proven beyond a reasonable doubt. If such proof is available, the conviction is justified. No repose or statute of limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>is available for murder in this state. MCL 767.24; MSA 28.964. [Stevenson at 392-393.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Similarly, the defendant does not cite, nor have we been able to discover, any state that has instituted a languishing test, which would require the determination whether a victim was languishing from a felonious injury at the time of death. However, while we do not wish to preclude such a test, even if this issue were presented, briefed, and argued in the Court of Appeals and, thus, properly before us, we think the injuries were of such a lingering nature and the testimony regarding the ongoing complications so explicitly clear that it would be nearly impossible to avoid finding that Jeffrey Dudley continued to languish from the felonious injuries until his death, and a judge or a jury would be well within its bounds to so find. See n 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">We conclude that the defendants are entitled to have their assault with intent to murder and armed robbery convictions vacated along with the corresponding felony-firearm convictions. It is further ordered that defendants are entitled to receive sentence credit toward, their statutory felony-murder punishment for the time served for the assault with intent to murder and armed robbery convictions, and defendant Bush is to receive sentence credit toward his subsequent felony-firearm conviction for time served for his previous felony-firearm convictions.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>The Court of Appeals order vacating the convictions of assault with intent to commit murder and armed robbery is reversed; its order vacating the felony-firearm conviction arising out of the case before us also is reversed.

Shortly thereafter a surgery was again performed to insert a chest tube for his lung and to remove a bullet from his abdomen.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-11\">In October 1983, Mr. Dudley collapsed in a shopping mall, which resulted in the implantation of a pacemaker. Later in October, Doctor Hahn J. Lee performed a heart catherization and determined that there was very high pressure, three or four times higher than normal, backing up in the left ventricle and that the heart muscle was so stiff it was unable to accommodate the blood required to meet the body\u2019s demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-12\">In December 1984, Doctor Lee became Mr. Dudley\u2019s treating cardiologist. At that time two stress tests were performed revealing that Mr. Dudley\u2019s heart was as weak as that of an eighty-five-year-old man. He could not walk two street blocks at a leisurely pace without becoming dizzy and his blood pressure dropping. Doctor Lee warned Mr. Dudley not to do anything strenuous, not to get upset, and to \"live like an old man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Acp\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>One year later, in December 1985, Doctor Lee conducted another stress test in which Mr. Dudley performed much worse than the first one. The doctor testified that a seventy-year-old woman with arthritis could do almost as well and that his blood pressure was \u201cnose-diving.\u201d At that point his pacemaker was changed to a more sophisticated model, and he was put on medication and blood thinners. A follow-up stress test was conducted in April 1986, which showed slight improvement to the level recorded during the first stress test, but far below (about twenty-five percent) what a man at his age should be able to do. Doctor Lee told Mr. Dudley that there was nothing more that could be done and that he was going to have to learn to live with his limitations, with an eye toward a heart transplant in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">The last stress test given by Doctor Lee was in March 1987. The doctor testified that the heart was declining from the date he met Mr. Dudley \u2014 \"It was a steady downhill course.\u201d The doctor told him that it did not look good, that a heart transplant was a possibility, and that he was to look out for himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Dr. Lee described Mr. Dudley as a \"time bomb\u201d with respect to any activity or emotional upset that pushes the heart beyond the tolerance limit. He testified that if Mr. Dudley had gotten used to watching out for himself and avoided strenuous exercise he would have lived longer. The chances of someone in Mr. Dudley\u2019s situation living five years was less than fifty percent; the chances for him to live another twenty-five years was nil. Finally, the doctor testified that for Jeffrey Dudley playing basketball was tantamount to suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">Mr. Dudley\u2019s mother, Gladys Dudley, testified that her son had been a very active young man. He had five jobs, went to college, and still had time for recreation and dating. After the assault, his health was extremely poor. He was unable to take walks without losing his breath, and sometimes he would have shortness of breath while just sitting still. He was very limited in his activity. The doctor had told her that he was not improving, which confirmed her own observations of her son. She testified that in 1986 her son \"could tell that he wasn\u2019t improving and he decided that whatever he did he had to live as normal a life as possible, and he wanted to get married so he became engaged and then they got married.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">Mr. Dudley\u2019s wife, who had been dating him even before the assault, gave conflicting testimony with regard to whether he was living a \"normal\u201d life. At one point she testified that he had some limitations as far as activities went and could exercise in moderation, but later she stated that she knew nothing about warnings by his doctor that he would have to avoid some of the more strenuous activities and reduce his hours at work, and she did not notice that he had made any change in his activity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b824-8\"> There was conflicting medical testimony regarding the actual cause of death. The defense called an expert witness who testified that the seizure indicated that there was a blow to his head causing the brain to send improper signals to the heart, which in fact caused the heart to stop pumping. Defendant Harding argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict, mainly because the autopsy failed to produce slides of brain tissue enabling the examiner and other doctors to definitively consider, and rule out, brain damage as the cause of death. The medical examiner testified that the cranium was opened and the brain actually examined, revealing no injury to the brain or skull. Another doctor testified that a blow severe enough to cause a convulsion would have produced obvious evidence such as a cracked skull or brain hemorrhage. The same doctor testified that, generally, a convulsion is a reaction by the brain when it is simply deprived of oxygen. We believe this question was adequately presented to the jury, and that it was properly instructed.

The legislature remains free under the Double Jeopardy Clause to define crimes and fix punishments; but once the legislature has acted courts may not impose more than one punishment for the same offense and prosecutors ordinarily may not attempt to secure that punishment in more than one trial. <em>[Brown v Ohio, </em>432 US 161, 165; 97 S Ct 2221; 53 L Ed 2d 187 (1977), quoted in <em>Wayne Co Prosecutor v Recorder\u2019s Court Judge, </em>406 Mich 374, 391-392; 280 NW2d 793 (1979).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">With regard to multiple punishment, \"the role of the constitutional guarantee is limited to assuring that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple punishments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>for the same offense.\u201d <em>Brown, supra </em>at 165.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \"Thus, the question of what punishments are constitutionally permissible is not different from the question of what punishments the Legislative Branch intended to be imposed.\u201d <em>Albernaz v United States, </em>450 US 333, 344; 101 S Ct 1137; 67 L Ed 2d 275 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Hence, in the instant case, \"[t]he dispositive question is whether the Legislature intended that two convictions might result . . . under the circumstances presented in this case.\u201d <em>People v Wakeford, </em>418 Mich 95, 111; 341 NW2d 68 (1983).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \"Thus, '[e]ven if the crimes are the same, ... if it is evident that a state legislature intended to authorize cumulative punishments, a court\u2019s inquiry is at an end\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>People v Sturgis, </em>427 Mich 392, 400; 397 NW2d 783 (1986), quoting <em>Ohio v Johnson, </em>467 US 493, 499, n 8; 104 S Ct 2536; 81 L Ed 2d 425 (1984).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Such adherence to legislative intent is necessary because \"[i]n our effort to see that the rights of persons accused of crime are protected, we should not overlook the fact that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>people also have interests that should be safeguarded.\u201d <em>In re Ascher, supra </em>at 551.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">In the instant case, the Legislature intended to punish defendant for both felony murder and armed robbery.

The majority, however, incorrectly dismisses the maximum punishment authorized for armed robbery: life imprisonment.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Utilizing its own analysis, the majority should find that the Legislature intended separate punishment for each offense at issue because each may be punished by life imprisonment.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Moreover, this Court has also noted that when statutes are directed at \"distinct social purposes\u201d or \"distinct evils\u201d multiple punishment was intended by the Legislature. <em>Sturgis, supra </em>at 408, 409. An examination of the elements of the offenses reveal that the social interests in punishing armed robbery are distinct from punishing first-degree murder. The elements of first-degree murder include: (1) malice, (2) homicide, and (3) either premeditation or a homicide accompanied by an enumerated felony. MCL 750.316; MSA 28.548. In other words, first-degree murder is common-law murder \" 'plus one or more of the aggravating circumstances mentioned\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>People v Carter, </em>395 Mich 434, 438; 236 NW2d 500 (1975), quoting Perkins, Criminal Law (2d ed), p 90. Hence, the focus of the offense is murder.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">On the other hand, the elements of armed robbery include: (1) an assault, (2) a felonious taking of property from the victim\u2019s presence or person, and (3) a perpetrator armed with a weapon. MCL 750.529; MSA 28.797. In other words, \"[r]obbery is committed only when there is larceny from the person, with the additional element of violence or intimidation.\u201d <em>People v Chamblis, </em>395 Mich 408, 425; 236 NW2d 473 (1975).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Hence, the offense \"is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>aimed at persons who violate social norms by taking property from the presence of another by force or threat of force while armed with a weapon.\u201d <em>People v Witt, </em>140 Mich App 365, 371; 364 NW2d 692 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">. Thus, first-degree murder focuses upon homicide, armed robbery upon the violent deprivation of property. The first-degree murder statute does not punish the taking of property except when accompanied by a homicide. Nor does the armed robbery statute punish homicide. The societal interests are independent. In fact, the societal interests targeted by the felony murder provision of the first-degree murder statute generally are distinct from the underlying felonies. Felony murder is designed to punish homicide committed in the course of aggravated circumstances, while the societal interests undergirding the enumerated felonies are independent and also important to maintain. That the societal interests in prohibiting rape and kidnapping, for instance, are distinct from those prohibiting murder cannot be doubted. In a parallel fashion, the societal interests served by armed robbery and the first-degree murder statutes are distinct.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">This is especially true in Michigan where felony murder requires malice. <em>People v Aaron, </em>409 Mich 672, 728; 299 NW2d 304 (1980). The societal interest in prohibiting first-degree murder is not only homicide, but one committed with malice. <em>Id. </em>Armed robbery, of course, does not possess such a requirement. \"[T]he presence of the different intent elements indicates that the Legislature intended to prevent distinct types of harm, robbery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>and corporal harm,\u201d as well as intended to address separate social ills. <em>People v Smith, </em>152 Mich App 756, 761; 394 NW2d 94 (1986) (holding that multiple punishments were intended with regard to assault with intent to do great bodily harm and assault with intent to rob and steal while armed). See also <em>People v Leach, </em>114 Mich App 732, 735-736; 319 NW2d 652 (1982) (holding that multiple punishments were intended with regard to armed robbery and assault with intent to commit great bodily harm). The Legislature carefully crafted distinct offenses defending separate societal interests that defendants violated. Punishment for each offense was intended by the Legislature.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Moreover, in <em>Wakeford, supra </em>at 105, n 7, this Court recognized the impropriety of the majority\u2019s conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-6\">We have never held, as a matter of state or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>federal constitutional law, that only one conviction may result, for example, from the rape, robbery, kidnapping, and murder of victim A . . . even if the charges must be brought in a single trial under the \"same transaction\u201d test. Such a rule could be said to permit criminals to engage in an extended crime \"spree,\u201d knowing that at most only one conviction could result and that any crime other than the most serious was \"free\u201d of any possibility of conviction.

This is true simply from the structure of our constitutional system. Our state constitution continues to possess vitality independent of the federal constitution. For instance, if the United States Supreme Court disavowed incorporation of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause by reversing <em>Benton, supra, </em>the protection of the Michigan provision would necessarily still possess force. Similarly, if the\u2019United States Supreme Court were to falter and deviate from the ancient common-law understanding of the prohibition of double jeopardy (for instance, by permitting retrials for the same offense after acquittal), this Court would not be empowered to impose that novel interpretation upon our constitution. On the other hand, when the United States Supreme Court does adhere to the original common-law understanding of the prohibition against double jeopardy, this Court must adhere to that understanding \u2014 not simply because the United States Supreme Court so holds, but because our constitution is founded on the same principles as the Fifth Amendment. In other words, the starting point for Michigan constitutional jurisprudence is the original understanding of the document\u2019s ratifiers and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>framers, supplemented by history, not the decisions of federal courts regarding analogous provisions.

In <em>White, </em>this Court adopted the transactional approach posited by Justice Brennan in his concurring opinion in <em>Ashe v Swenson, </em>397 US 436, 448; 90 S Ct 1189; 25 L Ed 2d 469 (1970), to determine whether a second prosecution violates the Michigan Constitution\u2019s prohibition against double jeopardy. Yet, the original understanding of the doctrine of double jeopardy rejects this interpretation. <em>United States v Dixon, </em>509 US \u2014; 113 S Ct 2849, 2860; 125 L Ed 2d 556 (1993) (holding that the same conduct test \"is wholly inconsistent with . . . the clear common-law understanding of double jeopardy,\u201d and accepting as dispositive Justice Scalia\u2019s dissenting opinion in <em>Grady v Corbin, </em>495 US 508; 110 S Ct 2084; 109 L Ed 2d 548 [1990]); <em>id. </em>at 529-536 (Scalia, J.)

A murder conviction which rests upon uncertain medical speculation as to the cause of death is not a case which has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Fears about murder convictions for death 5, 10 or even 20 years after the injury are therefore unfounded where proximate cause is proven beyond a reasonable doubt. </em>If such proof is available, the conviction is justified. <em>[People v Stevenson, </em>416 Mich 383, 392-393; 331 NW2d 143 (1982).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">In order to secure a felony murder conviction, the state must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendants\u2019 acts proximately caused the victim\u2019s death. Obviously, if Mr. Dudley would have died in the sewer or later at the hospital, proximate or legal causation would not present a problem. However, the case at bar is problematic because almost four and one-half years had passed between the assault and the victim\u2019s death. During this time Mr. Dudley returned to steady employment, married, fathered a child, and resumed a seminormal life. Furthermore, Mr. Dudley\u2019s death followed his participation in ninety minutes of strenuous physical activity and a physical altercation, activities which Mr. Dudley knew were forbidden. The relevant question is whether any of these events constitute a superseding cause that negates proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">The proximate cause standard requires a sufficient causal connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the result of that conduct. \"[I]t [must] appear[] that the death resulted as the natural, direct, and necessary result of the unlawful act . . . .\u201d <em>People v Barnes, </em>182 Mich 179, 196; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>148 NW 400 (1914).

As evidenced by our criminal jury instructions,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the criminal standard for proximate cause requires a more direct causal connection than the tort concept of proximate cause.

A bullet, shot by defendant Bush, lacerated Mr. Dudley\u2019s heart. Dr. Kaplan performed emergency surgery. Dr. Kaplan reported that Mr. Dudley was eventually discharged in good condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-6\">2. There are two types of heart failure. One is chronic heart failure, a continued, progressive disease of the heart. Chronic heart failure is evidenced by edema or swelling of the heart, as well as thickening of the ankles, and fluid in the lungs. The autopsy of Mr. Dudley did not show signs indicative of chronic heart failure. The other type of heart failure is acute, or sudden, heart failure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-7\">3. Dr. Kanluen, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy, opined that Mr. Dudley\u2019s death was due to an acute heart attack, which was the consequence of the permanent damage to the heart from the previous gunshot wound.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-8\">4. Dr. Petinga concluded that the cause of . death was acute congestive heart failure caused by the gunshot wound.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-9\">5. Dr. Kanluen failed to perform a full examination of Mr. Dudley\u2019s brain. The results from the missing examination may have supported the defendants\u2019 theory of brain death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">On the basis of the testimony, a rational trier of fact could have concluded, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the initial attack contributed to the victim\u2019s death. <em>But for </em>the gunshot wound, Mr. Dudley would not have died. The problem with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>this conclusion, however, is that this is not evidence of proximate cause, but actual cause.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, the Court of Appeals conclusion that the required proof of proximate cause was established because the medical testimony was sufficient to establish the cause of death was erroneous. The medical testimony proved actual cause. The question regarding proximate cause remains.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Intervening or superseding causes negate proximate cause. A series of events, immediately preceding Mr. Dudley\u2019s death, are relevant to the proximate cause inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">Mr. Dudley\u2019s testimony acknowledged the limitations his doctor placed on his physical activities. Yet he chose to disregard his doctor\u2019s instructions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The events that transpired immediately before his death evidenced Mr. Dudley\u2019s deviation from his recommended lifestyle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-8\">. 1. Mr. Dudley participated in a game of two-on-two basketball for ninety minutes. The other participants were young men in good health.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-9\">2. Despite experiencing shortness of breath and tiredness during the basketball game, Mr. Dudley continued to play following a brief break.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-10\">3. The disclosed wager between two of the players, as well as the testimony of the wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>nesses, revealed that this was not a slow leisurely game but a game of elevated competition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-5\">4. Following the game, Mr. Dudley initiated a fight with his eighteen-year-old brother-in-law. Mr. Dudley swung at his brother-in-law, Monte, because of his mistaken belief that Monte had hit Mrs. Dudley. After Monte hit Mr. Dudley in the nose, Mr. Dudley chased after Monte, leaping on him. When the two men hit the ground, Mr. Dudley landed underneath Monte, who weighed between 165 and 170 pounds. Another man joined in the fight, placing Mr. Dudley under the weight of two grown men. Monte testified to striking the victim while he was on the ground. The altercation continued for three to five minutes, ending when Mr. Dudley began to convulse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">The victim was advised not to participate in strenuous activity. Nevertheless, he played basketball for ninety minutes. The victim also initiated a physical altercation, leaving him pinned beneath two grown men. Mr. Dudley\u2019s disregard for his recommended physical activities is a superseding cause, negating proximate cause.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-7\">If a wounds b with the intent to kill, but thereafter c shoots b with intent to kill and does kill him instantly, we know that a is not the cause of b\u2019s death.

Instead, the victim returned to steady employment, married, fathered a child and resumed a seminormal life. Mr. Dudley, fully aware of his limitations, participated in strenuous physical activities. Furthermore, he failed to slow down when he began to experience shortness of breath and tiredness. While unfortunate, the victim, by participating in activities that would be taxing to a healthy individual, proximately caused his own demise.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Mr. Dudley acted contrary to his physician\u2019s orders. His participation in a ninety-minute game of basketball and a fistfight was certainly not motivated by his assault over four years earlier. The autopsy revealed that Mr. Dudley did not die because of a chronic, progressive heart condition, but because of acute or sudden heart failure. When reviewing this fact, along with the forbidden physical activities that immediately preceded his death, I am convinced that the prosecutor failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants\u2019 acts were the proximate cause of Mr. Dudley\u2019s death. The intervening factors, as chronicled above, proximately caused Mr. Dudley\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">On the basis of the evidence and the intervening events negating proximate cause, I would hold that the prosecutor failed to prove all the elements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>of felony murder beyond a reasonable doubt.
