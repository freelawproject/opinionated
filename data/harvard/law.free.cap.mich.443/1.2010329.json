The defendant first alleged a sentencing guidelines scoring error before the Court of Appeals by filing a motion to remand pursuant to MCR 7.211(C)(1)(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>that the Court of Appeals is not compelled to grant every motion to remand. The remand procedure is available only when the issue meets the requirements set forth in MCR 7.211(C). If there is evidence supporting the judge\u2019s initial scoring of a sentencing guidelines variable, the motion to remand may be denied. Because there is sufficient evidence in this case, we reverse the Court of Appeals decision to grant defendant\u2019s motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">On February 27, 1991, defendant pleaded guilty of assault with intent to commit murder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The incident leading to the charge occurred on June 30, 1990. The defendant was at a party, during which several guests became involved in a dispute with the neighbors. The victim lived near the house where the party took place, but did not return home until later in the evening. When the victim returned home, the individuals at the party began hollering racial slurs. The same individuals then began throwing rocks and beer bottles at the victim\u2019s window. The victim grabbed a stick, went out to the sidewalk, and began yelling at the individuals. Defendant then attacked the victim with a baseball bat, knocking him to the ground. Defendant continued to hit the victim with the bat. One witness testified'that the defendant continued to hit the victim until the bat broke. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>that time, a witness pulled defendant off the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">On March 25, 1991, nine days before sentencing, Kent Circuit Court Judge Dennis Kolenda sent defendant\u2019s attorney a presentence report and a letter informing the attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">Any additions or corrections which you would like to make, including any challenges to the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 scoring, should be submitted in writing by the close of business on Friday, March 29, 1991.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Judge Kolenda also provided an opportunity to meet with the parties to discuss the case before the sentence proceeding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">Defendant was sentenced on April 3, 1991, pursuant to a plea agreement, to six to twenty years, a sentence within the sentencing guidelines range for assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder. Defendant received a prior record score of twenty-five and an offense score of sixty-five, which placed him in the c-iv sector of the grid. The corresponding guideline recommended a minimum sentence of three years to six years, eight months.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">At sentencing, defense counsel agreed that the presentence report was \"basically a fair and accurate report.\u201d Judge Kolenda then explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-10\">Mr. Hernandez, I have come to the unfortunate conclusion, and I mean genuinely I think it\u2019s unfortunate that for reasons that I don\u2019t understand and you probably don\u2019t understand, that you are a dangerous person at the moment and from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>whom I\u2019ve got to protect society. You were involved in a very serious \u2014 and I think vicious is the right word \u2014 stabbing of a juvenile, and in this particular case involved a repeated senseless beating. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">The Prosecutor has recommended that you be sentenced under guidelines for an offense less serious than you committed, and less serious than you plead guilty to. The only way I can reject that recommendation is to set aside everything and have a trial, which I don\u2019t think would be in the interest of the parties involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Defendant did not raise any objections before or during the sentencing proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Following sentencing, defendant received notice of his right to timely appeal and to request appointment of an appellate attorney within forty-two days. Defendant submitted his request for appointment of an attorney on April 10, 1991. Judge Kolenda entered a claim of appeal and order appointing an attorney on May 17, 1991. The Kent Circuit Court received the case transcript on July 25, 1991. The notice of filing a transcript on appeal was received on September 17, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">The State Appellate Defender Office represented defendant during the appeal process. On September 25, 1991, defendant filed a motion in the Court of Appeals to remand the case to the circuit court to allow him to file a motion for resentencing. Defendant alleged error in the presentence scoring of fifty points for offense variable 2, which addresses \"Physical Attack and/or Injury.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant argued that the score of fifty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>points for \"excessive brutality\u201d is incorrect and that the proper score is twenty-five points because the victim only suffered bodily injury. If defendant received twenty-five points, his sentence range would have been two to five years under the c-m section of the grid.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The Court of Appeals remanded the case \"only because we are compelled to do so pursuant to <em>[People v] Walker </em>[428 Mich 261; 407 NW2d 367 (1987)].\u201d Unpublished order of the Court of Appeals, decided November 21, 1991 (Docket No. 140896). This Court granted the prosecutor\u2019s motion for leave to appeal, limited to the issue whether this Court should reconsider its decision in <em>Walker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">In Walker, this Court explained that a defendant must challenge the sentencing guidelines scoring in the trial court before raising the issue on appeal. The methods by which the issue may be raised in the trial court are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-9\">bringing] it to the attention of the trial court at sentencing, by a properly filed motion within the time period for filing a motion for a new trial, or by a timely filed motion for remand in the Court of Appeals. MCR 7.211(C)(1). <em>[Id. </em>at 262.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">This case involves MCR 7.211(C)(1), which was promulgated before the <em>Walker </em>decision._</p>\n<p id=\"Ac\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\">The need to develop a formal remand procedure began to crystallize when this Court decided <em>People v Moore, </em>391 Mich 426, 440; 216 NW2d 770 (1974), <em>People v Ginther, </em>390 Mich 436; 212 NW2d 922 (1973), and <em>People v Robinson, </em>390 Mich 629, 634; 213 NW2d 106 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">In <em>Moore, </em>the defendant filed a postsentence challenge, claiming that the judge considered an invalid conviction in determining his sentence. The defendant failed to object at sentencing and did not file a motion in the trial court before pursuing the claim on appeal. Thus, the record was incomplete, which made appellate review impracticable. The prosecutor, however, supplied the necessary information to establish whether the prior convictions were valid. We determined that one conviction was invalid, and we remanded the case for resentencing because the record showed that the trial judge had considered the invalid conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Despite the outcome in <em>Moore, </em>we specifically ordered that, in future cases, \"post-sentencing <em>Tucked[</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>claims should be initially decided by the sentencing judge or his successor. [The judge] is in the best position to explore and decide the factual issues and, if necessary, the defendant can then be resentenced.\u201d <em>Moore </em>at 440. Moving first in the trial court is important because without a record showing the judge\u2019s decision, appellate courts have no basis for reviewing the challenge. See <em>People v Mattison, </em>26 Mich App 453, 459-461; 182 NW2d 604 (1970). When a defendant\u2019s claim \" 'depends on facts not of record, it is incumbent on him to make a testimonial record at the trial court level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>in connection with a motion for a new trial <em>Ginther </em>at 443, quoting <em>People v Jelks, </em>33 Mich App 425, 431; 190 NW2d 291 (1971). Without a complete record, the appellate court must engage in fact finding, as occurred in <em>Moore, </em>which is not the court\u2019s role.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\"><em>Robinson </em>established the period for filing post-judgment motions. This Court stated that \"after this opinion is published, a defendant desiring reversal or a new trial because of a failure to produce an unindorsed or an indorsed witness shall, <em>before \u00f1ling his brief on appeal, </em>move the trial court for a new trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 634 (emphasis added). Allowing the defendant to file the post-judgment motion within the period for filing the appellate brief raised problems, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">Originally, a trial court did not retain jurisdiction after sending the transcripts to the Court of Appeals, which generally occurred before expiration of the period during which the appellant could file his brief.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s authority to grant a motion for a new trial terminated upon sending the transcripts to the Court of Appeals. Thus, a corresponding jurisdictional rule was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">Another problem evolved because defendants were required to file postjudgment motions in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>trial court within \"60 days after the entry of . . . the judgment or order appealed from . . . GCR 1963, 803.1(b)(1).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indigent defendants had to request and await appointment of appellate counsel before filing a postjudgment motion. Often, the \"60-day period after sentencing for filing [a postjudgment motion in the trial court] had expired before appellate counsel was appointed.\u201d <em>Ginther </em>at 444. Thus, the indigent defendant was barred from filing the postjudgment motion because it was deemed waived.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Ginther, </em>we remanded the case and agreed with the defendant that the Court of Appeals should have ordered a remand to the trial court so that he could file a motion for a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">This Court promulgated a formal remand procedure in 1978. The remand rule was modeled after <em>Moore, Robinson, </em>and <em>Ginther,</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and it resolved the problems expressed in those cases. The procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>allows the defendant to file a motion for a new trial in the trial court before filing a brief on appeal,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and it eliminated jurisdictional concerns by authorizing the Court of Appeals to grant a remand if the trial court already relinquished the transcripts and jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The procedure also resolved the <em>Ginther </em>concern that the indigent would involuntarily forfeit an opportunity to file a postjudgment motion. If appellate counsel is not appointed within the sixty-day period to file a postjudgment motion, after counsel is appointed, a defendant could file a claim of appeal and then file a motion to remand within the period for filing the appellate brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">On the basis of the remand rule, if the trial court would grant the motion for a new trial, the Court of Appeals may remand the case. If the trial court would not grant the motion, the Court of Appeals may decide to remand on the basis of GCR 1963, 817.6(l).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Evidently, years before <em>Walker, </em>the remand procedure could be used to raise issues in the trial court before seeking appellate review. Although the rules were amended between the time the remand procedure originally was promulgated and the time <em>Walker </em>was decided, the substance of the rule remained the same.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">The prosecutor questions whether <em>Walker </em>was correct in stating that challenges of sentencing guidelines scoring also could be raised in the trial court pursuant to the remand procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Generally, allowing postjudgment challenges to issues not raised at trial is necessary where an objection or challenge could not be raised contemporaneously with the occurrence of the event giving rise to the challenge. The cases from which the remand procedure evolved illustrate this point. For example, ineffective assistance of counsel claims generally cannot be raised contemporaneously because it is not clear until the close of trial whether there may be a reasonable claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Similarly, when newly discovered evidence arises, or it is unclear whether the sentence was based on inaccurate information,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or the prosecutor\u2019s failure to provide an indorsed witness is not discovered until after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>trial, the need for postjudgment motions is evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">On the other hand, objections to hearsay, admission of evidence pursuant to an illegal search, and other similar issues generally can and should be recognized so that contemporaneous objection is possible. If a contemporaneous objection requirement is unreasonable or impossible, then postjudgment challenges should be permitted. When <em>Walker </em>was decided, if a postjudgment challenge was permitted, then the remand rule was one method by which to raise that challenge first in the trial court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The prosecutor argues that sentencing guidelines scoring challenges should be subject to the contemporaneous objection requirement. The State Appellate Defender Office responds that postjudgment challenges are necessary because too frequently the defendant does not receive the presentence report until the day of sentencing. Thus, the defendant and counsel cannot adequately review the report to determine if an objection should be raised until after sentencing._</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>We agree that when <em>Walker </em>was decided that problem may have existed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Since <em>Walker, </em>the court rules have been amended. MCR 6.425(B) requires the trial court to permit the defendant to review the presentence report \"a reasonable time before the day of sentencing.\u201d As the amici curiae observed, however, not all judges have the same notion of what is a reasonable time. While some courts provide the defendant a copy of the presentence report several days before sentencing, other courts provide a copy the day of sentencing, sometimes shortly before sentencing. Some defendants are not given a reasonable time to review the report. Thus, at the time of <em>Hernandez, </em>the necessity of permitting postjudgment challenges to the scoring still existed.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\">Although we stated in <em>Walker </em>that postjudgment challenges to the sentencing guidelines scoring are permitted, we also stated that the remand procedure was available when \"a defendant properly raises a challenge to the manner in which the guidelines are scored.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 267. The Court did not explain, however,. what the defendant must show to raise a challenge that warrants granting the motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">The Michigan Court Rules again were amended in 1989. The amendments affected the remand procedure and defendant Hernandez\u2019 right to file a postjudgment challenge to the sentencing guidelines scoring. MCR 6.429(C) was added in response to <em>Walker</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and it enables the defendant to challenge the sentence guidelines scoring:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-5\">(1) at sentencing, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">(2) by a motion for resentencing filed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">(a) within 42 days after entry of the judgment,[<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>] or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">(b) in accordance with the procedure set forth in MCR 7.208(B);[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>] or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">(3) by a timely filed motion to remand in the Court of Appeals under MCR 7.211(C)(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">This case involves MCR 7.211(C)(1), which has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>limitations regarding what cases must be remanded for filing a motion for resentencing in the trial court.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The remand procedure is not mandatory. MCR 7.208 already accords defendant twenty-eight days after the commencement of the time for filing a brief on appeal to file various motions in the trial court without the permission of the Court of Appeals. Requiring remand merely on the basis of such a filing would render meaningless the requirement of seeking the permission of the Court of Appeals if the defendant misses the twenty-eight day deadline. A mandatory remand also would require the Court of Appeals to remand every challenge, no matter how frivolous.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">Accordingly, when the remand procedure is available, it is not mandatory, but requires discretion by the Court of Appeals in determining when remand is appropriate. The trial court here did not certify that it would grant a motion for a new trial. Therefore, the remand motion only could be granted under MCR 7.211(C)(1)(a). Although this Court has addressed situations in which development of a record is necessary,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> it has not discussed the alternative requirement that the issue be one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>that \"should be initially decided by the trial court.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We now undertake that task in the context of a challenge to the sentencing guidelines scoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">An issue that initially should be decided by the trial court is different from an issue that must be raised first in the trial court to be preserved for appeal.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The former, as here, requires that the trial judge make the initial scoring decision. The latter requires that the defendant first raise an objection to the judge\u2019s scoring in the trial court or it is deemed waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">Although, the initial scoring of the sentencing guidelines must be completed by the trial court, a remand to challenge the judge\u2019s scoring of the sentencing guidelines is unnecessary where there is evidence to support the judge\u2019s initial scoring. The Court of Appeals decision in <em>People v </em>Green, 152 Mich App 16, 18; 391 NW2d 507 (1986), correctly recognized that the judge\u2019s scoring of the sentencing guidelines will be upheld if there is evidence to support the score.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> If the judge made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>an initial scoring decision that is supported by the evidence, then remand would not serve a useful purpose.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>People v Degraffenreid, </em>19 Mich App 702, 719; 173 NW2d 317 (1969). This case presents an excellent example of when it is unnecessary to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">During the hearing in which the trial judge accepted the defendant\u2019s guilty plea, the following discussion occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\"><em>The Court: </em>During the course of that fight, I understand you struck him on the head several times. I\u2019ve heard the number as many as ten, but at least several times. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-10\"><em>The Court: </em>You did hit him on the head several times with that ball bat?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-11\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-12\"><em>The Court: </em>And these weren\u2019t just little taps; you took a good swing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-13\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">Defendant all but admitted that he used excessive brutality several times when using \"good swings\u201d of the baseball bat to hit the victim on the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-15\">The presentence report included the statement that defendant \"continued to beat the victim with a baseball bat after the victim was down.\u201d Witnesses stated that \"Hernandez continued to beat him with the bat across the head and body until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>the bat broke, then jabbed him repeatedly with the splintered end.\u201d Terry Major told the detective that he \"pulled Hernandez off of the victim because the beating was so savage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Defendant\u2019s response regarding the continued beating was \"I hit him a couple of times after he was down ... on impulse. The guy came after me. I was protecting myself.\u201d Although there is testimony to the contrary, even if defendant\u2019s claim of protecting himself were true, he may only use force reasonably necessary to protect himself. Any additional force would be considered excessive. Here the additional force was more than excessive, it was brutal.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">The preliminary hearing, the presentence report, and the trial judge\u2019s discussion with defendant during the plea hearing, led the judge to explain at sentencing that he believed the incident to be \"very serious \u2014 and I think <em>vicious </em>is the right word \u2014 stabbing of a juvenile, and in this particular case involved a <em>repeated senseless beating.\u201d </em>The victim suffered serious injuries, including fift\u00e9en stitches in his head, a broken finger, and torn cartilage in his wrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The Court of Appeals could glean from the record evidence supporting the judge\u2019s initial scoring of fifty points for excessive brutality.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Consequently, the requirements of MCR 7.211(C)(1)(a) were not established, and denying the motion to remand would have been appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">The remand procedure should not be utilized for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>presentence issues that can be raised contemporaneously with the event giving rise to the challenge. To ensure fairness, in light of amici curiae\u2019s observations, we will consider amending the court rules to require trial judges to provide defendants with copies of reports and scoring within a specific number of days before sentencing.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> If a trial judge complies with the requirement, then the defendant will be required to object before or at sentencing to preserve a challenge to the scoring. If the judge fails to comply, then the defendant will have available a postsentencing challenge pursuant to MCR 6.429. On the basis of the intended amendment to the court rules, the remand procedure will no longer be necessary for sentencing guidelines scoring challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">MCR 7.208 also supports limiting use of the remand procedure. The staff comment to MCR 7.208(B) explains that the rule was created in response to the addition of MCR 6.425(F)(3).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> MCR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>6.425(F)(3) was created to \"substantially accelerate the commencement of appeals by having the [request for the appointment of an attorney] also act as a claim of appeal in cases in which the defendant\u2019s request for a lawyer was timely . . . .\u201d Staff Comment, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The increasing backlog in the Court of Appeals docket has become a matter of great concern over the years. MCR 6.425(F)(3) was one method of expediting disposition of appeals, and MCR 7.208(B) was another. Interestingly, MCR 7.208(B) was promulgated for the same jurisdictional concerns that led to the development of the remand procedure.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Thus, MCR 7.208(B) was created to serve additional purposes, one of which was easing the Court of Appeals docket by eliminating the right to seek a motion to remand to preserve an issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">It makes little sense to require the issue to be preserved for appeal and then to require the Court of Appeals to remand a case to preserve the issue upon the mere filing of a motion to remand. Because of jurisdictional concerns, we had to overlook that anomaly; but today, MCR 7.208(B) ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>dresses the jurisdictional concerns.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The remand procedure is necessary only for those issues that are preserved, but still requires additional proceedings in the trial court before being resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">In sum, we hold today that the Court of Appeals is not compelled to grant every motion to remand. Only those issues that meet the requirements of MCR 7.211(C)(1) must be remanded. The motion to remand may be denied if there is evidence supporting the judge\u2019s initial scoring of the challenged sentence guidelines variable. There clearly is evidence supporting the judge\u2019s initial scoring of fifty points for excessive brutality.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals decision to grant defendant\u2019s motion to remand.</p>\n<judges id=\"b147-7\">Levin, Brickley, Griffin, and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b128-14\"> MCR 7.211(C)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-15\">Motion To Remand.

As expressed in <em>Moore, </em>if the issue also is one that initi\u00e1lly should be decided by the trial court, the Court of Appeals must remand the case. Or, as expressed in <em>Ginther, </em>if development of a record also is necessary then the case must be remanded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b136-8\"> MCR 7.211 is based on former GCR 1963, 817.6. We note that throughout many of the amendments, several problems involving claims of appeal, appointment of counsel, and preparation of tran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>scripts in time to file postjudgment motions would have occurred if the remand procedure was not in force. For example, MCR 7.204(A)(2) also addressed the concern raised in <em>Ginther. </em>The rule, however, only applied in cases involving pleas of guilty or nolo contendere. Thus, under subsection (A)(2), the defendant was required to take an appeal of right in a criminal case within a specified time, but the transcript may not have been prepared within that time. The defendant therefore was forced to file a postjudgment motion without the transcript in order to toll the period during which the defendant was required to file the claim of appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b137-7\"> Generally this also should be discovered. If the record shows that the trial judge did not consider the invalid conviction, then there would be no need to remand the case for the trial judge to initially determine if resentencing should occur. The case may arise, however, where it is unclear whether the judge relied on the inaccurate information. In <em>People v Keller, </em>428 Mich 918; 410 NW2d 281 (1987), we ordered the Court of Appeals to remand on the basis of inaccurate information and a scoring challenge. The record did not support the judge\u2019s scoring, and it was unclear on what information the judge based the score. Under those circumstances, the issue was one that the trial court initially had to address. Similarly, because it was not clear whether the judge considered the invalid conviction to deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>mine a sentence, it was not possible to raise a contemporaneous objection. In the future, however, we would recommend that defense counsel specifically inquire regarding what information the judge relied on in determining a sentence. Also, because we have sentencing guidelines today, if the sentence would remain the same even without considering the invalid conviction, remand is unnecessary. The test is \"whether the sentence <em>'might </em>have been different\u2019 if the sentencing judge had known that the earlier convictions had been unconstitutionally obtained.\u201d <em>Moore </em>at 439, quoting <em>United States v Tucker, </em>n 5 <em>supra </em>at 448 (emphasis in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b138-8\"> GCR 1963, 785.7(7) was amended in 1983 to specifically provide that in guilty plea cases, the defendant had to \"file a motion to withdraw the plea in the trial court before the filing of the claim of appeal; the Court of Appeals need not grant a motion to remand pursuant to GCR 1963, 817.6(1) to allow a defendant the opportunity to file such a motion.\u201d Although that rule no longer exists today, at the time it demonstrated that the remand procedure was not avail,able to preserve all issues. Whether a guilty plea was voluntarily made is an issue to which an objection is possible. Thus, only if extenuating circumstances such as new evidence develop, challenges may not be raised pursuant to the remand procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b139-6\"> The court rule that existed at the time provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">Disclosure of Presentence Reports.

Both parties must be given an opportunity at the time of sentencing to explain or controvert any factual representations in the presentence report. [Former MCR 6.101(K).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b139-8\"> We commend Judge Kolenda for submitting the presentence report and scoring to defense counsel nine days before sentencing and for offering a presentencing conference to both parties. On the basis of the facts of the case, Judge Kolenda provided the report within a reasonable time before sentencing. The defendant here had ample opportunity to review the presentence report and the sentencing guidelines scoring and to raise an objection. The scoring of the offense severity level was uncomplicated and only involved scores for two categories: ov l, aggravated use of weapon = 15 points for touching the victim with a weapon; and ov 2, physical attack and/or injury = 50 points for treating the victim with excessive brutality.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">Substantial time is not required to review the offense variables, to consider the facts of the case, and to ponder whether a weapon was involved that touched the victim and whether the victim was treated with excessive brutality.

The motion must be made within the period for filing the brief, which is fifty-six days from the date discussed in n 8. MCR 7.212(A)(l)(a)(iii), however, permits the parties to stipulate a twenty-eight day extension for filing the brief, after which the parties could move for an additional month in the Court of Appeals. Thus, the time for filing the brief could be as long as 114 days. Such a rule for an issue that easily should have been raised at trial is not practical, economical, or judicially efficient.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b141-7\"> The remand procedure has been utilized when development of the record was required.

This defendant and his attorney were certainly presented with ample opportunity to review and challenge the presentence report and guidelines scoring. It is the intention of this Court to publish such a proposed rule for comment and adoption. Nonetheless, we summarize here the direction in which we believe the rule should head.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b145-8\"> MCR 7.208(B) was promulgated under the October 1, 1989, amendment. The staff comment explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-9\">MCR 7.208(B) creates a new procedure under which a criminal defendant-appellant may file postjudgment motions in the trial court notwithstanding the fact that the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction of the case because the order appointing appellate counsel serves as the claim of appeal. See MCR 6.425(F)(3). Unlike motions to remand under MCR 7.211(C)(1), leave of the Court of Appeals is not required to take advantage of this procedure. The defendant-appellant may take advantage of this procedure by filing a motion in the trial court within 28 days after the period for filing the appellant\u2019s brief has begun to run. The rule sets forth the time limits for processing such a motion in the trial court and for further proceedings in the Court of Appeals following various possible dispositions of the motion by the trial court.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b146-8\"> <em>Ginther </em>involved an attempt to withdraw a guilty plea. GCR 1963, 803.1(c) also was amended to provide that an appeal of right in a case involving a guilty plea could be brought within sixty days of the filing of the plea transcript. The amendment was \"designed to give appellate counsel the time to review the transcript of the plea proceeding and to move in the trial court for relief while that court still has jurisdiction over the case. . . . The amended rules were not designed to simply place one meaningless step into the review process but were designed to facilitate the entire process by allowing trial courts the opportunity to correct any errors in the first instance. Of course, one benefit to the system would be a reduction in the number of reversals based on an omission during the plea proceedings.\u201d <em>People v Richardson, </em>144 Mich App 616, 621; 376 NW2d 167 (1985). That rule does not exist today; however, MCR 7.204(A)(2), 7.208(B), and 7.211(C) serve the same purpose as that amendment and are not limited to plea cases. The \"benefit of such a procedure is that the trial court may rectify any error prior to the initiation of the formal appeal process . . . which will result not only in fewer appeals but in swifter resolutions.\u201d <em>Richardson </em>at 620.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b147-9\"> MCR 7.208(B) still protects the indigent defendant, who has forty-two days from the time the judgment is entered to file a claim of appeal. MCR 7.204(A)(2)(b). An indigent loses the opportunity to file a postsentence challenge in the trial court within forty-two days of sentencing, MCR 6.429(C)(2)(a), when filing the claim of appeal because the Court of Appeals obtains jurisdiction at that time. MCR 7.208(B), however, gives concurrent jurisdiction so that the defendant may file in the trial court, without Court of Appeals permission, within twenty-eight days from the time of the commencement of the time for filing the defendant-appellant\u2019s brief. MCR 7.212(A)(1)(a) (iii) states that the brief must be filed within fifty-six days from the latest of the filing of the claim of appeal, the certification of the order granting leave to appeal, or the filing of the transcript with the trial court or tribunal. An indigent defendant\u2019s filing time is the latter of the date counsel is appointed or date the transcripts are filed. Thus, the defendant will have appellate counsel, access to the transcript, and time to file a postsentence challenge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b147-8\">Boyle, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aa\">(concurring). I agree with the result and much of the analysis present in Chief Justice Cavanagh\u2019s opinion. However, I would go further and require an objection at sentencing to preserve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>a sentencing guidelines issue. This holding and an amendment to the rules would serve to alleviate congestion in the Court of Appeals, avoid delay and the expenditure of trial court resources in dealing with circuitous remand orders, make the treatment of all defendants, indigent or not, equal, and cure the anomalous result that a defendant who failed to object at sentencing could gain a remand while a defendant who failed to object to unconstitutionally seized evidence could not. Most importantly, it would repose the responsibility for accurate application of sentencing guidelines in the sentencing judge and trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">An objection must either be specific, when challenge is made to a portion of the presentence report, or general, when a sentencing judge refuses to grant additional time to a defendant who objects to the lack of a \"reasonable time\u201d to review the presentence report under MCR 6.425(B). Thus, I would now amend MCR 6.429(C) to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">(C) Preservation of Guidelines Scoring Issue.
