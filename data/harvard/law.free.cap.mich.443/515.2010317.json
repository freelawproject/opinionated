We hold that the bureau has jurisdiction and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b642-13\">The Bureau of Workers\u2019 Disability Compensation addressed the current dispute on a brief stipulation of facts that Willie Boyd was an Illinois resident, that he entered into a contract of employment in Michigan, that while executing his duties pursuant to the contract he sustained a personal injury and died in Indiana, and that the injury and death arose out of and in the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Boyd\u2019s widow filed a petition for benefits with the bureau. The magistrate dismissed the claim for want of jurisdiction, and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appellate Commission affirmed. The Court of Appeals denied plaintiff\u2019s application for leave to appeal, which this Court then granted. 441 Mich 931 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Section 845 of the workers\u2019 compensation act grants extraterritorial jurisdiction to the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Disability Compensation over claims resulting from injuries that occur outside Michigan.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-8\">The bureau shall have jurisdiction over all controversies arising out of injuries suffered outside this state where the injured employee is a resident of this state at the time of injury and the contract of hire was made in this state. Such employee or his dependents shall be entitled to the compensation and other benefits provided by this act. [MCL 418.845; MSA 17.237(845).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">In addition, the act broadly defines employees covered by the act.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-10\">Every person performing service in the course of the trade, business, profession, or occupation of an employer at the time of the injury, provided the person in relation to this service does not maintain a separate business, does not hold himself or herself out to and render service to the public, and is not an employer subject to this act. [MCL 418.161(l)(d); MSA 17.237(161)(l)(d).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">Juxtaposed against these statutory provisions is <em>Roberts v IXL Glass Corp, </em>259 Mich 644; 244 NW 188 (1932), the landmark case interpreting an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>earlier version of \u00a7 845 and enunciating the Michigan rule of law regarding extraterritoriality. In <em>Roberts, </em>the plaintiff contracted for employment in Michigan with a resident corporation. However, he resided, performed all services, and received his injury outside Michigan. The defendant argued that the statutory requirement<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>of residency in the state at the time of the injury limited the jurisdiction of the industry accident board and, for that reason, the board lacked jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">This Court disagreed, and concluded that the claimant was entitled to compensation even though he was not a Michigan resident.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\">[W]e are satisfied that the reasonable construction and the one necessary to carry out the legislative intent appearing from the whole act is that it covers nonresident as well as resident employees in those cases wherein the contract of employment is entered into in this State with a resident employer.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The Court interpreted the jurisdictional provision in pari materia with the respective statutory provisions broadly defining the term \u201cemployee\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>setting forth the scope of the statute\u2019s coverage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-4\">[Defendant\u2019s] contention [regarding residency] would come with much, if not controlling, force if it were not in conflict with other portions of the statute. It is quite significant that this recital as to the employee being a resident at the time of injury was embodied by the amendment in the procedural part (part 3) of the act only; but was not inserted in the part of the act (part 1) which defines and fixes the rights and liabilities of employers and employees. . . . Further, the quoted portion of section 6[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] seems conclusive of the fact that the original enactment was intended to cover \"all employees\u201d regardless of residence or the locus of the accident. <em>[Roberts, supra </em>at 647.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">This Court further noted that the statute expressly provided for compensation to the dependents of a fatally injured employee regardless of the residence of the dependents. \"As a matter of legislative policy it would be quite inconsistent\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to deny compensation to an injured employee because he was a nonresident, while awarding compensation to the dependents of a fatally injured employee regardless of residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">At the time this Court decided <em>Roberts, </em>the workers\u2019 compensation act was elective, that is, an employer was not automatically subject to the act\u2019s provisions. However, the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>amended the act in 1943, making it compulsory.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Shortly after the 1943 amendment, this Court addressed the jurisdictional provision of the act but failed to mention <em>Roberts. </em>See <em>Cline v Byrne Doors, Inc, </em>324 Mich 540; 37 NW2d 630 (1949); <em>Daniels v Trailer Transport Co, 327 </em>Mich 525; 42 NW2d 828 (1950). The omission of <em>Roberts </em>from the analyses of those cases is fathomable; <em>Cline </em>and <em>Daniels </em>are distinguishable from <em>Roberts </em>in that they involved claims for additional benefits under the act after the employee first obtained compensation from the state where the injury occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Some time later, in <em>Austin v W Biddle Walker Co, 11 </em>Mich App 311; 161 NW2d 150 (1968), the Court of Appeals reaffirmed <em>Roberts. </em>Austin was a Kentucky resident who contracted in Michigan with a Michigan corporation. Austin worked for a brief period in Michigan, but was transferred to Kentucky, where he sustained an injury. The wcab found that because the contract of employment was entered into in Michigan, the board had jurisdiction pursuant to <em>Roberts. </em>The Court of Appeals affirmed and concluded that statutory amendments making the act compulsory had no eifect on the holding in Roberts.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Judge Levin dissented because of his disagreement with the majority\u2019s emphasis on the place of contracting. Nonetheless, he persuasively asserted that strict adherence to the residency requirement in \u00a7 845 is neither warranted nor desirable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">It is now 35 years since <em>Roberts </em>was decided. Whatever may have been the legislative intention at the time of adoption of the residency require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>ment (CL 1948, \u00a7 413.19 [Stat Ann 1960 Rev \u00a7 17.193]), it would be inappropriate at this late date to attempt to breathe new life into a statutory provision which was aborted so long ago. If the legislature desired to insist on a residency requirement, it could have done so at any time within the last 35 years; it was inferentially invited to do so in <em>Roberts, </em>p 649.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Despite the continued vitality of <em>Roberts </em>as recognized in <em>Austin, </em>the Court of Appeals has begun to interpret \u00a7 845 in contravention of <em>Roberts. </em>In <em>Wolf v Ethyl Corp, </em>124 Mich App 368; 335 NW2d 42 (1983), the plaintiff was hired in Michigan by a Virginia corporation. Following a transfer to and while working in New York, the plaintiff resided in Connecticut. The plaintiff subsequently sustained injuries in a work-related car accident in New York and filed for disability benefits in Michigan. The wcab concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s nonresidence in Michigan at the time of the accident precluded jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals affirmed and held that the clear and unambiguous language of \u00a7 845 requires both that the injured employee be a resident of Michigan at the time of injury and that the employment contract was consummated in Michigan.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">We find that the case of <em>Roberts v IXL Glass Corp, </em>259 Mich 644; 244 NW 188 (1932), which can be read as suggesting a different result, is not applicable to today\u2019s modern mandatory workers\u2019 compensation scheme. . . . The present statutory scheme has been made mandatory and has been revised and refined. Being bound not to usurp legislative power, see Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2; <em>Michigan Harness Horsemen\u2019s Ass\u2019n [v Racing Comm\u2019r, </em>123 Mich App 388; 333 NW2d 292 (1983)], we must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>apply the clear legislative mandate of the modern act\u2019s jurisdictional provisions![<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The Court then retreated from announcing a new bright line rule by limiting the holding to the facts in that case, because \"[q]uestions of residency, dual residency or temporary domicile to perform contractual employment must await case-by-case interpretation.\u201d <em>Wolf, supra </em>at 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">A few years later, the Court of Appeals followed <em>Wolf </em>in a similar case. In <em>Hall v Chrysler Corp, </em>172 Mich App 670; 432 NW2d 398 (1988), reconsideration den 432 Mich 931 (1989), the plaintiff was hired in Michigan and later accepted a transfer to Delaware. While working and residing in Delaware, the plaintiff alleged a disabling personal injury and filed for benefits. The wcab dismissed the claim for lack of jurisdiction and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">Because of the different nature of the 1912 Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the <em>Wolf </em>Court held the <em>Roberts </em>decision to be inapplicable to the plain language of the Michigan wdca. We agree with the reasoning contained in the <em>Wolf </em>decision and find that a person must be a resident of the state at the time of the injury and be subject to the terms of an employment contract entered into in Michigan.[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\"><em>Wolf </em>and <em>Hall </em>indicate that <em>Roberts </em>is no longer controlling because of amendments made in the workers\u2019 compensation act after <em>Roberts </em>was decided. Specifically, those cases suggest that because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number><em>Roberts </em>was decided at a time when the act was elective, <em>Roberts </em>is no longer valid. However, as the Court of Appeals noted in <em>Austin, </em>the relevant portion of the act has remained unchanged. The fact that the act became compulsory subsequent to <em>Roberts </em>is irrelevant; the requirements of \u00a7 845 have remained intact. Accordingly, <em>Wolf </em>and <em>Hall </em>may be reduced to the conclusion that <em>Roberts </em>is no longer valid precedent because it is \"too old.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">As the Court of Appeals repeatedly noted, it is the Supreme Court\u2019s obligation to overrule or modify case law if it becomes obsolete, and until this Court takes such action, the Court of Appeals and all lower courts are bound by that authority. <em>Edwards v Clinton Valley Center, </em>138 Mich App 312; 360 NW2d 606 (1984); <em>McMillan v Michigan State Hwy Comm, </em>130 Mich App 630; 344 NW2d 26 (1983); <em>Ratliff v General Motors Corp, </em>127 Mich App 410; 339 NW2d 196 (1983); <em>Schwartz v City of Flint (After Remand), </em>120 Mich App 449; 329 NW2d 26 (1982), rev\u2019d on other grounds 426 Mich 295; 395 NW2d 678 (1986). While the Court of Appeals may properly express its belief that a decision of this Court was wrongly decided or is no longer viable, that conclusion does not excuse the Court of Appeals from applying the decision to the case before it. <em>People v Mitchell, </em>428 Mich 364; 408 NW2d 798 (1987). Because this Court has never overruled <em>Roberts, </em>it remains valid precedent. The rule of law regarding extraterritorial jurisdiction as expressed in <em>Roberts </em>should have been applied by the bureau in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">If the allegedly \"out-dated\u201d <em>Roberts </em>decision is overruled by this Court, then a significant gap in coverage will exist in this state\u2019s compensation scheme. Specifically, all Michigan employees who suffer an out-of-state injury in the course of their employment and who reside in neighboring states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>will not be subject to the bureau\u2019s jurisdiction.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We believe that such a jurisdictional scheme is not only undesirable but also unduly restrictive. As Professor Larson notes,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">In the majority of states, the local statute will be applied if the place of injury, or the place of hiring, or the place of employment relation is within the state. Two-thirds of the states will take jurisdiction of out-of-state injuries if either the place of hiring or the place of employment relation is within the state. These two factors figure in most of the other states in different combinations.[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-7\"><em>Roberts </em>remains an effective means of retaining a fair and consistent scheme for extraterritorial jurisdiction. This Court has stated that a court will not overrule a decision deliberately made unless the Court is convinced not merely that the case was wrongly decided, but also that less injury would result from overruling than from following it. <em>Dolby v State Hwy Comm\u2019r, </em>283 Mich 609; 278 NW 694 (1938). Clearly, because of the gap in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>coverage that would result, overruling <em>Roberts </em>would cause a far greater injury than allowing <em>Roberts </em>to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">The dissent\u2019s assertion that <em>Roberts </em>was wrongly decided and contrary to the plain meaning of the statute<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> does not change the fact that the Legislature has acquiesced in extraterritorial jurisdiction as expressed in <em>Roberts </em>for over sixty years, despite numerous opportunities in the statutory history of the workers\u2019 compensation act to amend \u00a7 845. This Court has stated that the doctrine of stare decisis applies with full force to decisions construing statutes or ordinances, especially where the Legislature acquiesces in the Court\u2019s construction through the continued use of or failure to change the language of a construed statute. <em>Consumers Power Co v Muskegon Co, </em>346 Mich 243; 78 NW2d 223 (1956).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In <em>Dean v Chrysler Corp, </em>434 Mich 655, 664; 455 NW2d 699 (1990), we stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-5\">When, over a period of many years, the Legislature has acquiesced in this Court\u2019s construction of a statute, the judicial power to change that interpretation ought to be exercised with great restraint. On more than one occasion our Court has quoted with approval the statement that stare decisis \"is especially applicable where the construction placed on a statute by previous decisions has been long acquiesced in by the legislature, by its continued use or failure to change the language of the statute so construed, the power to change the law as interpreted being regarded, in such circumstances, as one to be exercised solely by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>legislature.\u201d <em>[Consumers Power Co v Muskegon Co, </em>346 Mich 243, 251; 78 NW2d 223 (1956), quoting 21 CJS, Courts, \u00a7 214, pp 388-390. See also <em>In re Clayton Estate, </em>343 Mich 101, 107; 72 NW2d 1 (1955)].[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">We further noted that the principles of stare decisis are particularly applicable when the Legislature has reenacted the statutory language without change. <em>Id. </em>at 665. The Legislature has revised the wdca several times but has yet to take any action that would indicate its disapproval of the <em>Roberts </em>interpretation of \u00a7 845. Because of its failure to amend \u00a7 845, the Legislature has accepted the interpretation of that section given by this Court in <em>Roberts </em>as an important part of the entire workers\u2019 compensation scheme. Thus, we believe that this Court should not disturb the <em>Roberts </em>interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">We conclude that pursuant to \u00a7 845 of the workers\u2019 compensation act and <em>Roberts v IXL Glass Corp, supra, </em>the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Disability Compensation shall have jurisdiction over extraterritorial injuries without regard to the employee\u2019s residence, provided the contract of employment was entered into in this state with a resident employer. In the present case, the bureau erred in failing to find that it had jurisdiction over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s claim. As a result, we remand this case to the bureau for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b653-5\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Levin and Boyle, JJ., concurred with Mallett, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b644-7\"> 1921 PA 173, amended the statute and added \u00a7 19, part III, which currently exists as \u00a7 845. 1929 CL 8458 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-8\">The industrial accident board shall have jurisdiction over all controversies arising out of injuries suffered without the territorial limits of this state in those cases where the injured employe is a resident of this state at the time of the injury, and the contract of hire was made in this State, and any such employe or his dependents shall be entitled to the compensation or death benefits provided by this act.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b644-9\"> <em>Roberts, supra </em>at 648-649.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b644-10\"> 1929 CL 8413.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-11\">The term \"employe\u201d as used in this act shall be construed to mean . . .

Many nonresident employees work for resident corporations and perform a great deal of services both in and out of the state. For example, a truck driver or salesman who lives in Toledo, Ohio, and works for a Michigan corporation falls in this category.

Because I believe the plain language of the workers\u2019 compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>sation statute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> precludes jurisdiction of the bureau over plaintiff\u2019s claim, I would affirm the decision of the bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Plaintiff is the widow of a carnival operator who was killed in a motor vehicle accident in Indiana. Plaintiff\u2019s decedent was a resident of Illinois and was employed in Michigan to move a carnival from Michigan to Mississippi. The Michigan magistrate and workers\u2019 compensation appellate commission agreed that plaintiff was precluded from bringing a workers\u2019 compensation claim in Michigan. The Court of Appeals denied leave \"for lack of merit in the grounds presented.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This Court granted leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">The statute defining the limit of the jurisdiction of the bureau is clear and unambiguous: jurisdiction over controversies arising out of injuries suffered outside Michigan exists where (1) \"the injured employee is a resident of this state at the time of injury <em>and </em>[(2)] the contract of hire was made in this state.\u201d MCL 418.845; MSA 17.237(845). The definition of employee, MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>418.161(l)(d); MSA 17.237(161)(l)(d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> does not conflict with the jurisdictional section, but rather is part of that provision. If the worker is not an \"employee,\u201d as defined by the statute, no question of jurisdiction would arise because the injured party does not come under the workers\u2019 compensation act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If the employee satisfies the broad definition in the statute and is injured outside Michigan in the course of his employment, the court must look to MCL 418.845; MSA 17.237(845) to determine whether it may take jurisdiction over the compensation claim. Every employer and employee satisfying the definitional provisions of the act is bound thereby, MCL 418.111; MSA 17.237(111); however, if the jurisdictional provision is not satisfied as well, the act \"otherwise specifically provide[s]\u201d that the board shall not have jurisdiction over the claim. As Justice Levin noted in his dissenting opinion in <em>Austin v W Biddle Walker Co, </em>11 Mich App 311, 324; 161 NW2d 150 (1968), every employee falling within the broad definition and every contract executed in Michigan, does not fall within the coverage of the workers\u2019 compensation statute. MCL 418.845; MSA 17.237(845) declares in unambiguous language that the bureau <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>will have jurisdiction over out-of-state injuries only where the employee is a Michigan resident and the employment contract was made in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">No construction is required where the plain language of the statute identifies when an out-of-state injury is within the purview of the Michigan workers\u2019 compensation act. See <em>Owendale-Gagetown School Dist v State Bd of Ed, </em>413 Mich 1, 8; 317 NW2d 529 (1982). In MCL 418.845; MSA 17.237(845), the Legislature established the boundaries and limits of the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Disability Compensation over out-of-state injuries. <em>Daniels v Trailer Transport Co, </em>327 Mich 525, 530; 42 NW2d 828 (1950).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">The earlier case of <em>Roberts v IXL Glass Corp, </em>259 Mich 644; 244 NW 188 (1932), however, essentially eliminated the employee residency requirement from the jurisdiction provision. The Court found that the workers\u2019 compensation act of 1921 contained inconsistent provisions, essentially the identical provisions existing in the present statute. Part 1 fixed the rights and liabilities of employees and employers. Part 3 was the procedural part of the act and contained the limitation on the jurisdiction of the industrial accident board. <em>Id. </em>at 647.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Plaintiff in the instant case argues that after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>decision in <em>Roberts, </em>a nonresident employee could receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits for an injury suffered out of state where the contract of employment was executed in Michigan.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Subsequent decisions of the Court of Appeals have split in their treatment of <em>Roberts. </em>In <em>Austin, supra </em>at 314, a majority of the Court of Appeals acknowledged that MCL 418.845; MSA 17.237(845) facially requires the employee to be a Michigan resident and the employment contract to be executed in Michigan. The Court reasoned that it was compelled, however, to follow <em>Roberts, </em>hence awarding benefits to a nonresident employee for an injury suffered in Kentucky because the employment contract was executed in Michigan. Judge Levin dissented, favoring a case-by-case approach to determinations of Michigan workers\u2019 compensation jurisdiction. He reasoned that <em>Roberts </em>eliminated \u00a7 19 altogether, <em>id. </em>at 320, and that the premise of <em>Roberts </em>was undermined by the elimination of the optional nature of the workers\u2019 compensation statutes and by the elimination of the statutory language regarding an electing employer\u2019s agreement \" 'to cover and protect all employees employed in any and all of his businesses\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327. Judge Levin concluded that because the workers\u2019 compensation scheme was optional, if an employer chose to take part in the workers\u2019 compensation scheme, it created a contract with its employees that followed the employee wherever the employee worked. He further asserted that subsequent Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>cases rejected the place of contracting as determinative of application of Michigan\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation scheme.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">In <em>Wolf v Ethyl Corp, </em>124 Mich App 368, 370; 335 NW2d 42 (1983), the Court of Appeals rejected <em>Roberts, </em>finding it inapplicable to \"today\u2019s modern mandatory workers\u2019 compensation scheme.\u201d The Court of Appeals instead determined that <em>Roberts </em>applied only to the \"earlier, voluntary workers\u2019 compensation statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court then held that a nonresident plaintiff who contracted for employment in Michigan but was injured in New York could not recover Michigan workers\u2019 compensation benefits because the two requirements of MCL 418.845; MSA 17.237(845) were not met. The Court of Appeals in the following cases also applied the unambiguous language of MCL 418.845; MSA 17.237(845) and refused to follow <em>Roberts\u2019 </em>elimination of the residency requirement. <em>Hall v Chrysler Corp, </em>172 Mich App 670; 432 NW2d 398 (1988) (no benefits were awarded to a nonresident employee injured in Delaware, even though the contract for hire was executed in Michigan); <em>Bell v FJ Boutell Driveaway Co, </em>141 Mich App 802; 369 NW2d 231 (1985) (no benefits were awarded to a nonresident employee injured in Ohio); <em>Jensen v Prudential Ins Co of America, </em>118 Mich App 501; 325 NW2d 469 (1982) (no benefits were awarded to a nonresident employee injured in Wisconsin; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>contract for hire was executed in Minnesota, although the job was to be performed primarily in Michigan). I believe that this line of authority properly follows the clear language of the jurisdictional statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">Other decisions, although involving Michigan resident employees, recognize the two requirements of MCL 418.845; MSA 17.237(845). <em>Crenshaw v Chrysler Corp, </em>394 Mich 513; 232 NW2d 166 (1975) (no benefits were awarded to a Michigan resident injured in Ohio where the contract of employment was executed in Ohio); <em>Rodwell v Pro Football, Inc, </em>45 Mich App 408; 206 NW2d 773 (1973) (benefits were awarded to a Michigan resident employee who was injured in Pennsylvania where the contract for hire was executed in Michigan; the residency of the employer was irrelevant).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The legal premise of the <em>Roberts </em>decision is not persuasive in light of the compulsory nature of the present workers\u2019 compensation act. The <em>Roberts </em>Court reasoned that its construction of the extraterritorial effect of the act was in accord with the construction of other optional compensation acts. <em>Id. </em>at 649. An optional act becomes a part of the employment contract when both the employer and the employee choose to be bound by the act\u2019s terms. It is arguable that, as with other contract terms such as wages and hours, the terms of the act would therefore follow the employee wherever the employee acted within the scope of his employment. <em>Id. </em>at 652; see also <em>Crane v Leonard, Crossette &amp; Riley, </em>214 Mich 218, 231; 183 NW 204 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Application of the terms of the workers\u2019 compensation act is now required by statute, rather than by contract. Both the <em>Crane </em>and the <em>Roberts </em>Courts recognized the reasoning that distinguishes between these two types of acts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>\"[I]t may be stated on the weight of authority that acts not construed to be contractual in character do not, in the absence of unequivocal language to the contrary, apply where the injury occurs outside the State . . . [Crane, <em>supra </em>at 222, quoting 1 Honnold, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a78.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">\"We are told that no distinction in construction is to be based upon whether the act is compulsory or elective. That is true as to some provisions of compensation acts. But that the statute is elective has controlling bearing on one thing that is most highly important. Where the statute is elective as to both employer and employee, payment of compensation is not the performance of a statute duty, but the performance of conditions in the contract of hiring . . . <em>.\u2019\u2019[Id. </em>at 225.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-7\">\"Where the statute compels submission by the employer and employee, there is no contract, as a general rule, enforceable outside of the State.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 226.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-8\">\"[A]cts not construed to be contractual in character do not, in the absence of unequivocal language to the contrary, apply where the injury occurs outside the State, while, on the other hand, acts construed to be contractual protect one injured outside the State, where the contract of employment was made within the State and is governed by the laws of the State.\u201d <em>[Roberts, supra </em>at 651.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">Whether the modern act covers an employee depends upon whether the requirements of the statute have been met. Therefore if the extraterritorial jurisdiction requirements are not met, an injury is not compensable under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">The majority asserts that if <em>Roberts </em>is overruled, \"all Michigan employees who suffer an out-of-state injury in the course of their employment and who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>reside in neighboring states will not be subject to the bureau\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 523-524. If the employee is not a Michigan resident and suffers an injury during the course of. his employment outside Michigan, labeling him as a \"Michigan employee\u201d is misleading. There is no legal or logical authority for defining a \"Michigan employee\u201d solely as one who has contracted for employment in Michigan. Although the denial of benefits may seem harsh, it is not within this Court\u2019s authority to alter the clear provisions of the statute under consideration. Workers\u2019 compensation is a matter of statutory grace, <em>Selk v Detroit Plastic Products, </em>419 Mich 1, 11; 345 NW2d 184 (1984), and is not an equitable remedy. Equitable considerations are not proper where the Legislature has clearly enunciated the limits of the workers\u2019 compensation bureau. That the employee may or may not receive benefits in another state<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is not a pivotal factor, and is not a criteria in the statutory definitions of an employee or the jurisdictional limits of the bureau. Although there may be some employees who therefore are left without Michigan workers\u2019 compensation coverage, this Court is bound to follow the language of the statute, rather than the equities of a single situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">The majority does not dispute that the language of the extraterritorial provision is clear or that the analysis in <em>Roberts </em>is no longer persuasive.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Hence, the majority\u2019s argument rests primarily on the principle of legislative acquiescence, rather than on the propriety of the <em>Roberts </em>decision. \"Because of the indirect nature of the support it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>provides, the legislative acquiescence principle, even when applicable, is not alone controlling.\u201d <em>Lamb v Bureau of Pardons, </em>106 Mich App 175, 183; 307 NW2d 754 (1981), citing <em>Magreta v Ambassador Steel Co, </em>380 Mich 513, 520; 158 NW2d 473 (1968). Considering the changes in the nature of the workers\u2019 compensation system, as well as the clarity of the statutory language, the principle of legislative acquiescence should not be used to continue a decision that lacks persuasive legal foundation. Moreover, the clarity of the conjunctive language used in MCL 418.845; MSA 17.237(845) also supports the argument that the Legislature could not change the language of the statute after <em>Roberts </em>to add a residency requirement, because the clear language already existed in the statute and nothing else needed to be added. Therefore, legislative acquiescence to the <em>Roberts </em>decision is not as clear as the majority suggests. <em>Ante </em>at 525-526.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">By failing to recognize the change in the nature of the compensation act, the majority imposes a responsibility on the employer beyond that which is required by statute. Despite contrary precedent from 1932, I would recognize the existing clear language of MCL 418.845; MSA 17.237(845) defining coverage by the Michigan workers\u2019 compensation act to exist with regard to out-of-state injuries only where the claimant is a Michigan resident and the contract of employment was executed in Michigan. I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b662-6\">Griffin, J., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b654-10\"> MCL 418.845; MSA 17.237(845) provides for jurisdiction of the bureau of workers\u2019 compensation over claims</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-11\">arising out of injuries suffered outside this state where the injured employee is a resident of this state at the time of the injury and the contract of hire was made in this state.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b654-12\"> Unpublished order of the Court of Appeals, entered January 8, 1992 (Docket No. 145746).

This provision encompasses all employees, even those who contracted for employment outside the state.

This Court reversed, finding that the facts did not bring the plaintiff within provisions of the act defining the board\u2019s jurisdiction.
