The Juvenile Justice Code (Code), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-20 to -90, authorizes the imposition of an extended-term sentence in two situations and, in this matter, we must construe the statutory prerequisites for one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-44(d)(3) authorizes the Family Part court to impose an extended-term sentence on a juvenile adjudged delinquent of a qualifying present offense if the court \u201cfinds that the juvenile was adjudged delinquent on at least two separate occasions, for offenses which, if committed by an adult, would constitute a crime of the first or second degree, and was previously committed to an adult or juvenile facility.\u201d Here, we are called on to determine whether section 4A-44(d)(3) requires two previous adjudications or whether the adjudication for which the juvenile presently is being sentenced may itself count as the second predicate offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">The facts and procedural history to the sentencing that gives rise to the legal question before the Court can be briefly summarized.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>On April 29, 2009, Kyle <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was charged in a Burlington County Juvenile Complaint with conduct that, if committed by an adult, would have constituted first-degree robbery contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1. At a hearing conducted on July 20, 2009, the Family Part court, after finding the State had failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the robbery had been committed with intent to kill or inflict serious bodily injury, adjudged Kyle delinquent for committing an act that would have constituted second-degree robbery if committed by an adult. That adjudication subjected him to a maximum period of incarceration of three years. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-44(d)(1)(d). If he had been adjudged, as charged, of the equivalent of a first-degree offense, he would have been subject to a maximum period of incarceration of four years. <em>N.J.SJL </em>2A:4A-44(d)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">A disposition hearing was conducted on July 27, 2009, and the State moved for the imposition of an extended term of incarceration under section 4A-44(d)(3), which provides in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">Upon application by the prosecutor, the court may sentence a juvenile who has been convicted of a crime of the first, second, or third degree if committed by an adult, to an extended term of incarceration beyond the maximum set forth in <em>\u00cdN.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-i4(d)(l)], if it finds that the juvenile was adjudged delinquent on at least two separate occasions, for offenses which, if committed by an adult, would constitute a crime of the first or second degree, and was previously committed to an adult or juvenile facility. The extended term shall not exceed five additional years for an act which would constitute murder and shall not exceed two additional year\u2019s for all other crimes of the first degree or second degree, if committed by an adult, and one additional year for a crime of the third degree, if committed by an adult.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-44(d)(3).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Thus, the State\u2019s application sought to have Kyle sentenced to a maximum extended-term sentence totaling five years of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">Kyle had been adjudged delinquent on three occasions prior to the offense giving rise to this appeal. The first two adjudications involved minor offenses that did not meet section 4A-44(d)(3)\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>predicate requirement of first- or second-degree offense adjudications: (1) in April 2007 Kyle was adjudged delinquent for disturbing the peace, a disorderly persons offense; and (2) in August 2007 Kyle was adjudged delinquent on a fourth-degree riot complaint. Also, neither of those adjudications resulted in his commitment to a juvenile detention facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">However, in March 2008 Kyle was adjudged delinquent of second-degree aggravated assault and was sentenced, consistent with a plea agreement, to twenty-four months\u2019 incarceration at the New Jersey Training School. As part of the plea agreement in that matter, the State agreed not to oppose recall of Kyle and the other individuals sentenced along with him. <em>See State ex rel. R.M., </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>434, 453, 661 A.2d 1277 (1995) (discussing Family Part\u2019s authority \u201cto recall eases previously decided and to modify dispositions previously ordered\u201d). In September 2008, after Kyle had served six months of his custodial sentence, the court conducted a recall hearing and ordered his release and placement in the Juvenile Intensive Supervision Program (JISP).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, Kyle was noncompliant and failed to complete JISP. After being charged with violation of JISP, his participation was terminated on March 3, 2009. Noting Kyle\u2019s approaching eighteenth birthday, the Family Part court dismissed the JISP violation and discharged the few months remaining on Kyle\u2019s sentence while cautioning Kyle to remain offense free. Less than two months later, Kyle committed the act of delinquency resulting in his current sentence and this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>In respect of the challenged sentence, the disposition court held, after taking Kyle\u2019s prior adjudication on the second-degree aggravated assault charge and the present adjudication into consideration, that as a matter of law Kyle was extended-term eligible under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-44(d)(3). The court sentenced Kyle to the maximum permissible term of three years at a juvenile detention facility pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-44(d)(1) with an additional two-year extended term pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:4A-44(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Kyle appealed his sentence and the Appellate Division affirmed. <em>In re K.O., </em>424 <em>N.J.Super. </em>555, 566, 39 A.3d 202 (App.Div.2012). With respect to the statutory analysis, the panel compared section 4A-44(d)(3)\u2019s language to that contained in the other section authorizing an extended-term sentence for juvenile adjudications, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-44(d)(4).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The panel interpreted section 4A-44(d)(3) as permitting the imposition of an extended term whenever there are two separate occasions of a first- or second-degree offense, one of which involved a period of incarceration. Noting that section 4A-44(d)(3) does not refer to previous or prior offenses, the panel rejected the argument that section 4A-44(d)(3) requires two <em>previous </em>adjudications in order for a juvenile to be extended-term eligible for a present adjudication. Applying that approach to extended-term eligibility under section 4A-44(d)(3), the panel found that Kyle qualified and that the trial court committed no abuse of discretion in imposing an extended-term sentence in Kyle\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Kyle filed a petition for certification challenging his eligibility for an extended-term sentence under section 4A-44(d)(3). On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>November 9, 2012, we granted certification in this matter. 212 <em>NJ. </em>460, 56 A.3d 395 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Kyle contends on appeal that he does not meet the requirements for an extended-term sentence set forth in <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2A:4A-44(d)(3) because he did not have two prior delinquency adjudications for conduct equivalent to first- or second-degree offenses at the time of the disposition hearing. Kyle argues that a juvenile\u2019s current offense should not qualify as one of the two predicate offenses required to impose an extended term under section 4A-44(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">He supports this contention by relying on the section\u2019s plain language and legislative history, which, he contends, express a legislative intent \u201cto punish repetitive offenders.\u201d In advancing a plain language argument, Kyle contends that the use of past tense in section 4A-44(d)(3) implies a requirement that the qualifying offenses must have been prior offenses. He claims that the Appellate Division placed undue weight on the absence of the terms \u201cprior\u201d or \u201cprevious\u201d within section 4A-44(d)(3). He further argues that, when section 4A-44(d)(3) is read in concert with section 4A-44(d)(4), it becomes clear that the Legislature did not intend for the instant offense to qualify as one of the two predicate offenses required under section 4A-44(d)(3). In the alternative, Kyle argues that the rule of lenity should apply if the Court finds ambiguity in the language of section 4A-44(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">The State argues that section 4A-44(d)(3) should be read to allow for the imposition of an extended term so long as there are two separate qualifying offenses, inclusive of the instant offense. Thus, the State\u2019s interpretation would require only two separate delinquency proceedings. The State relies on the plain language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>of the statute, emphasizing the Legislature\u2019s use of \u201cseparate\u201d instead of \u201cprior\u201d or \u201cprevious\u201d when discussing qualifying offenses. The State also finds support for its construction of section 4A-44(d)(3) in the statute\u2019s legislative history. The State contends that Kyle\u2019s arguments regarding the Legislature\u2019s use of past tense and the applicability of the rule of lenity are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Because statutory interpretation involves the examination of legal issues, it is considered a question of law. <em>McGovern v. Rutgers, </em>211 <em>N.J. </em>94, 107-08, 47 A.3d 724 (2012). Accordingly, a de novo standard of review applies on appeal. <em>Ibid.-, see also State v. Gandhi, </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>161,176, 989 A.2d 256 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">In statutory interpretation, a court\u2019s role \u201cis to determine and effectuate the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Allen v. V &amp; A Bros., </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>114, 127, 26 A.3d 430 (2011). The first step toward that end is to consider the plain language of the statute. <em>Norfolk S. Ry. Co. v. Intermodal Props., LLC, </em>215 <em>N.J. </em>142, 166, 71 A.3d 830 (2013) (quoting <em>Pizzullo v. N.J. Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>251, 264, 952 A.2d 1077 (2008)). Statutory language should be given its ordinary meaning and be construed in a common-sense manner. <em>N.J. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot. v. Huber, </em>213 <em>N.J. </em>338, 365, 63 A.3d 197 (2013); <em>N.E.R.I. Corp. v. N.J. Highway Auth., </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>223, 236, 686 A.2d 328 (1996). Further, when construing the Legislature\u2019s words, every effort should be made to avoid rendering any part of the statute superfluous. <em>See Jersey Cent. Power &amp; Light Co. v. Melcar Util. Co., </em>212 <em>N.J. </em>576, 587, 59 A.3d 561 (2013) (noting \u201cbedrock assumption\u201d that Legislature did not use meaningless or unnecessary language).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">In sum, our overriding goal is to discern and effectuate the legislative intent underlying the statutory provision at issue. <em>N.J. Dep\u2019t of Children &amp; Families, Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. A.L., </em>213 <em>N.J. </em>1, 20, 59 A.3d 576 (2013). Our role is not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>\u201crewrite a plainly-written enactment of the Legislature []or [to] presume that the Legislature intended something other than that expressed by way of the plain language.\u201d <em>DiProspero v. Penn, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>477, 492, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005) (first alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). Where the language is unclear or ambiguous, or if the Legislature\u2019s intention is otherwise uncertain, resort may be had to extrinsic aids to \u201cassist us in our understanding of the Legislature\u2019s will.\u201d <em>Pizzullo, supra, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>at 264, 952 A.2d 1077; <em>see also Roberts v. State, Div. of State Police, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>516, 521, 924 A.2d 550 (2007); <em>DiProspero, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 492, 874 A.2d 1039.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">In the statutory construction question at issue, we consider a sentencing provision in the legislative scheme governing the dispensing of juvenile justice. The rehabilitation of juvenile offenders is the goal of the juvenile justice system. <em>See State ex rel. C.V., </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>281, 295, 990 A.2d 640 (2010); <em>State ex rel. J.D.H., </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>475, 483, 795 A.2d 851 (2002). The Code balances its intention to act in the best interests of the juvenile and to promote his or her rehabilitation with the need to protect the public welfare. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-21 (enumerating Code\u2019s purposes). While rehabilitation of juveniles has historically been at the heart of juvenile justice, <em>see In re Gault, </em>387 <em>U.S. </em>1, 15-16, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>1428, 1437, 18 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>527, 539 (1967), modern experiences with serious juvenile crimes have elevated the importance of punitive sanctions in juvenile dispositions, <em>see State v. Presha, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>304, 314, 748 A.2d 1108 (2000) (noting that \u201cpunishment has now joined rehabilitation as a component of the State\u2019s core mission with respect to juvenile offenders\u201d). This Court has noted that the Legislature underscored that the Code\u2019s sanctions are not just for the purpose of accomplishing rehabilitation but are also \u201cdesigned to promote accountability and protect the public.\u201d <em>State v. Franklin, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>456, 466, 815 A.2d 964 (2003) (quoting language added in 1995 to statement of Code\u2019s purposes in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number><em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:4A-21(b)). In this matter, we must construe a clearly punitive sanction available under the Code\u2014one included in the Code when it was adopted in 1982 that enables the Family Part court to impose an extended-term sentence on a juvenile.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-44(d)(3) bears repeating in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">Upon application by the prosecutor, the court may sentence a juvenile who has been convicted of a crime of the first, second, or third degree if committed by an adult, to an extended term of incarceration beyond the maximum set forth in <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-44(d)(l)], if it finds that the juvenile was adjudged delinquent on at least two separate occasions, for offenses which, if committed by an adult, would constitute a crime of the first or second degree, and was previously committed to an adult or juvenile facility. The extended term shall not exceed five additional years for an act which would constitute murder and shall not exceed two additional years for all other crimes of the first degree or second degree, if committed by an adult, and one additional year for a crime of the third degree, if committed by an adult.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A\u201444(d)(3).]</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Our duty to discern and implement the legislative intent underlying this authorization for an extended-term sentence compels us to seek that intent from the words used in the statute. <em>See Norfolk, supra, </em>215 <em>N.J. </em>at 166, 71 A.3d 830. From a plain language reading, the statute addresses the disposition stage of the offense for which the juvenile is being sentenced. The statute requires the filing of an application for an extended-term sentence by the prosecutor after the juvenile has been adjudged to have committed what would have been the equivalent of a first-, second-, or third-degree crime if committed by an adult. Thus, the statute envisions that the extended-term application is to be made after the adjudication is complete and while the disposition of the present offense is taking place. The Legislature clearly has demarked the \u201cpresent\u201d offense in its discussion in this part of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">The plain language of the statute then requires certain findings by the disposition court. An extended term may be imposed \u201cif [the court] finds that the juvenile was adjudged delinquent on at least two separate occasions, for offenses which, if committed by an adult, would constitute a crime of the first or second degree, and was previously committed to an adult or juvenile facility.\u201d In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>this part of the statute, the Legislature has moved to the past tense, and not just for the past adjudication but also for the additional requirement that at least one such adjudication resulted in commitment to a juvenile or adult facility. The words refer to someone who \u201cwas adjudicated\u201d and \u201cwas previously committed\u201d on at least one such occasion to a facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The rules of statutory construction require deference to the words chosen by the Legislature. Statutory language is entitled to its ordinary meaning and to be given a common-sense construction. <em>See Huber, supra, </em>213 <em>N.J. </em>at 365, 63 A.3d 197; <em>Smith v. Fireworks by Girone, Inc., </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>199, 216, 850 A.2d 456 (2004). In following that precept, we give great weight to the difference in verb tenses used by the Legislature in this statute. The Legislature first used the \u201chas been convicted\u201d language when referring to the present offense for which the court is considering the prosecutor\u2019s application for an extended term. The Legislature then switched to past tense when referring to the two findings from the person\u2019s past that the court must make in order to declare the person eligible for an extended term. As to the latter, the Legislature used past tense two times, requiring that the person (1) \u201cwas adjudicated\u201d delinquent on at least two separate occasions for offenses of a certain grade if committed by an adult, and (2) \u201cwas previously committed\u201d to an adult or juvenile facility. Both conditions clearly are from the person\u2019s past and do not naturally suggest the inclusion of the present adjudication before the disposition court, especially when the Legislature had just used a different tense to describe the instant offense. We glean from this that the Legislature intentionally went out of its way to differentiate between the instant offense and the qualifying predicate offenses. That interpretation is a common-sense application of the section\u2019s language and it advances a discernible public policy. The Legislature wanted to address individuals who have not learned from their past serious adjudications that have included time spent incarcerated pursuant to a previously imposed order of commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>We are unpersuaded that the failure to include the word \u201cpreviously\u201d twice when identifying the two required findings compels a plain language reading that the present adjudication may count as one of two separate offenses. Indeed, in considering this argument made on the basis of an omitted word, we note that the Legislature did not use that same language construction in the companion section of 4A-44(d)(4) when it expressly dealt with the imposition of an extended-term sentence in sentencing for multiple unrelated crimes before the court in a single sentencing proceeding. It is a guiding principle in achieving the goal of fulfilling the legislative intent underlying a statute that a provision be considered in light of its surrounding statutory provisions. <em>Huber, supra, </em>213 <em>N.J. </em>at 365, 63 A.3d 197 (stating we must examine statutory \u201clanguage sensibly, in the context of the overall scheme in which the Legislature intended the provision to operate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">In section 4A-44(d)(4), when addressing a juvenile who has engaged in a spree of qualifying offenses, the Legislature has authorized the imposition of an extended-term sentence on the basis of the present offenses by using language that clearly and unambiguously captures the instant offenses with which the disposition court is dealing. Moreover, section 4A-44(d)(4) refers to those offenses as ones for which the juvenile \u201chas been adjudicated,\u201d just as section 4A-44(d)(3) does when describing the instant offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The language of section 4A-44(d)(3), in referring in past tense to the previous separate adjudications that must provide the predicate for an extended term to be imposed on the instant offense, points to a natural reading that does not favor the State\u2019s position or the extended-term sentence imposed on Kyle. Our goal is to effectuate legislative intent based on our best assessment of the words used by the Legislature. We have done that. To the extent one could argue that there is some ambiguity in the text of the section, we may resort to legislative history. Here, legislative history is silent on the specific issue before us. Accepted forms of legislative history such as sponsor or committee statements ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>dressing the question presented about section 4A-44(d)(3) do not exist. To the extent that the State points to subsequent study-commissions that have examined progress made in combatting juvenile crime and dispensing juvenile justice, those reports are not indicative of legislative intent. They do not represent contemporaneous expressions of intent by the Legislature that enacted or amended the legislation in question. We may not consider them of value in ascertaining legislative intent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See State v. Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>505, 550-51, 734 A.2d 1160 (1999) (Handler, J., dissenting) (asserting statements made after enactment of constitutional amendment not part of legislative history); <em>see also Consumer Prod. Safety Comm\u2019n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., </em>447 <em>U.S. </em>102, 117, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>2051, 2061, 64 L.Ed.2d 766, 778 (1980) (noting \u201cthe views of a subsequent Congress form a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Further, to the extent that section 4A-44(d)(3) is not a model of perfect clarity, because it is a juvenile justice statute involving among the most severe sanctions that can be imposed on a juvenile, principles of lenity deserve consideration. A court may apply the doctrine of lenity when construing an ambiguous criminal statute. <em>State v. Rangel, </em>213 <em>N.J. </em>500, 515, 64 A.3d 558 (2013). \u201cThat doctrine \u2018holds that when interpreting a criminal statute, ambiguities that cannot be resolved by either the statute\u2019s text or extrinsic aids must be resolved in favor of the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Gelman, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>475, 482, 950 A.2d 879 (2008)). The doctrine is founded on two guiding principles. The first is the important concept that a criminal defendant is entitled to \u201cfair warning ... of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed.\u201d <em>Gelman, supra, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>at 482, 950 A.2d 879 (omission in original) (quoting <em>United States v. Bass, </em>404 <em>U.S. </em>336, 348, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>515, 522, 30 L.Ed.2d 488, 496 (1971)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The second guiding principle is the notion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>the Legislature, and not the courts, should define the contours of criminal activity. That principle is founded upon society\u2019s \u201cinstinctive distaste against men [and women] languishing in prison unless the lawmaker has clearly said they should.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 482-83, 950 A.2d 879 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Bass, supra, </em>404 <em>U.S. </em>at 348, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 523, 30 L.Ed.2d at 497) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Here, in interpreting an aspect of the Code affecting the dispensing of justice to juveniles, where rehabilitation concerns are at their highest in the criminal justice sphere, we decline to give this statute its harshest possible reading. Notwithstanding the important role that punishment now plays in the juvenile justice system, <em>see Presha, supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>at 314, 748 A.2d 1108, principles of statutory construction still govern, including the principle of lenity when construing a criminal statute. To the extent that reasonable people can differ on whether the Legislature indeed intended to allow for an extended-term sentence for individuals like Kyle, who have only one previous separate predicate offense, not including the offense for which they are being sentenced, we conclude that the more lenient construction of the statute should pertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">We therefore hold that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-44(d)(3) requires two separate previous predicate adjudications, including one that resulted in incarceration in a juvenile or adult facility, exclusive of the adjudication for which the disposition court is sentencing the juvenile. The imposition of an extended term for Kyle transgresses that interpretation of the statute. We therefore reverse the extended-term sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">The judgment of the Appellate Division is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-10\"> We use the fictitious name Kyle, as did the Appellate Division, to refer to K.O., the young man who brought this appeal before our Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b126-7\"> JISP is a statewide dispositional alternative to juvenile detention that exposes offenders to intensive rehabilitation techniques regarded as \"more stringent than juvenile probation, but less rigid than detention or commitment.\u201d <em>The Juvenile Intensive Supervision Program, (JISP), </em>New Jersey Courts, http://www.judiciary. state.nj.us/probsup/jisp_intro.htm (last visited Jan. 31, 2014). \"JISP works cooperatively with the Family Court and community agencies to provide support services to assist participants and their families.

The statute provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\">Upon application by the prosecutor, the court may sentence a juvenile who has been convicted of a crime of the first, second, or third degree if committed by an adult, to an extended term of incarceration beyond the maximum set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection, if it finds that the juvenile was adjudged delinquent on at least two separate occasions, for offenses which, if committed by an adult, would constitute a crime of the first or second degree, and was <em>weviously </em>committed to an adult or juvenile facility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\"><em>[N.J.SA </em>2A:4A-44(d)(3) (emphases added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">The majority presents a strong case as to why two prior predicates are required. It focuses on the different verb tenses in the statute, which are underscored above. <em>Ante </em>at 94-95, 85 A.3d at 944-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Another persuasive reading of the statute focuses on the word \u201cpreviously.\u201d The Legislature inserted the term only once: to establish that a juvenile must have been \u201cpreviously\u201d incarcerated. The word does not appear in the clause that states \u201cthe juvenile was adjudged delinquent on at least two separate occasions.\u201d Thus, the Legislature required two juvenile adjudications but did not say both must have occurred \u201cpreviously.\u201d As the Appellate Division noted, \u201cthe Legislature could easily have\u201d said so had it meant to. <em>In re K.O., </em>424 <em>N.J.Super. </em>555, 561, 39 A.3d 202 (App.Div.2012). Instead, it omitted the very limiting term it used later in the same section. For this and other reasons, the appellate panel concluded that the pending offense may count as a predicate for an extended term. <em>Id. </em>at 564, 39 A.3d 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">Because both interpretations of this criminal statute are reasonable, and because the legislative history does not resolve this dispute, the doctrine of lenity applies. <em>See State v. Rangel, </em>213 <em>N.J. </em>500, 515, 64 A.3d 558 (2013); <em>State v. Shelley, </em>205 <em>N.J. </em>320, 324, 15 A.3d 818 (2011). As a result, the ambiguity in the statute should be resolved in defendant\u2019s favor. <em>Rangel, supra, </em>213 <em>N.J. </em>at 515, 64 A.3d 558 (citing <em>State v. Gelman, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>475, 482, 950 A.2d 879 (2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>I agree with the majority\u2019s discussion of the doctrine of lenity. <em>See ante </em>at 96-97, 85 A 3d at 946. My difference wdth the majority is slight. It concludes that the statutory language is plain and considers the rule of lenity to the extent one might find the law ambiguous. <em>Ibid. </em>Because I do not believe the language of the statute leads to one clear interpretation, I turn directly to the rule of lenity in the absence of definitive legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">For the above reasons, I concur in the result the majority reaches and would reverse the judgment of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\"><em>For </em>reversal\u2014Chief Justice RABNER and Justices LaVECCHIA, ALBIN and PATTERSON and Judges RODR\u00cdGUEZ (temporarily assigned) and CUFF (temporarily assigned)\u20146.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Opposed\u2014None.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
