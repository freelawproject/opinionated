Under the New Jersey Sexually Violent Predator Act (SVPA or Act), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.24 to -27.38, a person previously convicted of a sexual offense can be civilly committed only if the State can establish by clear and convincing evidence that he suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes him highly likely to commit a sexually violent offense. The experienced judges assigned to hear these cases have the difficult task of assessing expert testimony that often is in conflict, making factfindings about events described from varying viewpoints, and ultimately predicting the probability of a person\u2019s future conduct. In the balance, an individual\u2019s right to liberty is weighed against society\u2019s interest in public safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">In this case, R.F., when he was seventeen years old, engaged in sexual conduct with two children, ages twelve and thirteen. He pled guilty in adult court to endangering the welfare of both children and was sentenced to a five-year term at the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center at Avenel (ADTC or Avenel). Before R.F. completed his sentence, the State petitioned to have R.F. civilly committed under the SVPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">At an SVPA commitment hearing, the Honorable Serena J. Perretti, J.S.C., sifted through a ream of documentary evidence and heard testimony from three expert witnesses, two for the State and one for R.F. Although Judge Perretti found that R.F. committed predicate sexual offenses and suffered from a personality disorder, she concluded that the State had not proven by clear and convincing evidence that R.F. was highly likely to engage in sexually violent behavior if not civilly committed. In coming to the decision that the State had not met the evidentiary standard for SVPA commitment, Judge Perretti made specific findings of fact and ultimately placed decisive weight on R.F.\u2019s expert. She also made clear that R.F. is subject to parole supervision for life, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:43-6.4; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.12. R.F., moreover, must also comply with a discharge plan prepared by the Special Treatment Unit (STU) where he has been civilly committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>The Appellate Division reversed, determining that the opinions of the State\u2019s experts were \u201cwell-supported by the record and amply substantiate the State\u2019s petition for R.F.\u2019s commitment under the SVPA.\u201d Selecting the facts it deemed more credible, accepting the opinions it viewed more persuasive, and drawing its own inferences from the record, the panel came to a different conclusion than Judge Perretti.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The issue, however, is not whether members of the panel would have decided the case differently had they heard the case. Nor is the issue whether evidence in the record supports the opinions of the State\u2019s experts. Rather, the issue is whether sufficient credible evidence in the record supports Judge Perretti\u2019s findings. Those findings are entitled to deference, for Judge Perretti was not only intimately familiar with the case file but also had the unique opportunity to hear the witnesses, to judge their credibility, and to weigh their testimony\u2014things that cannot be gleaned from the cold record.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Judge Perretti\u2019s determination that the State did not establish by clear and convincing evidence that R.F. was highly likely to sexually reoffend unless institutionalized is supported by sufficient credible evidence in the record. Her findings are not clearly mistaken and are entitled to deference. We therefore reverse the Appellate Division and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">In light of the passage of more than five years between Judge Perretti\u2019s decision and our resolution today, we will stay the release of R.F. for thirty days to allow the State to file a new petition if there are any changed circumstances or conditions that would warrant civil commitment. On his release, R.F. will be subject to a discharge plan and parole supervision for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">R.F. was charged in two separate juvenile complaints with committing, in May and July 2004, first-degree aggravated sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>assaults against twelve-year-old A.M. and thirteen-year-old J.W. and other related offenses. R.F. was seventeen years old when the events that gave rise to the charges occurred. As part of a plea agreement, the case was waived to adult court where R.F. pled guilty to the lesser charges of third-degree endangering the welfare of A.M. and J.W., <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The State recommended that R.F. be sentenced to a five-year term at the ADTC based on an evaluation that he was a repetitive and compulsive offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">In giving a factual basis to the charges, R.F. admitted that, on separate occasions, he had \u201csex\u201d with A.M. and J.W. With each girl, he touched various parts of her body and placed his \u201cpenis like in her butt,\u201d but \u201cit fell out.\u201d R.F., however, insisted that the sexual acts were consensual\u2014a position he maintained in later interviews. During the plea colloquy, R.F. stated: \u201cI just did it because they wanted to have sex ...[.] I didn\u2019t want to do it, but I cannot say no to a girl for some stupid reason.\u201d Nevertheless, he admitted that having sex with a minor was \u201cwrong\u201d and that he felt \u201cbad.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">That R.F. was cognitively impaired was evident at the time of the plea. Two of three psychiatrists who examined him declared that he was not competent to participate in the proceedings. Nevertheless, R.F. declared that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">After that plea proceeding, at the correctional facility where he was incarcerated, R.F. threw a box at a corrections officer and then resisted several officers and spit on them. That incident led to R.F. pleading guilty to fourth-degree aggravated assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-1(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>In July 2005, R.F. was sentenced on the endangering and assault charges. An evaluation submitted by the ADTC to the court indicated that, although R.F. was deemed a repetitive and compulsive offender, he was considered amenable to treatment at the program at Avenel. R.F. did not object to an Avenel sentence. However, his attorney urged the court to find as a mitigating factor that R.F. \u201cdid not contemplate that his conduct would cause or threaten serious harm,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1(b)(2). The defense attorney stressed that R.F. was \u201cbarely competent to understand the proceedings\u201d and that his conduct was the result of his psychiatric disorder, his \u201clack of education,\u201d and \u201chis inability to comprehend the consequences of [his] actions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Although the prosecutor commented on the seriousness of all three offenses, he acknowledged that R.F. had \u201ca lot of mental limitations\u201d and that R.F. was \u201cin severe need of\u2019 both sex offender and mental health treatment. The defense and prosecution agreed that the incident in the county jail was the product of \u201cfrustration\u201d on R.F.\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">In imposing sentence, the court found, as aggravating factors, that R.F. had \u201cacted out violently, or engaged in threats of violence,\u201d and that the two young victims were \u201cvulnerable\u201d and \u201cincapable of resisting his advances.\u201d As mitigating factors the court found that R.F. was diagnosed with \u201cmild mental retardation,\u201d \u201cdeficits in his visual cognitive processes,\u201d and \u201cattention deficit, hyperactivity disorder\u201d (ADHD), and that R.F. was classified as \u201cneuro-psychiatrically compromised.\u201d The court also noted R.F.\u2019s youth and expression of remorse: \u201c[H]e knew what he was doing was wrong, but he ... couldn\u2019t resist the impulse to engage in the unlawful activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The court sentenced R.F. to concurrent five-year terms on the endangering charges, to be served at the ADTC, and to a concurrent nine-month term on the assault charge, and imposed all requisite fines and penalties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court also imposed parole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>supervision for life, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:43-6.4, and noted that R.F. was subject to sex offender registration under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">In May 2008, before R.F. completed his sentence, the State petitioned the Superior Court to have R.F. civilly committed under the SVPA. Attached to the State\u2019s petition were the clinical certificates of two psychiatrists, each offering an opinion that R.F. \u201chas serious difficulty controlling his sexually inappropriate impulses, and ... is highly likely to sexually reoffend.\u201d Based on the petition and clinical certificates, a Superior Court judge found probable cause to believe that R.F. met the standards for commitment under the SVPA. R.F. was temporarily committed to the STU, a secure facility designated for sex offenders, pending an SVPA hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Judge Perretti presided at the commitment hearing held in December 2008. During the hearing, a number of documents were presented to Judge Perretti, including statements that had been given by A.M. and J.W. to the police. Those statements described incidents of forcible sex, including the accusation by A.M. that R.F. grabbed her by the throat and the accusation by J.W. that R.F. threatened her with a knife.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> J.W.\u2019s statement, however, indicated that R.F. and A.M. were in a consensual relationship with each other. The documentary record revealed that A.M. and J.W. were not strangers to R.F. but seemingly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>within his circle of friends\u2014despite their significant age differences.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">R.F. self-reported his sexual encounters with the two young girls. In late July 2004, R.F. told A.M.\u2019s mother that he attempted to have sexual intercourse with her daughter, and in late August, he told J.W.\u2019s brother that he had intercourse with J.W. Eventually, the mothers of the two girls reported the matters to the police. The varying accounts given by R.F., A.M., and J.W. about whether force was used are not reconcilable.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">At the hearing, the State called two expert witnesses, Dr. Robert Harris, a psychiatrist, and Dr. Sean McCall, a psychologist. R.F. called one expert witness, Dr. Vivian Shnaidman, a psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">Dr. Harris testified that he interviewed R.F. three times, for approximately five to six hours in all, and found him cooperative but struggling, at times, to \u201cmaintain[ ] a line of thought.\u201d Illustrative of this point is that, according to Dr. Harris, R.F. stated \u201cthat he was not attracted to younger kids,\u201d \u201cthat he wasn\u2019t attracted to girls over the age of 13,\u201d \u201cthat some people are attracted to 17-year old girls and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s right and he would ... hurt those people,\u201d and then, finally, that \u201chis arousal to the 10 and 13 year old girls\u201d is \u201cnot right.\u201d Concerning R.F.\u2019s mental capacity to participate in his earlier criminal proceedings, Dr. Harris was knowledgeable about the report of one psychiatrist who opined that R.F. was competent to participate but not about the reports of two other psychiatrists who opined that he was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">Dr. Harris expressed his understanding that R.F. had \u201cbefriended\u201d twelve-year-old A.M. and thirteen-year-old J.W. At the time, R.F. considered the girls to be his \u201cpeers.\u201d R.F. reported to him that he became \u201csexually interested\u201d in A.M. when she was nine or ten years old, which corresponded to when R.F. was fourteen or fifteen years old. From his review of the police reports and statements of A.M. and J.W. and his interviews with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>R.F., Dr. Harris hypothesized that R.F. was \u201ctargeting these two girls, creating an environment for them to play in ... and really going out of his way to groom [them].\u201d Dr. Harris noted that the assault of A.M. occurred when R.F. entered the bathroom where she was concealing herself during a game of hide-and-seek with friends, including R.F. In an apparent reference to the assault on J.W., Dr. Harris stated that R.F. had \u201ccreated this kind of clubhouse in an area where younger people would hang out.\u201d (J.W.\u2019s statement, however, indicated that she and her friends built the clubhouse.) As part of his grooming theory, Dr. Harris also emphasized that R.F. bought A.M. food and a bicycle\u2014 although the sources he relied on indicate that these gifts followed the incident in the bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Dr. Harris acknowledged that R.F. maintained that the sexual encounters with A.M. and J.W. were consensual. In his psychiatric analysis, Dr. Harris observed, on the one hand, that R.F.\u2014who is in the \u201clow average to borderline intellectual\u201d range\u2014\u201chas this very reactive quality to him where ... he doesn\u2019t think about what he\u2019s doing. He acts in a way without any kind of planning.\u201d On the other hand, Dr. Harris found that R.F.\u2019s \u201csexual offenses were very well planned. He spent a great deal of time grooming and creating an environment to which he had access to these two girls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Dr. Harris diagnosed R.F. with pedophilia,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> ADHD,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and antiso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>cial personality disorder.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Dr. Harris concluded that R.F.\u2019s pedophilia and antisocial personality placed him at a high risk to reoffend if he were not committed to the STU for sex offender treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Because R.F. was \u201cessentially 18 years old\u201d at the time of the offenses, Dr. Harris did not believe that R.F.\u2019s youth undermined the pedophilia diagnosis. He explained that R.F. had been attracted to A.M. for several years. Dr. Harris, however, did not elaborate on the point that R.F.\u2019s attraction dated to a time when he was fourteen or fifteen years old. Instead, he cited to a statement by R.F. that he still had arousal to children. Dr. Harris stated that he did not know whether J.W. was prepubescent and that R.F. was unable \u201cto figure out if she was [sexually] developed].\u201d (A pedophilia diagnosis requires that the victim be prepubescent, according to the <em>DSM-IV-TR, supra, </em>at 571.)</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Dr. Harris diagnosed R.F. with antisocial personality disorder because R.F. had a history of failing to control his behavior and because, he believed, the treatment at the ADTC was not successful. However, Dr. Harris agreed that R.F. had not been cited for any infractions since his commitment to the STU.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Dr. Harris measured R.F.\u2019s risk of sexually reoffending with a diagnostic tool called the Static-99. R.F.\u2019s scores of a four and a five placed him in the moderate- to high-risk category for sexually reoffending. Although Dr. Harris agreed that the Static-99 \u201cshould be used with caution\u201d in grading juvenile offenders, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>judged R.F. as an adult because he was just shy of eighteen years at the time of the offenses.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Dr. McCall, a psychologist at the STU, testified that, based on R.F.\u2019s antisocial personality disorder, R.F. posed a high risk of sexually reoffending if not committed. Unlike Dr. Harris, Dr. McCall did not diagnose pedophilia because A.M. admitted to J.W. that she had a consensual relationship with R.F. He cited to the <em>DSM-IV-TR, supra, </em>at 572, which explicitly says not to diagnose pedophilia in \u201can individual in late adolescence involved in an ongoing sexual relationship with a 12- or 13-year-old.\u201d Dr. McCall also could not substantiate paraphilia<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> as a diagnosis because it was uncertain how \u201carousing\u201d the events were to R.F. and because the activities did not occur over a period of six months.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Dr. McCall settled on a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder based on R.F.\u2019s \u201cfights in prison,\u201d his \u201cstill breaking the rules,\u201d his \u201cbeing self-centered [and] kind of impulsive,\u201d and his \u201cwillingness and interest in going after young girls.\u201d In the breaking-the-rules category, Dr. McCall also pointed out that R.F. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>apparently had a consensual sexual encounter with another inmate at the ADTC. Dr. McCall emphasized that R.F. was on probation for a simple assault as a juvenile when he committed the endangering offenses. He believed that R.F.\u2019s commission of those offenses while under probation supervision for simple assault \u201cwas a robust predictor of [sexual offense] recidivism.\u201d Dr. McCall noted that R.F. tested in the \u201clow average range of intellectual functioning\u201d and that, given his Static-99 score of four, he fell within the group with a thirty-six percent likelihood of sexually reoffending within fifteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Dr. McCall conceded that R.F. held firm that his sexual encounters with A.M. and J.W. were consensual; that he never admitted at any time to using force or a weapon; that neither A.M. nor J.W. alleged that R.F. anally penetrated them; that J.W. stated that she asked R.F. to build a fort in the woods (J.W.\u2019s statement, however, indicates that she and her friends built the fort); that J.W., after having sex with R.F., believed she was having her period because of bleeding (thus suggesting that she was not prepubescent); that A.M. and J.W. admitted that they \u201chung out\u201d with R.F.; and that R.F. saw himself as a \u201cpeer.\u201d Dr. McCall also acknowledged that in R.F.\u2019s statement to the police he admitted that it was wrong for him to have sex with A.M. and J.W. because of their age differences.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Dr. Shnaidman, a psychiatrist who had been a consultant at the ADTC for more than five years, determined that R.F. did not fit the diagnostic profile for pedophilia or paraphilia. She ruled out those diagnoses because R.F. did not have \u201ca specific arousal to prepubescent children\u201d or nonconsensual sex. Dr. Shnaidman, however, diagnosed R.F. with conduct disorder.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> She also con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>ceded that he met the definition for antisocial personality disorder. She did not select the latter diagnosis because, although he committed the county-jail assault and other institutional infractions after he turned eighteen, R.F. did not mentally become eighteen on the day of his eighteenth birthday. Moreover, she did not weigh R.F.\u2019s alleged consensual sexual encounter with another resident as an increased risk factor because the evidence did not suggest any \u201cpredatory or abusive\u201d relationship. As she explained, \u201cour standard for sex offenders somehow becomes much higher than the standards that we even hold ourselves to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Dr. Shnaidman also rejected the Static-99 as an effective diagnostic tool in assessing R.F.\u2019s risk of sexually reoffending due to his cognitive limitations and the fact that the offenses were committed when he was a juvenile. The Static-99, in her estimation, is a test primarily for adults, and even then, is only \u201cone piece of information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">In Dr. Shnaidman\u2019s opinion, R.F. posed a \u201cfairly low\u201d risk of sexually reoffending. She could not say the risk was \u201czero\u201d but it was \u201cnot likely.\u201d She came to that conclusion because, as a result of his criminal conviction and the treatment at the ADTC, R.F. knows that it is wrong to have sex with underage girls and to force someone to have sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">In explaining the conduct that led to R.F.\u2019s convictions, Dr. Shnaidman stressed R.F.\u2019s cognitive limitations. She diagnosed him with \u201cborderline intellectual functioning,\u201d noting that at the age of twenty-two he had trouble reading <em>The Cat in the Hat. </em>She recounted that when she interviewed R.F., he did not \u201cactually know\u201d the charges to which he had pled guilty. She explained that R.F. saw himself as part of the victims\u2019 peer group and considered his interactions to be consensual. According to Dr. Shnaidman, the evidence, including R.F.\u2019s mental limitations, did not support the claim that R.F. was \u201cgrooming\u201d A.M. and J.W.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">In light of the differing accounts given by A.M., J.W., and R.F., Dr. Shnaidman acknowledged the difficulty in discerning the true circumstances of the encounters, but she emphasized that R.F. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>always denied using force and that A.M. told at least one friend (J.W.) that the sexual activity with R.F. was consensual.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">In making her risk assessment, Dr. Shnaidman considered that R.F. would be subject to parole supervision for life. In her opinion, R.F. poses a low risk to reoffend and \u201cseems to be motivated not to re-offend,\u201d but nevertheless she stressed that providing structure and support for R.F. in the community would further reduce the risk of recidivism. Dr. Shnaidman expressed that anyone \u201cinvolved in sex offender treatment should be transitioned into the community with some kind of supervision and some kind of services,\u201d and in R.F.\u2019s case vocational training and counseling would serve as prevention therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Before rendering her decision, Judge Perretti not only heard the testimony of the three expert witnesses, but also reviewed the relevant documentary evidence, such as the victims\u2019 and R.F.\u2019s statements, R.F.\u2019s plea and sentencing transcripts, and the expert reports. She viewed the evidence through the prism of the governing legal principles, keeping in mind that the State had the burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence the elements required for SVPA commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">Judge Perretti first concluded that R.F. pled guilty to predicate offenses that made him eligible for commitment under the SVPA. She noted that the record revealed that R.F. had penetrated thirteen-year-old J.W. and had sexual contact with twelve-year-old A.M. Based on these circumstances, Judge Perretti concluded that R.F.\u2019s convictions for third-degree endangering the welfare of those children were sexually violent offenses under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">Second, Judge Perretti concluded that, based on his conduct in the community and in custody as well as the experts\u2019 testimony, R.F. had juvenile conduct disorder. She determined that Dr. Harris\u2019s diagnosis of pedophilia did \u201cnot squarely fit the criteria of the DSM IV.\u201d In that regard, Judge Perretti observed that \u201cthere may have been an ongoing relationship between [R.F.] and A.M.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>and that it is not known whether she was prepubescent. She also noted that both Dr. McCall and Dr. Shnaidman rejected the diagnosis of pedophilia. Judge Perretti, moreover, did not find paraphilia as an appropriate diagnosis based on Dr. Shnaidman\u2019s testimony. In support of the juvenile conduct disorder diagnosis, Judge Perretti mentioned that R.F. had been \u201cassigned to the mental health program at [the] ADTC and reportedly had bouts of anger which resulted in his getting into trouble.\u201d Referencing his therapist\u2019s report, she stated that R.F. had \u201cdemonstrated distorted thinking and had only a limited understanding of his crime\u201d; that he \u201chad deficits in intellectual functioning, social skills, communication skills and developing relationships\u201d; that he \u201chad poor impulse control which resulted in [his] acting out behaviors within the [ADTC]\u201d; and that he \u201chad made only limited progress in treatment.\u201d She also observed that R.F. received a number of disciplinary citations at the ADTC, including an incident in which R.F. was found in a portable bathroom with another inmate \u201cunder suspicious circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Despite the predicate-offense and personality-disorder findings, Judge Perretti held that the State did not establish by clear and convincing evidence that R.F. was \u201chighly likely to commit a sexually violent offense.\u201d In reaching this conclusion, Judge Perretti placed great weight on Dr. Shnaidman\u2019s opinion that R.F.\u2019s risk to reoffend was \u201c \u2018fairly low1 \u201d and that R.F. had learned that it is wrong to have sex with someone under age. She also gave weight to the fact that R.F. disclosed his wrongdoing to the victims\u2019 families: \u201cIt would seem that [R.F.] was conscious at the time that he made his disclosures of the wrongness of his acts\u201d and that the disclosures \u201cindicate[ ] a resolution to desist.\u201d Further, Judge Perretti highlighted that R.F. would be subject to parole supervision for life, \u201cwhich affords some protection to the public and may act as a deterrent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Judge Perretti also observed that some of the testimony of the State\u2019s experts \u201cappears [to be] based upon an exaggeration or misunderstanding of the circumstances which led to their eonelu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>sions.\u201d For example, Dr. Harris diagnosed R.F. with pedophilia partly based on the assumption that R.F. had engaged in grooming behavior. Yet, as Judge Perretti pointed out, the documentary evidence revealed that R.F. had not\u2014as believed by Dr. Harris\u2014built the fort that Dr. Harris saw as a way of luring children. Judge Perretti, moreover, noted that the \u201cgifts\u201d from R.F. to A.M. \u201cfollowed the sex incident\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and supposedly were \u201coffered and received to keep her quiet.\u201d To her mind, the State did not demonstrate that A.M. or J.W. had \u201cany ongoing fear of [R.F.] who continued to be part of the circle of friends.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Judge Perretti further explained that Dr. Harris\u2019s opinions \u201cdepend[ed] greatly upon [R.F.\u2019s] self-disclosures\u201d during his interviews with R.F. However, some of R.F.\u2019s statements referenced by Dr. Harris, in the judge\u2019s view, were \u201cincomprehensible,\u201d \u201cbabbling,\u201d and showed \u201ca seeming confusion as to time and persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">In addition, Judge Perretti maintained that Dr. McCall\u2019s initial paraphilia diagnosis was based on an unfounded assumption. Dr. McCall assumed that J.W. sustained injuries during her sexual encounter with R.F. based on the presence of bloodstains. J.W., however, stated to the police that she believed the blood was a result of \u201cher monthly period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Judge Perretti also noted that the prosecutor\u2019s office did not pursue aggravated sexual assault charges but rather allowed R.F. to plead guilty to third-degree endangering charges with a five-year maximum exposure. Yet, the State\u2019s petition for civil commitment, if granted, \u201cin this case is tantamount to life in custody.\u201d That raised in her mind issues of proportionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Judge Perretti found both Dr. Harris and Dr. Shnaidman \u201cequally well-qualified\u201d and that the difference of opinions between these \u201chighly respected\u201d experts was \u201citself a matter generating doubt.\u201d To Judge Perretti, there was a distinction between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>a reasonable prediction that R.F. would \u201cget in trouble if released now into the community\u201d\u2014a proposition she accepted\u2014and a finding by clear and convincing evidence that R.F. was \u201chighly likely to commit a sexually violent offense in the foreseeable future\u201d\u2014a proposition she did not accept.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Last, Judge Perretti had little doubt that R.F. would \u201crequire many social services if he is to peacefully negotiate life in the community.\u201d She maintained, however, that the \u201cState must step up to the plate now and cannot simply hide [R.F.] in the Special Treatment Unit.\u201d Judge Perretti dismissed the State\u2019s SVPA petition but stayed her order pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">In an unpublished per curiam opinion, the Appellate Division reversed the dismissal of the State\u2019s petition, thereby directing that R.F. be civilly committed. The panel concluded \u201cthat the record does not support the trial court\u2019s determination that R.F. does not qualify for [SVPA] commitment.\u201d Although the panel acknowledged that \u201c[t]he scope of appellate review of the trial court\u2019s findings is extremely narrow,\u201d citing <em>In re Civil Commitment of V.A., </em>357 <em>N.J.Super. </em>55, 63, 813 A.2d 1252 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, 177 N.J. </em>490, 828 A.2d 917 (2003), the panel made its own findings of fact and rejected those made by Judge Perretti.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">The panel deemed it error for the trial court to consider that R.F.\u2014with his limited cognitive ability\u2014viewed himself as the girls\u2019 peer. It found that'R.F.\u2019s \u201cbehavior was calculating and predatory\u201d and that \u201c[h]e sought out the girls with the intention of engaging in sexual activity, with or without their assent.\u201d Thus, accepting in full the victims\u2019 accounts, it determined that R.F. \u201cviolently sexually assaulted\u201d A.M. in a locked bathroom and lured J.W. to \u201ca secluded area [and] then forcibly sexually assaulted her at knife point.\u201d The panel maintained that R.F.\u2019s \u201cdenial or minimization of the harm he caused his victims ... revealfed] his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>distorted and pathological perception that he was acting in an age-appropriate manner when he assaulted the girls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The panel faulted the trial court for \u201cunduly discounting] the testimony of the State\u2019s expert witnesses,\u201d stressing that their opinions were \u201cwell-supported by the record.\u201d It was dismissive of Dr. Shnaidman\u2019s opinion for failing to reckon \u201cthe danger posed to the community at large by the precipitous release\u201d of R.F. Last, the panel determined that, based on his history of noncompliance with treatment, R.F. was \u201chighly likely to re-offend if released under the conditions suggested by Dr. Shnaidman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">We granted R.F.\u2019s petition for certification. <em>In re Civil Commitment of RF., </em>212 <em>N.J. </em>288, 53 A.3d 663 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">R.F. submits that the Appellate Division failed to adhere to the limited scope of its review when it disregarded the trial court\u2019s findings. According to R.F., the trial court heard extensive testimony from three different experts, considered voluminous documentary materials, and then reached a decision fully supported by the evidence. R.F. argues that the trial court did not have to credit the ultimate opinions of the State\u2019s experts or to reject the opinion offered by Dr. Shnaidman. Rather, the court had to exercise its own independent judgment in making findings of fact and determining whether R.F. was highly likely to sexually reoffend. The panel, R.F. maintains, did not give Judge Perretti\u2019s findings the utmost deference and merely substituted its own findings. Last, R.F. believes that the SVPA allows the court to place conditions on R.F.\u2019s release from the STU or to make recommendations in regard to parole supervision for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">The State urges this Court to affirm the Appellate Division, reasoning that the trial court\u2019s determination was a \u201cmanifestly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>mistaken exercise of discretion.\u201d The State argues that Judge Perretti \u201cabused her discretion when she rejected the diagnosis of pedophilia\u201d because \u201cthere was ample evidence in the record to support a diagnosis of pedophilia.\u201d It submits that Judge Perretti speculated in suggesting that R.F.\u2019s disclosures to Dr. Harris may have been unreliable and that J.W. may not have been prepubescent.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The State also declares that the evidence \u201coverwhelmingly established that R.F. is \u2018likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined\u2019 \u201d to the STU, quoting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.26. The State questioned the trial court\u2019s finding that R.F. could be released subject to parole supervision for life without endangering the public, given that he had \u201csexually assaulted the victims while on supervised probation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Last, the State professes that this Court has no jurisdiction to place conditions on R.F.\u2019s discharge in the event that it reinstates Judge Perretti\u2019s decision. Based on its reading of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.32(b), the State suggests that court-imposed conditions can only be implemented and enforced if R.F. is committed under the SVPA and later found by the commitment court no longer to be a sexually violent predator.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">The preeminent issue in this case concerns the scope of appellate review in commitment cases involving the Sexually Violent Predator Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.24 to -27.38. Trial judges who handle SVPA commitment hearings generally possess expertise and experience in highly complex matters where credibility decisions must be made, expert psychiatric testimony assessed, future conduct predicted, and individual liberty weighed against public safety. The level of deference that is accorded to trial court decisions in SVPA cases is at the heart of the conflict between R.F. and the State. Resolving that issue requires an understanding of the SVPA, to which we turn now.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The SVPA permits the State to involuntarily commit \u201ca person who has been convicted ... of a sexually violent offense\u201d who \u201csuffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility for control, care and treatment.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.26. At the commitment hearing, the State must establish three elements: (1) that the individual has been convicted of a sexually violent offense, <em>ibid.; </em>(2) that he suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder, <em>ibid.; </em>and (3) that as a result of his psychiatric abnormality or disorder, \u201cit is highly likely that the individual will not control his or her sexually violent behavior and will reoffend,\u201d <em>In re Commitment of W.Z., </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>109, 130, 801 A.2d 205 (2002). Although the first two elements derive directly from the statute, to comport with substantive due process concerns, this Court interpreted the third statutory element as requiring the State to show that a person is \u201chighly likely,\u201d not just \u201clikely,\u201d to sexually reoffend. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The State bears the burden of proving all three elements by clear and convincing evidence. <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.32(a). Clear and convincing evidence is evidence that produces \u201ca firm belief or conviction\u201d that the allegations are true; it is evidence that is \u201cso clear, direct and weighty and convincing\u201d that the factfinder can \u201ccome to a clear conviction\u201d of the truth without hesitancy. <em>In re Jobes, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>394, 407, 529 A.2d 434 (1987) (quoting <em>State v. Hodge, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>369, 376, 471 A.2d 389 (1984)). The terms of the statute must be strictly met. The State cannot confine a person because it is reasonably likely that he will not be able to abide by all of society\u2019s laws or norms. SVPA commitment is limited to those who are highly likely to <em>sexually </em>reoffend. <em>Cf. Kansas v. Crane, </em>534 <em>U.S. </em>407, 412, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>867, 870, 151 L.Ed.2d 856, 862 (2002) (noting \u201cthe constitutional importance of distinguishing a dangerous sexual offender subject to civil commitment \u2018from other dangerous persons who are perhaps more properly dealt with exclusively through criminal proceedings\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Kansas v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number><em>Hendricks, </em>521 <em>U.S. </em>346, 360, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>2072, 2081, 138 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>501, 514 (1997))).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">At issue in this case is not whether R.F. committed a predicate sexual offense under the SVPA or even whether he suffers from a personality disorder or mental abnormality\u2014although the nature of the disorder or abnormality is contested. The key dispute is whether based on the sexual offenses committed, the disorder or abnormality, and his juvenile history and institutional infractions, R.F. is highly likely to commit another sexual offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">We now turn to the standard governing appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">\u201cThe scope of appellate review of a commitment determination is extremely narrow.\u201d <em>In re D.C., </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>31, 58, 679 A.2d 634 (1996) (citing <em>State v. Fields, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>282, 311, 390 A.2d 574 (1978)). The judges who hear SVPA eases generally are \u201cspecialists\u201d and \u201ctheir expertise in the subject\u201d is entitled to \u201cspecial deference.\u201d <em>See In re Civil Commitment of T.J.N., </em>390 <em>N.J.Super. </em>218, 226, 915 A.2d 53 (App.Div.2007). The final decision whether a person previously convicted of a sexually violent offense is highly likely to sexually reoffend \u201clies with the courts, not the expertise of psychiatrists and psychologists. Courts must balance society\u2019s interest in protection from harmful conduct against the individual\u2019s interest in personal liberty and autonomy.\u201d <em>See D.C., supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 59, 679 A.2d 634 (stating principles that apply in ordinary civil commitment hearings). A trial judge is \u201cnot required to accept all or any part of [an] expert opinion[ ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61, 679 A.2d 634. The ultimate determination is \u201ca legal one, not a medical one, even though it is guided by medical expert testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 59, 679 A.2d 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">We give deference to the findings of our trial judges because they have the \u201copportunity to hear and see the witnesses and to have the \u2018feel\u2019 of the ease, which a reviewing court cannot enjoy.\u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 161, 199 A.2d 809 (1964). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>An appellate court should not overturn a trial court\u2019s findings because it \u201cmight have reached a different conclusion were it the trial tribunal\u201d or because \u201cthe trial court decided all evidence or inference conflicts in favor of one side\u201d in a close case. <em>Id. </em>at 162, 199 A.2d 809.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Accordingly, an appellate court should not modify a trial court\u2019s determination either to commit or release an individual unless \u201cthe record reveals a clear mistake.\u201d <em>D.C., supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 58, 679 A.2d 634 (citing <em>Fields, supra, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>at 311, 390 A.2d 574); <em>see Johnson, supra, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>at 162, 199 A.2d 809 (stating that trial court\u2019s findings should be disturbed only if so clearly mistaken \u201cthat the interests of justice demand intervention\u201d and only then should appellate court \u201cappraise the record as if it were deciding the matter at inception and make its own findings and conclusions\u201d). So long as the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by \u201csufficient credible evidence present in the record,\u201d those findings should not be disturbed. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>at 162, 199 A.2d 809; <em>see In re Civil Commitment of J.M.B., </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>563, 597, 964 A.2d 752 (stating that appellate courts must defer where there is \u201csubstantial, credible evidence to support the court\u2019s findings\u201d), <em>cert, denied, </em>558 <em>U.S. </em>999, 130 <em>S.Ct. </em>509, 175 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>361 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">In light of these governing standards, we now must determine whether the Appellate Division had a proper basis to overthrow the findings of the trial court. In the end, we conclude that the panel overstepped the narrow scope of appellate review applicable in this case. The major flaw in the panel\u2019s analysis is that instead of surveying the record to see whether there was sufficient credible evidence to support Judge Perretti\u2019s factfindings, the panel assembled bits and pieces of the record that supported the State\u2019s case. The issue was not, as the panel stated, whether the opinions of the State\u2019s experts were \u201cwell-supported by the record\u201d and thus \u201camply substantiate^] the State\u2019s petition.\u201d That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>the Appellate Division would have come to a different conclusion had it sat as the trier of fact is not a basis for overturning the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The State bore the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence each of the elements for commitment under the SVPA. Judge Perretti found that the State satisfied the first two elements. She found, however, that the State did not present clear and convincing evidence of the third and decisive element\u2014that R.F. was highly likely to sexually reoffend. In reaching that conclusion, Judge Perretti stated her reasons for rejecting the ultimate opinions of the State\u2019s two experts and accepting the opinion of Dr. Shnaidman. Sufficient credible evidence is present in the record to support Judge Perretti\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Judge Perretti found that R.F.\u2019s plea of guilty to endangering the welfare of twelve-year-old A.M. and thirteen-year-old J.W. in 2004, when R.F. was seventeen years old, constituted prior \u201csexually violent offenses\u201d under the catch-all provision of the SVPA, <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.26(b).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> No one disputes that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">Judge Perretti also found that R.F. suffered from a personality disorder\u2014the second element necessary for commitment under the SVPA. That finding is not contested. Nevertheless, the State argues that Judge Perretti abused her discretion in rejecting Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Harris\u2019s pedophilia diagnosis. Yet, the State\u2019s own expert, Dr. McCall, as well as Dr. Shnaidman, did not believe that pedophilia was substantiated\u2014and, according to Judge Perretti, a pedophilia diagnosis did \u201cnot squarely fit the criteria of the DSM IV.\u201d Moreover, we cannot say that Judge Perretti clearly erred by accepting the opinion of Dr. Shnaidman who found that a paraphilia diagnosis was inappropriate because R.F. did not have \u201ca specific arousal to prepubescent children.\u201d Judge Perretti was not bound to adopt the State\u2019s opinions; she was required to exercise her independent judgment in making findings that, as here, were supported by the record. <em>See D.C., supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 59,679 A.2d 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The critical finding of Judge Perretti was that the State failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that R.F., if released from confinement, was highly likely to commit another violent sexual offense. In coming to that conclusion, Judge Perretti took into account R.F.\u2019s youth, the cognitive limitations that led him to perceive himself as a peer of twelve- and thirteen-year old girls, and his self-reporting of his sexual encounters to the mother of A.M. and the brother of J.W. She also placed great weight on Dr. Shnaidman\u2019s opinion that R.F. had learned that having sexual relations with someone under age is wrong and that his risk of sexually reoffending was \u201cfairly low.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Judge Perretti understood that many facts were in dispute\u2014a point not fully grasped by the Appellate Division. The experts disagreed about whether the evidence established that the girls were prepubescent, an important factor in assessing the nature of R.F.\u2019s disorder; whether, given R.F.\u2019s cognitive limitations and age, the Static-99 was an appropriate diagnostic tool for measuring his risk of sexually reoffending; and whether R.F.\u2019s viewing the girls as his peers increased or decreased the risk that he would sexually reoffend. Additionally, there were conflicting accounts about whether violence was used during the sexual encoun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>ters and misunderstandings about whether R.F. built a fort and then used it to lure children. Before the SVPA commitment hearing, no trial ever resolved these disputed facts and issues. That difficult task was left to Judge Perretti. She sifted through the documentary evidence, heard the testimony of the experts, and came to her factual findings and legal conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Judge Perretti had a full understanding of the factual limitations in the record, and that led her to have doubt about whether the State had carried its burden. In its opinion, the Appellate Division exceeded its scope of review because it did not canvass the record for credible evidence to support Judge Perretti\u2019s factfindings. Instead, it drew its own inferences from the record and made its own factfindings\u2014different from those of Judge Perretti\u2014that R.F. acted in a \u201cpredatory\u201d manner, violently sexually assaulted the girls, and minimized the harm he caused the victims. However, a mere disagreement with the trial court\u2019s factfindings cannot be the basis for substituted factfindings by an appellate court. Judge Perretti, moreover, was authorized to discount an expert opinion that she believed was at odds with the record and not as well grounded as another expert opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">In this case, a judge who sat regularly on SVPA cases and who was a specialist in the area came to a reasoned conclusion based on sufficient credible evidence in the record. She judged a cognitively impaired young man who was convicted of having sexual relations with underage minors and who had a prior juvenile record and a history of institutional infractions. Judge Perretti did not look at the case through rose-colored glasses. She knew that the raw truth sometimes is not easily discernible. She did what we expect of judges\u2014she viewed difficult facts against the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Judge Perretti understood that a reasonable prediction could be made that, given his disorder and background, without help, R.F. would \u201cget in trouble if released now into the community.\u201d But the SVPA only permits for the civil commitment of those who are highly likely to commit a sexually violent offense if released. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number><em>W.Z., supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 129-30, 801 A.2d 205; <em>cf. Crane, supra, </em>534 <em>U.S. </em>at 412, 122 <em>S.Ct </em>at 870, 151 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 862. That she could not find by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Judge Perretti also considered that R.F. is subject to a multiplicity of conditions and restrictions through parole supervision for life, which will minimize any potential threat to public safety. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>20:43-6.4; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.12(b). The sweeping supervision to which R.F. will be subject after his release requires R.F. to: live in an approved residence, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.12(d)(5)-(6); receive permission to leave the state, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.12(d)(7); refrain from possessing weapons, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.12(d)(8)-(9), and from possessing or using controlled dangerous substances, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.12(d)(10); submit to drug and alcohol testing, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.12(d)(13), and psychological testing, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.12(d)(11); complete appropriate counseling or treatment, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.12(d)(12), including any therapy specified by the staff at the ADTC, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.12(g); obtain permission before accepting employment, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.12(d)(14); notify his parole officer if he becomes unemployed, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.12(d)(15); avoid any contact with A.M. or J.W., <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.12(d)(16); comply with any curfew, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.12(d)(17); and submit to warrantless searches by his parole officer, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.12(d)(21).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The terms of R.F.\u2019s supervised release also require that he generally not contact or attempt to contact a minor, <em>N.JAC. </em>10A:71-6.12(e)(1)-(2), and not live with a minor without permission, <em>N.JAC. </em>10A:71-6.12(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">What is more, \u201cspecial conditions\u201d can be imposed on R.F. if \u201csuch conditions would reduce the likelihood of recurrence of criminal behavior.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.12(n). These supervision requirements are also accompanied by mandatory registration requirements under Megan\u2019s Law. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-2. It was appropriate for Judge Perretti to consider these conditions in reaching her decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Judge Perretti acknowledged that R.F., who at the time had been confined for over four years, first at the county jail, then at the ADTC, and later at the STU, would \u201crequire many social services if he is to peacefully negotiate life in the community.\u201d That, in the free world, an individual may need assistance in housing, in vocational training, in mental health counseling, and in other life skills is not a reason for his continued commitment in the STU. That is what Judge Perretti meant when she stated: \u201cThe State must step up to the plate now and cannot simply hide [R.F.] in the Special Treatment Unit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Upholding Judge Perretti\u2019s decision means that R.F. must be released with an appropriate discharge plan prepared by the STU staff. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.37 (\u201cA person discharged by the court shall have a discharge plan prepared by the treatment team at the facility designated for the custody, care and treatment of sexually violent predators____\u201d); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.32(b) (stating that person found not to be sexually violent offender must be released with \u201cdischarge plan\u201d). That discharge plan, crafted by staff of the STU, presumably will provide for the services and counseling necessary for R.F.\u2019s successful reintegration into the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">The Department of Human Services, which operates the STU, must decide whether to provide the services necessary for former committees, such as R.F., to live successfully in the free world. Surely, the Department will want to maximize the likelihood of R.F.\u2019s reintegration into the community and minimize the risk of recidivism. Our civil commitment jurisprudence has emphasized the importance of \u201cprovid[ing] the needed level of care in the least restrictive manner,\u201d <em>In re S.L., </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>128, 141, 462 A.2d 1252 (1983), and not infringing on an individual\u2019s \u201cliberty or autonomy any more than appears reasonably necessary to accomplish\u201d the State\u2019s goals of public safety and effective treatment, <em>State v. Krol, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>236, 261-62, 344 A.2d 289 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Significantly, the SVPA provides for a \u201cconditional discharge\u201d of a committee when the Department of Human Services so recommends and \u201cthe court finds that the person will not be likely to engage in acts of sexual violence because the person is amenable to and highly likely to comply with a plan to facilitate the person\u2019s adjustment and reintegration into the community.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.32(c)(1). The goal of a discharge plan for an individual who is conditionally discharged is to \u201crender involuntary commitment as a sexually violent predator unnecessary for that person.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Although R.F.\u2019s release follows from a different provision of the SVPA, the goal of his discharge plan prepared by the STU should also be to facilitate his \u201cadjustment and reintegration into the community.\u201d <em>See ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">R.F. has lived over nine years\u2014his entire adult life\u2014in the custody of the State. The record is clear that R.F. is a cognitively impaired young man who requires assistance when he is released into the community. Clearly, the STU staff and the Department of Human Services will be in the best position to decide what services and counseling R.F. will require to successfully navigate outside the confines of a State institution. Accordingly, we remand to the civil commitment court to allow the \u201ctreatment team\u201d at the STU to formulate an appropriate discharge plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Our difference with the dissent is that it pays lip service to the standard of review by ignoring evidence and testimony that supports the findings of Judge Perretti and by cherry-picking facts that would support the State\u2019s petition. In addition, the dissent has a mistaken understanding of some portions of the record. For example, the dissent does not take into account that Dr. Shnaid-man found and Judge Perretti accepted that R.F.\u2014having served his prison term\u2014understands that it is wrong to have sexual relations with underage individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">The dissent also misapprehends our citation to the subsection of the SVPA that references a \u201cconditional discharge,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>27.32(c)(1). We know that R.F. is not a candidate for conditional discharge under that statute. Our only point is that whether a discharge plan is crafted under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.32(c)(1) or under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.32(b), when the court finds a person, such as R.F., should be released, the goal is \u201cto facilitate the person\u2019s adjustment and reintegration into the community so as to render involuntary commitment\u201d unnecessary, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.32(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The complex and difficult judgment calls to be made after hearing the testimony of the experts and sifting through the evidence was for the trial judge, and we must not second-guess those calls unless they are clearly mistaken and unsupported by the evidence. It is here where we part ways with the dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">R.F. has been detained at the STU for over five years without any judicial review of his mental or behavioral status. This Court has not been informed of R.F.\u2019s current status or of his progress at the STU over the lengthy history of this appeal. We cannot foreclose the possibility that circumstances or conditions that might have a bearing on whether R.F. is highly likely to sexually reoffend have changed since Judge Perretti\u2019s ruling. Our decision does not deprive the State of the right to re-petition for SVPA commitment based on changed circumstances and conditions.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Nevertheless, if there is a basis to re-petition, it may not be used as an occasion to re-litigate or collaterally attack Judge Perretti\u2019s findings. Those findings are not to be revisited.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">In light of the unusual posture of this appeal, we will stay the discharge of R.F. for thirty days. During that period, a discharge plan shall be prepared and the State can decide whether there is any ground to re-petition based on changed circumstances and conditions since Judge Perretti\u2019s decision. If the State chooses to re-petition, the civil commitment court shall provide R.F. with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>prompt probable-cause determination, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.28(f), and hearing, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.29(a) (requiring hearing \u201cwithin 20 days from the date of the temporary commitment order\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">For the reasons expressed, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Division and reinstate the decision rendered by the trial court, subject to the modifications set forth in this opinion.

Given the deprivation of liberty that follows civil commitment under the statute, the SVPA authorizes courts to civilly commit an individual only if the State proves by clear and convincing evidence that the individual is a \u201csexually violent predator\u201d who, if released into the community, would be \u201chighly likely\u201d to sexually reoffend. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.26; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.32(a); <em>In re Civil Commitment of W.Z., </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>109, 132, 801 A.2d 205 (2002). The trial court\u2019s determination \u201cshould be modified only if the record reveals a clear mistake.\u201d <em>In re D.C., </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>31, 58, 679 A.2d 634 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">In my view, as in the opinion of the Appellate Division panel, the record of this case reveals a clear mistake. With due respect for the seasoned judge who presided over the commitment hearing, the testimony presented to her simply does not support her conclusion that R.F. is not a sexually violent predator. Even if we disregard the compelling testimony of the State\u2019s expert witnesses that R.F. poses a significant risk to the public, and R.F.\u2019s self-described \u201cdeviant arousal\u201d for preteen girls and the sight of blood, the testimony of R.F.\u2019s own expert establishes the risk imposed by R.F.\u2019s impending release. R.F.\u2019s expert conceded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>R. F. has a psychiatric condition that meets the clinical definition of antisocial personality disorder. R.F.\u2019s expert opined that by virtue of a cognitive impairment, R.F. considered himself a peer of the twelve- and thirteen-year-old victims of his offenses\u2014prompting him to perceive sexual contact with a child to be tantamount to adult dating behavior, rather than criminal assault. R.F.\u2019s expert provided no assurance that R.F. can successfully navigate an independent existence in the community, and strongly suggested that he cannot. Nonetheless, the trial court ordered his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">I respectfully submit that, notwithstanding the deferential standard to which the trial court\u2019s factual findings are entitled, the court\u2019s ruling in this case should not survive appellate review. The Appellate Division panel did not substitute its judgment for that of the trial judge, but did what an appellate court is intended to do: provide a careful review of the evidence in accordance with the statutory mandate and the compelling public safety interest at stake. The panel tested the trial court\u2019s determination against the record before it, and unanimously found that determination to be contrary to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">I would affirm the panel\u2019s judgment, and would authorize the continued civil commitment of R.F., subject to annual review as required by <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.35.1 respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">The record before the trial court should be viewed in the context of the Legislature\u2019s purpose when it enacted the SVPA. The Legislature recognized that violent sexual offenders \u201csuffer from mental abnormalities or personality disorders which make them likely to engage in repeat acts of predatory sexual violence if not treated for their mental conditions.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.25(a). As this Court has noted, \u201c[t]he Legislature enacted the SVPA to protect other members of society from the danger posed by sexually violent predators.\u201d <em>In re Civil Commitment of J.M.B., </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>563, 570-71, 964 A.2d 752, <em>cert, denied, </em>558 <em>U.S. </em>999, 130 <em>S.

The Legislature foresaw the risks posed by sexually violent predators and the shortcomings of the existing procedure for involuntary commitment to address those risks. <em>supra, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>at 571, 964 A.2d 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">In that setting, the Legislature \u201cbroaden[ed] the reach of New Jersey law to afford protection to society from those sexually violent predators who pose a danger as a result of a mental abnormality or personality disorder which makes them likely to engage in repeated acts of predatory sexual violence.\u201d <em>In re Civil Commitment of E.D., </em>353 <em>N.J.Super. </em>450, 456, 803 A.2d 166 (App.Div.2002); <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.25(b)-(c) (stating that in light of shortcomings in existing involuntary commitment procedures, \u201cit [was] necessary to modify the involuntary civil commitment process in recognition of the need for commitment of those sexually violent predators who pose a danger to others should they be returned to society\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">To be involuntarily committed under the SVPA, an individual must be adjudged a \u201csexually violent predator,\u201d defined as \u201ca person who has been convicted ... of a sexually violent offense\u201d and who \u201csuffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility for control, care and treatment.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.26; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.32(a). The Legislature defined \u201c[l]ikely to engage in acts of sexual violence\u201d to mean \u201cthe propensity of a person to commit acts of sexual violence is of such a degree as to pose a threat to the health and safety of others.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.26.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">As the majority notes, at an SVPA civil commitment hearing, the State is required to prove by clear and convincing evidence three elements derived from the SVPA and case law. <em>Ante </em>at 173, 85 A.3d at 991. First, the State must prove that the individual has been convicted of one or more of the sexually violent offenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>enumerated in the statute, or \u201cany offense for which the court makes a specific finding on the record that, based on the circumstances of the case, the person\u2019s offense should be considered a sexually violent offense.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.26; <em>see W.Z., supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 127, 801 A.2d 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Second, the State must prove that the individual \u201csuffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in acts of sexual violence\u201d unless he or she is confined. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.26; <em>W.Z., supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 130, 801 A.2d 205. \u201cA finding of mental abnormality that results in an impaired but not a total loss of ability to control sexually dangerous behavior\u201d may suffice; the State need not demonstrate \u201ca total lack of capacity to control such dangerous behavior.\u201d <em>W.Z., supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 126-27, 801 A.2d 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Finally, the State must prove that the individual poses a threat to the health and safety of others, which is established upon proof by clear and convincing evidence that he or she has \u201cserious difficulty in controlling his or her harmful behavior such that it is highly likely that [he or she] will not control his or her sexually violent behavior and will reoffend.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130, 801 A.2d 205. This Court has explained that the court\u2019s findings regarding the threat of recidivism:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">incorporate a temporal sense that will require an assessment of the reasonably foreseeable future. No more specific finding concerning precisely when an individual will recidivate need be made by the trial court. Commitment is based on the individual\u2019s danger to self and others because of his or her <em>present </em>serious difficulty with control over dangerous sexual behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 132-33, 801 A.2d 205.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">That determination requires the court to carefully scrutinize the testimony of the expert witnesses presented by the State and the individual who is the subject of the hearing. Prior to the enactment of the SVPA, this Court noted that in the context of a commitment hearing, the determination of a violent sex offender\u2019s dangerousness is \u201ca legal one, not a medical one, even though it is guided by medical expert testimony.\u201d <em>D.C., supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 38, 59, 679 A.2d 634. In making that determination, the court must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>carefully balance the safety of the public against the individual\u2019s liberty interests. <em>Id. </em>at 59, 679 A.2d 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Civil commitment under the SVPA is not indefinite. Rather, the reviewing court holds an annual hearing to determine whether the \u201cinvoluntary commitment of a sexually violent predator shall be continued,\u201d imposing on the State the burden of proving the statutory elements by clear and convincing evidence. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.35. A trial court\u2019s denial of the State\u2019s motion for civil commitment pursuant to the SVPA has immediate consequences for that individual and for the public. Under the terms of the SVPA, the individual must be released \u201cwithin 48 hours ... or by the end of the next working day, whichever is longer,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.32(b), with a discharge plan prepared under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.37, and notice to law enforcement and victims to the extent required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.38.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Charged with protecting the public from violent sexual predators, and safeguarding the due process rights of the individual under review, the judiciary plays a crucial role in the application of the SVPA. A critical component of that role is a thorough and rigorous appellate review. Our appellate courts recognize the specialized expertise of the commitment court, and will reverse that court\u2019s determination only upon \u201can abuse of discretion or a lack of evidence to support it.\u201d <em>In re Civil Commitment of T.J.N., </em>390 <em>N.J.Super. </em>218, 225-26, 915 A.2d 53 (App.Div.2007); <em>accord In re Civil Commitment of R.Z.B., </em>392 <em>N.J.Super. </em>22, 35-36, 919 A.2d 864 (App.Div.2007). \u201c \u2018The appropriate inquiry is to canvass the ... expert testimony in the record and determine whether the [commitment judge\u2019s] findings were clearly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>R.Z.B., supra, </em>392 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 36, 919 A.2d 864 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>D.C., supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 58-59, 679 A.2d 634). Nonetheless, appellate review of an SVPA determination entails scrutiny of the evidence before the trial judge, and a determination of whether the judge\u2019s findings are supported by that evidence. <em>See Curtis v. Finneran, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>563, 570, 417 A.2d 15 (1980) (stating in context of nonjury civil action, \u201cthe trial court must state clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>its factual findings and correlate them with the relevant legal conclusions\u201d); <em>In re Civil Commitment of J.P., </em>393 <em>N.J.Swper. </em>7, 17, 922 A.2d 754 (App.Div.2007) (stating in context of trial court\u2019s determination that defendant\u2019s underlying sexual conduct constituted predicate sexual offense under SVPA, \u201c[tjrial judges must understand that the requirement to articulate specific findings ... is essential to meaningful review of the record\u201d). In short, given the competing interests at stake, appellate review of an SVPA determination must be conducted with precision and care.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">In my view, the Appellate Division panel properly identified this case as the rare instance in which the trial court\u2019s findings lack a firm foundation in the record, warranting reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The trial court\u2019s task was to determine three issues: (1) whether R.F. had been convicted of a sexually violent offense; (2) whether R.F. suffered from a mental abnormality or personality disorder; and (3) whether as a result of that abnormality or disorder, it is highly likely that R.F. will not control his sexually violent behavior, and that he will reoffend. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.26; <em>W.Z., supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 127-33, 801 A.2d 205. The trial court found that the State had proven by clear and convincing evidence the first and second elements\u2014that R.F. had been convicted of a predicate offense as defined by the SVPA, and that he suffered from a mental abnormality or personality disorder within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.26. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s denial of the State\u2019s application for civil commitment was premised on a single determination: that the State had failed to meet its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that by virtue of his recognized mental abnormality or personality disorder, R.F. is highly likely to reoffend.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Like the Appellate Division panel, I am persuaded that the State presented clear and convincing evidence\u2014indeed, overwhelming evidence\u2014that R.F. is a sexually violent predator who is highly likely to engage in acts of sexual violence after his release. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>My conclusion is not premised upon the differences between the opinions offered by the various experts, but upon their common ground. While it diverged to some extent from the expert opinions offered by the State, the testimony of R.F.\u2019s expert witness confirmed the State\u2019s evidence in significant respects, and in my view supported R.F.\u2019s continued confinement, not his release. I respectfully submit that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the State had failed to meet its burden under the SYPA is contrary to the evidence, and is premised upon reasoning that is simply irrelevant to the SVPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">As the majority recounts, the State\u2019s expert psychiatrist, Dr. Robert Harris, diagnosed R.F. with pedophilia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and antisocial personality disorder. The expert\u2019s diagnoses were premised in part upon his interviews with R.F. In those interviews, R.F. admitted that he began to be attracted to one victim when she was ten years old. R.F. also told the expert on multiple occasions that he had a \u201cdeviant arousal\u201d for girls aged between ten and thirteen, and that he was also aroused by images of blood. Dr. Harris testified that the combination of pedophilia and anti-social personality disorder greatly exacerbated R.F.\u2019s risk of reoffense. Acknowledging that the Static-99 diagnostic tool should be used with caution to assess juvenile offenders, Dr. Harris nevertheless relied upon it, given that R.F. was almost eighteen years old at the time of his offense. By Dr. Harris\u2019s assessment, R.F.\u2019s Static-99 scores of four and five meant that he presents a moderate to high risk of sexually reoffending.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Dr. Harris noted that R.F. may identify himself with young children or perceive them to be his peers. He considered this factor to heighten, rather than mitigate, R.F.\u2019s risk of reoffending if released from civil commitment. The expert was further concerned by R.F.\u2019s sexual activity during his confinement, finding that this denoted R.F.\u2019s inability to comply with rules and regulations. Ultimately, Dr. Harris concluded that R.F. presented a high risk of reoffense.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>The State\u2019s second expert witness, psychologist Dr. Sean McCall, did not concur with Dr. Harris\u2019s definitive diagnosis of pedophilia in R.F. Instead, Dr. McCall adopted a provisional diagnosis of \u201crule out pedophilia,\u201d as well as a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder. Dr. McCall opined that R.F. had admitted that he was sexually aroused by young girls, and noted R.F.\u2019s willingness to \u201cact upon\u201d that arousal. Dr. McCall described R.F.\u2019s escalating sexual violence and deviance, noting his use of force against the first victim and his use of a weapon against the second. Like Dr. Harris, Dr. McCall relied upon the Static-99 test given R.F.\u2019s near-adult status at the time of his offenses and the nature of those offenses. The expert determined R.F.\u2019s Static-99 score to be a four, which he equated to a thirty-six percent chance of being reconvicted for a sexual offense within fifteen years. Dr. McCall shared Dr. Harris\u2019s concern that R.F.\u2019s continued inability to refrain from sexual activity while confined indicated that he could not comport himself to the restrictive standards of commitment, much less the standards of society. Dr. McCall found that R.F.\u2019s diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder predisposed him to reoffend. Dr. McCall concluded that R.F. was at a high risk to sexually reoffend if not committed. During his cross-examination, Dr. McCall expressed the same concern as Dr. Harris regarding R.F.\u2019s emotional identification with children, concluding that it increased the risk of R.F. reoffending sexually.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Dr. Vivian Schnaidman, an expert in psychiatry, testified on behalf of R.F. Dr. Shnaidman diagnosed R.F. with conduct disorder. She initially characterized his condition as a juvenile manifestation of antisocial personality disorder, but conceded under questioning from the trial judge that R.F.\u2019s mental condition met the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders </em>criteria <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for antisocial personality disorder. She stated that because R.F. had conduct disorder, \u201cthere is definitely psychopathology, I just don\u2019t want it to be sexual psychopathology.\u201d Dr. Shnaidman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>rejected the use of the Static-99 diagnostic test because of R.F.\u2019s age and cognitive limitations, and opined that despite his mental conditions, R.F. is at a low risk to reoffend.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Dr. Shnaidman emphasized R.F.\u2019s belief that his young victims, who had accepted him as someone with whom they could play \u201chide-and-seek,\u201d were in fact his peers. She testified that in concert with R.F.\u2019s cognitive impairment, this belief caused him to equate his sexual assaults on his twelve and thirteen year old victims to adult dating behavior. Although she conceded that children of these victims\u2019 ages may not, as a matter of law, consent to sexual activity, Dr. Shnaidman suggested that R.F. believed that the victims were his contemporaries, and therefore were capable of giving consent. Dr. Shnaidman acknowledged R.F.\u2019s interaction with the victims prior to the assaults, which had been characterized by the State\u2019s experts as R.F.\u2019s \u201cgrooming\u201d of the victims. She minimized the significance of those interactions, observing that if such contact took place between adult men and adult women, it would be called \u201cdating.\u201d Dr. Shnaidman testified that in R.F.\u2019s mind, his sexual encounters with his young victims constituted \u201cdating.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Dr. Shnaidman testified regarding R.F.\u2019s plea bargain, pursuant to which R.F. had pled guilty to two charges of third-degree endangering the welfare of a minor, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4(a), rather than the more serious charges pending against him, two counts of first-degree aggravated sexual assault <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2(a)(4). To Dr. Shnaidman, the State\u2019s decision to enter into the plea bargain indicated that R.F.\u2019s conduct, contrary to statements from his victims indicating R.F.\u2019s use of force and weapons, fell somewhere on the spectrum between consensual sexual activity and sexual activity conducted through the use of force. Dr. Shnaidman opined that R.F. had learned from his mistakes and now understood that he would not be protected from prosecution because he was not yet eighteen when these offenses were committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Thus, while the expert witnesses who testified before the trial court disagreed on significant points, there was substantial con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>sensus among them. All of the experts agreed that R.F.\u2019s mental condition met the <em>DSM-IV-TR </em>criteria for antisocial personality-disorder. All of the experts agreed that R.F. misidentified children as his peers and that he has had sexual encounters with minors. All of the experts recognized that R.F. had likely been sexually active, in violation of facility rules, while confined.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> None of the experts remotely suggested that following his offenses, R.F. gained the ability to control the arousal that is prompted by his contact with children. Indeed, the very explanation that Dr. Shnaidman offers in R.F.\u2019s defense\u2014that R.F.\u2019s mental condition rendered him incapable of understanding that he is not the contemporary of a pubescent girl, or of distinguishing between the sexual assault of a child and adult dating behavior\u2014itself raises serious concerns.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">In my view, the trial court\u2019s analysis of the record fails to support its conclusion. The court cited factors that would tend to exacerbate, not reduce, the risk of recidivism: R.F.\u2019s disciplinary record and lack of significant progress while confined, his poor impulse control, his limited ability to comprehend that he had committed sexual offenses and what the trial judge described as his \u201cbizarre\u201d statements about being aroused by young girls and blood. The trial judge noted discrepancies between R.F.\u2019s narra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>tive of the two incidents that led to his conviction for endangering the welfare of a child and the official record. She observed that R.F. had received numerous disciplinary citations while confined, including one involving suspected sexual activity with another resident of the facility, that he claimed to have another personality that he termed \u201cGoliath,\u201d that he reported experiencing blackouts, that he demonstrated what the court termed \u201cdistorted thinking,\u201d and that \u201che had only a limited understanding of his crime.\u201d The judge found evidence in the expert testimony and in R.F.\u2019s treatment records that R.F. is significantly cognitively impaired. She noted that R.F. made only limited progress in treatment, that he had been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and bipolar disorder and that he suffered from juvenile conduct disorder. The trial judge stated that based upon R.F.\u2019s past conduct, it could be reasonably predicted that \u201che will get in trouble if released now into the community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Nonetheless, the trial judge stated that she was \u201cnot so clearly convinced\u201d that R.F. was \u201chighly likely to commit a sexually violent offense in the foreseeable future.\u201d That conclusion was not based upon any expert testimony indicating that R.F. has made progress with treatment and time. Instead, the trial judge focused upon a factor recognized nowhere in the SVPA or in the case law applying it: the terms of defendant\u2019s plea bargain. The trial judge conjectured that the prosecutor\u2019s decision to permit R.F. to plead guilty to a lesser included offense, rather than to try him for first-degree aggravated sexual assault, revealed that the State had doubts about the underlying offenses. She stated: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>In fact, the record reveals nothing whatsoever about the reason why the State entered into a plea agreement with R.F.; like any other plea bargain, the agreement in this case may have been influenced by a range of factors. Further, the trial judge\u2019s suggestion that R.F.\u2019s civil commitment is akin to a life sentence is belied by the statute\u2019s requirement that R.F.\u2019s commitment be reviewed annually, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.35. I respectfully submit that the trial court\u2019s reliance upon speculation about R.F.\u2019s plea bargain and erroneous assumptions regarding his term of commitment constituted significant errors, and led the court to the wrong decision.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>The Sussex County Prosecutor\u2019s Office and the sentencing Judge are those more closely connected to [R.F.\u2019s] sexual offending behavior and most capable of making an evaluation of appropriate sanctions punitive and remedial. Rather than pursue child rape convictions possible here with a presumptive 30-year sentence, the two offenses were pled out as third-degree endangering charges ... with concurrent sentences of five years at [the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center]. The State\u2019s petition now seeks civil commitment to [the] Special Treatment Unit with an indeterminate time which in this case is tantamount to life in custody. This disproportion itself raises doubts in this Court\u2019s mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>The Appellate Division panel did not, as the majority suggests, substitute its judgment for that of the trial court in drawing inferences from a debatable record. Instead, the panel properly concluded that the trial court\u2019s analysis lacked support in the evidence, and that it accordingly could not withstand even a deferential appellate review. In my view, the panel furthered the Legislature\u2019s goals that violent sexual offenders be ensured due process and provided treatment, and that public safety\u2014in this case the safety of children\u2014be preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">I do not share the majority\u2019s confidence that R.F.\u2019s release with a discharge plan, with the restrictions imposed by community supervision for life (CSL) under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:43-6.4, will protect the community.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The restrictions of CSL cited by the majority\u2014 requiring R.F. to seek authorization regarding his residence and employment, to contact his parole officer for various reasons, to submit to drug, alcohol and psychological testing and to complete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>treatment\u2014can provide effective protection to the public and adequate supervision for certain offenders released from SVPA confinement. I submit, however, that R.F. is not such an offender, and this is not such a case. Given R.F.\u2019s previous failure to make progress in treatment, his violation of rules regarding sexual activity even while confined, his documented inability to control his sexual impulses and his history of violence, the restrictions imposed as part of CSL provide scant protection to potential victims, especially children whom R.F. may encounter. Particularly in light of R.F.\u2019s own expert\u2019s opinion that his identification with children led him to confuse sexual activity with minors with adult dating, there is no assurance that he would comply with a ban on contact with his victims or other minors, and a strong suggestion that he would not. In my view, CSL restrictions are simply inadequate to protect the community from the risk that R.F. will reoffend.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">I respectfully submit that a substantial error was made when the trial court denied the State\u2019s motion to civilly commit R.F. under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.32(a). I would affirm the Appellate Division\u2019s determination, and I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\"><em>For </em>reversal/reinstatement/remandment\u2014Chief Justice RABNER and Justices LaVECCHIA, ALBIN, and Judges RODR\u00cdGUEZ (temporarily assigned) and CUFF (temporarily assigned)\u20145.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\"><em>For </em>affirmance\u25a0\u2014Justice PATTERSON\u20141.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-6\"> American Psychiatric Association, <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders </em>706 (4th ed.
