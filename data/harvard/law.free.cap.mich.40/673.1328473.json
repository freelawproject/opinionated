Four pleas were filed in bar of the information, and to each plea a replication was filed, and the second, third and fourth replications were demurred to, the first being merely a joinder in issue on the first plea, which alleged that the common council of Detroit had never, by resolution \u201eor otherwise, created the office of .chief clerk of the assessor\u2019s office of the city of Detroit, either under or by virtue of the authority conferred by section two of the city charter, or by virtue of any other power or authority possessed by said council, and that no such office exists in the corporation known as the city of Detroit, and there is no such public office in said city, or in this State, and of this the said defendant puts himself upon the country.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b694-10\">The second plea, which is referred to in the statement of facts, runs thus: \u201cAnd for a further plea in this behalf with reference to so much and such part of said information as charges this defendant with having entered into, used, exercised, claimed and usurped an office in the corporation of the city of Detroit, known as chief clerk of the. assessor\u2019s office of the city of Detroit, without any legal election, appointment, warrant or authority therefor, this defendant says: That the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>city of Detroit is a municipal corporation in this State, under and by virtue of an act entitled \u201cAn act.to revise the charter of the city of Detroit,\u201d approved February 5th, 1857,. and the acts amendatory thereof; that by an ordinance relative to the city assessor and his assistants, approved December 30th, 1861, it was ordained by the common council of the said city, among other things, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b695-4\">\u201c Sec. 7.

IT. H. Leroy was city assessor, and there were five or six clerks in his office who had been employed by him, and they remained in his office with him until the expiration of his official term on the 20th day of March, 1878, at which time he was succeeded in office by the Hon. George W. Gilbert, the present city assessor of the city of Detroit; that on \u00bfhe 29th day of March, 1878, the said George <em>W. </em>Gilbert, as city assessor, transmitted the following communication to the common council of the said city: \u201c <em>To the Honorable the Common Council: </em>Gentlemen, \u2014 I hereby recommend Thomas F. Langdon for chief clerk in the city assessor\u2019s office, and most respectfully ask your honorable body to appoint him to that position. George W. Gilbert, <em>City Assessor.\u201d </em>On the, second day of April, 1878, the said nomination was confirmed by the common council by a vote on a call of the roll of fifteen yeas to ten nays; that this defendant thereupon duly qualified and entered upon the performance and discharge of his duties as chief clerk of the assessor\u2019s office, and claims to hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>the said office, and does hold it, with all its privileges, by virtue of such appointment and the authority thereof, as it was lawful and proper for him to do. And this defendant will continue to claim the said office until the expiration of the official term of George W. Gilbert as city assessor. Without this, that he in any way usurps said office, or entered into, used or exercised the same without warrant or authority of law; and this the said defendant is ready to verify.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b697-4\">The third plea runs thus: And for a further plea in this behalf with reference to so much and such part of said information as sets forth a pretended right in the relator, William A. Throop, to hold said office, this defendant says: That prior to said second Tuesday in January, 1879, the common council of the city of Detroit had duly passed and adopted the ordinance relative to the appointment of assistants, clerks and other employees set forth in the second plea above pleaded, and which ordinance was approved July 13th, 1877; that the common council of the said city has never fixed or prescribed the duties of the chief clerk, or of the other clerks in the assessor\u2019s office, but that, as a matter of fact, the duties of the chief clerk are those of a mere clerkship, and consist of writing out and copying the annual assessment rolls of the city from minutes and field notes furnished by the assessor and his assistants, and also certain special assessment rolls prepared in the office of the assessor; that the chief clerk has no official functions, powers or authority, and he does not act for or represent the assessor in the performance of any official act or duty; that the clerks in the office of the assessor are only necessary because the assessor and the two assistant assessors provided by the charter cannot do all the writing and copying required in the office; that the only distinction between the chief clerk and the other clerks in the office is, that the' chief clerk gives out or divides the work among the other clerks, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>superintends their work for the purpose of making the force systematic and efficient, and of having the work properly performed; but the chief clerk cannot sign the name of the assessor, or determine any matter within his official judgment or discretion, and, in point of fact, is merely his chief amanuensis and copyist. This defendant admits that at a meeting of the council held on the 22d day of January, 1879, the following resolution was adopted by a vote on a call of the roll of fourteen yeas to eleven nays: \u201c <em>Resolved, </em>That William A. Throop be and is hereby appointed chief clerk in the assessor\u2019s office.\u201d But this defendant says that said William A. Throop was not nominated by the city assessor, as required by the ordinance of July 13th, 1877, and that said ordinance was, and still is in full force and effect; and further, that at the then next session of the common council, the Hon. George C. Langdon, mayor of the city, sent to the council the following veto message:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b698-4\">\u201c <em>To the Honorable the Common Council:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b698-5\">Gentlemen, \u2014 I most respectfully return to your honorable body without my approval, each of the following resolutions adopted at your last session:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b698-6\"><em>Resolved, </em>That William A. Throop be and is hereby appointed chief clerk in the assessor\u2019s office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b698-7\">[Here follow several resolutions purporting to appoint other persons to other positions.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b698-8\">Under an ordinance authorizing it, the persons now holding the clerkships or positions mentioned in said resolutions were nominated and recommended by the controller, receiver of taxes and the assessor respectively, and said recommendations were concurred in by the common council.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b698-9\">The ordinance in question, does net contemplate any change in the clerks appointed under it during the term of the officers making the nominations, except for misconduct reported by the officer to the common council. The ordinance only requires the heads of departments 'to recommend suitable persons for subordinate positions in their respective offices at the commencement of their official terms, and is based upon the theory that the responsible head of such office or department who has given bonds for the faithful execution of the duties of his office 'shall have a voice in the selection of his clerks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>and assistants, for whoso conduct he is officially responsible and subject to liability on his official bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b699-4\">I do not understand that the clerkships mentioned in the above resolutions are offices within the meaning of the charter, or that the incumbents thereof can be regarded as officers. I can find no ordinance or resolution of the common council creating any such offices, and, in the absence of any such action, the clerks in question must be regarded as occupying contract relations with the city rather than official. They are mere employees, and under the express and implied terms of their employment are subject to discharge at any time by the city; but as they are not officers, the question whether they shall be discharged or not, comes within the veto power of the mayor, the same as any other matter concerning the contracts of the city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b699-5\">Disapproving, as I do, of any interference with the clerks in the offices named, unless at the request of the officers themselves, and believing that the ordinance to which I have referred is correct in its policy, and that it should be enforced, I deem it my duty to veto each of the said resolutions, and trust that, upon a reconsideration of the same, your honorable body will see the injustice of forcing a clerk upon any city officer, especially those who are required to give official bonds. Very respectfully, Geo. C. Langdon, <em>Mayor.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b699-6\">Detroit, January 24, 1879.\u201d'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b699-7\">Aid.

W. Gilbert, city assessor, presented a communication to the common council remonstrating against any cfiange in the clerks in the assessor\u2019s office, and asking the council to rescind its action appointing Wm, A. Throop chief clerk, and certain other persons clerks in said office, or to relieve them from further liability as such sureties, and on the 14th day of February, 1879, at a session of the council held on that day, the action of the council of the 24th day of January in appointing William A. Throop chief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>cleric in the assessor\u2019s office was reconsidered by the council by a vote of thirteen yeas to eleven nays. It was then moved that the resolution making the appointment be adopted, notwithstanding- the objection of the mayor. The motion was lost by a vote of eleven yeas to thirteen nays. The motion last aforesaid, as well as the motion to reconsider, included all appointments referred to in the mayor\u2019s veto message hereinbefore set forth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b700-4\">This defendant admits that said William A.

We are an of opinion that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">An office is a special trust or charge created by competent authority. If not merely honorary, certain duties will be connected with it, the performance of which will be the consideration for its being conferred upon a particular individual, who for the time will be the officer. The officer is distinguished from the employee in the greater importance, dignity and independence of his position ; in being required to take an official oath, and perhaps to give an official bond; in the liability to be called to account as a public offender for misfeasance or nonfeasance in office, and usually, though not necessarily, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>in the tenure of his position. In particular cases other distinctions will appear which are not general.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">In this case the facts are stipulated, and are given in the margin.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We find among them no evidence that an office known as chief clerk in the office of the assessor of Detroit has ever been created. A person has been appointed, and has acted under the designation of chief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>clerk, but no statute or ordinance has given bim. that title, and if he were now to be called and to style himself in the discharge of his duties head clerk, or leading clerk, or assistant to the assessor, or assessor\u2019s amanuensis, it would, for aught we can discover, be equally well, for nothing whatever depends upon the name. Indeed, we can discover no necessity for his making use of the title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>at all, except perhaps to indicate to those with whom he was transacting business that he was not an intruder in the assessor\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-3\">Nor do we find in the facts stipulated or in any law or ordinance the requirement of an official oath. It is said that the usual oath of office has sometimes and perhaps always been administered, but why administered we do not understand. The fact of its being taken cannot prove that the clerk is an officer; at most, it could only evidence his belief that he was one, or perhaps his caution to observe all forms that possibly might turn out to be essential. It was, we think, a needless ceremony.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">Nor do the duties usually performed by the chief clerk indicate an office rather than an employment. Nothing but custom has defined them, and custom has certainly not been very specific, except in excluding him from all \u201cthe official functions, power and authority appertaining to the office of assessor,\u201d and from \u201crepresenting the assessor in any official act or duty.\u201d But while thus excluded he is still wholly subordinate to the assessor, having no independent functions; his duties are those of \u201c a mere clerkship, and consist of writing out and copying the annual assessment rolls of the city, from minutes and field notes furnished by the assessor and his assistants, and also special assessment rolls,\u201d and he is distinguished from the other clerks in the office in that \u201che gives out and divides the work among the other clerks, and superintends the work for the purpose of making the work systematic and efficient, and of having it properly performed.\u201d Surely these cannot be called official functions; they are properly described as those of a mere clerk, and a mere clerk is not an officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">But the duties, such as they are, can be changed at the will of the superior, since no rule of law or well defined custom forbids it. The assessor may distribute his own work and oversee it himself, and if he were to restrict the clerk, now called the chief clerk, to some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>particular class of duties without making others subordinate to him, we cannot see that the incumbent would have any legal ground of complaint. The law has put nobody under the chief clerk, and the title is as applicable to the assessor\u2019s confidential assistant, who is \u201cchief\u201d because of the special confidence reposed, as it is to one who is \u201cchief\u201d because of having a certain authority over others. The word \u201c chief,\u201d in other words, defines no duties, and the title \u201cclerk\u201d is properly that of an employee. We know of no case in which it is conferred as a title of office where the duties are undefined. Nor is there anything significant in the fact that the chief clerk is independent of the assessor in the tenure of his position. The common council might give the assessor a janitor equally independent in that particular, but the janitor would not be an officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">As these views require us to render judgment for defendant, it does not become necessary to consider the applicability to the case of the remedy which was sought. But it is proper to say that it is at least doubtful whether the proceeding by information is applicable to the case of any office not created by the State itself. In <em>People v. DeMill, </em>15. Mich., 164, 182, we had occasion to point out that there may be many cases apparently within the words of the statute which cannot be within its real intent and meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Judgment will be entered for the defendant, but without costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b706-6\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b703-5\"> Statement oe Facts. \u2014 1.
