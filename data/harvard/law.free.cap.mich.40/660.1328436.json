Eldred &amp; Co., and which, came to the control of the defendants in the Muskegon river.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">The logs were sold by two different contracts in writing, one of which it is conceded was fully performed, and the logs delivered under it. A copy of the other is given in the margin.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Under it the plaintiffs cut and put into the west branch of Muskegon river 135,481 feet of logs, but not in time for the main drive on the Muskegon river. Eldred &amp; Co. had an arrangement with the booming company to receive, run and boom on Muskegon lake, these logs together with a large amount of other logs belonging to them and marked in the same manner, except that these, in addition to the mark of Eldred &amp; Co., had a figure upon them, put on by plaintiffs to indicate the camps from which they were taken, and by which it was possible to identify them. The delivery of the logs into the west branch of the Muske<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>gon was completed about tbe first of March, 1877. The place of delivery was some fifty or sixty miles above Big Rapids. The delivery not being in time for the main drive in the Muskegon river, plaintiffs under their contract became obligated to drive them until the main drive should be overtaken, and they employed one Watson to drive them to the mouth of the west branch. He drove them to Big Rapids where defendants took charge of them by request of Eldred &amp; Co., though this' was long after the main drive had passed, and run them to the mouth of the river, where they delivered them on the order of Eldred &amp; Co. to the firm of Blanchard, Borland &amp; Co. Before this time, howev\u00e9r, the firm of E\u201e Eldred &amp; Co. had lost credit, and had ceased to meet; their obligations, and plaintiffs served written notice-on defendants to retain the logs, and not \u25a0 deliver to Eldred &amp; Co., or to any other party or parties, without the order of plaintiffs. This notice seems to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>served immediately before the delivery commenced. Defendants disregarded the notice, and were sued in trover; the charges for running the logs having previously been tendered them.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">The circuit judge was of opinion that as soon as the logs were delivered into the west branch of the river they were delivered to Eldred &amp; Co., and he therefore instructed the jury to find for the defendants, which they did. It is not contended in this court that this charge was correct. The plaintiffs were not only to put \u2022the logs into the west branch, but they were also to drive them until the main drive was overtaken. This was never done. Possibly what was done by Watson in allowing defendants to take possession of the logs on the order of Eldred &amp; Co. was equivalent to delivery and acceptance by Eldred &amp; Co., but the facts concerning Watson\u2019s authority, and what took place respecting deliv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>\u00a1cry, were not submitted to the jury, and as we have no authority to draw conclusions of fact, we are not at liberty to find that delivery in law has actually taken place.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">The judgment must be reversed, with costs, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b685-5\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b682-5\">This article of agreement, made the twelfth day of December, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-six, between Elisha Eldred &amp; Co., of Chicago, and State of Illinois, of the first part, and Alfred E.
