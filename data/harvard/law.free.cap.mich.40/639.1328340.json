The case was sent to a referee, who found the facts and held as matter of law that Mrs. Smith was entitled to judgment for five dollars and costs of suit. <em>The </em>circuit court affirmed the report and entered judgment accordingly, and defendants brought error.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The case appears plain. It is true Mrs. Smith had not leased the site, and in fact claimed the building and the right to enter. But the finding, we think, is clear that at the time of the alleged trespass, and for some years prior thereto, the district was in the actual entire and undisturbed possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Such being the ease, the act of the plaintiffs in error under the authority of the district was not an act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>unlawful force or of trespass against Mrs. Smith or any body else. Her possession was not disturbed, because she had none. The action was not maintainable. 1 Chitty\u2019s Pl.
