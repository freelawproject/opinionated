B sold the logs and the purchaser agreed to pay for running them, of which fact the company was informed. They drew on B, however, for part payment, and ho returned the draft with directions to draw on the purchaser, which they did, making the draft of the same date and amount, and payable at the same time. The purchaser accepted, the draft, which fell due and was protested without notice to B, who did not know of its non-payment until some time afterwards when the purchaser had failed, and he was for the first time called on to pay it. <em>Held </em>that the accepted draft must be regarded as having been received as conditional payment, and that the company made it their own by failing to notify B of its dishonor. <em>Held </em>that this point was sufficiently raised by an exception to a charge that the drawing and acceptance of the draft would not discharge B unless it was agreed that it should discharge him, or that the draft be taken as payment on the account, since an agreement was not necessary, as the company made the draft their own by neglecting to notify B of its dishonor.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-7\">Error to Saginaw.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"A52\">Submitted April 9.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AWN\">Decided April 15.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-8\">Assumpsit.

It is not disputed that he made the contract with them, nor that they ran the logs under it, and were entitled to recover of some on9 their bill amounting to' over f1,200. Blanchard\u2019s defense is, that he sold the logs the same season to the copartnership of T. Saylor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>&amp; Co., who agreed to pay for running them; that the boom company were informed of the sale and understood that they were to look to T. Saylor &amp; Co., for payment for their services, and that in June, 1875, the company received from T. Saylor &amp; Co. an acceptance at two months which they took no steps to collect when due, but retained until the November following, when the acceptors failed and made assignment. Blanchard claims that under these facts the boom company had discharged him and accepted T. Saylor &amp; Co. as their debtors, or if not, that at least the boom company discharged him to the extent of the acceptance of T. Saylor &amp; Co. by receiving the same and failing to take proper steps for its collection or to put him in position to collect it.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">I. We do not think there is any evidence in the case from which the jury could have been at liberty to find \u2022that the boom company agreed to accept T. Saylor &amp; Co. as their debtors. It is not claimed that any express \u25a0understanding to that effect was proved. It was shown that the company knew of the sale of the logs, and that 'T. Saylor &amp; Co. had agreed to pay for running them; ,but this in no manner affected the express contract of Blanchard to pay for their services. That contract continued in force notwithstanding the sale, and if T. Saylor &amp; Co. should make payments upon it, they would only pay what Blanchard was legally bound for.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">II. We think, however, that the boom company did make the $700 acceptance their own. The circumstances relating to this were the following: The boom company made a draft on Blanchard for $700 at two months, which he returned by letter, saying to the company, \u201c draw on T. Saylor &amp; Co.they thereupon drew on T. Saylor &amp; Co. a draft of same date and amount, and payable at the same time, which was presented to and accepted by T. Saylor &amp; Co., but was never paid. When the draft fell due in August it was protested, but no notice was given to Blanchard, nor did he know of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>non-payment until after T. Saylor &amp; Co. had failed in November, when for the first time he was called upon to pay the boom company\u2019s bill. Under these circumstances the draft of T. Saylor &amp; Co. must be regarded as having been received as conditional payment, and by the failure to notify Blanchard of its dishonor, the company made it their own. <em>Jennison v. </em>Parker, 7 Mich., 355; <em>Ph\u0153nix Ins. Co. v. Allen, </em>11 Mich., 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">It is insisted by defendant in error that this point is not fairly made by exception and assignment of error; but we are inclined to hold that it is. The judge after instructing the jury that the mere drawing and acceptance of the draft would not discharge the defendant, added: <em>\u201c </em>There must have been an agreement or understanding to the effect that by the acceptance of that draft the defendant should be discharged from liability, or that the draft should be taken as payment on the account for the $700.\u201d This was excepted to. Now to make the draft a payment on the account for the $700 we think no agreement to that effect was necessary: it was sufficient that the boom company made the draft their own by their neglect to notify Blanchard of its dishonor.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The judgment must be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b589-6\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
