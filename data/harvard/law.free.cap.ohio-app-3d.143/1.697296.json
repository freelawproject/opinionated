Abele, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">This is an appeal from a Washington County Common Pleas Court judgment. The court granted a motion by Sandra D. Weaver, defendant below and appellee herein, to modify a prior judgment that allocated parental rights and responsibilities. Jeffrey C. Beaver, plaintiff below and appellant herein, raises the following assignment of error for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred when it changed custody of Jeffrey Beaver to his mother.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Our review of the record reveals the following facts pertinent to the instant appeal. On April 10, 1990, the parties married. One child was born as issue of the marriage: Jeffrey G. Beaver, born October 15, 1990. In March 1993, the parties divorced and the trial court designated appellant as the residential parent. Both parties subsequently remarried. Appellee and her new husband have two children. Appellee continued to remain involved in Jeffrey\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">On the evening of October 23, 1999, appellee received a phone call from the home room mother at Jeffrey\u2019s school. The home room mother stated that appellant and his wife \u201cwere on the internet in some very disturbing poses that [appellee] needed to see.\u201d Appellee subsequently discovered appellant\u2019s internet website titled \u201cJokersRealm.com.\u201d The website contained photographs of an explicit sexual nature.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellee learned that appellant and his wife appeared on the website.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">On November 24, 1999, appellee filed a motion to modify the trial court\u2019s prior allocation of parental rights and responsibilities. Appellee alleged that a change in circumstances had occurred and that designating appellee as Jeffrey\u2019s primary residential parent would serve Jeffrey\u2019s best interests. Appellee claims that appellant\u2019s recent website operation had the potential to morally, emotionally, and sexually damage her son, and thus constituted a change in circumstances sufficient to warrant a change in the prior allocation of parental rights and responsibilities. Appellee\u2019s motion did not specifically delineate how appellant\u2019s activities adversely affected her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>On February 24, 2000, the trial court held a hearing to consider appellee\u2019s motion. In support of her motion, appellee presented her own testimony and the testimony of two fellow Wal-Mart employees. The employees testified about the content of appellant\u2019s website. The two Wal-Mart employees did not, however, have any information regarding the effect, if any, that the website had on Jeffrey. Appellee likewise testified as to the content of the website. She further explained her concerns about Jeffrey\u2019s remaining in appellant\u2019s care. Appellee stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-5\">\u201cI think my biggest issue with this is it is \u2014 it\u2019s morally wrong. I don\u2019t want Jeffrey growing up thinking that your body is \u2014 it\u2019s not something to be ashamed of, but it is private and, for your self-respect and your self-esteem, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to sell it, whether it be in books, magazines or across the internet.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Appellee stated that Jeffrey did not seem to know much about the website. She explained that \u201c[a]ll he could tell me [about the website] was that there was his dad and a bunch of babes on the front and two squiggly marks that he thought was lightning at the top of it.\u201d Appellee opined that appellant\u2019s operation of the website adversely affected Jeffrey, causing Jeffrey to become upset and to perform poorly in school.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Washington County Children Services (\u201cWCCS\u201d) caseworker Gina Karwatka testified that she received a referral involving appellant\u2019s operation of the website. She explained that WCCS became involved due to the concern that Jeffrey may have been a subject of the website. Karwatka stated that her investigation revealed that Jeffrey had not, in any manner, been involved with the website. Karwatka further stated that as part of her investigation, she interviewed Jeffrey and he denied any contact with his father\u2019s website. Karwatka stated that after the interview, she had no concerns as to whether the website had affected Jeffrey. Karwatka further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-8\">\u201c[Jeffrey] seemed like a very good kid. I think I remember talking to [appellant] about that afterward, that he seemed like a well \u2014 he was very well-mannered, he was respectful. He told me that \u2014 that he loved both of his parents and he was very attached to his dad and \u2014 because I talked to him about being afraid at home or if things happened at home that he doesn\u2019t like. And he didn\u2019t express any concern or fear about his father\u2019s house.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">Like Karwatka\u2019s testimony, and in contrast to appellee\u2019s testimony, appellant testified that he did not believe that his website operation had affected Jeffrey in any way or had affected appellant\u2019s ability to parent. Appellant further explained that he never had any problems with Jeffrey until Jeffrey learned that appellee filed the motion to modify the allocation of parental rights and responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>After presenting her evidence, appellee urged the trial court to modify the prior allocation of parental rights and responsibilities because the \u201cpoor moral atmosphere\u201d may cause \u201cother things\u201d to happen to \u201cput [Jeffrey\u2019s] upbringing at risk.\u201d Appellant countered that his alleged lack of morality could not properly serve as a basis for modifying the allocation of parental rights and responsibilities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">After hearing the parties\u2019 arguments, the trial court issued a temporary order designating appellee as the residential parent. The trial court found \u201cclear and convincing evidence that there has been a substantial impact on this child. He is not performing up to his capacity in school.\u201d At the conclusion of the hearing, the court further ordered appellant to undergo a \u201cmental examination pursuant to Rule 35.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">On April 24, 2000, the results of appellant\u2019s psychological evaluation were filed with the trial court. The psychologist interviewed appellant and also gave him several tests. During his evaluation, appellant told the psychologist that when appellant informed Jeffrey of the court\u2019s March 7, 2000 decision, Jeffrey became extremely upset and he did not calm down for nearly one and one-half hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">After administering the various tests, the psychologist concluded that appellant is concerned about his son and that he enjoys activities with his son. The results of one of the tests revealed \u201ca pervasive theme of loss and concern for his son\u201d and that \u201c[appellant] looks forward to the time when his son can return home with him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">The results of the Parent-Child Relationship Inventory revealed the following: (1) appellant had an \u201cabove-average\u201d score on the Parental Support scale, meaning that he believes that he receives adequate practical help and emotional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>support as a parent, (2) appellant had a \u201chigh average\u201d score on the Satisfaction with Parenting scale, indicating that appellant enjoys his child and enjoys being a parent, (3) appellant\u2019s score on the Involvement scale, which reflects the propensity to seek out the child and manifest an interest in the child\u2019s activities, was \u201cwell above average,\u201d indicating that appellant has \u201can above average interest in his child\u2019s activities,\u201d (4) appellant\u2019s score on the Communication scale, which represents the awareness of how well the parent communicates with the child and the parent\u2019s empathy, was \u201cabove average,\u201d (5) appellant\u2019s score, on the Limit Setting scale, which measures the effectiveness and character of the parent\u2019s discipline techniques, was \u201chigh average,\u201d and (6) appellant\u2019s score on the Autonomy scale, which reflects the willingness to permit a child\u2019s independence, was in the \u201clow average range.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The psychologist also observed appellant\u2019s interacting with Jeffrey. The psychologist noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">\u201cInitially, [appellant\u2019s] son sat close to him on a couch, while they looked at a book. They also played with cards on the floor. Jeffrey appeared close to his father and there was a relaxed and comfortable interchange between them. There also appeared to be good rapport between the two. They did exchange hugs, in an appropriate manner. When Jeffrey was ready to leave, he ran into his father\u2019s open arms with such force that he threw his father off balance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">The psychologist also interviewed Jeffrey. Jeffrey indicated \u201cthat he is \u2018OK\u2019 with living with his mother, but he really missed his father.\u201d The psychologist noted that Jeffrey \u201cwas unsure as to why he is now residing with his mother instead of his father.\u201d With respect to discipline, Jeffrey told the psychologist that \u201chis father sits down and explains to him what he did wrong and tells him that he should not do it again.\u201d Jeffrey indicated that he believed that appellant\u2019s discipline method was effective. The psychologist then noted: \u201cAt this point, Jeffrey began to appear uncomfortable. Eventually, he did appear tearful and cried. Jeffrey then explained that he is not able to see his dad much and that he wants to see him much more.\u201d Jeffrey advised the psychologist that he would prefer to live with his father. Jeffrey explained that \u201cif he was given a choice, he would like for things to be the way they were when he lived with his dad. He explained that he used to see his mother on weekends. He would then stay with her during the summer and see his father on weekends during the summer. Jeffrey \u2018liked it much better that way.\u2019 He stated that the way it is now, he does not see his father enough and he missed him very much.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">Jeffrey also informed the psychologist that \u201cit was difficult getting used to his new school\u201d and that \u201c[i]t was also hard to change schools. Jeffrey stated that he liked his old school better.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>The psychologist also interviewed appellee. Appellee stated that she believes that appellant \u201cis good to Jeffrey\u201d and that \u201c \u2018[h]e\u2019s excellent at doing kid stuff with him.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The psychologist ultimately concluded that \u201cthere is no evidence that [appellant] would place his son in jeopardy or expose him to any type of pornography.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">After the psychological report was filed, appellant, on April 26, 2000, filed a motion to rescind the temporary order of March 7, 2000. Appellant asserted that the report revealed that Jeffrey wants to return home to his father and that appellant shares a healthy, nurturing relationship with Jeffrey.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">On July 18, 2000, the trial court issued its judgment and modified the prior allocation of parental rights and responsibilities and designated appellee as the residential parent. In reaching its decision, the trial court relied upon the results of the psychological examination. The trial court noted that the report demonstrated that appellant has \u201cnumerous personality problems and deficiencies.\u201d The court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-8\">\u201cThe summary of the father\u2019s MMPI-2 profile indicates characteristics such as resentment and hostility, difficulty appropriately expressing negative emotions, emotional instability, and the under-control of emotions. In addition, the profile shows egocentricity, a low frustration tolerance, and impulsiveness, as well as traits such as irresponsibility, rebelliousness, adventurousness, self-centeredness and unreliability. According to the psychologist\u2019s report, the father may tend to \u2018disregard the potential or actual consequences of actions and may not learn from experience. Acting out and antisocial behavior may include sexual acting out. He may tend to be childish, energetic, immature, shallow and talkative.\u2019 Other possible traits of the father, based on the psychologist\u2019s report, include aggressiveness, inflexibility about masculinity, doubts about masculinity, exhibitionism, self-indulgence, immaturity, opportunism, difficulty delaying gratification and problems with impulse control. The report finds that the father\u2019s \u2018relationships are apt to be superficial and insincere. He might provoke resentment and hostility in others.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">Although the court did not explicitly state what it found to constitute a change in circumstances sufficient to warrant the modification, it appears that the court determined that the revelation of appellant\u2019s \u201cnumerous personality problems and deficiencies\u201d constituted a change in circumstances. The court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-10\">\u201cIn this case, the parties\u2019 minor son, did know that his father and stepmother had a web site, which he had the ability to access, that involved pictures of women and/or girls. The father\u2019s pornographic web site for profit was known to other parents of other children in the son\u2019s class at school. In fact, the teacher at the class eventually gained knowledge of this web site. The child has suffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>from scabies, which the father maintains was contracted through contact with the father\u2019s brother\u2019s dog, a mile down the road. The parties\u2019 son has had extensive visitation and interaction in his mother\u2019s home and community in the past several years, and is bonded with his mother and stepfather. Unbeknownst to this Court, prior to this time, the father does have significant psychological problems pursuant to the profile that was ordered post-hearing in this matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The trial court did not, however, explicitly address how the change in circumstance affected Jeffrey. Nevertheless, the court determined that modification was warranted. Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">In his sole assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred by modifying the prior allocation of parental rights and responsibilities. Appellant argues that the trial court lacked authority to modify the prior allocation without a finding that a change in circumstances has occurred that negatively affects the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">We initially note that when \u201can award of custody is supported by a substantial amount of credible and competent evidence, such an award will not be reversed as being against the weight of the evidence by a reviewing court.\u201d <em>Bechtol v. Bechtol </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 21, 550 N.E.2d 178, syllabus; see, also, <em>Davis v. Flickinger </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 415, 418, 674 N.E.2d 1159, 1162. Furthermore, a reviewing court should afford the utmost deference to a trial court\u2019s decision regarding child custody matters. See, <em>e.g., Miller v. Miller </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 71, 74, 523 N.E.2d 846, 849. Consequently, absent an abuse of discretion, a reviewing court will not reverse a trial court\u2019s decision regarding child custody. See, <em>e.g., Bechtol, supra. </em>When applying the abuse of discretion standard, a reviewing court may not simply substitute its judgment for that of the trial court. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 482-483, 450 N.E.2d 1140, 1142. Moreover, deferring to the trial court on matters of credibility is \u201ccrucial in a child custody case, where there may be much evident in the parties\u2019 demeanor and attitude that does not translate to the record well.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>77 Ohio St.3d at 419, 674 N.E.2d at 1163.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">While a trial court\u2019s discretion in a custody modification proceeding is broad, it is not absolute. The trial court must follow the procedure outlined in R.C. 3109.04. <em>Miller, </em>37 Ohio St.3d at 74, 523 N.E.2d at 849. R.C. 3109.04(E)(1)(a) governs the modification of a prior decree of the allocation of parental rights and responsibilities. The statute provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">\u201cThe court shall not modify a prior decree allocating parental rights and responsibilities for the care of children unless it finds, based on facts that have arisen since the prior decree or that were unknown to the court at the time of the prior decree, that a change has occurred in the circumstances of the child, his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>residential parent, or either of the parents subject to a shared parenting decree, and that the modification is necessary to serve the best interest of the child. In applying these standards, the court shall retain the residential parent designated by the prior decree or the prior shared parenting decree, unless a modification is in the best interest of the child and one of the following applies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-5\">\"* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">\u201c(iii) The harm likely to be caused by a change of environment is outweighed by the advantages of the change of environment to the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">In determining whether to modify a prior allocation of parental rights and responsibilities, three factors generally guide a trial court\u2019s decision: (1) whether there has been a change in circumstances, (2) whether a modification is in the child\u2019s best interests, and (3) whether the benefits resulting from the change will outweigh any harm. See R.C. 3109.04(E)(1)(a); see, <em>e.g., Clark v. Smith </em>(1998), 130 Ohio App.3d 648, 653, 720 N.E.2d 973, 976.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">In <em>Davis, </em>77 Ohio St.3d at 416\u2014417, 674 N.E.2d at 1161, the court discussed the requirement of a \u201cchange in circumstances\u201d and emphasized that a trial court\u2019s finding of whether a change in circumstances has occurred must not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-9\">\u201cR.C. 3109.04 requires a finding of a \u2018change in circumstances.\u2019 Such a determination when made by a trial judge should not be disturbed, absent an abuse of discretion. In determining whether a change in circumstances has occurred so as to warrant a change in custody, a trial judge, as the trier of fact, must be given wide latitude to consider all issues which support such a change, including a change in circumstances because of a child\u2019s age and consequent needs, as well as increased hostility by one parent (and that parent\u2019s spouse) which frustrates cooperation between the parties on visitation issues.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">The <em>Davis </em>court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-11\">\u201cClearly, there must be a change of circumstances to warrant a change of custody, and the change must be of substance, not a slight or inconsequential change. The nomenclature is not the key. As the <em>Wyss </em>court aptly stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-12\">\u201c \u2018The clear intent of that statute is to spare children from a constant tug of war between their parents who would file a motion for change of custody each time the parent out of custody thought he or she could provide the children a \u2018better\u2019 environment. The statute is an attempt to provide some stability to the custodial status of the children, even though the parent out of custody may be able to prove that he or she can provide a better environment.\u2019 <em>Wyss [v. Wyss </em>(1982) ], 3 Ohio App.3d [412] 416 [3 OBR 479, 483], 445 N.E.2d [1153] 1157.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>\u201cIn determining whether a \u2018change\u2019 has occurred, we are mindful that custody-issues are some of the most difficult and agonizing decisions a trial judge must make. Therefore, a trial judge must have wide latitude in considering all the evidence before him or her * * * and such a decision must not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Miller v. Miller </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 71, 523 N.E.2d 846.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>77 Ohio St.3d at 418, 674 N.E.2d at 1162.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Thus, not only must the change of circumstances be of consequence, but it also must relate to the child\u2019s welfare. See <em>Hanley v. Hanley </em>(May 22, 1998), Pickaway App. No. 97 CA 35, unreported, 1998 WL 372685. \u201cImplicit in the definition of changed circumstances is that the change must relate to the welfare of the child.\u201d <em>Holtzclaw v. Holtzclaw </em>(Dec. 14, 1992), Clermont App. No. CA9204-036, unreported, 1992 WL 368712.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Once a change in circumstances has been demonstrated, a trial court next must consider whether a modification will serve the child\u2019s best interests. R.C. 3109.04(F)(1) specifies the factors that a trial court should consider when determining a child\u2019s best interests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\">\u201cIn determining the best interest of a child * * * the court shall consider all relevant factors, including, but not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-8\">\u201c(a) The wishes of the child\u2019s parents regarding his care;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-9\">\u201c(b) If the court has interviewed the child * * * regarding the child\u2019s wishes and concerns as to the allocation of parental rights and responsibilities concerning the child, the wishes and concerns of the child, as expressed to the court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-10\">\u201c(c) The child\u2019s interaction and interrelationship with his parents, siblings, and any other person who may significantly affect the child\u2019s best interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-11\">\u201c(d) The child\u2019s adjustment to his home, school, and community;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-12\">\u201c(e) The mental and physical health of all persons involved in the situation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-13\">\u201c(f) The parent more likely to honor and facilitate visitation and companionship rights approved by the court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-14\">\u201c(g) Whether either parent has failed to make all child support payments, including all arrearages, that are required of that parent pursuant to a child support order under which that parent is an obligor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-15\">\u201c(h) Whether either parent previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to [certain criminal offenses];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-16\">\u201c(i) Whether the residential parent or one of the parents subject to a shared parenting decree has continuously and willfully denied the other parent his or her right to visitation in accordance with an order of the court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>\u201c(j) Whether either parent has established a residence, or is planning to establish a residence, outside this state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">If a trial court concludes that a change in circumstances has occurred and that a modification of the prior allocation of parental rights and responsibilities would serve the child\u2019s best interests, a trial court may not modify a custody order unless the court determines that the harm likely to be caused by a change of environment is outweighed by the benefits of the change of environment. R.C. 3109.09(E)(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">After our review of the record in the case <em>sub judice, </em>we believe that the trial court must conduct further proceedings and permit the parties to submit additional evidence for the court\u2019s consideration. First, we note that the trial court attached great significance to the psychologist\u2019s report. This report does include negative information concerning appellant\u2019s MMPI-2 profile and his personal \u201ccharacteristics.\u201d A large portion of the report, however, casts appellant in a very positive light and illustrates the depth of the relationship between appellant and Jeffrey. Furthermore, additional consideration must be given to precisely how appellant\u2019s alleged psychological deficiencies affect his ability to function and to parent, and how these alleged deficiencies constitute a change in circumstances sufficient to warrant a custody modification. In other words, the record in the instant case provides little insight into how appellant\u2019s alleged psychological deficiencies have affected appellant\u2019s ability to parent Jeffrey and have affected Jeffrey\u2019s welfare. See <em>Hanley, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Second, we recognize that our difficulty stems from the fact that the psychologist did not testify but rather submitted a written report. Appellant notes that the psychologist\u2019s examination and report occurred after the trial on the merits; thus, he did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the psychologist and to address the issues raised in the psychologist\u2019s report. R.C. 3109.04(C)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Civ.R. 75(D)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> speak to psychological examinations of parties in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>domestic relations proceedings. These provisions contain various procedural requirements. If a court chooses to consider the report as evidence, \u201cdue process requires that the trial court permit each party to cross-examine a court-appointed investigator whose report the trial court considers as evidence.\u201d <em>Webb v. Lane </em>(Mar. 15, 2000), Athens App. No. 99 CA 12, unreported, 2000 WL 290383; <em>Eitel v. Eitel </em>(Aug. 23, 1996), Pickaway App. No. 95CA11, unreported, 1996 WL 482703. Thus, parties should be given the opportunity to cross-examine the expert who prepared the report and to explore the nature and the scope of the expert\u2019s findings and conclusions. Of course, we recognize that parties could choose to submit a psychologist\u2019s report to the court without conducting an evidentiary hearing and without considering the psychologist\u2019s oral testimony. <em>Eitel, </em>citing <em>Corrigan v. Corrigan </em>(Dec. 30, 1986), Ross App. No. 1300, unreported, 1986 WL 15205. We find no such agreement or stipulation in the instant case, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">We note that in <em>Eitel, </em>because the trial court fully complied with the procedural requirements outlined in Civ.R. 75(D) we upheld the trial court\u2019s use of an investigator\u2019s report in rendering its decision. A significant part of our rationale in upholding the trial court\u2019s use of the report rested upon the court-appointed investigator\u2019s availability for cross-examination. In contrast to <em>Eitel, </em>in <em>Webb </em>we held that the trial court erred when it admitted a guardian <em>ad litem\u2019s </em>report post-hearing without allowing either party an opportunity to cross-examine the guardian <em>ad litem.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>it appears that neither party had the opportunity to cross-examine the psychologist and to explore the nature and the scope of the psychologist\u2019s findings and conclusions. Again, we note that the psychologist\u2019s examination and report appears to form the sole basis for the trial court\u2019s custody modification order. Thus, we believe that under the facts and circumstances present in the instant case, .the parties must be permitted to fully explore how appellant\u2019s alleged psychological problems have affected appellant and Jeffrey\u2019s welfare. Additionally, on remand the parties should be permitted to present any other relevant evidence, including expert testimony, that they wish to submit to the court for consideration. We hasten to add, however, that our decision should not be construed as a comment on the merits of the custody modification issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons we sustain appellant\u2019s assignment of error, reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b49-6\">Harsha and Evans, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b39-11\">.

In <em>Inscoe </em>v. <em>Inscoe </em>(1997), 121 Ohio App.3d 396, 700 N.E.2d 70, we followed established precedent and noted that unless a parent's sexual activity directly and adversely impacts the child, the parent's sexual activity ordinarily should not be a basis for modifying a prior allocation of parental rights and responsibilities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-10\">\" ' \" * * * The direct adverse impact approach to custody * * * is the soundest, provided certain limitations on its application are adopted. Courts should consider only present impact. Before depriving a sexually active parent of custody, courts should demand preponderance proof that the parent's conduct is having or is probably having an effect on the child and that the effect is actually harmful. Without such proof, the fact of nonmarital sexual conduct should not justify a custody denial or change. Moreover, on the issue of harmfulness, the primary focus should be on the child\u2019s present physical and psychological welfare and developmental potential. Unless accompanied by clearly adverse collateral consequences, moral impact should be ignored.\u201d ' \" (Emphasis deleted.) <em>Inscoe </em>at 413-414, 700 N.E.2d at 81, quoting <em>Whaley v.
