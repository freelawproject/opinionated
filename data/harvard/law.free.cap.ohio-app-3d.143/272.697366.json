The city advances on appeal six assignments of error that, in essence, challenge the trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion with respect to the evidence permitted to be adduced and the comments permitted to be offered in argument before the jury. Finding no merit to any aspect of these challenges, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The genesis of this appeal was the city\u2019s November 1998 filing in the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas of a petition for the appropriation, pursuant to R.C. Chapter 168. The city sought by its petition to take by eminent domain property owned by Banks for the purpose of improving Fort Washington Way, the east-west connector located to the south of Cincinnati\u2019s central business district. The city prayed in its petition for an order directing the appropriation and a determination of the property\u2019s value.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">In October 1999, the matter was tried to a jury. On the issue of the property\u2019s value, Banks calculated its worth at $13,922,000 and presented the testimony of two experts, who valued the property at $6,280,000 and $10,000,000, respectively. The city countered with the testimony of three experts, who variously fixed the property\u2019s value at $735,000, $701,500, and $744,000. The jury returned a verdict awarding Banks $4,469,760, and the trial court entered judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">The city subsequently filed a motion seeking a remittitur, the entry of judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or a new trial. On December 29, 1999, the trial court denied the motion, and this appeal ensued. By entry dated January 31, 2000, the trial court stayed execution on its judgment pending the outcome of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">The city, in its first and second assignments of error, contends that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting expert opinion testimony by two defense witnesses to the fair market value of Banks\u2019s property. We find no merit to this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, and Section 19, Article I of the Ohio Constitution guarantee just compensation for the taking of private property for public use. In an appropriation proceeding under R.C. Chapter 163, the measure of just compensation is the fair market value of the property taken. See <em>Columbia Gas Transm. Corp. v. An Exclusive Natural Gas Storage Easement </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 463, 464, 620 N.E.2d 48, 49. The fair market value of property is the price on which a willing seller and a willing buyer would settle in a voluntary sale. The determination of the fair market value of appropriated property must be made upon consideration of \u201cwhat it is worth generally for any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>and all uses for which it might be suitable, including the most valuable uses to which it can reasonably and practically be adapted.\u201d <em>Sowers v. Schaeffer </em>(1951), 155 Ohio St. 454, 44 O.O. 419, 99 N.E.2d 313, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The property that the city sought to appropriate is located at the foot of the Clay Wade Bailey Bridge, which spans the Ohio River between downtown Cincinnati and Covington, Kentucky. At the time of its taking, the property consisted of a two-hundred-space paved surface parking lot and a canopied building that had served, in an earlier incarnation, as the office for a gas station. The Bankses operated on the premises a parking lot, a U-Haul rental business, a convenience store, and a lottery sales outlet.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The Bankses presented at trial expert opinion testimony to the property\u2019s fair market value by two experts. Allen Nagler was a real estate broker with fifty years of experience and a specialty in commercial real estate in downtown Cincinnati. He had, over the years, served as a consultant and expert witness for private entities and for the city in its acquisition of property by eminent domain. Nagler concluded that the fair market value of the property, as of February 13, 1999, the date of the property\u2019s taking, was $6,280,000, based upon the specialized knowledge that he had garnered from his experience in downtown real estate transactions, his observation of the property, and his consideration of market data from approximately two hundred arm\u2019s-length real estate transactions in which he had participated.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">M. Robert Garfield was also a real estate broker, with forty-five years of experience and a specialty in downtown real estate, including property along the city\u2019s riverfront. Garfield estimated the property\u2019s fair market value at $10 million. In contrast to Nagler, Garfield found no comparable arm\u2019s-length transactions. He instead based his opinion on his observation of the property\u2019s \u201cunique\u201d location \u201cbetween two half-billion dollar properties,\u201d <em>viz., </em>the then nearly completed Paul Brown Stadium and the certain-to-be-expanded Cincinnati Convention Center; on his determination that retail or commercial development would prove to be the property\u2019s \u201chighest and best use\u201d; and on an \u201ceducated gut feeling\u201d gained from forty-five years\u2019 experience in downtown real estate transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">The city had sought, through a pretrial motion <em>in limine, </em>to preclude testimony by Garfield to the property\u2019s fair market value. The trial court, following a hearing, \u201coverruled\u201d the motion. At trial, the city objected to Nagler\u2019s opinion testimony about the property\u2019s fair market value on the ground that it lacked a proper foundation. The trial court overruled the objection. The court also admitted Garfield\u2019s opinion on the property\u2019s fair market value, despite the city\u2019s objection and its subsequent motion to strike the witness\u2019s testimony on the ground that Garfield had employed an \u201cunacceptable methodology.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>We note at the outset that the rules and statutes governing procedure and evidence make no provision for a \u201cmotion <em>in limine.\u201d </em>A trial court may, however, be seen to derive its authority to consider such a motion from Evid.R. 611(A), which authorizes the court to control the presentation of evidence at trial. See <em>State v. Lundy </em>(1987), 41 Ohio App.3d 163, 165, 535 N.E.2d 664, 668. A motion <em>in limine </em>is, in essence, a pretrial request for a tentative ruling cautioning the nonmoving party to avoid \u201creferring to or offering evidence on matters so highly prejudicial to [the] moving party that curative instructions cannot prevent [a] predispositional effect on [the] jury.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6 Ed.1990) 1013 (quoted in <em>State v. French </em>[1995], 72 Ohio St.3d 446, 449, 650 N.E.2d 887, 890). The trial court need not rule upon the motion, and regardless of the court\u2019s disposition of the motion, error in the ultimate admission of the challenged evidence must be preserved by objection when the matter is broached at trial. In the absence of a timely objection, any error in the admission of the evidence is waived unless it rises to the level of plain error. See <em>State v. Brown </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 305, 528 N.E.2d 523, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">On appeal, the city contends that the opinions of Garfield and Nagler on the property\u2019s fair market value were inadmissible at trial, when they were not based upon any of the three \u201crecognized methods of appraising real property for its fair market value\u201d prescribed by the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (\u201cUSPAP\u201d). To the contrary, neither statutory nor case law restricts expert opinion testimony on the fair market value of appropriated property to those opinions founded upon the methods prescribed by the USPAP. Rather, \u201c \u2018in determining the amount of compensation, or the market value of the property taken, each case must be considered in the light of its own facts, and every element that can fairly enter into the question of value, and which an ordinarily prudent business [person] would consider before forming [his] judgment in making a purchase, should be considered.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sowers, supra, </em>at 459, 99 N.E.2d at 317 (quoting 29 Corpus Juris Secundum 971, Section 136).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Under R.C. Chapter 163, the \u201cassessment of compensation\u201d is a matter for the jury. See R.C. 163.09. Evid.R. 702 and 704 permit expert opinion testimony on the ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact under the following conditions: First, the testimony must \u201crelat[e] to matters beyond the knowledge or experience possessed by lay persons,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>it must aid the trier of fact in drawing the proper inferences from the evidence; second, \u201cthe witness [must be] qualified as an expert by specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony,\u201d and third, the testimony must be \u201creliable.\u201d Evid.R. 702(A) through 702(C). In general, the test for reliability is whether the \u201ctestimony is based on reliable scientific, technical, or other specialized information.\u201d Evid.R. 702(C). But testimony that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>\u201creports the result of a procedure, test, or experiment * * * is reliable only if\u2019 the procedure, test or experiment (1) is based on a theory that is either \u201cobjectively verifiable\u201d or \u201cvalidly derived from widely accepted knowledge, facts or principles,\u201d (2) is \u201cdesigned to] * * * reliably implement] the theory,\u201d and (3) \u201cwas conducted in a way that will yield an accurate result.\u201d Evid.R. 702(C)(1) through 702(C)(3). An expert must base his opinion, in whole or in major part, on \u201cfacts or data * * * perceived by him or admitted in evidence\u201d at trial, and he must disclose \u201cthe underlying facts or data\u201d before rendering his opinion. Evid.R. 703 and 705; see, also, <em>State v. Solomon </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 124, 570 N.E.2d 1118, syllabus (in which the Ohio Supreme Court relaxed the foundational requirement of Evid.R. 703). The decision to admit expert opinion testimony is discretionary with the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal unless the court abuses its discretion. See <em>Wightman v. Consol. Rail Corp. </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 431, 437, 715 N.E.2d 546, 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Garfield and Nagler, by virtue of their \u201cexperience\u201d with and \u201cspecialized knowledge\u201d concerning the market for downtown real estate, must be said to have been qualified to render an expert opinion on the fair market value of Banks\u2019s property. The property\u2019s fair market value was unquestionably a matter beyond the scope of the knowledge and experience of a layperson; therefore, expert opinion testimony to the property\u2019s fair market value was helpful to the jury in assessing the compensation due Banks upon the property\u2019s appropriation. Moreover, the testimony of each expert was preceded by disclosure of, and was based upon firsthand knowledge of, the facts and data underlying his testimony. Finally, the testimony did not \u201crepor[t] the result of a procedure, test, or experiment,\u201d but was instead based upon \u201cspecialized information\u201d garnered from years of experience in downtown real estate, and each expert presented testimony that would permit a conclusion that that \u201cspecialized information\u201d was \u201creliable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">We, therefore, hold that the admission of expert opinion testimony by Garfield and Nagler did not constitute an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we overrule the first and second assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">We address next the fourth assignment of error, in which the city challenges the denial of its motion for a new trial. Specifically, the city argues that the trial court abused the discretion conferred under Civ.R. 59(A)(1) to grant a new trial when the court had improperly admitted into evidence at trial testimony to profits from the businesses operated by Banks and her husband on the property. This challenge is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Prior to trial, the city filed a motion <em>in limine </em>seeking an order to exclude evidence concerning \u201cprofits or net operating income of the [Bankses\u2019] business[es].\u201d The city argued in support of its motion that the admission of evidence of lost future profits from the businesses operated on the appropriated property would \u201cundu[ly]. prejudice\u201d the city, when such profits were \u201ctoo speculative and uncertain in character\u201d to provide a basis for evaluating the property\u2019s fair market value. The trial court, by entry, \u201csustained\u201d the motion and ordered that \u201cevidence of profits and net operating income of any business on the property in question be excluded from the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Despite the court\u2019s order, and often over the city\u2019s objections, testimony concerning the nature and profitability of the business ventures pursued on Banks\u2019s property was volunteered, elicited, and admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">During the defense\u2019s case-in-chief, the trial court sustained the city\u2019s objection to, and instructed the jury to disregard, testimony by a defense expert witness that the Bankses had \u201cnetted about $100,000 a year on lottery tickets.\u201d Yet, the court permitted, over the city\u2019s objections, testimony to the relative success of the Bankses\u2019 lottery sales outlet and testimony by Banks that the \u201cpretty much maintenance free\u201d building on the property had yielded a \u201creal easy income stream * *</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The city, in its case-in-chief, presented expert opinion testimony by certified real estate appraisers Raymond Jackson and Gary Wright and \u201cparking expert\u201d John Lawrence Donoghue. Jackson and Wright \u201cappraised\u201d Banks\u2019s property at $735,000 and $744,000, respectively, using the methods prescribed by the USPAP. Pursuant to the USPAP, the appraisers estimated the property\u2019s fair market value, first, by gathering market data; then, by analyzing the data to determine the subject property\u2019s \u201chighest and best use\u201d; and finally, by applying one or more of the three \u201ctraditional approaches to value,\u201d <em>viz., </em>the \u201csales comparison\u201d approach, the \u201ccost\u201d approach, or the \u201cincome\u201d approach. Donoghue, who was not a certified appraiser, conducted a \u201cfeasibility study\u201d and concluded, upon application of the \u201ctraditional income approach,\u201d that the property had a fair market value of $701,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Jackson testified that the objective of an appraiser in applying the highest-and-best-use analysis was to determine, \u201cif [one were] to build today, what would be the ideal thing to build[,] * * * what [would] render an owner the highest net return.\u201d This determination, according to Wright, was to be made upon consideration of those uses that were \u201c[legally] permissible,\u201d \u201cphysically possible,\u201d \u201cfinancially feasible,\u201d and \u201cmaxim[ally] productive * * * [f]rom a profitability standpoint.\u201d Jackson and Wright each concluded that the highest and best use of Banks\u2019s property was as a surface parking lot, and Donoghue, in preparing his feasibility study, accepted that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Then, proceeding on the assumption of the property\u2019s highest and best use as a parking lot, the appraisers estimated the property\u2019s fair market value under one or more of the three \u201ctraditional approaches to value.\u201d Jackson testified that, in using the cost approach to value improvements to the property, he gave no consideration to the \u201centrepreneurial profits\u201d that might be derived from those improvements. In contrast, the income approach required an inquiry into the property\u2019s income-producing potential. Thus, Jackson, Wright and Donoghue each testified that, in employing the income approach, he, first, estimated the potential gross annual income of the property by multiplying the number of parking spaces that the property could accommodate by the estimated \u201cincome potential\u201d of each space<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; he then estimated the property\u2019s \u201cnet operating income\u201d by subtracting from gross income the estimated expenses of operating the parking lot; and he, finally, capitalized the net income to arrive at an estimate of the property\u2019s value as \u201cinvestment\u201d or \u201cincome-producing\u201d property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">On cross-examination of the city\u2019s experts, the trial court alternately overruled and sustained defense counsel\u2019s inquiries into whether the opinions expressed by the city\u2019s expert witnesses were formed upon consideration of the fact that the Bankses\u2019 lottery sales outlet was the \u201clargest\u201d or \u201cbusiest\u201d in the state. The court also initially sustained the city\u2019s objections to defense counsel\u2019s inquiries into whether the city\u2019s experts had considered the \u201csales,\u201d \u201crevenue,\u201d or \u201cvolume\u201d generated by the Bankses\u2019 lottery business. But the court required the experts to respond to counsel\u2019s queries when they directly targeted the experts\u2019 opinions as to the property\u2019s highest and best use.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Finally, in the Bankses\u2019 case in rebuttal, the trial court precluded testimony by defense expert Garfield to the income generated per parking space by the Bankses\u2019 parking operation. And while the court permitted the Bankses\u2019 accountant to testify, over the city\u2019s objection, that the property was \u201cuniquely\u201d situated for the sale of lottery tickets, the court excluded the accountant\u2019s testimony to the \u201clucrative\u201d nature of the lottery business and to the property\u2019s \u201cbest use\u201d as a lottery sales outlet.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">In its post-trial motion, the city sought a new trial under Civ.R. 59(A)(1), 59(A)(2), 59(A)(4), 59(A)(6) and 59(A)(9). Its challenge on appeal, however, focuses on the trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion in admitting, over objection, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>and in the face of its order on the motion <em>in limine, </em>testimony concerning the profitability of the Bankses\u2019 lottery sales operation. Civ.R. 59(A)(1) permits a court to grant a new trial on the basis of an \u201cabuse of discretion, by which an aggrieved party was prevented from having a fair trial.\u201d The disposition of a motion for a new trial based on Civ.R. 59(A)(1) is discretionary with the trial court and will be reversed on appeal only if the record demonstrates that the court abused its discretion. See <em>Rohde v. Farmer </em>(1970), 23 Ohio St.2d 82, 52 O.O.2d 376, 262 N.E.2d 685, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The city predicates its challenge to the admissibility of evidence of lottery profits or net operating income on the \u201cbusiness losses\u201d rule. See Oswald, Goodwill and Going Concern Value: Emerging Factors in the Just Compensation Equation (1991), 32 B.C.L.Rev. 283. The business-losses rule is a judicial construct that holds that the owner of appropriated property may not be compensated for the loss of future profits from any commercial enterprise on the property. See <em>Preston v. Stover Leslie Flying Serv., Inc. </em>(1963), 174 Ohio St. 441, 23 O.O.2d 100, 190 N.E.2d 446, paragraph five of the syllabus; <em>Sowers v. Schaeffer, supra, </em>at 459, 44 O.O. at 421-422, 99 N.E.2d at 317. The theory underlying the application of the rule by Ohio courts to deny compensation for lost future profits is that commercial profits \u201cdepen[d] * * * upon the acumen and skill of the one who carries on the business,\u201d <em>Sowers v. Schaeffer, supra, </em>at 459, 44 O.O. at 421, 99 N.E.2d at 317, and thus the \u201c[l]oss of future profits * * * is too speculative and uncertain for an accurate and satisfactory measurement of the [appropriated property\u2019s] present value * * *.\u201d <em>Preston, supra, </em>paragraph five of the syllabus. The rule has, in turn, provided a basis for the exclusion from appropriation proceedings of evidence of lost future profits on the ground that such profits are not relevant to a determination of the issue of just compensation or that the admission of such evidence might confuse the jury and lead to an improper award.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The business-losses rule does not, however, erect an insuperable barrier to compensation of the property owner for lost future profits. Rather, the rule requires the trial court to \u201clook to the evidence to determine whether it is of such a character as to take the determination of [lost future profits] out of the field of speculation.\u201d Thus, compensation for lost future profits may be permitted if such profits can be \u201cproved with reasonable exactitude.\u201d <em>Preston, supra, </em>at 447, 190 N.E.2d at 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Nor does the rule, as the city would have it, compel the exclusion of any and all evidence of profits or income generated by a business operated on appropriated property. It is axiomatic that evidence that is inadmissible for one purpose may be admissible for another purpose. Thus, in <em>Sowers v. Schaeffer, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number><em>supra, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court acknowledged that, \u201c[a]s a rule, profits from commercial businesses on [appropriated] premises can not be shown.\u201d The court noted, however, that an estimation of the value of appropriated property necessarily entails an inquiry into \u201cits best and most valuable uses.\u201d The court thus held that testimony to income from the rental of summer dwellings on appropriated property was admissible \u201cto show the kinds of businesses to which the premises [were] adaptable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 458-459, 44 O.O. at 421-422, 99 N.E.2d at 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Evidence of lost future profits has also been held to be admissible for the limited purpose of rebuttal or impeachment, provided that the jury has been properly instructed as to the evidence\u2019s limited admissibility. See <em>Dorsey v. Donohoo </em>(1992), 83 Ohio App.3d 415, 615 N.E.2d 239 (holding that testimony by the owner\u2019s expert to the value of trees on appropriated property was properly admitted to rebut or impeach testimony by the appropriating agency\u2019s expert that the trees had no value in terms of their effect on the property\u2019s market value).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Finally, evidence of business profits and income has been admitted when unique circumstances have effectively eliminated the concerns inherent in the business-losses rule\u2019s theoretical underpinnings. Notably, in <em>Wray v. Hart </em>(Aug. 13, 1992), Lawrence App. No. 91AC20, unreported, 1992 WL 208900, a case that bears striking similarities to the case before us, the Ohio Department of Transportation sought to appropriate property located at the foot of a bridge spanning the Ohio River between Ohio and West Virginia. Witnesses for the property owners testified, over the department\u2019s objections, to the business income generated by a service station and lottery sales outlet operated on the property, and they attributed the relative success of those operations to the unique location of the property, which drew automobile traffic from Ohio, West Virginia, and Kentucky. The owners also adduced expert opinion testimony from a witness who testified, over objection, that, in applying the income method of appraisal, he considered income generated by the owners\u2019 businesses to arrive at a net income figure for capitalization. The Court of Appeals for Lawrence County held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence concerning the owners\u2019 business income. In so holding, the court determined that \u201cthe traditional grounds for excluding such evidence did not mandate exclusion\u201d in this instance, when the record showed that the property\u2019s value lay in the businesses\u2019 profitability, which was, in turn, attributable to the property\u2019s unique location, \u201crather than any particular skill, acumen, or management [abilities] possessed by [the property\u2019s owners].\u201d Further, the court determined that, although the owners\u2019 expert had erroneously used gross business income, evidence of net business income provides an appropriate fundament for expert appraisal testimony using the income approach, because the income approach assesses \u201cthe present worth of the future potential benefits of a property,\u201d which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>\u201cis measured by the \u2018net income\u2019 [that] a fully informed person is warranted in assuming that the property will produce during its remaining useful life.\u201d <em>Wray, supra </em>(citing Nichols, The Law of Eminent Domain [3 Ed.1991] 4-59, Section 4.05).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">In the proceedings below, and here on appeal, the grounds advanced by the city for the exclusion of evidence of lottery profits and income were, and are, essentially those specified in Evid.R. 402 and 403(A). Evid.R. 402 provides, generally, that \u201crelevant evidence is admissible\u201d and \u201c[e]vidence [that] is not relevant is. not admissible.\u201d Evid.R. 403(A) mandates the exclusion of relevant evidence when \u201cits probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.\u201d Although the terms of Evid.R. 402 and 403(A) are mandatory, a trial court is vested with broad discretion in determining whether evidence is \u201crelevant\u201d or whether the adverse effects of relevant evidence \u201csubstantially outweig[h]\u201d its probative value. A reviewing court is, therefore, limited to a determination of whether the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the disputed evidence. See <em>Rigby v. Lake Cty. </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 269, 271, 569 N.E.2d 1056, 1058 (Evid.R. 401 and 402); <em>Krischbaum v. Dillon </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 58, 66, 567 N.E.2d 1291, 1299 (Evid.R.403[A]).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Evid.R. 401 defines \u201c[Relevant evidence\u201d as \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Here, as in <em>Wray v. Hart, supra, </em>the evidence adduced at trial showed that the property\u2019s value resided principally in the profitability of the commercial ventures undertaken there, and that the businesses\u2019 profitability was attributable to the property\u2019s unique location, rather than to the business acumen of its owners. Upon that evidence, the trial court might reasonably have concluded that the theoretical justifications for denying compensation for lost future profits were inapt, and that the business-losses rule should not provide a basis either for the denial of such compensation or for the exclusion of evidence. But the record reflects a fairly consistent, if not scrupulous, effort on the part of the trial court throughout the trial to exclude evidence of lottery income and profits and to convey to the jury through admonitions that such evidence should be disregarded. Moreover, before submitting the matter, the court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">\u201cThere was testimony in the case concerning the business of the lottery sales on the property in question. You may not consider this business in arriving at the fair market value of * * * Banks\u2019[s] property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>\u201cIn other words, gross income and profits of a business on property being appropriated are not proper measures for determining the fair market value of the property being appropriated, as in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Thus, the court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, admonitions, and instructions suggest that the court considered the business-losses rule to be fully operational. Consequently, evidence of lottery income and profits, if offered in support of an award of compensation for lost future profits, was inadmissible because it was not \u201crelevant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Nevertheless, as the trial progressed, evidence of lottery income and profits did prove to be relevant to the computation of compensation. As we noted <em>supra, </em>the measure of the value of appropriated property is its fair market value, and the determination of fair market value must be made upon consideration of \u201cwhat [the property] is worth generally for any and all uses for which it might be suitable, including the most valuable uses to which it can reasonably and practically be adapted.\u201d <em>Sowers v. Schaeffer, supra, </em>paragraph three of the syllabus. The opinions of the city\u2019s experts on the fair market value of Banks\u2019s property embodied this principle when each estimate of value proceeded from an initial determination of the property\u2019s \u201chighest and best use.\u201d Thus, the highest and best use of Banks\u2019s property was a \u201cfact that [was] of consequence to the determination of the action.\u201d Evidence of the lottery income and profits generated on the property tended- to controvert, and thus \u201cmake * * * less probable,\u201d the conclusions of the city\u2019s experts that the property\u2019s \u201chighest and best use\u201d was solely as a surface parking lot and tended to \u201cmake * * * more probable\u201d the contrary conclusion that the property\u2019s highest and best use was a mixed use that would include a lottery sales outlet. Accordingly, evidence of lottery income and profits was relevant and thereby presumptively admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Moreover, Evid.R. 616, which prescribes the methods of impeachment, provides an additional basis for admissibility. To the extent that evidence of lottery income and profits was relevant to, yet directly controverted the testimony of the city\u2019s experts concerning, the property\u2019s highest and best use, the evidence provided \u201c[f]acts contradicting [those] witnesses\u2019] testimony.\u201d As such, the evidence was admissible for the \u201cpurpose of impeaching [those] witnesses\u2019] testimony.\u201d Evid.R. 616(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">Despite its relevance, evidence of lottery income and profits was subject to exclusion in the proceedings below, if \u201cits probative value [was] substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.\u201d Evid.R. 403(A). As we noted <em>supra, </em>the trial court was somewhat erratic in excluding evidence of lottery income and profits, but regularly admonished and ultimately instructed the jury that the owner of appropriated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>property could not be compensated for lost future profits. The court\u2019s admonitions and instructions were designed to guide the jury in fashioning a proper compensation award. We must presume that the jury, in determining compensation, heeded them. See <em>Pang v. Minch </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 186, 559 N.E.2d 1313, paragraph four of the syllabus. Thus, the trial court might reasonably have concluded that the probative value of the disputed evidence, which was considerable, was not \u201csubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">We, therefore, hold that the trial court, to the extent that it admitted evidence of lottery income and profits and then declined to grant a new trial on that basis, did not abuse its discretion. Accordingly, we overrule the fourth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">In its third assignment of error, the city contends that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting into evidence a defense exhibit showing downtown properties acquired by or under the threat of eminent domain. This contention is equally untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">During direct examination of Christopher Banks, the defense presented its Exhibit 2. The witness identified the exhibit as a map of downtown Cincinnati that depicted the vast number of downtown properties taken either by or under the threat of eminent domain. The city objected, and the witness was examined on voir dire. Based upon the witness\u2019s testimony on voir dire that he had personally researched \u201csome,\u201d but not all, of the properties depicted, the city sought exclusion of the exhibit on the ground that it was comprised of inadmissible hearsay. The court suspended its ruling on the exhibit\u2019s admissibility until it was offered into evidence. The defense subsequently elicited from a city engineer testimony regarding various inaccuracies in the information conveyed by the exhibit. Then, at the close of the defense\u2019s case-in-chief and over the city\u2019s objection, the trial court admitted the exhibit into evidence as modified by the corrections proposed by the engineer.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">In an appropriation proceeding, compensation paid for other properties taken by eminent domain cannot provide a comparable basis for valuing the property to be appropriated. Exhibit 2 did not show the compensation paid for other properties taken by eminent domain. It was, however, a portrayal of the vast extent of governmental takings in the area surrounding Banks\u2019s property. As such, the exhibit was probative of, and thus relevant to show, the dearth of arm\u2019s-length transactions involving comparable properties upon which an expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>might predicate his application of one of the \u201ctraditional\u201d approaches to determining the fair market value of property. See Evid.R. 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The information conveyed by the exhibit was assembled by Christopher Banks, who attested to that fact at trial. Thus, the exhibit did not present a multiple-hearsay problem. See Evid.R. 801(C) and 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The information was derived, however, from out-of-court \u201cstatement^]\u201d that Christopher Banks gleaned either from county property records or from his communications with individuals who did not testify at trial. The information was \u201coffered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Therefore, the exhibit was, as the city contended, comprised of \u201chearsay.\u201d See Evid.R. 801(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Hearsay is not admissible in evidence at trial, except as provided by state or federal Constitution or by statute or rule. See Evid.R. 802. The information conveyed by Exhibit 2, to the extent that it was derived from the research of county records personally conducted by Christopher Banks, was admissible under the public-records exception to the hearsay rule. See Evid.R. 803(8). But to the extent that the information was derived from Christopher Banks\u2019s communications with individuals who did not testify at trial, it was not subject to any exception to the hearsay rule and was thus inadmissible at trial. See Evid.R. 801(C) and 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Error in the admission of evidence will provide a basis for reversal on appeal only upon some demonstration that its admission \u201caffect[ed a] substantial righ[t]\u201d or was \u201cinconsistent with substantial justice.\u201d Civ.R. 61. Such error is harmless if it can be said that, in the absence of the error, the \u201ctrier of the facts would probably have made the same decision.\u201d <em>Hallworth v. Republic Steel Corp. </em>(1950), 153 Ohio St. 349, 41 O.O. 341, 91 N.E.2d 690, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">In the proceedings below, defense expert Garfield testified that, in arriving at his opinion of the fair market value of Banks\u2019s property, he did not consider comparable sales, because the only property transfers that he had found involving what he considered to be comparable properties resulted not from arm\u2019s-length negotiations but from the government\u2019s exercise of its power of eminent domain. The defense thus presented through Garfield admissible evidence concerning the matter that it had sought to demonstrate through Exhibit 2. For that reason, we are persuaded that, even if the trial court had excluded Exhibit 2, the jury would likely have arrived at the same verdict. We, therefore, hold that the trial court\u2019s error in admitting Exhibit 2 was harmless, and we, accordingly, overrule the third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The city contends, in its fifth assignment of error, that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting opinion testimony by Cheryl Banks to the fair market value of her property. We find no merit to this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Banks testified at trial that her property had a fair market value of $13,922,000. To arrive at her opinion of the property\u2019s fair market value, Banks separately valued the land and the building. She valued the land at \u201c$11.44 [million]\u201d by multiplying the property\u2019s square footage by the price per square foot paid in 1990 for real estate located three to five blocks from her property. She valued the building at \u201capproximately $2.44 [million]\u201d upon consideration of the \u201creal easy income stream that came through [a] building that was really pretty much maintenance free * *</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The city objected to Banks\u2019s testimony concerning the building\u2019s value on the ground that it was improperly based on the building\u2019s \u201cincome stream.\u201d The trial court permitted the testimony. The city also moved to strike Banks\u2019s testimony on the ground that she was not qualified to render an opinion on the property\u2019s fair market value. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Evid.R. 701 permits a lay witness to testify in the form of an opinion if the opinion is \u201crationally based on the perception of the witness\u201d and is \u201chelpful to a clear understanding of his testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.\u201d The Staff Note to the rule states that \u201c[t]he rule is in accordance with Ohio law as it ha[d] developed prior to the adoption of the Rules of Evidence.\u201d Ohio courts have long recognized what has come to be known as the \u201cowner-opinion rule.\u201d Under the owner-opinion rule, an owner of real property, by virtue of his ownership and without qualification as an expert, is competent to testify to his property\u2019s fair market value. See <em>Tokles &amp; Son, Inc. v. Midwestern Indemn. Co. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 621, 605 N.E.2d 936, paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>Smith v. Padgett </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 344, 347, 513 N.E.2d 737, 740. The rule is based on the presumption that \u201cthe owner of real estate * * * possesses] sufficient acquaintance with it to estimate the value of the property, and his estimate is therefore received although his knowledge on the subject is not such as would qualify him to testify if he were not the owner.\u201d <em>Smith, supra, </em>at 347, 513 N.E.2d at 740 (citing <em>Morris v. Huber </em>[1933], 15 Ohio Law Abs. 71, 73, 1933 WL 1474); see, also, <em>Tokles &amp; Son, Inc., supra, </em>paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">The city concedes that the owner-opinion rule permitted Banks to express an opinion on the fair market value of her property. The city contends, however, that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting her testimony, when her opinion of the value of the building was improperly based upon lost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>future profits, and when her opinion of the value of the land was shown by cross-examination to be based on property that was not comparable.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Banks, in testifying to her approach to valuing the building, did not specify in monetary terms either the \u201cincome stream\u201d generated by or the maintenance costs associated with her building. On the record before us, we are unable to discern how Banks translated the building\u2019s \u201cincome stream\u201d and maintenance costs into a fair market value for the building of $2,878,000. Consequently, the record does not support the city\u2019s contention that Banks improperly based her opinion of the building\u2019s fair market value on lost future profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\"> Equally feckless is the city\u2019s contention that Banks\u2019s opinion on the land\u2019s value was subject to exclusion because it was improperly predicated on noncomparable property. The weight to be accorded the owner\u2019s opinion concerning his property\u2019s value is a matter to be determined by the trier of fact. See <em>Smith, supra, </em>at 348, 513 N.E.2d at 741 (citing <em>Bishop v. E. Ohio Gas Co. </em>[1944], 143 Ohio St. 541, 546, 28 O.O. 470, 472, 56 N.E.2d 164, 166); accord <em>Wurzelbacher v. Colerain Twp. Bd. </em>(1995), 105 Ohio App.3d 97, 100, 663 N.E.2d 713, 715. Evidence elicited on cross-examination suggesting the noncomparable nature of the property upon which Banks based her opinion might have functioned to undermine her credibility but it did not provide a basis for the exclusion of her opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">We hold that the trial court properly permitted Banks to offer opinion testimony concerning the value of her property, leaving the jury free to accord whatever weight it wished to her opinion. Therefore, we overrule the fifth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">In its sixth and final assignment of error, the city contends that the trial court abused its discretion by permitting defense counsel, in closing argument, to refer to the business income generated by Banks\u2019s property and to disparage the integrity of the city\u2019s experts. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">Defense counsel opened his closing argument with the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-11\">\u201cAs I was sitting through this trial, I was impressed by the great emphasis placed by the city on the notion of a member of the appraisal institute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-12\">\u201cThere are jokes about what those initials mean \u2014 MAI\u2014but I won\u2019t get into that. But from what I saw in this case, MAI seems to be a systematic approach, but it systematically seems to hide the reality of this case * * * the so-called MAI systematic approach seems to hide the common sense of the situation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-13\">The city offered no objection to these remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Counsel then proceeded to a discussion of the position taken by each of the city\u2019s expert witnesses that a surface parking lot represented the property\u2019s highest and best use. In the course of this discussion, counsel directed the jury\u2019s attention to testimony concerning the \u201ceconomic productivity\u201d of the businesses that the Bankses had operated on the property and the property\u2019s status as the \u201ctop lottery sales outlet [or] * * * location in the state.\u201d The trial court overruled the city\u2019s objection to these and subsequent references by counsel to the property\u2019s \u201ceconomic productivity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Continuing in that vein, and in the context of commenting upon the city\u2019s challenges at trial to the educational qualifications of the defense\u2019s experts, counsel offered the following remarks relative to testimony elicited on cross-examination of the city\u2019s experts that revealed similarities between the experts\u2019 reports, which, counsel suggested, were more than merely coincidental:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">\u201cYou know, it\u2019s a strange thing, even with their college degrees and their MAI designations, both Jackson and Wright made the same mistake.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">\" * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">\u201cNow how could two college-educated MAIs come up with exactly the same wrong address for a piece of real estate, unless there was some kind of special collaboration between them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-9\">\u201cMaybe they were sharing information; maybe they got the information from the city. No one will know. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-10\">\u201cThey both made the same assumption, highest and best use parking, and they both chose to ignore the actual use, which was a mixture of compatible uses that included, among other things, parking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-11\">\u201cMr. Donoghue didn\u2019t even have an opinion about highest and best use. He just accepted what Jackson and Wright told him. * * * all three of them used the wrong rates for the spaces * * *. They all made assumptions about vacancy rates, and the facts are there were no vacancies here. There was a waiting list, yet, they\u2019re asking that you, ladies and gentlemen, ignore common sense, including the common sense that people pay money for the best lottery location in the State of Ohio.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">The city again offered no objection, either to these remarks or to defense counsel\u2019s subsequent statement that, \u201cunlike the city\u2019s appraisers, who were collaborating well enough to make the same mistakes in the same way, there was no indication, no fact from which one can infer collaboration between [defense experts] Nagler and Garfield.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-13\">Finally, on rebuttal to the city\u2019s closing argument, and again without objection by the city, counsel remarked as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>\u201cI do think that Mr. Wright and Jackson are qualified to render opinions, * * * [b]ut, as I said earlier, there\u2019s a joke about MAIs, and frankly this case illustrates that MAI stands for Made As Instructed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">A trial court must afford counsel \u201c[g]reat latitude * * * in the presentation of closing argument[s] to the jury.\u201d <em>Pang v. Minch, supra, </em>paragraph two of the syllabus. Improprieties in closing argument will not provide a basis for reversal on appeal, unless the improprieties were met with timely objections or can be said to have constituted a \u201cgros[s] and persisten[t] abuse [of counsel\u2019s] privilege.\u201d <em>Snyder v. Stanford </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St.2d 31, 44 O.O.2d 18, 238 N.E.2d 563, paragraph one of the syllabus; accord <em>Norwood v. Forest Converting Co. </em>(1984), 16 Ohio App.3d 411, 16 OBR 481, 476 N.E.2d 695. \u201cThe assessment of whether the permissible bounds of closing argument have been exceeded is, in the first instance, a discretionary function to be performed by the trial court,\u201d and the trial court\u2019s assessment will not be disturbed on appeal, unless it is shown to constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>Pang, supra, </em>paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The city preserved with timely objections its appellate challenge to the references by defense counsel in his closing argument to the subject property\u2019s \u201ceconomic productivity.\u201d But, as we determined <em>supra, </em>testimony to that effect was admissible and was properly admitted in the proceedings below on the material issue of the property\u2019s highest and best use. Offered in that context, defense counsel\u2019s comments were appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">The city offered no objection to the various remarks of defense counsel in closing argument that, the city now asserts, disparaged the integrity of its experts. We conclude, for the following reasons, that the city failed to preserve for appeal its challenge to counsel\u2019s allegedly disparaging remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">The challenged remarks were made during defense counsel\u2019s summation at the close of a trial in which the sole issue was the fair market value of the property to be appropriated. The trial disclosed a vast difference between the value estimates of the city\u2019s experts and the value estimates of the defense experts. That difference might reasonably be traced to the conclusions drawn by the respective experts regarding the property\u2019s highest and best use. During the trial, through direct and cross-examination of witnesses, each party sought to probe the reasons for the experts\u2019 varying conclusions regarding the property\u2019s highest and best use. The city did so by questioning the qualifications of the defense\u2019s experts, and the defense did so by questioning the objectivity of the city\u2019s experts. In so doing, each party employed a legitimate approach to challenging the credibility of expert opinion testimony. See Evid.R. 702 and 616(A). Thus, with one possible exception, the allegedly disparaging remarks of counsel in closing argument, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>when viewed in the context in which they were offered, constituted fair comment on the evidence adduced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">With his allusion in his closing argument to the \u201cjok[e] about what those initials [MAI] mean\u201d and his delivery on rebuttal of the punch line \u201cMade As Instructed,\u201d defense counsel might well have crossed the line between fair and disparaging comment. But that one remark can hardly be characterized as a \u201cgros[s] and persisten[t] abuse [of counsel\u2019s] privilege.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">We, therefore, hold that the trial court, in the latitude that it afforded defense counsel in closing argument, did not abuse its discretion. Accordingly, we overrule the sixth and final assignment of error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b331-8\">Gorman, P.J., and Painter, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b331-9\">Raymond E.

Jackson's testimony relative to the income approach prompted an objection by defense counsel. The trial court overruled the objection following an unreported sidebar.
