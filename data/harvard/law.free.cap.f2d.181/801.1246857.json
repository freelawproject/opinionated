The Board is given the power to conduct elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-19\">The Board took jurisdiction over the dispute in question and conducted an election wherein, out of 183 employees eligible to vote, only 86 did so. 17 of these ballots were void. The remaining 69 were in favor of the appellant. Whereupon the ap-pellee indicated its intention to dismiss the appellant\u2019s application for certification in accordance with a Board policy of many years standing to decline to certify a representative where less than a majority of the eligible voters participated by casting valid ballots. However, due to the fact that this practice was challenged in this and three other pending cases, the Board requested an opinion of the Attorney General. The Attorney General opined that the Board had <em>the power </em>to certify a representative which receives a majority of the votes cast despite the fact that less than a majority of those eligible voted. But, he went on to say, though the Board has the power, it need not exercise it automatically. <em>It is a discretionary function. </em>On the strength of this opinion and the investigation, the Board refused certification to the appellant dismissing its application. The appellant, thereupon, instituted this action on the ground that the Board\u2019s action was arbitrary, capricious, contrary to law and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>violative of rights guaranteed by the terms of the Act, praying that the order of dismissal be set aside and that the appellee be directed to certify the appellant. The court below, however, granted appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss, and, from the order granting that motion, this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">We find no error in that court\u2019s order. The right of representation for the .majority was created by Congress under this Act. Congress, however, also decided, as it had the power to do, upon the method for the protection of this right which it had created. The method provided was the administrative determination by the Board, and when the administrative finding is made the dispute has reached its last terminal point.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Congress chose not to confer any judicial remedies in a case such as this.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The duty of the Board is one of investigation and certification of the designated and. authorized representative whenever, in tile case of a dispute, one of the parties thereto so requests. The question of whether or not a given claimant is the designated representative must be based on investigation, and in the matter of investigation the Board\u2019s actions are purely discretionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b857-20\">. 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 152.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b857-22\">.
