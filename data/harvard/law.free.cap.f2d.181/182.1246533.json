Forcheimer -and M. P. (Pete) Walinsky, from the judgment of the trial court, which denied their right to a trial by jury despite a demand therefor in compliance with Rule 38, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. We are of the opinion that the United States District Court had no jurisdiction as a Federal Court of the controversy presented to it by the plaintiffs, or by the counterclaim, and that the judgment must be set aside and the proceedings dismissed for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">The ground alleged for Federal jurisdiction is diversity of citizenship and more than $3,000 involved, hut the complaint itself discloses that one of the plaintiffs, Commercial Standard Insurance Company, is a Texas corporation and that one of the defendants, M. P. (Pete) Walinsky, is also a citizen of the State of Texas. There is no averment of citizenship in respect to the two remaining plaintiffs and the other defendant is alleged to be a citizen of the State of Missouri. The necessary complete diversity is clearly lacking. Strawbridge v. Curitiss, 3 Cranch 267, 2 L.Ed. 435; Raphael v. Trask, 194 U.S. 272, 24 S.Ct. 647, 48 L.Ed. 973.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">We accordingly reverse the judgment and direct that the proceedings in <em>the </em>United States District Court be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
