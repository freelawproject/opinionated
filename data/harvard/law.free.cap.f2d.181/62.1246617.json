After extended litigation,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>he was substantially though not wholly successful in his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-23\">This appeal is from a supplemental decree<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the district court awarding to Arenas\u2019 attorneys fees and expenses and securing the payment thereof by the impression of a lien upon the land inuring to his benefit as a result of the litigation. The appeal was taken by the United States on behalf of the Indian and by the Indian individually.</p>\n<p id=\"pA5h\">The claim of Arenas was assertable against the United States by virtue of the waiver of sovereign immunity to suit found in the Act of 1894, 28 Stat. 286, 305, as amended, 25 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 345.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-25\">The key question for decision in this appeal concerns the jurisdiction of the district court to declare a lien on property in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>the circumstances obtaining. The government argues that such declaration is in effect a judgment against the United States by which it has not consented to be bound and that it violates congressional intent as expressed in applicable enactments relating to Indian lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\">On the other hand it is contended by ap-pellees that the district court, having acquired the equity jurisdiction to hear and decide the case in which the United States is a party, may fully adjust the matter by providing for the payment of expenses and attorneys\u2019 fees through the impression of a lien on the land which it adjudges to be the Indian\u2019s allotment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A_N\">Under the General Allotment Act and related legislation,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Indian allot-tee receives what is called a \u201ctrust patent\u201d, The legal title to the allotted land is retained by the United States under the immediate supervision of the Secretary of the Interior. Whether the allotment has been made by the Secretary or by a judgment of the court, the Indian has an equitable estate in the allotted land with the right of occu pancy and the use of produce but withou the right of alienating or encumbering thland.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> United States v. Hellard, 1944, 321 U.S. 363, 64 S.Ct. 985, 88 L.Ed. 1326. Throughout the history of Indian legislation the Congress has been aware that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>inexperienced and uneducated Indian would be subject to imposition and would suffer from his own improvidence unless protected therefrom by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"Agf\">We come to the question: Does the equity jurisdiction of federal courts under the Act of 1894 invoke all equitable processes and hence permit the application of rules \u201c * * * which experience has shown to be essential to the adequate protection of a wronged <em>cestui que trust </em>* * * <em>? \u201d </em>United States v. Equitable Trust Co., 1931, 283 U.S. 738, 745, 51 S.Ct. 639, 641, 75 L.Ed. <em>1379.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The opinion in United States v. Equitable Trust Co., supra, is pointed to by appellee as decisive of the issue. We quote: \u201cCounsel for the United States concede the general rule [see footnote 4 ante], but regard it as inapplicable here. They assume that Barnett\u2019s fund was restricted in the sense that it was not subject to disposal in any form or for any purpose, save with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>approval of the Secretary of the Interior; and from this they argue that the court by charging the fund with the costs and expenses and requiring their payment therefrom would be disposing of a part of the fund in violation of applicable restrictions. We make the assumption that, the restrictions had substantially the same application to the fund that they had to the land from which it was derived, but we think the argument-carries them beyond their purpose and the fair import of their words. Without doubt they were intended to be comprehensive and to afford effective protection to the Indian allottees, but we find no ground for thinking they were intended to restrain courts of equity when dealing with situations like that disclosed in this litigation from applying the rules which experience has shown to be essential to the adequate protection of a wronged <em>cestui que trust </em>such as Barnett was shown to be. * * * When all is considered, we are brought to the conclusion that the United States by its intervention and participation in the suit, consented, impliedly at least, that reasonable allowances be made from the fund, under the rule before stated, for the services and expenses of the next friend and his attorneys.\u201d United States v. Equitable Trust Co., 1931, 283 U.S. 738, 744, 745, 746, 51 S. Ct. 639, 641, 75 L.Ed. 1379.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Appellant United States in the instant case makes practically the same argument as it made- in the Equitable case. That is, that the court cannot apply the general rule, to wit: That a court of equity may settle incidental questions as well as fundamental questions, because the applicable statutes in this case do not specifically authorize it. It is also argued that as to our case the applicable statute does not authorize the impression of a lien upon the property, because its foreclosure would have the effect of. disposing of a part of the property. But the Supreme Court rejected the argument by saying that it was intended that the restrictions on the allotted land, <em>which apply as \u2022well to produce from the land, </em>should afford protection to the allottee, rather than to restrict courts of equity from giving such protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Since the restrictions on the land and its produce are one and the same and since attorney fees and expenses necessary to protect the fund can be paid out of the fund, it follows that so much of the land as is necessary to satisfy the lien can be resorted to for these necessary expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The appellant\u2019s argument carried it to the cruelly farcical posture that the government must protect the- Indian by strictly preventing any diminution of the allotted land even though by exercising such protection the Indian without funds cannot have any part of his rightful allotment of land. \u201cIt must be remembered that the fundamental consideration is the protection of a dependent people.\u201d United States v. Pelican, 1914, 232 U.S. 442, 450, 34 S.Ct. 396, 399, 58 L.Ed. 676. And legislation must be construed in the way most favorable to the Indian. United States v. Celestine, 1909, 215 U.S. 278, 290, 30 S.Ct. 93, 54 L.Ed. 195; Choate v. Trapp, 1912, 224 U.S. 665, 675, 32 S.Ct. 565, 56 L.Ed. 941; Chase v. United States, 8 Cir., 1916, 238 F. 887, 893; Arenas v. United States, D.C.S.D.Cal. 1945, 60 F.Supp. 411, 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">At the risk of being unnecessarily repetitious we summarize as follows: \u25a0 .-</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">We appreciate the fact that the allotment scheme as to Mission Indians was adopted by Congress in accordance with its belief that the time had come to direct the Indian away from the tribal system of life and into the nation\u2019s system of individual responsibility and ownership of property. It thought, however, that a sudden and complete change' over at one step would result in many allottees losing their property through inexperience. Accordingly the restriction against alienation and encumbering was provided. It was contemplated, however, that eventually (the details need not be recited) all restrictions would be removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">When the United States authorized the Indian to make the United States an adversary party in its own courts, it did so knowing that the -Indian by himself was incapable of talcing advantage of the privilege and that attorney fees and other expenses would be the unavoidable concomitant. It also knew that the Indian litigant, with few exceptions, was- without the means to meet the necessary expenses. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>seems to us'that Congress could not have intended to commit the subject to its courts with any paralyzing limitation but, in committing the subject to its courts it intended them to fully exercise their general equitable jurisdiction. The chancellor will, of course, see to it that no unconscionable fee or extravagant expenditure will be allowed and will protect the allotment from being affected in the slightest unnecessary manner or degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">We think the case of United States v. Equitable Trust Co., supra, is authority in support of appellees\u2019 contention, and the trial court\u2019s holding, that the land comprising the allotment awarded Arenas may be impressed with a lien as security for the payment of attorney\u2019s fees and necessary expenses of the litigation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">It is argued by appellant Arenas that the amount of fees awarded should have been governed by the written attorney\u2019s contract executed in 1940. This contract provided for an aggregate fee of 10% of the value of the land recovered. Appellees Clark and Sallee performed under such arrangement until 1943 when appellee Preston became associated. In 1945 Arenas signed another contract wherein he agreed to compensate appellees on a quantum meruit basis. The district court, having ruled that the 1945 contract superseded the 1940 contract, allowed to appellees Clark and Sallee 10% of the value of the interest secured for Arenas and to appellee Preston 12%% of such value as the reasonable value of his services. See Blair v. Cullom, 2 Cir., 1948, 168 F.2d 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">We think, however, that the fee and necessary expenditures which cari be the United States still retains an interest in the subject of a lien on the property cannot be awarded upon any contract by and between the allottee and his attorneys since the land. When, as here, the attorneys seek to secure their fees by a lien upon the property the judge as the chancellor has the jurisdiction to impress the lien for a sum equal to but not in excess of the sum which he deems reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">The record before us reveals the fact that the court did not determine the value of the allotment Arenas secured and therefore could not have known the value of the percentage allowances made for which a lien was ordered. It may be that the value of the percentage allowed for attorney\u2019s fees upon a finding of the property value, would prove either inadequate or grossly excessive. The interest of the United States in the allotment will not cease to exist until the \u201ctrust patent\u201d to the property is ripened into an unqualified patent to it and the impressment of a lien for an excessive fee would illegally and inequitably affect such interest. However, should a sale of a portion of the land take place to satisfy the lien, such portion would be freed of any governmental interest under the same sanction that a portion of the fund in the Equitable case was freed of any governmental interest. The district court should have proceeded expressly to fix the dollar value of the services performed as the basis for the sum secured by the lien and' in so doing should have considered and determined the value of the thing secured by the litigation, namely, the reasonable value of the Indian\u2019s interest in the allotted land under the trust patent, as one of the elements to be taken into consideration. See Sampsell v. Monell, 9 Cir., 1947, 162 F.2d 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">The case is remanded to the district court with instructions to determine the sum of money for which amount the lien against the allotted property is to be impressed. Upon such determination having been made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>and upon the lien having been accordingly impressed upon the property the judgment shall stand affirmed, except as to proper assignments of error which may be claimed to have occurred in the determination herein ordered. The district court should retain jurisdiction to do all things necessary in regard to the lien as it did in the judgment under review here.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-9\">.
