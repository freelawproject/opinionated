Appellees sued to recover the reasonable value of legal services allegedly rendered in negotiating a settlement for appellants in connection with claims asserted by them against one Adams. The jury returned a verdict for a portion of the fee sued for. Appellants contend that no services were performed by appel-lees on their behalf, that they are not indebted to appellees in any sum, and that in truth the relationship of attorney and client never existed between appellees and themselves. While the showing on these points was conflicting, there is ample evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict, and the judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
