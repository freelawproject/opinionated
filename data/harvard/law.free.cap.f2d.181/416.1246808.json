That left, then, for determination: the proper figures of net profits; the necessary continuing \u00e9x-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>pense for six months time subsequent to the fire; the necessary ordinary payroll expense for the ninety days following the fire; and also the figures necessary to be determined as provided for by the coinsurance clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Throughout the course, and at the conclusion, of the trial, defendants vigorously urged, as their principal contention, that in violation of the fraud provisions of the policies, plaintiffs had concealed or misrep-represented material facts or were guilty of fraud and false swearing - and there could be no recovery on the po-licies.-</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">As their alternative contention, they urged that under the coinsurance clause of the policies, plaintiffs\u2019 recovery must be greatly iimited.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">On the fraud issue, the district judge found that plaintiffs had not been guilty of misrepresentation or. false swearing within the meaning of the invoked clause of the policy so as to defeat their recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">On the coinsurance issue, he found that the total loss sustained by plaintiffs was greatly less .than the total maximum liability of defendants under the two policies, and that this established conclusively that plaintiffs \"had carried and maintained insurance in an amount' not only equal to the eighty percent of liability required by the coinsurance clause but in an amount far in excess of one hundred percent of such liability. Upon this finding he rejected defendants\u2019 claim that plaintiffs were coinsurers and their recovery must be accordingly reduced, and, finding for plaintiffs, under Item I of the policy, for lost profits, $2500, and, for continuing expenses, $2275.87, and under Item II for $1544.08, he gave judgment against \u25a0 each. defendant for its proportionate share of this recovery, with attorneys\u2019 fees and a penalty of ten percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Defendants moved to set the court\u2019s findings and decision aside, or, in default thereof, for their amendment so as to give effect to the coinsurance clause, insisting that .under .Item I, plaintiffs should have recovered only $2881.70, and under Item II, only $548.09.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-13\">Their motions denied, defendants-appellants are here urging that, because of their false swearing, it was error: (1) to allow plaintiffs any recovery; and (2) that, if not, it was error not to diminish their recovery by application of the coinsurance clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-14\">Appellees, on their part, conceding, as they must, the validity of the clause avoiding the policies for false swearing; urge upon us that the finding of the district judge, that there was no breach of it, is supported by ample evidence, and that, unless the recovery is to be diminished under the co-insurance clause, the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-15\">We agree with appellees that this is so.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-16\">As to the coinsurance clause, we agree with appellant that the reason given by the district judge for holding plaintiffs not coinsurers will not stand up, and that the question of whether, and to what extent, plaintiffs are coinsurers is to be determined on entirely different considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-17\">As applied to ordinary fire insurance on property, \u201cCo-Insurance clauses in substance require of the assured to maintain insurance on each item of property insured equal to its actual cash value, or a certain percentage thereof, and failing to do so, make the assured as insurer to the extent of the deficiency, and require the assured, as such co-insurer, to bear his' proportionate part of loss on each item.\u201d 24 Tex. Jur., Insurance, \u00a7 223, p. 1016.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-18\">\u201cCo-insurance means a relative division of the risk between the insurer and the insured, dependent upon the relative amount of the policy and the actual value of the property insured thereby.\" Cyclopedia of Insurance Law, Couch,- Vol. 7, \u00a7 1845,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-19\">In short, co-insurance clauses are designed to compel the insured,' either as self insurer or otherwise, to carry insur-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>anee on the risk in an amount equal to the percentage of its value fixed by the particular clause. Though such clauses are generally held enforceable, in the absence of a statutory prohibition to the contrary, they are entirely prohibited hv statute in some jurisdictions, greatly restricted in others, and subject in all to a strict construction and the requirement of strict proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">While appellants, as they were obliged to do, did plead the co-insurance clause in defense, they tried the case on the facts below, they have presented it here, as though the burden were upon appellees to show that they were not co-insurers instead of, as it was,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> upon appellants to convince that they were. They tried it, too, there and here, as though the experience of the business before the fire was the controlling factor, indeed conclusive in the application of the coinsurance clause. The policy provides directly to the contrary. Clause 4(a), the coinsurance clause for Item I, fixes the amount required as \u201c80 percent of the sum * * * that would have been earned (had no fire occurred) during the 12 months <em>immediately following the date of loss\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). Clause 3,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cExperience of the Business\u201d, gives this provision further emphasis by providing \u201cthat the amount * * * covered under Item I. and Item II. shall he determined * * * for the application of the coinsurance clause <em>by giving due consideration to the experience of the business before the fire and the probable experience thereafter\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The defendants offered no evidence as to the probable experience after the fire, but below and here insisted on the determination of the matter based entirely on the experience of the business before the fire. Nor was there any evidence offered as to the circumstances and conditions under which the amount of $12,000, carried on Item I and $2300, carried on Item II were fixed.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">In this state of the record, we do not believe that, though he gave a wrong reason for it, the conclusion of the district judge, that the defendants had not sustained their burden as to this clause, should he, on this record, overturned as wrong. The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b473-8\">. 29 Am.Jur., Insurance, \u00a7 1093.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b473-9\">.
