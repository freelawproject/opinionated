The United States contributed about $386,-750 toward the cost of the construction and furnishing of the Hospital by means of the Work Projects Administration. The Authority leased the Hospital to the Department of Property and Supplies of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the Department) for a term beginning November 1, 1939 and ending June 1, 1968. The lease provided that the Hospital might be subleased.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-22\">The Hospital was vacant until occupied by the United States in 1942.' On October 23, 1942 a \u201cSublease and Agreement\u201d was entered into by the Department \u201cacting for and on behalf of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as Sublessor\u201d, the United States of America as sublessee, and the Authority. By the sublease and agree-</p>\n<p id=\"b944-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>ment the United States acquired the Hospital for a term beginning with the date of entry and ending June 30, 1943. The sublease and agreement provided for renewal by mutual .consent from year to year on six months\u2019 notice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> . It provided further that $2,699,935 less certain deductions, not pertinent here, \u201c * * * shall be the amount of the award for all damages or compensation\u201d by reason of the taking of a fee simple title by the United States in any judicial proceeding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The sublease and agreement was signed by the Secretary of Property and Supplies, on behalf of the \u201cDepartment of Property and Supplies\u201d, described in the document itself as \u201ca body corporate and' politic constituting a public corporation and governmental instrumentality, organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania * * * as owner.\u201d The document was signed also1 by an official of'the Authority and approved in writing by the Attorney General of the Commonwealth and the Governor of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">The United States went into possession, operated the establishment as Deshon Hospital and made improvements and additions thereto at a cost of about $4,000,000.00. It is claimed by the United States that these improvements were made in reliance on the condemnation provisions of the \u201cSublease and Agreement\u201d. The lease was renewed from year to year, the final renewal being for a term ending June 30, 1946.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">Late in December 1945 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was informed by a letter written by Colonel E. G. Gesler, \u25a0Engineers Corps, U. S. A., that the United States would hot require the Hospital after June 30, 1946. Shortly thereafter General Omar N. Bradley, Administrator of Veterans Affairs, informed Governor Edward Martin of Pennsylvania, that the War Department proposed to vacate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>Hospital not later than June 30, 1946. In view of this information Governor Martin had studies made by state employees as to possible future uses of the Hospital by the State of Pennsylvania. On February IS, 1946 General Bradley wrote to Governor Martin stating that urgent requests had been received from citizens of Pennsylvania asking that the Hospital be acquired by the Veterans Administration. The letter also asked for terms of \u201cpurchase\u201d if the Veterans Administration should find the Hospital suitable for conversion to a veterans\u2019 hospital. On March 13, 1946 Governor Martin quoted to General Bradley a price of $4,000,000. On June 26, 1946, four days before the lease ran out, the United States filed its petition in the court below to condemn a fee simple title to the Hospital for the United States. I-Iearing was had. The court below filed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a memorandum opinion,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and entered an order awarding the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania $2,512,297.39 as just compensation. It will be noted that the award is based on the sublease and agreement, in which, as we have said, it was stipulated by the parties that the amount stated should be deemed to be \u201cdamages and compensation\u201d if a fee simple title was condemned in a legal proceeding. No other pertinent evidence as to the value of the Hospital was introduced at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">It is conceded, in effect, by the parties that if the sublease and agreement is valid and binding upon the parties the award must stand. It is argued by the Commonwealth that the Authority and the Department acting through the persons who signed that document were not authorized to sell real property, that, therefore, their acts were <em>ultra vires </em>and the provisions of paragraph 6 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 5do not bind the Commonwealth. See Section 514 of the Administrative Code of April 9, 1929, P.L. 177, and supplements thereto, 71 P.S.Pa. \u00a7 194.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> -\\Ye will assume <em>arguendo </em>that real property belonging to the Commonwealth cannot be sold without the express approval of the Legislature of Pennsylvania. The agreement in dispute is not an agreement to sell. The agreement sets an amount of <em>\u201cdamages and compensation\"</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to be awarded the Commonwealth in case of <em>\u201cany judicial proceedings\u201d </em>by the United States to acquire fee simple title. Condemnation proceedings involve an involuntary taking quite unlike a sale. The cited statute can not limit the power of the United States to condemn property, nor does it serve to limit the power of the executive officials of the Commonwealth to make agreements as to compensation in case of condemnation. The Pennsylvania statute relied on by the Commonwealth does not range so far.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-11\">It is also contended by the Commonwealth that the United States had given up any rights which it had under the sublease and agreement prior to the filing of the condemnation proceedings on June 26, 1946. The court below weighed the evidence carefully on this point. No statements made in behalf of the United States which indicated that the United States would vacate the premises went so far as to give up rights existing under the agreement. The Commonwealth\u2019s contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">The judgment of the court below will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b944-9\">.
