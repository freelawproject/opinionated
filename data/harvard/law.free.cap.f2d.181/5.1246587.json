It also filed an amended complaint, in which, still attacking the action of the court in No. 1148-M-Civil, as invalid, it prayed that the court enter a declaratory decree determining and defining the respective rights of the parties, plaintiff and defendants, and further determining that the defendants have no interest in and to the property, but the only interest therein is in the .plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">On May 13, these motions, on notice of the hearing, coming on to be heard, the district court entered two orders. One was an order denying the motion to vacate the May 6, 1949, order which had dismissed its original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The other was an order: reciting the examination by the court of the original record and proceedings in the cause No. 1148-M-Civil, the decree in which was attacked on the complaint; determining, from that examination, that the plaintiff has no cause of action against the moving defendants; and adjudging, that the complaint is not capable of being amended, that plaintiff\u2019s rights, if any, are limited to its claim upon the proceeds of the receiver\u2019s sale in said cause No. 1'148-M-Civil, and that the complaint be, and the same is'hereby, dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Plaintiff, appealing from the orders of May 6th and May 13th, 1949, is here urging: (1) that its suit was not based upon a federal question, and, therefore, it should have been remanded; and (2) that, if the federal court had jurisdiction, it was error to dismiss the bill of complaint because it set forth facts which, if true, stated <em>a. </em>cause of action. ' \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\"> We cannot agree with either of these contentions. It is quite clear, upon the authorities,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that the suit was founded upon, and raised, a federal question authorizing its removal to the federal court. It is further clear, that the complaint and the amended complaint present nothing more than an effort, to do by indirection in the state court what it had been denied the right to do by intervention in the federal court. This was to relitigate in the state court matters already determined in the federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">It is quite plain that this is just another of the attempts of appellant, persisted in almost to the point of, if not beyond, contumacy, to continue to litigate matters already conclusively determined against its predecessor in title and itself.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judgment appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"b62-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AL7\">.
