Both ships were merchant vessels in a convoy. WJthiii two years of the stranding, an amended libel 'in personam brought in the United States alleging that it was a bareboat charterer of the Gatun. In 1949, on the basis of newly discovered facts, libellant sought leave to file another amended libel, charging that the stranding of the Mar\u00e1vi was.caused not only by the negligence of the Gatun but also by the negligence of \u201cthe Roanoke and the escort vessels and respond\u00e9nt\u2019s servants in charge of them.\u201d The Roanoke and the escort vessels were public vessels of the United States, the. Roanoke being the flagship of the convoy in which the .Maravi and the Gatun sailed. The district court denied leave to file the proposed amendment on the ground that neither the Suits in Admiralty Act, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 742 nor the Public Vessels Act, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 781, authorizes suit against the United States without reference to a specific vessel. From this, the court. concluded that the amendment, which sought to allege the negligence of vessels other than the Gatun, stated a new claim, barred by the two year statute of limitations, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 745, 782.- This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">Although the advocate for the United States would welcome a decision on the merits of the order on appeal, he has very properly questioned our appellate jurisdiction. We think it clear that the order is not \u201cfinal\u201d within the intendment of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291. For an order to be appealable under this section it \u201cmust be, not only in its nature final, but a complete disposition of the cause.\u201d Nyanza Co. v. Jahncke Dry Dock, 264 U.S. 439, 440, 44 S.Ct. 355, 68 L.Ed. 777. In that case there were four causes of action: one in rem and one in personam for collision damage and one in rem and one in personam for salvage. All claims except the one in personam for collision damage were dismissed for want of adrhiralty jurisdiction. The Supreme Court, through Brand\u00e9is, J., held the order of dismissal non-appealable. A claim for salvage would appear to be more distinct from a claim for collision than are the two claims involved in the case at bar. The test applied in the Nyanza case leaves no doubt as to the result required here. Denial of leave to file the amended libel is not \u201ca com-, p\u00edete disposition of the cause.\u201d If libel-lant should recover its damages against the United States on account of the Gatun\u2019s negligence, the question of the Roanoke\u2019s negligence \u2014 and the propriety of rejecting the proffered amendment \u2014 will be rendered moot. It is true that if decision on the merits goes against libellant and if on appeal the district court\u2019s order with respect to the amended libel should be reversed, much time and money will have been futilely expended. But in the absence of statutory relaxation of the present rules on appealability, that practical consideration cannot alter the inevitable conclusion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">Nor can appellate jurisdiction be rested on 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1292(3), permitting appeals from interlocutory decrees \u201cdetermining the rights and liabilities of the parties to admiralty cases in which appeals from final decrees are allowed.\u201d See Schoenamsgruber v. Hamburg Line, 294 U. S. 454, 457-458, 55 S.Ct. 475, 79 L.Ed. 989; The Maria, 2 Cir., 67 F.2d 571. The rights of the parties in so far as they relate to alleged negligence on the part of the Roanoke and the escort vessels have been \u201cdetermined\u201d only on the hypothesis that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>the ruling below was correct. To adopt that hypothesis would beg the question on which appellate jurisdiction depends. Indeed, the appellant has made no contention that the order is appealable under \u00a7 1292.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
