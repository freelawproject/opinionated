C. Gasanas should not be certified for contempt\u201d, issued on appellant\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-15\">The claim for the rule was that appellee, the state court receiver for many years prior to the filing of the bankruptcy proceeding, though required, by Sec. 69, sub. d of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 109, sub. d, and by order of November, 12, 1947, entered in the bankruptcy proceeding, to account to the bankruptcy court, had failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-16\">Appellee filed an answer purporting to make a full accounting, and showing: that the furniture, for which claim was filed, had been disposed of many years before; and that the moneys referred to in the clainl had been expended by him, under state court order, before the company had been adjudged bankrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-17\">After a hearing, in which full evidence<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was taken, the referee, concluding that a satisfactory accounting had been made, that appellee was not in contempt of the bankruptcy court, and that if appellant had any cause of action against appellee, he should pursue it elsewhere and not by contempt proceedings, denied the relief prayed for in the show cause application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-18\">On certification, the district judge sustained the position of appellee that the bankruptcy and the chapter 10 proceedings were not continuous, and that appellee was not responsible to the bankruptcy court for what he did between April, 1946, and Jan. 20, 1947. In addition, he sustained the referee\u2019s findings that there was no basis in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>fact for a contempt order, and entered his order affirming those findings'and the order denying relief, and appellant is here seeking to'set that order aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">While we reject appellee\u2019s claim, for which he cites Wingert v. Kieffer, 4 Cir., 29. F.2d 59, that the order appealed from was' entered in a criminal contempt proceeding and is, therefore, not appealable, we agree with him that it may not be reversed. It was for the referee and the district .judge to determine whether there was any substantial basis in the evidence for the issuance of the contempt order. The evidence fully supports their finding and conclusion that: there was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1063-19\">. This showed without substantial dispute: that State Realty Co., Inc., was a cor-j)oration with two stockholders, apj)ellant Gough and one IT IJ.
