'</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">There -were nine counts in the indictment, all charging appellant\u2019s violation of section 338a, subdivision (a), of Title 18 United States-Code [1948 Revised Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 876], in wilfully with intent to extort <em>money, </em>threatening to injure, and knowingly and with intent to extort money depositing in the United States Post Office letters containing threats to injure the person of the addressee.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">On motion of the United States Attorney, all counts of the indictment except the ninth count were dismissed. The defendant was found guilty on that count and was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment.
