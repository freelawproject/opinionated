To that we cannot agree. When he appeared on behalf of successive certificate holders, he became entitled \u201cto be heard\u201d \u2014 \u00a7 206, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 606, \u2014 and we know of nothing in the statute that requires him to \u201cintervene\u201d in order to take full part in the proceeding: \u00a7 207, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 607, refers to others than creditors or stockholders of the debtor. He thereupon became entitled to an allowance out of the estate, based upon any services described in \u00a7 243, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 643,. so far as he performed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-14\">We do not mean to suggest \u2014 we do not mean to intimate \u2014 that the allowance in fact made to him was'too small to cover all that he did even upon this construction of \u00a7 243; and we remand the case only because we are uncertain from what the judge said, whether, had he understood the section as we do, he might not have made a larger allowance. We altogether agree that, so far as the petitioner\u2019s intervention was a bit of officious duplication, it should not be recognized; we altogether agree that he is entitled to be paid for no services which \u00a7 243 does not cover. How-, ever, in so far as his services were within that section, and in so far as the trustee and his attorney did not perform them, and, but for him, would not have performed them, we hold that he need not look for his pay to his clients. The case will be remanded for further proceedings, not inconsistent with the foregoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-15\">Order reversed; cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
