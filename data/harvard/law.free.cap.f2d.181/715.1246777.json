Since, ..upon the, filing of the Petition in Bankruptcy under Chapter 12, the Bankruptcy Court acquired exclusive jurisdiction of the property of the debtor and since \u00a7 828, supra, automatically stayed the proceedings, the order of sale was void and the sale thereafter made under that order was void.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">In re Tinkoff, 7 Cir., 141 F.2d 731, is not to the contrary.
