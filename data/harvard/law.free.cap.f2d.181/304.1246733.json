(1949 Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7' 132.2' to 132.4. Section 132.4 reads: \u201cThe cases of all aliens of the\u2019 excludable classes \u2019brou'ght to seaports of the United States who apply for temporary admission, except \u2019 cases within \u00a7 132.3, shall be submitted to the Department \u2022 for \u2022special ruling.\u201d Relators \u00e1re .not within the terms of \u00a7 132.3.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> . We construe the word \u201cDepartment\u201d in \u00a7 132.4 to mean the Board of Immigration Appeals.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we think the Commissioner, was required to submit to that Board the relators\u2019 applications for temporary admission. As \u00a7 132.4 is mandatory, it was not .necessary for relators to appeal to that Board. Consequently, they had exhausted their' administrative remedies. We think, also, that an application for temporary admission - may be made at any tim\u00e9 before actual departure' from 'our: shores. We dp not agree with, respondent\u2019s argument that temporary admission is restricted to- the kinds of persons described -in 8 U.S.C.A- \u00a7 203, since 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 136(q) contains no such restriction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">We reverse and remand with directions to release the relators unless, within a reasonable time to be fixed by the District Court, (1) the Commissioner submits to the Board of Immigration Appeals relators\u2019 applications for temporary admission, and (2) the Board acts upon those applications.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b362-7\">. That failure to possess a visa does not preclude the exercise of such- discretion, cf. Stone ex rel. Colonna v.
