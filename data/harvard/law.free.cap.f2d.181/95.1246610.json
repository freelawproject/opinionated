Krepper\u2019s conviction was upheld in an exhaustive opinion filed in this court. See 159 F.2d 958, certiorari denied 330 U.S. 824, 67 S. Ct. 865, 91 L.Ed. 1275. The issues raised by bis present application are adequately disposed of in the opinion of the court below. 86 F.Supp. 862.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-23\">The grounds upon which Krepper seeks to set aside the judgments do not suggest that he has been denied constitutional rights. We agree with the ruling of the court below that it was unnecessary to conduct a hearing. The order appealed from will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
