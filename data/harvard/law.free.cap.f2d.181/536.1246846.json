He is serving a sentence of twenty-four months\u2019 imprisonment in the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners, at Springfield, Missouri. The sentence was imposed by the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Alabama. The appellant\u2019s conviction by that court was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit on October 30, 1945, Pinkerton v. U. S., 151 F.2d 499, and by the Supreme Court of the United States on June 10, 1946, 328 U.S. 640, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-19\">The appellant has had his full day in court. He asserts, however, that, after his conviction had been affirmed by the Supreme Court, the sentencing court failed to commit him to custody promptly, that he is entitled to credit for the time during which he was awaiting commitment, and that his sentence has therefore expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-20\">There is obviously no merit in the appellant\u2019s contention, since he could have entered upon the execution of his sentence at any time after it was imposed. Aside from that, however, the District Court for the Western District of Missouri could not entertain his petition, since no application for the vacation of his sentence had been made, under \u00a7 2255, Title 28 U.S.C.A., to the court which had sentenced him.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-21\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
