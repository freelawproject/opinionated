There were also prayers for damages and a general prayer for equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Defendant set up: as a first defense that the complaint fails to state a claim for relief; for a second defense that the action is now barred by laches; and a third defense that the name sought to be enjoined \u2022is not sufficiently similar to plaintiff\u2019s name to cause confusion or deceive anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">There was further a denial that the use of the name has misled or' deceived anyone, a denial that the plaintiff has suffered any harm or damages by reason of defendant\u2019s acts, and a denial that defendant ever represented to anyone that he was, or represented, the plaintiff, International Forwarding Co., or ever did business with anyone under that name.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The pleadings standing thus, defendant, expressly waiving damages and asking judgment only \u201cfor the injunctive relief prayed and for its costs\u201d, moved for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">From the interlocutory order<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>denying its motion, plaintiff has appealed,* insisting that there were no issues of fact to be decided and that on the pleadings it was entitled to the relief asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">We do not think so. If plaintiff had limited the relief asked in its motion to the relief numbered (1) and (2) above, its motion should have been granted, because, upon the pleadings, there is no issue of fact that the use of such names or words was wrongful as to plaintiff, and that plaintiff was entitled to injunctive relief from that use.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">The difficulty with plaintiff\u2019s cause arises from the fact that the relief it asked was much broader than this, and that the very broad relief asked for in number (3) above ought not to have been granted on the pleadings in view of defendant\u2019s denials of an intent to defraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-13\">The judgment is, therefore, affirmed, but without prejudice to the right of the plaintiff, if it is so advised, to reapply for judgment on the pleadings for the relief, in the modified form indicated above, in numbers (1) and (2).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b106-9\">. \u201cAfter argument on motion of plaintiff \u2022 for judgment on the pleadings, it appears that there are issues of fact to be decided and the motion is denied\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b106-10\">.
