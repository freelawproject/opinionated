We are of the opinion that the complaint presented for determination only one controversy, as to the respective rights and liabilities of plaintiff and defendants, growing out of the collision, and not several ^eparate ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-21\">We cannot, therefore, agree with the view of the district judge; that the claim with respect to the settlement was a distinct and separate cause of action on a less than jurisdictional amount; or with his view, that, because plaintiff would not be entitled to a favorable declaration on whether Mrs. Bonney could be made to contribute to or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>indemnify the railroad company, the court was without jurisdiction to entertain and proceed with the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">We are, however, in complete agreement with his view, that, though the court had declaratory judgment jurisdiction, it should not, in the exercise of a sound discretion, entertain or proceed with the action, but, declining to exercise the jurisdiction, should dismiss the cause without prejudice to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">The order, sustaining the motion to dismiss and dismissing the complaint, is a general dismissal without stating the grounds. Unless, therefore, what appears in the record as a letter opinion of the judge is read into, and made a part of the order, the order might be regarded as a judgment dismissing the cause on its merits. The order is, therefore, modified to read: \"Ordered and Adjudged that the complaint be, and the same is hereby, dismissed, not, however, for want of jurisdiction or on the merits, but, in the exercise of an informed discretion not to entertain or proceed further in the cause\u201d, and so modified, it is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b908-12\">.
