Plaintiffs prayed for a declaration of the rights of the parties under said lease and for injunctive-relief. The issue presented depends solely upon a construction of the lease. The court below construed the lease adversely to plaintiff\u2019s contention and therefore denied the relief sought. It is from this decision that the instant appeal comes.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">The case was tried below by Judge Charles G. Briggle, who made findings of fact and entered conclusions of law as a premise for his decision. He also filed a written opinion, which is reported. Gluck et al. v. Commercial Merchants Nat. Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Peoria et al., D.C, 85 F. Supp. 287. In that opinion the provisions of the lease in controversy, the contentions of the respective parties relative thereto, as well as the reasons upon which the court arrived at its decision are clearly stated. And we find nothing in plaintiffs\u2019 presentation here which calls for any -additional statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">We are of the view that the issue involved was corr\u00e9ctly decided <em>below </em>and we agree with the reasoning by which that result was reached. We therefore adopt the opinion of the lower court as that of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-13\">The decree appealed from is Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
