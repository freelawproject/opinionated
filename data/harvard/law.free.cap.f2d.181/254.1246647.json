It was alleged that the mark had been continuously used since February 10, 1943.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-18\">The application was passed for publication and appeared in the Official Gazette of May 21, 1946.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-19\">On June 19th of that year appellee filed its notice of opposition to the sought registration, alleging that the trade-mark \u201cGarden Lady\u201d is confusingly similar to two registered marks of appellee, \u201cLady In Waiting\u201d and \u201cAnnie At The Garden Gate,\u201d respectively, as applied to dolls. Appellant in its answer traversed the material allegations contained in the notice of opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-20\">The goods of the parties possess the same descriptive properties and the only issue below and here is whether or not the mark of appellant is confusingly similar to the registered marks herein of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-21\">The Examiner of Interferences deemed it necessary to consider only the registration of \u201cAnnie At The Garden Gate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-22\">The examiner agreed that there are certain differences between appellant\u2019s mark and the mark of appellee, \u201cAnnie At The Garden Gate,\u201d but was of opinion that the similarity between the marks may fairly be said to predominate. He stated that the term \u201cLady,\u201d as employed in the mark of appellant, can not be considered distinctive, as applied to dolls, and that the word \u201cGarden\u201d appears to be arbitrary, so that purchasers would primarily rely upon that word in identifying appellant\u2019s goods as to their source. With respect to appellee\u2019s mark, \u201cAnnie At The Garden Gate,\u201d the examiner stated that the word \u201cGarden\u201d is a prominent part thereof, and that a further element of similarity between the marks is contained in the word \u201cAnnie.\u201d Because, in the opinion of the examiner, the marks of the parties as a whole are similar and convey the impression of a garden scene, he held that their concurrent use on the same kind of merchandise is likely to cause confusion in trade and deception of the, purchaser. He therefore sustained the notice of opposition and further adjudged that appellant is not entitled to the registration of its mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>The Commissioner of Patents affirmed the decision of the examiner (79 USPQ 20). From that decision this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">We can not agree with the reasoning of the tribunals below, because, even though the two marks \u201cGarden Lady\u201d and \u201cAnnie At The Garden Gate\u201d might convey an impression of a garden scene, they are utterly unlike in sound, meaning and appearance. There is no likelihood, in our opinion, that the concurrent use of the marks of the parties on their respective goods will cause confusion in trade or deceive purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Therefore, we think that appellant is entitled to the registration of his mark, and, accordingly, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
