Such credits are allowable, petitioner contends, because the foreign taxes so paid were imposed \u201cin lieu of a tax upon income\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 131(h) of our Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 131(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">Petitioner latef filed timely claims for refund upon the ground that an erroneous computation of the credit limitation imposed by \u00a7 131(b) had been made. The limitation of the foreign-tax credit claimed in the returns was computed by adopting the ratio of gross amount of income from Canadian sources to. gross amount of income from all sources. Whereas petitioner now contends that the proper credit limitation is-the ratio of normal-tax net income from Canadian sotirces to such income from all sources. :</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">The Commissioner assessed deficiencies for the foreign-tax credits claimed in the returns, and also disallowed the claims for refund. The decision of the Tax Court upon stipulated facts, 12 T.C. 498, upholding both, acts of the Commissioner, is here for review pursuant fo Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 1141(a), 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1141(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">The Canadian Special War Revenue Act of 1915, \u00a7 14, Canada Rev.Stat. 3538 (1927), as amended, Canada Stat. 6-7 Geo. 6, c. 32, \u00a7 5 (1942), levied a 3% tax upon \u201cnet premiums\u201d of mutual insurance companies other than life. The statute, \u00a7 13, defines \u201cnet premiums\u201d to be \u201cthe gross premiums received * * * less the rebates and return premiums paid on the cancellation of policies * * But it was not until 1946 that mutual insurance companies other than life were made subject to Canadian income taxes, Canadian Income War Tax Act of 1917, \u00a7 4, Canada Rev.Stat. 2140 (1927), as amended, Canada Stat., 10 Geo. 6, c. 55, \u00a73 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">In 1942 and 1943 petitioner paid the Canadian government the 3% tax upon \u201cnet premiums\u201d collected in Canada. The Tax Court held that the Canadian tax was not one imposed \u201cin lieu of a tax upon income\u201d within the meaning of Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 131 (h), and that petitioner was not therefore entitled to credit for the foreign taxes so paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">Whether a foreign tax is imposed \u201cin lieu of a tax upon income\u201d within \u00a7 131 (h) is determined not by characterization of the tax in foreign statutes and decisions, but according to the laws of the United States. Biddle v. Commissioner, 1938, 302 U.S. 573, 578, 58 S.Ct. 379, 82 L.Ed. 431; New York &amp; Honduras Rosario Min. Co. v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 1948, 168 F.2d 745, 747. Which is to say we are to look at the true nature and incidence of Canada\u2019s tax, regardless of how it is named by her Parliament or her courts, and ascertain whether, when tested by our income tax laws, the \u201cnet premium\u201d tax paid by petitioner must fairly be said to have been \u201cin lieu of a tax upon income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-14\">It has already been shown that the Canadian tax in question was in the nature of a \u201cgross income\u201d or, more precisely, a \u201cnet sales\u201d tax. See Pat\u00f3n, Accountants\u2019 Handbook 110 (3d Ed.1944). In Canada, then, during the tax years 1942 and 1943, companies such as petitioner were not subject to Canadian income tax, but were subject to the 3% \u201cnet premium\u201d tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>We turn now to consider our method of taxing mutual insurance companies other than life during the same period. Prior to 1942, such companies were, in practical effect, exempt from federal income taxation. Revenue Act of 1938, \u00a7 101(11), 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 101 note; Sec H.R.Rep. No. 2333, 77th Cong, 2d Sess. 27 (1942), 1942-2 Cum.Bull. 372, 395; cf. Revenue Act of 1942, \u00a7 165(a), 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 101(11). In the Revenue Act of 1942, \u00a7 165(b), Int. Rev.Code, \u00a7 207(a), 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 207(a), alternative tax bases for mutual insurance companies other than life were provided\u2014 namely, normal-tax net income derived from net investment income, Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 207(a) (1), and \u201cgross amount of income\u201d (i.e. investment income plus \u201cnet premiums\u201d minus certain deductions). \u00a7 207(a) (2). The greater tax computed under the two alternatives established tax liability. \u00a7 207(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">It was conceded upon oral argument that investment income of mutual insurance companies other than life constitutes but a negligible proportion of gross amount of income. In substance then the tax imposed under our \u00a7 207(a) (2) cannot be distinguished from a tax upon \u201cnet premiums.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">The legislative history of the Revenue Act of 1942, \u00a7 165(b), 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 207, amending Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 207, discloses that administrative difficulties encountered in attempting to define and tax the underwriting income of mutual insurance companies other than life prompted the Congress to resort to the \u201cgross amount of income\u201d alternative. Thus the tax based upon \u201cgross amount of income\u201d is in fact a tax \u201cin lieu of a tax upon income.\u201d See Sen.Rep. No. 1631, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. 131 (1942), 1942-2 Cum.Bull. 504, 602, 615; cf. Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 204(a, b) 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 204 (a, b).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The Commissioner contends that a foreign tax must have some relation to profits in order to fall within the operation of Int. Rev.Code, \u00a7 131. This was true prior to 1942 when foreign-tax credits were allowed on foreign \u201cincome taxes\u201d only. Revenue Act of 1938, \u00a7 131(a) (1), 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 131 note, Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 131(a) (1), 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 131(a) (1). The 1942 amendment is clearly broader in scope providing credits for foreign taxes imposed \u201cin lieu of a tax upon income\u201d. Revenue Act of 1942, \u00a7 158(f), Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 131(h). To uphold the Commissioner\u2019s contention would in effect abrogate the enactment o\u00ed \u00a7 131 (h) and place \u00a7 131 where it was before 1942. See St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Reynolds, D.C.Minn.1942, 44 F.Supp. 863.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">It is our duty to look to the language employed and the legislative history and \u201cto construe the language so as to give effect to the intent of Congress\u201d. United States v. American Trucking Ass\u2019ns., 1940, 310 U.S. 534, 542-545, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 1063, 84 L.Ed. 1345. The report of the Senate Finance Committee on proposed \u00a7 131(h) expressly states that foreign taxes measured by \u201cgross sales\u201d would constitute a credit. See Sen.Rep. No. 1631, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. 131 (1942), 1942-2 Cum.Bull. 504, 602. Manifestly gross sales have no relation to profits. Gross sales are however analogous to \u201cnet premiums..\u201d See American Institute of Accountants Research Bulletin No. 9 (1941) 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">Both the language and the legislative history of Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 131(h), force us therefore to conclude that the Canadian \u201cnet premium\u201d tax imposed upon petitioner, like the American counterpart imposed by Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 207(a) (2), was \u201cin lieu of a tax upon income\u201d within the meaning of Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 131(h). It follows that petitioner is entitled to the credits claimed in the returns for tax years 1942 and 1943, and that the deficiencies assessed by the Commissioner were erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-13\">This conclusion necessitates consideration of petitioner\u2019s claims for refund upon the ground that an erroneous computation was made of the credit limitation imposed by \u00a7 131(b). The Revenue Act of 1943, \u00a7 130(a), Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 131(b), provided, as to a corporation, that the foreign-tax credit \u201cshall not exceed * * * the * * * proportion of the tax against which such credit is taken, which the taxpayer\u2019s normal-tax net income from sources within [the foreign] country bears to its entire normal-tax net income for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>same taxable year\u201d. The language is clear, and unambiguous. Sec. 130(c) of the Revenue Act of 1943, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 131 note, expressly made these quoted provisions retroactive to December 31, 1939.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Taxes imposed upon petitioner by the United States for the years 1942 and 1943, were based not upon its normal-tax net income, but solely upon the alternative basis \u2014 \u201cgross amount of income\u201d as defined in Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 207(a) (2). In view of that fact limitation of foreign-tax credits by a ratio of normal-tax net income appears to have no logical basis. But as legislative history reveals, mutual insurance companies such as petitioner present unusual problems of tax administration. Resolution of those problems has been made, if empirically, by the Congress. Our function is at an end when we have determined the scope of congressional action. See United States v. Evans, 1948, 333 U.S. 483, 495, 68 S.Ct. 634, 92 L.Ed. 823.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The foreign taxes paid by petitioner for the years 1942 and 1943 do not exceed the limitation specified in Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 131(b). The claims for refund are therefore allowable.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The decision of the Tax Court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
