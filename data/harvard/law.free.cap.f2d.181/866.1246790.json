Swift. Cf. Garrett Biblical Institute v. American University, 82 U.S.App.D.C. 265, 163 F.2d 265. The District Court found as a fact that Mrs. Swift gave this fund to the University with no other restriction than that it was to be a memorial to her deceased husband and that its income was to be used for annual fellowships, named in his honor, for graduates of the Institute. This finding appears to be correct and at the very least is not clearly erroneous. It supports the court\u2019s conclusion of law and judgment that there are no other restrictions and that a resolution of the University\u2019s Board of Trustees in 1942, limiting use of the fellowships to study in the University, is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-23\">CLARK, Circuit Judge, dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
