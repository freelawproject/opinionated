United States, 318 U.S. 101, 63 S.Ct. 483, 87 L.Ed. 640, upon which the appellant relies, does not hold that an indictment such as that in controversy is defective. The Supreme Court in that case ruled, in substance, that the word \u201cfelony,\u201d as used in the statute, did not include a felony which was not such under federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-12\">The indictment was not fatally defective, compare Hewitt v. United States, 8 Cir., 110 F.2d 1; United States v. Bent, 8 Cir., 175 F.2d 397, 400-402, certiorari denied 338 U.S. 829, 70 S.Ct. 79, and, if defective at all, is no longer subject to attack. Hagner v. United States, 285 U.S. 427, 433, 52 S.Ct. 417, 76 L.Ed. 861.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-14\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
