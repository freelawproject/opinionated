The undisputed evidence showed that the laboratory was an established part of the hospital. By arrangement with an outside physician it was operated under his overall direction. The technician was hired and paid by the hospital. In the instant case the hospital, in usual course, ordered a laboratory test. The technician, without the presence or supervision of the physician, made the test and submitted her report directly to the hospital. Relying thereon the hospital made the transfusion. In our opinion the facts clearly established the responsibility of the hospital for the acts of its technician. That responsibility is unaffected even though, agreeably to the requirements of 2 D. C. Code (1940) \u00a7\u00a7 101, 102 and 134(b), the technical work in the laboratory was put under the \u201cdirection\u201d of a physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">As to the remaining questions, we think they present no prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
