That Article provides that \u201cAny grievance or dispute which arises in connection with the application or interpretation of any of the terms or provisions hereof\u201d [i. e., of the agreement] * * * shall be settled in accordance with the following grievance procedure.\u201d That \u201cprocedure\u201d includes the following: If a grievance exists, \u201cit shall be reduced to writing\u201d by the employee and countersigned by the department steward; the foreman is then to \u201cwrite his answer.\u201d The \u201cwritten grievance\u201d,then becomes the basis of an attempted settlement. If not settled, \u201ceither party may notify the other,\u201d within a specified period, \u201cof their intention to submit the grievance to arbitration.\u201d Article V explicitly states: \u201cNo grievance will be discussed unless the procedure outlined has been followed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-17\">The record contains nothing to show that any grievance, constituting any of the claims here sued upon, was ever \u201creduced to writing.\u201d As to no such.claim, then, did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>the \u201cgrievance procedure\u201d ever become operative. Accordingly, as to no such claim could the arbitration clause become potentially active, since that clause is but a part of the \u201cgrievance procedure\u201d which can be set in motion in no other way than by a written statement of a grievance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On that ground, all else aside, the denial of a stay was proper. We therefore do not consider the applicability of the federal and Connecticut arbitration statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-16\">. Moreover, the claims here were for unpaid instalments, so that there is applicable this provision: \u201cAny grievance shall be retroactive only to the date the written grievance is submitted to the government.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
