On. November 6, 1946, he was taken into custody under a warrant of arrest issued October 24, 1946, by the Immigration and Naturalization Service of the Department of Justice. The basis for the warrant was the charge that the Appellee was in the United States in violation of the immigration laws in that he was feeble-minded at the time of his entry and was a person likely to become- a public charge. After hearing a warrant of deportation was issued on January 19, 1949. Appellee sued out a writ of habeas corpus contending that the issuance of the warrant of deportation was at a time more than five years removed from the date of Appel-lee\u2019s entry and was -contrary to the above-quoted language of Section 19(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">The lower Court sustained the Appellee\u2019s construction of the statute and in consequence ordered Appellee released. .</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">There is a diversity of- opinion prevailing in the various Courts of Appeals as to whether the section of the statute under consideratiqn requires the\u2019completion of the deportation proceedings within the five years specified in the said section or whether the issuance of a warrant of arrest within the five-year period serves to toll the running of the statute. We ar\u00e9 of th'e opinion that a timely issuance of the warrant of arrest suffices.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">This, position, is warranted by the express phraseology of the statute and is rendered persuasive by consideration of the universal rule prevailing in the various State and Federal Courts, that the filing of charges, whether by information or- by indictment, tolls the running of the statute of limitations against a -criminal prosecution and is effective even though the w\u00e1rr\u00e1nt be not served upon the accused until after the running of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">This portion of the Act has been construed and the Appellant\u2019s position sustained in each of the following cases: U. S. ex rel. David v. Tod, 2 Cir., 289 F. 60; U. S. ex rel. Patton v. Tod, 2 Cir., 297 F. 385; United States ex rel. Danikas v. Day, 2 Cir., 20 F.2d 733; U. S. ex rel. Ginal v. Day, 2 Cir., 22 F.2d 1022; Metaxis v. Weedin, 9 Cir., 44 F.2d 539; Marty v. Nagle, 9 Cir., 44 F.2d 695; Tillinghast v. Cresswell ex rel. Di Pierro, 1 Cir., 54 F.2d 459; Raftery ex rel. Giacomazzi, v. Tillinghast, 1 Cir., 63 F.2d 97. Cf. Hughes v. Tropello, 3 Cir., 296 F. 306, and McCandless v. United States ex rel. Swystun, 3 Cir., 33 F.2d 882, to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">The proceedings in this case having antedated the decision enunciated in Sung v. McGrath, 70 S.Ct. 445, holding that the Federal Administrative: Procedure Act, Title 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1001 et seq., is applicable to such proceedings, and it appearing, from information furnished by appellant\u2019s counsel, that such Act was not followed by the immigration authorities in the determination of the proceedings against the Appellee, it is directed, upon suggestion of said counsel, that the lower Court\u2019s order be reversed, the. writ of habeas corpus be vacated, and that Appellee be remanded to the custody of the Director of Immigration and Naturalization Service at Miami, Florida, for the resumption of deportation proceedings against the s\u00e1id Appellee in accordance with the req\u00fairements of the Federal Administrative Procedure Act. See Sung v. McGrath, supra, and amendment of order therein.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Asc\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b420-7\">. On March 13, 1950, 70 S.Ct. 564, the Court entered the following amendatory order: \u201cThe motion of the Solicitor General to modify the judgment Is granted and the judgment is modified so as to provide for the release - of the prisoner from custody under the order of deportation but without terminating petitioner\u2019s custody under the warrant of arrest issued by the Attorney General dated October 13, 1947.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-13\">Mr. Justice Clark took no part in the consideration or decision of this application.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
