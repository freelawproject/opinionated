We fully treated the fundamental issues of this case in the companion case.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>The district judge in the instant case fixed attorney fees on a percentum value basis of the allotted land unrestricted by any interest of the United States and made an allowanc\u00e9 for expenses. He ordered the land impressed with a lien to secure payment of the attorney\u2019s fees and expenses and ordered the' land sold forthwith 'by a commissioner in discharge of the indebtedness. The lien was ordered impressed and the attorney fee was fixed upon the- theory .that the allotment was entirely free from any interest of the United States. A mere reading of our opinion in the companion case will clearly show that such theory was Wrong and substantially affected the court\u2019s conclusions and judgment and constituted reversible error:</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The record shows on its face that whereas $100 was allowed as expenses, only $15 was actually expended. The judgment should be .reduced in accordance, with these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The case is remanded to the district court with instructions to proceed to fix an attorney fee and to secure its payment by-the impressment of a lien on the allotted property all in accord with' our expressions in the Arenas case No. 12,046. Any lien impressed upon the property should be foreclosable only after a reasonable period has elapsed in which payment could be mad\u00e9<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-22\">.
