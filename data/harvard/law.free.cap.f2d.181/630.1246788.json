It is our opinion that judgment of the lower court was entirely correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-21\"> The diamond to which the appellants\u2019 claim relates came into the possession-of the appellee by virtue of its sale to him by the aforesaid Durant. Shortly after this transaction Durant was apprehended for the theft of the Hesse family jewels. The case received considerable notoriety, and the appellee, on reading about it in the paper, voluntarily turned the diamond over to the authorities for its possible evidentiary value. It became one of the exhibits at the court martial of Durant but was never identified in any way as one of the Hesse jewels. After Durant\u2019s conviction appellee sought the return of the diamond in question. The Government was permitted to implead the appellants and to deposit the <em>res </em>in the registry of the court. Appellants\u2019 whole case hinges on inferences from the foregoing facts. In short their claim amounts to this proposition: We had some diamonds. These diamonds were stolen from us by Durant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number><em>Ergo, </em>all diamonds that Durant had are ours, and this particular one must belong to us. Legally this proposition is unsound for the reason it fails to establish beyond a mere suspicion that the diamond ever belonged to the Hesse family; and we would be less than candid if we did not admit-that there is ground for a strong suspicion that this diamond does belong to appellants. But the presumption of ownership was in favor of the appellee, and we cannot allow presumptions to be overturned by suspicions. They must be countervailed by substantial evidence. Stone v. Stone, 1943, <em>78 </em>U.S.App.D.C. 5, <em>7, </em>136 F.2d 761, 763. The countervailing evidence must, if believed by the trier of the fact issues, establish facts from which reasonable minds can draw but one inference. Falstaff Brewing Corp. v. Thompson, 8 Cir., 1939, 101 F.2d 301, 304, certiorari denied 307 U.S. 631, 59 S.Ct. 834, 83 L.Ed. 1514. The evidence in the instant case failed to meet the test. The judgment of the District Court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
