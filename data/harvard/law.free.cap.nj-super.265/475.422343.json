The second issue is whether the regulations violate the general welfare provision under the police powers of <em>N.J.Const. </em>Art. IV, \u00a7 6, 112, and the substantive due process and equal protection provisions inherent in <em>N.J. Const. </em>Art. I, U1, as explicated in <em>Southern Burlington Cty. N.A.A.C.P. v. Mount Laurel Tp., </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>151, 174-181, 336 A.2d 713, <em>app. dismissed, </em>and <em>cert. denied, </em>423 <em>U.S. </em>808, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>18, 46 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>28 (1975), (Mt. Laurel I); <em>Southern Burlington Cty. N.A.A.C.P. v. Mount Laurel Tp., </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>158, 208-248, 456 A.2d 390 (1983) (Mt. Laurel II) and subsequent cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">The Fair Housing Act (Act), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-301 <em>et seq., </em>adopted in 1985, authorizes the Council on Affordable Housing (COAH) to promulgate regulations to ensure compliance with <em>Mt. Laurel II, </em>pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:27D-307. COAH promulgated regulations, codified as <em>N.J.AC. </em>5:92-1 <em>et seq., </em>to determine what constituted a municipality\u2019s fair share of a region\u2019s low and moderate income housing. This appeal focuses on the regulations which determine a municipality\u2019s credit under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-307c(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">COAH\u2019s initial set of regulations were effective August 4, 1986, and were supplemented December 15,1986. 18 <em>N.J.R. </em>1527 (Aug. 4, 1986); 18 <em>N.J.R. </em>2442 (Dec. 15, 1986). COAH originally inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>preted the mandatory credit provision of <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:27D-307c(l) as applying only to housing units created or rehabilitated between April 1,1980, and December 15,1986, where occupancy of the unit was restricted to low or moderate income households, and where the price of the unit was controlled in accordance with COAH affordability standards. <em>See N.J.AC. </em>5:92-6.la as adopted on August 4, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">In <em>Bernards Tp. v. Dep\u2019t of Com. Affairs, </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 12-13, 558 A.2d 1 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>194, 570 A.2d 959 (1989), we held that the portion of <em>N.J.AC. </em>5:92-6.1a which required that credits pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-307c(l) were available to a municipality only if \u201ca unit\u2019s occupancy is restricted to low or moderate income households\u201d was violative of the Act. COAH has interpreted <em>Bernards Tp. </em>to preclude consideration of affordability in determining a municipality\u2019s credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">After consideration by a task force and much debate otherwise, COAH issued a new regulation dealing with a municipality\u2019s credit under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-307c(l), thereby amending <em>N.J.AC. </em>5:92-6.1a. The amendments, adopted July 12, 1991, are referred to as \u201cCredits Without Controls.\u201d They provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">5:92-6.1 Credits</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">(a) Municipal present and prospective fair share shall be determined after crediting, on a one to one basis, those housing units created or rehabilitated after April 1, 1980 that meet the criteria in <em>N.J.AC. </em>5:92-6.2 and 6.3 ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-8\">5:92^6.3 New construction</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-9\">(a) A housing unit created and occupied between April 1,1980 and December 15, 1986 shall receive a credit if it is in sound condition and currently occupied by a low or moderate income household. In general, municipalities shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-10\">1. Document the date of construction with a certificate of occupancy date;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-11\">. 2. Verify the condition of the unit by an exterior inspection performed by a licensed building inspector; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-12\">3. Document household income with the most recent Federal tax return.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-13\">(b) Municipalities that have received substantive certification prior to August 5, 1991 may apply and receive credit for housing units satisfying the criteria outlined above. These credits shall be applied to the municipality\u2019s next low and moderate income housing obligation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-14\">(c) After December 15, 1986, a housing unit shall be eligible for a credit when a unit\u2019s occupancy is restricted to low or moderate income households and when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>municipality has implemented adequate assurance for continued affordability consistent with <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:92-12, Controls on Affordability. All housing units that received preliminary approval after December 15, 1986 shall also conform to the requirements of <em>N.J.AC. </em>5:92-14 in order to receive a credit. <em>[N.J.AC. </em>5:92-6.1 and 6.3]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The Public Advocate contends that the \u201cCredits Without Controls\u201d regulations violate the terms of the Act. Resolution of this issue requires us to review COAH\u2019s exercise of its rule-making power.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">COAH\u2019s decision, like that of any administrative agency, must stand unless arbitrary or capricious. <em>Van Dalen v. Washington Tp., </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>234, 244-45, 576 A.2d 819 (1990); <em>Williams v. Dep\u2019t of Human Services, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>102, 107, 561 A.2d 244 (1989). Under that standard, a reviewing court must consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-8\">(1) whether the agency\u2019s action violated the enabling act\u2019s express or implied legislative policies;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-9\">(2) whether there was substantial evidence in the record to support the findings on which the agency based its action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-10\">(3) whether in applying the legislative policies to the facts, the agency clearly erred by reaching a conclusion that could not reasonably have been made after weighing the relevant factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-11\"><em>Ibid. Accord, Public Service Electric and Gas Co. v. New Jersey Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Protection, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>95, 103, 501 A.2d 125 (1985). It is also well established that judicial review of agency action requires that we accord an administrative regulation a presumption of reasonableness and validity. <em>In re Adoption of N.J.A.C. 7:26B, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>442, 449, 608 A.2d 288 (1992); <em>Medical Soc\u2019y of N.J. v. New Jersey Dep\u2019t of Law and Pub. Safety, </em>120 <em>N.J. 18, 25-</em>26, 575 A.2d 1348 (1990). While COAH has wide discretion in promulgating regulations to carry out the mandate of the Act, the breadth of that discretion, however, may \u201cnot dilute COAH\u2019s duty to adopt regulatory methods that are consistent with the statutory goals\u201d as expressed in the Act. <em>In re Petition for Substantive Certification Filed by Warren Tp., </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>1, 28, 622 A.2d 1257 (1993). \u201cThe central goal of the Fair Housing Act is to implement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>the <em>Mount Laurel </em>doctrine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41, 622 A.2d 1257. With these principles in mind, we turn to the regulation in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">As noted earlier, the present provisions in <em>N.J.AC. </em>5:92-6.1 allow a credit to municipalities for units constructed or rehabilitated between 1980 and December 15,1986, if the unit is habitable in terms of being in sound condition and if it is occupied by a low or moderate income family. No consideration is given to whether the low or moderate income family can afford to live in the unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The pertinent statutory provision directs that COAH adopt criteria and guidelines for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">(1) Municipal determination of its present and prospective fair share of the housing need in a given region. Municipal fair share shall be determined after crediting on a one-to-one basis each current unit of low and moderate income housing of adequate standard____ <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-307c(l) ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">The Act defines low income housing as housing affordable, under recognized guidelines, to householders earning fifty percent or less of the median income in the region. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-304c. Moderate income housing is defined as affordable to householders earning between fifty percent and eighty percent of the region\u2019s median income. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-304d.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">While the Act has not defined \u201caffordable,\u201d COAH\u2019s regulations generally deem a unit affordable if it costs less than twenty-eight percent to thirty percent of the household\u2019s income. <em>N.J AC. </em>5:92-12.12. This definition of \u201caffordable\u201d is similar to that employed by the Court in <em>Mt. Laurel II, </em>which considered housing affordable if it consumed no more than twenty-five percent of a household\u2019s income. 92 <em>N.J. </em>at 221, n. 8, 456 A.2d 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Eight days after oral arguments were conducted in this case, <em>L. </em>1993, <em>c. </em>104 was enacted on April 13,1993, which amended the Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-301 to 329. In response to our request, counsel have submitted supplemental briefs addressing the impact of the recent legislation on this appeal. In its supplemental brief, the Public Advocate concedes that the Act, as amended by <em>L. </em>1993, c. 104, \u201cspecifically directs the COAH to grant credits for any housing constructed or rehabilitated between 1980 and 1986 that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>occupied by low or moderate income households even though it is not in fact realistically affordable to such households.\u201d It is undisputed that the 1993 amendments are ameliorative and should be applied retroactively. <em>See Carnegie Bank v. Shalleck, </em>256 <em>N.J.Super. </em>23, 38-40, 606 A.2d 389 (App.Div.1992). We hold that based on the 1993 amendments to the Act, the regulations in question are not ultra vires.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The Public Advocate contends further that the 1993 amendments are unconstitutional because they are inconsistent with the <em>Mount Laurel </em>doctrine requiring municipalities to create realistic opportunities for the construction of housing that is affordable to low and moderate income people. This assertion was reinforced recently. <em>In re Petition for Substantive Certification of Warren Tp., supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 12, 622 A.2d 1257.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">It is well-established that a legislative enactment carries with it a presumption of constitutionality, <em>Hills Development Co. v. Bernards Tp., </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>1, 24, 510 A.2d 621 (1986), and that courts must proceed with great caution in declaring a statute unconstitutional. <em>N.J. Sports Exposition Authority v. McCrane, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>1, 9, 292 A.2d 545 (1972), <em>app. dism., </em>409 <em>U.S. </em>943, 93 <em>S.Ct. 21% </em>34 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>215 (1972). The Public Advocate relies heavily upon <em>Morris County Fair Housing Council v. Boonton Tp., </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>393, 429-30, 507 A.2d 768 (Law Div.1985), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part, sub. nom., Hills Development Co. v. Bernards Tp., supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 47, n. 13, 510 A.2d 621, to support the argument that permitting a credit without regard for affordability will unconstitutionally dilute the statewide housing need as determined by COAH.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">The Public Advocate raised the impermissible dilution argument before COAH when the agency first proposed amending the credits without controls regulation. Unfortunately, the Public Advocate did not develop the argument with the statistical data that she now submits on appeal. Even the data submitted to us does not include figures for the entire State. Beyond that, the reliability of the data submitted to us has not been established. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Since we are enjoined to proceed with great caution in declaring statutes unconstitutional, the present record does not permit us to conduct the thorough review required of us. We cannot determine from the present record what the dilutionary effect the 1993 amendments to the Act will be. Until we know what the effect will be, we cannot determine how much dilution the constitution will tolerate. In the first instance, this determination should be made by the agency with the expertise required. We therefore remand the matter to COAH to develop a full and complete record on the issue of impermissible dilution. We regard <em>Abbott v. Burke, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>269, 299, 495 A.2d 376 (1985) as substantial authority in support of a remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">We hold- that the regulations under review are not ultra vires. We decline to decide the constitutional issue based on an inadequate record. We remand the constitutional issue to COAH for exhaustion of administrative remedies. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
