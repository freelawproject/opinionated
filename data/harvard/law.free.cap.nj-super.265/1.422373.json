The land is mostly wetlands. The original aggregate assessments were $19,-978,100. They were reduced to $976,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-11\">On this appeal the Borough of East Rutherford raises four points: (1) the judge erred in reducing the assessments without requiring plaintiff to apply for governmental permits for development, (2) the case was not ripe for judicial review, (3) the taxpayer\u2019s proper remedy was inverse condemnation, not reduced assessments, and (4) the decision was inconsistent with <em>Township of North Bergen v. Borough of Teterboro, </em>254 <em>N.J.Super. </em>704, 604 A.2d 216 (Law Div.1991). We disagree and affirm for the reasons given by Judge Crabtree in his written opinion at 12 <em>N.J.Tax </em>399 (Tax 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-12\">This case presented questions of credibility on the reasonable likelihood of development of the properties and the analysis of comparable sales for valuation purposes. The judge clearly accepted the credibility of the taxpayer\u2019s experts on the wetlands and the properties\u2019 development potential. <em>Id. </em>at 406. According <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>to the credible testimony, the application process for permits to dredge and fill wetlands had become \u201cmuch stricter\u201d in the late 1980\u2019s. <em>Id. </em>at 407. The judge concluded that such permits were \u201cvirtually impossible to obtain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413. <em>See also Bersani v. Robichaud, </em>850 F.2d 36 (2nd Cir.1988); <em>Inmar Assoc., Inc. v. Borough of Carlstadt, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>593, 549 A.2d 38 (1988) (evaluation of polluted land); <em>University Plaza Realty Corp. v. City of Hackensack, </em>12 <em>N.J.Tax </em>354 (Tax 1992), <em>aff'd, </em>264 <em>N.J.Super. </em>353, 624 A.2d 1000 (App.Div.1993) (fair valuation recognizes environmental hazards and regulatory restraints).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The judge also found the Borough\u2019s valuation expert\u2019s evidence \u201cflawed in too many respects to have any probative value,\u201d and thus rejected it. 12 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 412-13. On this record, he clearly was entitled to do so. The judge found that the taxpayer\u2019s well-qualified expert provided the only credible evidence of value in the ease by use of the comparable sales method. <em>Id. </em>at 408-17. As our Supreme Court has observed, \u201cThe answer [to the valuation of property question] depends upon the particular facts and the reaction to them of experts steeped in the history and hopes of the area.\u201d <em>City of New Brunswick v. Division of Tax Appeals, </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>537, 544, 189 A.2d 702 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">The Borough relies on the presumption of the validity of the original assessment, citing <em>Pantasote Co. v. City of Passaic, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>408, 414, 495 A.2d 1308 (1985). In that case, the Tax Court \u201creasonably rejected the adequacy of the taxpayer\u2019s [valuation] evidence.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In the case before us, the taxpayer presented adequate and credible valuation evidence; the Borough, on the other hand, presented no reliable evidence to support the original assessment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">We find no indication from this record that there has been an inverse taking. The judge found some evidence of \u201c \u2018solid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>and adequate\u2019 fair market value.\u201d 12 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 417, citing <em>Florida Rock Indus., Inc. v. United States, 791 F.2d 893, 903 </em>(Fed.Cir.1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 <em>U.S. </em>1053, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>926, 93 L.Ed.2d 978 (1987). Under our law, diminution of land value alone does not constitute a \u201ctaking.\u201d <em>Gardner v. New Jersey Pinelands Comm\u2019n, 125 N.J. </em>193, 210, 593 A.2d 251 (1991); <em>Littman v. Gimello </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>154, 163, 557 A.2d 314, <em>cert. denied, </em>493 <em>U.S. </em>934, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>324, 107 L.Ed.2d 314 (1989). We also reject the Borough\u2019s notion that an action for inverse condemnation should replace the taxpayer\u2019s remedy of a tax appeal. We find no support in <em>Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, </em>505 <em>U.S. </em>-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>2886, 120 L.Ed.2d 798, 815 (1992), for such a view.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Finally, we reject the claim that Judge Crabtree\u2019s opinion was inconsistent with his opinion in <em>Township of North Bergen v. Borough of Teterboro, supra, </em>254 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 707, 604 A.2d 216, where two municipalities brought a constitutional challenge to the inter-municipal tax sharing formula contained in the Hackensack Meadowlands Reclamation and Development Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:17-10 to -86. The judge there found that the statutory powers of the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission were not preempted by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers. 254 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 721-22, 604 A.2d 216. We find no inconsistency between that ruling and Judge Crabtree\u2019s rejection of the Borough\u2019s 1990 assessed value in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b34-8\"> We also heard argument in <em>Federal Pater Co. v. Borough of East Rutherford, </em>A-6090-90T1, on March 17, 1993, just before the argument in this case. <em>Federal Pater Co. </em>involved an appeal by the Borough of East Rutherford from the reduction of the 1989 tax assessment of a smaller but very similar parcel of land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>also in the Berry's Creek area of the Meadowlands. Tax Court Judge Lasser there used a somewhat different valuation approach than Judge Crabtree used in this case. <em>Federal Pater Co. </em>was tried in March 1991; this case was tried in July 1991. Theoretically, the use of different approaches to valuation could lead to undesirable variations in the taxing level. The solution, of course, is consolidation of pending cases at the trial level. \"The Tax Court on its own motion or on a party's motion may consolidate actions if they present a common question of law or fact, involve the same property or related properties or the same or similar proofs.\u201d <em>R. </em>8:8~3(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
