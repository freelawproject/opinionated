Judge Imbriani merged the convictions and sentenced defendant to a three-year period of probation, conditioned upon defendant serving 364 days in the county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">On appeal, defendant raises the following points:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-13\"><em>Point </em>I\u2014The warrantless use of binoculars in conjunction with the police officer\u2019s false statements in his affidavit for search warrant constitute [an] unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-14\"><em>Point </em>II\u2014The trial court\u2019s failure to let defendant cross-examine the State\u2019s expert witness concerning his bias and interest in the outcome of the ease as an employee of the Somerset County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, which was seeking civil forfeiture of defendant\u2019s house, and had already seized $65,000 through an invalid consent order, constitutes error requiring the court to overturn the conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-15\"><em>Point </em>III\u2014The prosecutor's highly prejudicial remarks concerning facts not in evidence constitute error mandating reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>We affirm the order denying defendant\u2019s motion challenging the seizure of drugs pursuant to a search warrant substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Imbriani in his opinion reported at 265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>208, 625 A.2d 1162 (Law Div.1990). We agree with the judge that the officers\u2019 use of binoculars to observe defendant\u2019s rear-yard marijuana crop did not violate the privacy protections afforded by the Fourth Amendment. Under the facts presented, defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in his marijuana garden. <em>See California v. Ciraolo, </em>476 <em>U.S. </em>207, 213, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1809, 1812, 90 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>210, 216 (1986) (the Fourth Amendment \u201chas never been extended to require law enforcement officers to shield their eyes when passing by a home on public thoroughfares\u201d); <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 <em>U.S. </em>347, 351, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>507, 511, 19 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 576, 582 (1967) (\u201cWhat a person knowingly exposes to the public ... is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Lace, </em>669 F.2d 46, 49-51 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 <em>U.S. </em>854, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>121, 74 L.Ed.2d 106 (1982); <em>United States v. Allen, </em>675 F.2d 1373, 1381-82 (9th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 <em>U.S. </em>833, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>133, 70 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>112 (1981); <em>State v. Lee, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>441, 450, 586 A.2d 256 (App.Div.1991). Moreover, the detectives used their binoculars to obtain only a closer look at what they could already see without resorting to the binoculars. <em>See </em>1 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure: A Treatise On The Fourth Amendment </em>\u00a7 2.2(c) at 339 (2d ed. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Defendant also challenges the search warrant based on the detectives\u2019 purported omissions of salient fact in their affidavit, and \u201cmisrepresentations\u201d to the issuing judge. However, Judge Imbriani\u2019s finding in his oral opinion after the suppression hearing that the detectives were truthful and the omissions inadvertent is amply supported by the record. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 161-64, 199 A.2d 809 (1964). Further, the judge specifically determined that an additional hearing was not required pursuant to <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 <em>U.S. </em>154, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>2674, 57 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>667 (1978). Implicitly, he concluded that defendant had failed to make a \u201csubstantial preliminary showing\u201d that the detectives had willful<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>ly lied or that their statements were made in reckless disregard for the truth. <em>Id. </em>at 170, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2684, 57 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">We have carefully considered defendant\u2019s remaining contentions and are satisfied they are clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2). See <em>Evid.R. </em>4; <em>State v. Williams, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>393, 447, 550 A.2d 1172 (1988); <em>State v. Ramseur, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>123, 322-23, 524 A.2d 188 (1987); <em>State v.
