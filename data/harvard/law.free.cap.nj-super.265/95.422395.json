We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">Plaintiff William J. Lees, an emergency medical technician (EMT) employed in the Paterson Fire Department, was dispatched to render emergency medical assistance to defendant Attillo Loboseo at his home. While carrying Loboseo in a \u201cstair chair\u201d to the ambulance, Lees allegedly slipped and fell on an accumulation of snow and ice on the sidewalk in front of Lobosco\u2019s house. Alleging negligent maintenance of the sidewalk, Lees brought this action against Loboseo and his wife; Lees\u2019s wife asserted a per <em>quod </em>claim. On defendants\u2019 motion, a Law Division judge dismissed the causes of action as barred by the fireman\u2019s rule. Plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b126-13\">We have described plaintiff as a municipally-employed EMT, not as a fireman or firefighter. The parties have treated him as such throughout the litigation. The facts permit no other description of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-14\">Plaintiff was hired by Paterson as an EMT and he was so classified and certified by the New Jersey Department of Personnel. He was never trained or certified as a firefighter, nor did he ever perform firefighting duties. He served in the Paterson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Emergency Medical Services Department, which, according to plaintiffs uncontradicted certification, was \u201cunder the auspices\u201d of the Paterson Fire Department \u201c[a]s a matter of administrative convenience, and for no other reason.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">For purposes of the fireman\u2019s rule, then, plaintiff was not a fireman or firefighter. His administrative assignment to the Fire Department is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">As first announced in <em>Krauth v. Geller, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>270, 157 A.2d 129 (1960), the fireman\u2019s rule mandated only \u201cthat the occupier [of private property] is not liable to a fireman for the creation of a fire.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275, 157 A.2d 129. <em>Berko v. Freda, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>81, 459 A.2d 663 (1983), extended the rule to policemen, but again limited the immunity to \u201can act of ordinary negligence that creates the occasion for the presence of a firefighter or a police officer in a place where he is injured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 84, 459 A.2d 663. That limitation was removed by <em>Rosa v. Dunkin\u2019 Donuts of Passaic, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>66, 583 A.2d 1129 (1991), which applied the fireman\u2019s rule to bar a policeman\u2019s suit for injuries sustained when he slipped on the floor of a donut shop to which he had responded on a call for emergency medical assistance. The expanded scope of the immunity was there stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-9\">[T]he policies and goals that bar a firefighter and police officer from recovering for injuries sustained from an ordinary act of negligence that occasioned the officer\u2019s presence on the premises are equally applicable to bar liability for injuries that arise from an act of ordinary negligence posing a hazard that is incidental to and inherent in the performance of the officer\u2019s duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 76, 583 A.2d 1129.]</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">The New Jersey appellate decisions both before and after <em>Rosa </em>all involve fire and police officers and describe the fireman\u2019s rule as applicable only to those persons. The core question here\u2014 whether the rule should be extended to include any other classes of persons\u2014has been addressed only in two reported trial court decisions that reached conflicting results. <em>Siligato v. Hiles, </em>236 <em>N.J.Super. </em>64, 563 A.2d 1172 (Law Div.1989) (rule applicable to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>local volunteer emergency rescue squad member); <em>Kiernan v. Miller, 259 N.J.Super. </em>320, 612 A.2d 1344 (Law Div.1992) (rule inapplicable to a volunteer first aid worker engaged on behalf of the municipality).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Defendants argue here, as they did in the trial court, that <em>Krauth, Berko </em>and <em>Rosa </em>stand for the proposition that \u201can act of ordinary negligence should not expose an actor to liability for an injury sustained in the course of a public servant\u2019s performance of necessary, albeit hazardous, duties.\u201d Relying on plaintiffs official job description\u2014which includes duties to respond to calls for emergency medical treatment, extricate patients from entrapment, render emergency care, prepare victims for transportation and transport them to hospital\u2014defendants say that plaintiffs public employment \u201cinvolves the saving, delivering or freeing of others from <em>danger.\u201d See Siligato, supra, </em>236 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 67, 563 A.2d 1172. Accordingly, defendants urge, just as the defendant in <em>Rosa </em>was immune from liability for the policeman\u2019s fall on the slippery floor, so too they should be immune from liability for plaintiffs fall on their slippery sidewalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">That argument has its blandishments. The policy justifications for the fireman\u2019s rule can be said to reach beyond firefighters and police officers to EMTs and other persons who assume duties to respond to danger and emergency. Firefighters and police officers are not the only persons who undertake on behalf of the community \u201cto confront crisis and allay dangers,\u201d <em>Berko, supra, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 86-87, 459 A.2d 663, nor are they the only ones who \u201chave assumed (and been trained to handle) those risks.\u201d <em>Rosa, supra, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>at 72, 583 A.2d 1129. Other public employees\u2014as well as volunteers and others serving the public need\u2014are \u201csummoned in circumstances of emergency\u201d with \u201cno reasonable expectation that the property has been made safe for [their] arrival.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 73, 583 A.2d 1129 (quoting <em>Maryland Casualty Co. v. Heiot, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>441, 444, 540 A.2d 920 (Law Div.1988)). The risks they encounter, including an ordinary act of negligence, can certainly be regarded as \u201cinherent and incidental to the performance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>[their] duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 73-74, 583 A.2d 1129. Nevertheless, we are satisfied that the fireman\u2019s rule should not be expanded to include persons other than firefighters and police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The central and oft-stated justification for the fireman\u2019s rule is that firefighters and police officers are <em>mi generis, </em>that they are paid to confront danger and that they accordingly have both responsibilities and powers unlike those of other public servants. As stated in <em>Berko, supra, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 86, 459 A.2d 663:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">Both [firefighters and police officers] are paid to confront crises and allay dangers created by an uneircumspect citizenry, a circumstance that serves to distinguish firefighters and police from most other public employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The Supreme Court has never indicated that the fireman\u2019s rule would be applied to any persons other than firefighters and police officers. To the contrary, the Court\u2019s expressions consistently invoke the special role of such officers as the warrant for the rule. <em>See, e.g., Mahoney v. Carus Chemical Co., Inc., </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>564, 573, 510 A.2d 4 (1986) (\u201c[hjazards negligently created are staples of the duties firemen and policemen are expected to perform\u201d); <em>Rosa, supra, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>at 66, 583 A.2d 1129 (\u201c[t]he accidents and emergencies occasioning the presence of firefighters and police officers ... are ... the very reason for the existence of the public forces of the \u2018finest\u2019 and the \u2018bravest\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">Most of the other jurisdictions that have adopted a fireman\u2019s rule have similarly suggested that the rule is to be applied only to firefighters and police officers. <em>See, e.g., Furstein v. Hill, </em>218 <em>Conn. </em>610, 616-22, 590 A.2d 939, 943-45 (1991) (fireman\u2019s rule justified by special authority, training and benefits enjoyed by police officers and firefighters); <em>Thomas v. Pang, </em>72 <em>Haw. </em>191, 197, 811 P.2d 821, 825 (1991) (\u201cpublic policy considerations ... amply support a classification of fire fighters separate and apart from most public employees\u201d); <em>Winn v. Frasher, </em>116 <em>Idaho </em>500, 503, 777 P.2d 722, 725 (1989) (fireman\u2019s rule recognizes the special relationship between police officers, firefighters and society); <em>Calvert v. Garvey Elevators, Inc., </em>236 <em>Kan. </em>570, 574-76, 694 P.2d 433, 438 (1985) (status and responsibilities of firefighters justify the rule on public policy grounds); <em>Kreski v. Modem Wholesale Elec. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number><em>Supply Co., </em>429 <em>Mich. </em>347, 371, 415 N.W.2d 178, 189 (1987) (\u201cfire fighters and police officers are different than other employees whose occupation may peripherally involve hazards\u201d); <em>England v. Tasker, </em>129 <em>N.H. </em>467, 471, 529 A.2d 938, 940-41 (1987) (fireman\u2019s rule supported by policy considerations arising from responsibilities of police and firefighters, and the relationship between citizens and police and firefighters).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Indeed, in the few cases that directly address the question, the courts of other states have refused to extend the fireman\u2019s rule to other classes of public employees. Illustrative, and particularly apropos, is <em>Krause v. U.S. Truck Co., Inc., </em>787 S.W.2d 708 (Mo.1990), where the Missouri Supreme Court held the fireman\u2019s rule inapplicable to a municipal ambulance attendant injured at the scene of an automobile accident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">Policemen and firemen have exceptional responsibilities. At the scene of an emergency they are covered by a panoply of legal powers and duties necessary to control the people and place where rescue is required. They are expected to act with daring and dispatch to protect life and property. Other public servants may be sent to the scene to perform duties tangent to the emergency. But the official whose <em>primary </em>duty is to confront danger is the fireman or policeman.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 713.]</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\"><em>See also Kowalski v. Gratopp, </em>177 <em>Mich.App. </em>448, 442 <em>N.W.2d </em>682 (1989) (fireman\u2019s rule not applicable to municipal paramedic, whose work only \u201cperipherally involve[s] hazards\u201d); <em>Bath Excavating &amp; Constr. Co. v. Wills, </em>847 P.2d 1141 (Colo.1993) (fireman\u2019s rule is not a \u201cpublic safety worker rule\u201d and thus is not applicable to a municipal utility worker injured at scene of emergency caused by ruptured water line); <em>cf. Evans v. J. Roberts Constr., Inc., </em>527 So.2d 918 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1988) (where injury occurred during code enforcement inspection at construction site, applicability of fireman\u2019s rule depended on whether plaintiff was a police officer or a building inspector). <em>But cf. Pane v. City of New York, 177 A.D.2d </em>688, 577 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>68 (1991), <em>appeal denied, </em>80 N.Y.2d 752, 599 N.E.2d 692, 587 N.Y.S.2d 288 (1992) (finding the \u201creasoning\u201d of the fireman\u2019s rule \u201cequally relevant to court officers, whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>scope of duty particularly includes preserving order in the courtroom\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Any extension of the fireman\u2019s rule beyond fire and police officers would thus contradict the rule\u2019s rationale. But doctrinal purity is not the sole consideration. We are equally concerned that any such extension would invite the wholesale abolition of traditional tort actions by public employees who suffer injuries as a result of hazards inherent in their employment. Many kinds of public employees confront dangers inherent in their jobs. <em>See Rosa, supra, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>at 83, 583 A.2d 1129 (Handler, J., dissenting) (\u201cthere are more similarities than differences between police officers and firefighters and a host of other public employees\u201d). If we did not distinguish firefighters and police <em>officers from </em>other public employees, then no public employees would be able to recover for injuries sustained as a result of those dangers. The Supreme Court has never suggested such a broad rule, nor would we. The potential reach of the fireman\u2019s rule has been contained by restricting its application to firefighters and police officers. That limitation may be regarded as arbitrary and productive of \u201cquaint results\u201d as between similarly situated plaintiffs, <em>Mahoney, supra, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 586, 510 A.2d 4 (Clifford, J., dissenting in part), but it is practical, workable and consistent with our appellate case law and the case law of other jurisdictions. We will not tamper with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">The dismissal order is reversed. The matter is remanded to the Law Division for proceedings consistent with this opinion. <em>Siligato v. Hiles, </em>236 <em>N.J.Super. </em>64, 563 A.2d 1172 (Law Div.1989) is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
