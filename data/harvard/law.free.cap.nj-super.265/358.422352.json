He now appeals from the judgment, urging error only in the denial of the suppression motion. <em>R. </em>3:5-7(d). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-17\">The stipulated facts on the suppression motion were that Trenton Police Officer McMillan, driving a police vehicle on Stuyvesant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Avenue, saw defendant and another person sitting on the curb at the rear of 322 Rutherford Avenue, one of them drinking from a brown paper bag. When defendant saw the police vehicle, he \u201cquickly got up, turned, and started running through the yard of 322 Rutherford Avenue.\u201d McMillan radioed to other officers who were patrolling on East Rutherford Avenue. When defendant saw the officers on Rutherford Avenue, he ran back \u201ctowards Officer McMillan at the rear of 322 Rutherford.\u201d As he ran past the rear portion of the home, he tossed a clear plastic bag into \u201cthe opening of the porch.\u201d At that point McMillan \u201cwas able to stop the defendant.\u201d McMillan retrieved the plastic bag, which was found to contain crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The police may pursue and stop a person upon a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity. <em>State v. Doss, </em>254 <em>N.J.Super. </em>122, 603 A.2d 102 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>17, 611 A.2d 655 (1992). But \u201cit would not be appropriate for the police to engage in an intrusive chase after someone without at least an \u2018articulable suspicion\u2019 that he was or had been engaged in the commission of a criminal offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 128 n. 2, 603 A.2d 102. Here the only ostensible basis for McMillan to have pursued defendant was that defendant had inexplicably fled when he saw the police van. But flight from the police does not alone create a reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct. <em>See State v. Farinich, </em>179 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 5, 430 A.2d 233 (App.Div.1981), <em>aff'd </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>378, 446 A.2d 120 (1982). And what this record does <em>not </em>show is also highly persuasive: no observed criminal activity; no particularized suspicious conduct, such as the possession of suspicious packages or the exchanging of money; no reports of recent nearby crimes; no descriptions of recent crime suspects; no nearby potential or victims of crimes; no nearby vehicle matching a description of a vehicle involved in a recent crime, or the like. <em>See State v. Kuhn, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>275, 280, 517 A.2d 162 (App.Div.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">In sum, the record shows no sufficient basis for the police to have pursued defendant. The contraband jettisoned by defendant in response to the improper police conduct thus should have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>suppressed. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Wilson, </em>953 F.2d 116 (4th Cir.1991); <em>State v. Lemmon, </em>318 <em>Md. </em>365, 568 A.2d 48 (1990); <em>Hawkins v. State, </em>758 S.W.2d 255 (Tex.Crim.App.1988); <em>People v. Shabaz, </em>424 <em>Mich. </em>42, 378 N.W.2d 451 (1985); <em>Commonwealth v. Barnett, </em>484 <em>Pa. </em>211, 398 A.2d 1019 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The order denying the motion to suppress is reversed, as is the ensuing judgment of conviction. The matter is remanded to the Law Division for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
