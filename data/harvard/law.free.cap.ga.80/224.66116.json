The defendant pleaded as follows: In plaintiff\u2019s written application for the insurance, among the interrogatories touching the property were these: \u201c What is the title (answer particularly)? Is your property encumbered? By what and to what amount? \u201d To the first question plaintiff answered \u201cAbsolute\u201d; to the second he answered, \u201cNo.\u201d In fact, the University Bank of Athens then held plaintiff\u2019s deed conveying the property in fee simple to secure a loan, which was then unpaid.\u00bb The representations in the answer were made by plaintiff to induce the acceptance of the risk, and the facts they stated untruly and materially affected the nature, extent and character of the risk. The policy was issued because of said representations, and their untruth was never discovered by defendant until after loss occured. Further, plaintiff covenanted in his application that, if any untrue answer had been given to the interrogatories, the policy should be void. Had the incumbrance been communicated to defendant and not denied in the application, it would not have issued the policy, and had it been subsequently discovered, it would have cancelled the policy; etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-6\">The court charged as follows: \u201cIf the plaintiff\u2019s interest in the property insured was not such as he represented it to be in his application in a material particular, the policy sued on cannot be sustained. Misrepresentation in an immaterial particular does not vitiate the policy.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-7\">After verdict for the plaintiff, a new trial was moved for and refused, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Asj\">John C.

He answered that there was not, when in fact there was an incumbrance of $500 upon it and the land on which it was situated. The court left it to the jury to say whether this misstatement by Fulton was a material misstatement in this case. The jury found that it was not, and found in favor of Fulton.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">The insurance applied for was $1,000. The house was shown to have been worth from $1,200 to $1,500; the land, according to the testimony, was worth from $6,500 to $10,000. The incumbrance amounted only to $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">According to our code, the misstatement must be material in order to void the policy. The question of whether it is material or not, is a question for the jury, and in this case was properly left to the jury. There is no complaint that the question was not fairly submitted to them. <em>We </em>think there was sufficient evidence to authorize their find, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>ing. They might very well have considered that, where-there was only an incumbrance of $500 upon premises of the .value testified to, the failure to state it in the application was not such a material misstatement as would void-the policy. The jury having so found, we affirm the judgment of the court below in refusing the grant of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
