Indiana Dep\u2019t of State Revenue, 953 N.E.2d 682 (Ind. Tax Ct. 2011). The Tax Court denied the Department of Revenue\u2019s motion for summary judgment and certified its order for interlocutory appeal. <em>See </em>Garwood v. Indiana Dep\u2019t of State Revenue, 24 N.E.3d 548 (Ind. Tax Ct. 2014). This Court granted the Department of Revenue\u2019s motion to accept review of the interlocutory order and set the case for oral argument. During oral argument, the Department of Revenue\u2019s counsel argued that Garwood\u2019s tax appeal alleges tort claims seeking compensatory damages that should be decided in the civil action Garwood has filed in the Harrison Circuit Court. <em>See </em>Garwood v. State of Indiana, et al., No. 31C01-1105-CT-24. Garwood\u2019s counsel agreed that the tort claims arising from the sale of the dogs should be decided in the Harrison Circuit Court case. Counsels\u2019 statements bind their clients. <em>See </em>Koval v. Simon Telelect, Inc., 693 N.E.2d 1299 (Ind. 1998). As to whether Garwood is entitled to a tax refund, that matter cannot be resolved until a decision is reached on the amount of taxes, if any, Garwood owes, and that issue remains pending before the Department of Revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Based on the parties\u2019 \u2019representations, the Court VACATES the Tax Court\u2019s published order denying summary judgment reported at Garwood v. Indiana Dep\u2019t of State Revenue, 24 N.E.3d 548 (Ind. Tax Ct. 2014), and DISMISSES in its entirety the tax appeal, No. 82T10-1208-TA-46, without prejudice to either party later pursuing a tax action relating to any taxes Garwood may owe or any refund she may be due. Garwood\u2019s tort claims seeking compensatory damages shall proceed in the Harrison Circuit Court case.</p>\n<judges id=\"b929-6\">All Justices concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
