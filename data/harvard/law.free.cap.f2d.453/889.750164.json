It charges the defendants with negligence in connection with medical treatment requested and needed by the prisoner. The complaint also contains an allegation that medical attention was withheld because the plaintiff refused to sign a document waiving any claim for injury that might result from treatment. But this allegation is followed by a statement that, shortly after the plaintiff\u2019s refusal to sign a release, the prison authorities did provide him with medical attention. Thus, accepting the petitioner\u2019s allegations as true, we can find no more in the complaint than a charge of ordinary negligence in the course of the handling, diagnosis or treatment of the prisoner\u2019s medical complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-23\">While such negligence is a tort, cognizable under state law, it does not amount to such a denial of a constitutional or federally protected right as can be redressed under the Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-24\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
