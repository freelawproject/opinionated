The district court entered judgment on the jury\u2019s verdict against the general contractor. We affirm because the accident resulted in part from the failure of the general contractor to exercise the broad control it had retained over safety practices on the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-8\">Crown Construction Co., a general contractor and owner of a site near Fairmont, West Virginia, contracted with Kent Steel Co. to erect the steel framework of buildings for a shopping center. Kent, as an independent contractor, supplied all the equipment, labor, and supervision required to accomplish its phase of the project. It moved its power crane to the site for unloading, sorting, and hoisting steel into place on the buildings under construction. Over a period of several days the crane\u2019s boom slipped three times because of a defective clutch. On the third occasion it dropped a load of steel, severely injuring Samuel Dale Summers, an ironwork-er employed by Kent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-13\">The trial judge instructed the jury in substance that they should return a verdict against Crown if they found that it had learned of the crane\u2019s faulty condition in sufficient time before the accident to have corrected it; it had failed to take remedial action; and its failure was a proximate cause of Summers\u2019 injuries.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury\u2019s verdict, supported by ample evidence, established that Crown\u2019s job superintendent knew of the defective crane several days before Summers was injured and that he did nothing to have it repaired or replaced. Crown does not now dispute these facts, but it argues that as a matter of law it owed no duty to Summers to correct the defect or even to warn of the hazard. In support of its position it relies on the oft quoted rule, which is recognized in West Virginia, that an owner or general contractor is not liable for the negligence of an independent contractor that it has employed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1059-14\">So riddled is the rule insulating a general contractor from an independent contractor\u2019s negligence that one court has aptly noted: \u201cIndeed it would be proper to say that the rule is now primarily important as a preamble to the catalog of its exceptions.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> One <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>well recognized exception is not, strictly-speaking, based on vicarious responsibility. The general contractor may be liable for its own negligence if it retains control over any part of the work, and fails \u201cto exercise reasonable care for the protection of others [or] to put a stop to any unnecessarily dangerous practices of which he becomes informed. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia has not had occasion to apply this exception, but the district judge was fully justified in believing that the Court approved it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">In Chenoweth v. Settle Engineers, Inc., 151 W.Va. 830, 156 S.E.2d 297 (1967), the Court absolved the city of Elkins from liability for injuries to an employee of an independent contractor arising from the negligence of the independent contractor employed to construct a sewer line. But pointedly the Court noted that the city did not retain any contractual right \u201cto enforce or require any safety precautions.\u201d 156 S.E.2d at 302. One cannot read <em>Chenoweth </em>without reaching the firm conviction that had the city retained control over safety practices, it would have been liable for harm to an employee of the independent contractor caused by its own negligent failure to exercise its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">Here the facts require the imposition of liability that <em>Chenoweth </em>inferentially recognized. Although Crown and Kent did not execute a written contract, the extent of Crown\u2019s control over Kent\u2019s safe prosecution of the job is unequivocally established by the testimony of Crown\u2019s senior employees. Crown\u2019s general superintendent of construction and its superintendent of this project both testified that Crown\u2019s employees were under a duty to report \u201csafety problems\u201d caused by independent contractors to Crown\u2019s job superintendent. Crown\u2019s vice president in charge of construction, its general superintendent, and its job superintendent all attested to the authority of the job superintendent to ensure that an independent contractor corrected an unsafe situation or practice. Specifically, the evidence established that when Kent, or any other independent contractor, operated an unsafe machine on the job, Crown\u2019s superintendent had authority to require the independent contractor \u201cto get it fixed to be in working order or ... to take it off the job.\u201d Kent\u2019s president did not dispute that Crown retained this control,</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-14\">Crown\u2019s retention of the right to prohibit Kent from doing its work in a dangerous manner clearly meets the standards of the Restatement<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the dictum in Chenoweth, 156 S.E.2d at 302. The district judge, therefore, properly concluded that West Virginia law imposed a duty on Crown to exercise reasonable care to prevent Kent\u2019s defective machinery from harming a business invitee on the building site. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1059-9\">. The trial judge charged the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-10\">\u201cTherefore, if the jury shall find by a preponderance of the evidence that the crane in question was defective and had malfunctioned on occasions prior to the happening of the accident resulting in Summers\u2019 injuries, and if you shall further find by a preponderance of the evidence that Crown knew, or by the exercise of due care should have known, of the faulty condition of the crane in time to have either repaired the crane itself or have required Kent Steel to do so prior to the happening of the accident causing Summers\u2019 injuries, and it failed to do so, and if the. jury shall further find by a preponderance of the evidence that such failure, if any, on the part of Crown was a proximate cause of Summers\u2019 injuries, then your verdict shall be for the plaintiffs and against the defendant. . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1059-16\">The judge also charged on contributory negligence, and this issue is not raised on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1059-17\">.
