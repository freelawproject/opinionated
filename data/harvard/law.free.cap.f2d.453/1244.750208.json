After the jury returned its verdict on these counts, the district court imposed ten year sentences on each count, to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-16\">Appellant here contends that the evidence as to each charge was insufficient as a matter of law to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt; that misconduct by the prosecutor in making a rebuttal argument served to deprive Allers of a fair trial; that the trial court erred in instructing the jury concerning the effect of testimony by an accomplice on behalf of the prosecution; and that the introduction of evidence of other criminal activity by the defendant, although received at trial without objection, constituted plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-17\">Following our review of the record in this case, we find sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction on each of the three counts. We do not believe that argument by the prosecution deprived Allers of a fair trial. Moreover, the trial court properly cautioned the jury to disregard any remarks of the prosecuting attorney that might have indicated the prosecutor\u2019s personal belief of the defendant\u2019s guilt. Finally, we find no merit in appellant\u2019s post-trial claim that the trial court committed plain error in allowing the introduction of the following evidence through the direct examination of the accomplice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1305-18\">Q [by Assistant District Attorney Thompson] Mr. Lewis, when the defendant said, \u201cYou burnt me twice,\u201d do you know what he was referring to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1305-19\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1305-20\">Q What was he referring to ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1305-21\">A Another incident some six or seven months before concerning postal money orders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1305-22\">Q And how did you burn him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1305-23\">A He was under the assumption that I wasn\u2019t completely honest in the deal and I withheld.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1305-24\">Q What was the deal ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1305-25\">A One for one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>Q You were passing them again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1306-4\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1306-5\">Q For the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1306-6\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1306-7\">This testimony was relevant in explaining the witness\u2019s testimony earlier and did not necessarily refer to any crime. Even if the testimony were to be construed as referring to the defendant\u2019s commission of another crime, we do not find that its admission, in the light of the overall record, constituted plain error affecting any substantial right of defendant Allers, as contemplated by Rule 52(b) F.R.Crim.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
