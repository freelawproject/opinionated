Such a conviction is a ground for deportation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Deportation proceedings were begun but before completion, appellant was granted relief under the Texas Adult Probation and Parole Law<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which serves to relieve a probationer of the penalties and disabilities resulting from his conviction. The Special Inquiry Office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service ordered that the deportation proceedings be terminated on the ground that the Texas statute effectively expunged the conviction upon which the deportation charge was based. A majority of the Board of Immigration Appeals reversed the order of the immigration officer, and held that the finality of the conviction had not been vitiated for deportation purposes. This appeal is from the Board\u2019s decision. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-7\">This appeal raises the identical issue presented to this court in Gonzalez de Lara v. United States.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>de Lara </em>we rejected the contention that the Texas statute so erased or expunged a conviction for unlawful possession of marijuana that it was eliminated as a ground for deportation. Rubio suggests that <em>de Lara </em>should be limited to narcotics violations. Although there is some authority for such a result,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we based our decision in <em>de Lara </em>upon principles of federalism which are in no way bounded by the nature of the offense involved.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1304-13\">The manner in which Texas chooses to deal with a party subsequent to his conviction is simply not of controlling importance insofar as a deportation proceeding \u2014 a function of federal, not state, law \u2014 is concerned.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQQr\">Gutierrez-Rubio\u2019s conviction for a violation of the Texas firearms statute was a valid ground for the deportation order notwithstanding the Texas statute.</p>\n<p id=\"A7o\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1304-8\">. 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1251(a) (14). In pertinent part the statute provides for the deportation of any alien in the United States who:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1304-11\">\u201cat any time after entry, shall have been convicted of possessing or carrying in violation of any law any weapon which shoots or is designed to shoot automatically or semi-automatically more than one shot without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger, or a weapon commonly called a sawed-off shotgun</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1304-21\">.
