Lasker, District Judge, 331 F.Supp. 1246. Petitioner claims that his guilty pleas were induced by broken promises of the New York County District Attorney\u2019s Office. Without reaching this question, we affirm the denial of the petition on the ground the District Court denied it, namely, that petitioner voluntarily and knowingly waived an opportunity to withdraw his pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">On November 21, 1966, Burke pleaded guilty in the Supreme Court, New York County, to the felony of attempted second degree grand larceny and to the misdemeanor of coercion. When presented for sentencing on January 27, 1967, petitioner was asked whether he had any legal cause to show why judgment should not be pronounced against him. Burke replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">\u201cYes, I do . . . .1 was originally with the District Attorney\u2019s police, and I was induced to confess in this crime, and I was given to understand that the disposition of all matters pending would be two misdemeanors. They reneged on that promise, and they haven\u2019t initiated it up to this point.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">Mr. Wynn, an assistant district attorney for New York County, denied that any such promise was made. Mr. Erdmann, petitioner\u2019s counsel, then read into the record a memorandum he had made following a meeting with several assistant district attorneys:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-11\">\u201cI was asked by Assistant District Attorney Karl Grebow if I would permit him to interview William Burke with respect to co-operating with the District Attorney\u2019s Office in their continuing investigation of the extortion ring. . . . Grebow said that they would not give Burke immunity. However, that if any indictment in addition to those already existing was returned against him by virtue of his co-operation, it would not \u2018be held against him.\u2019 Furthermore, if Burke\u2019s co-operation was substantial, he could rely on all his cases being disposed of on the basis of a couple of misdemeanors. I communicated the above to Burke, and he elected to talk to the detective and with Mr. Grebow.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"An4\">Thereafter Mr. Wynn said \u201cthere is no question that such meeting took place . However, [Burke\u2019s] co-operation was far from substantial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-14\">The sentencing judge, Justice Schweitzer, then afforded petitioner an opportunity to withdraw his guilty pleas, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-15\">\u201cI feel that the plea in this case is much too low.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-16\">I make no secret about my feelings in this case: that I would be in full accord with the District Attorney\u2019s consent to the withdrawal of these pleas and setting them down for trial forthwith, on both pending indictments, and an expeditious processing of any and all other cases now known to the District Attorney involving ex-tortions, which presently remain dormant in his office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-17\">Now, I would like to have an expression of opinion from you, Mr. Erdmann; because I state to you that if Mr. Hogan were to come into this courtroom and recommend two misdemeanors in this case, I would not accept it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-18\">After conferring with counsel, Burke decided not to withdraw his pleas. Justice Schweitzer then sentenced him to City Prison for the time already served on the misdemeanor and to State Prison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>for a term of two to five years on the felony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Burke contends that the intimidating tone of the sentencing judge\u2019s remarks created an atmosphere which precluded a reasoned, intelligent and voluntary choice among the alternative courses of action; and that the District Court therefore erred in concluding that he had voluntarily waived an opportunity to withdraw his pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">We hold that there is no basis in the record to support Burke\u2019s claim that the sentencing judge\u2019s remarks destroyed petitioner\u2019s capacity for reasoned choice. At the sentencing proceeding, Burke was represented by competent counsel,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who was capable of assisting Burke in making an intelligent choice and whose presence helped to dispel the coercive potential of the judge\u2019s remarks. See Mc-Mann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 770-71 (1970); Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 754 (1970). Moreover, petitioner\u2019s lengthy criminal record<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> enabled him to make a relatively informed decision about his chances for acquittal if he went to trial and made it unlikely that the sentencing judge\u2019s remarks intimidated him. Finally, petitioner\u2019s contention that the judge\u2019s failure to grant him additional time to consider the alternatives precluded a reasoned choice is without merit. The record clearly shows that petitioner consulted with counsel and that neither he nor counsel requested additional time for deliberation or consultation.</p>\n<p id=\"Adc\">Given the totality of circumstances, we hold that petitioner reaffirmed his guilty pleas not because he was incapable of making a voluntary and rational choice, but \u201cbecause in his view he had absolutely nothing to gain by a trial and much to gain by pleading.\u201d North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 37 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-13\">We commend petitioner\u2019s assigned counsel, Robert B. Fiske, Jr., Esq., and Arthur F. Golden, Esq., for their excellent brief and forceful oral argument in this Court \u2014 in accordance with the highest traditions of the profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-7\">. Petitioner\u2019s conviction was unanimously affirmed by the Appellate Division, 32 App.Div.2d 741, 300 N.Y.S.2d 511 (1st Dept.1969), and leave to appeal to the New York Court of Appeals was denied on September 24, 1969. Petitioner\u2019s coram nobis application to vacate and set aside the guilty pleas on the ground that they were induced by broken promises was denied, without a hearing, by Justice Schweitzer on November 3, 1969. Petitioner has been serving his sentence since November 5, 1969, parole having been denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b625-10\">. At the evidentiary hearing in the District Court, Martin Erdmann, petitioner\u2019s counsel at the sentencing proceeding, testified that he was admitted to practice in 1939 and had been associated with the Legal Aid Society for 25 years. The District Court found that \u201cPetitioner was represented by especially competent counsel. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b625-24\">. As Judge Lasker wrote, \u201cThe record shows that petitioner was a man remarkably experienced as to the significance of legal acts and rights. At the time of the proceedings herein he had been convicted some 18 times (seven of these convictions for the same type of felony as here) and, in petitioner\u2019s own words, has \u2018a record a yard long\u2019.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
