(\u00a7 516.140 RSMol959, V.A.M.S.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-23\">The facts and basis of decision are fairly set forth in Judge Wangelin\u2019s opinion reported at 326 F.Supp. 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-24\">Plaintiff upon appeal strongly urges that summary judgment was improper because disputed fact issues exist. Summary judgment of course is inappropriate where a dispute exists as to a material fact. The record consists of the pleadings, affidavits, interrogatories, answers thereto and depositions. While some factual disputes exist, the trial court assumed for the purpose of his ruling that representations were made as stated by the plaintiff. The court then determined that, under the controlling Missouri law set forth in its opinion, the record when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff afforded no basis for tolling the statute of limitations. The trial court\u2019s decision is not based upon the resolution of material factual issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-25\">We agree with the view of the trial court that no dispute exists as to material facts. The facts as urged by the plaintiff and accepted by the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>for the purpose of ruling on the motion are inadequate upon the basis of controlling Missouri law to support a finding that the statute of limitations was tolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-4\">The judgment of dismissal is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
