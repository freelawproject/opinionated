The suit arose after a series of over 55 transactions during 1968, 1969, and 1970 in which Plaintiffs-Appellees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>[hereinafter The Carpet Mart], carpet retailers in Kingsport, Tennessee, purchased carpets from Defendant-Appellant [hereinafter Collins &amp; Aikman], incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware, with its principal place of business in New York, New York, and owner of a carpet manufacturing plant [formerly the Painter Carpet Mills, Inc.] located in Dalton, Georgia. The Carpet Mart originally brought this action in a Tennessee state trial court,, seeking compensatory and punitive damages in the amount of $450,000 from Collins &amp; Aikman for the latter\u2019s alleged fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation in the sale of what were supposedly carpets manufactured from 100% Kodel polyester fiber. The Carpet Mart maintains that in May, 1970, in response to a customer complaint, it learned that not all of the carpets were manufactured from 100% Kodel polyester fiber but rather some were composed of a cheaper and inferior carpet fiber. After the cause was removed to the District Court on the basis of diversity of citizenship, Collins &amp; Aikman moved for a stay pending arbitration, asserting that The Carpet Mart was bound to an arbitration agreement which appeared on the reverse side of Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s printed sales acknowledgment forms. Holding that there existed no binding arbitration agreement between the parties, the District Court denied the stay. For the reasons set forth below, we remand the case to. the District Court for further findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-6\">We initially note that the denial of a motion to stay pending arbitration, although interlocutory in nature, is appealable to this Court. In Shanferoke Coal &amp; Supply Corp. v. Westchester Service Corp., 293 U.S. 449, 55 S.Ct. 313, 79 L.Ed. 583 (1935), the Supreme Court held that a motion to stay pending arbitration under 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 3 is, in effect, an application for an interlocutory injunction, the denial of which is appealable under Section 9 of the Judicial Code [now, as amended, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292.] <em>See also </em>Hoover Motor Express Co., Inc. v. Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Helpers and Taxicab Drivers, Local No. 327, 217 F.2d 49, 51 (6th Cir. 1954). We also find that there is no conflicts of law problem in the present case, the Uniform Commercial Code having been enacted in both Georgia and Tennessee at the time of the disputed transactions. G.C.A. Tit. 109A (eff. April 1, 1963) (without Official Comments); T.C.A. Tit. 47 (eff. June 30, 1964) (with Official Comments).</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-10\">The primary question before us on appeal is whether the District Court, in denying Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s motion for a stay pending arbitration, erred in holding that The Carpet Mart was not bound by the arbitration agreement appearing on the back of Collins &amp; Aik-man\u2019s acknowledgment forms. In reviewing the District Court\u2019s determination, we must look closely at the procedures which were followed in the sales transactions which gave rise to the present dispute over the arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-11\">In each of the more than 55 transactions, one of the partners in The Carpet Mart, or, on some occasions, Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s visiting salesman, telephoned Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s order department in Dalton, Georgia, and ordered certain quantities of carpets listed in Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s catalogue. There is some dispute as to what, if any, agreements were reached through the telephone calls and through the visits by Collins &amp; Aik-man\u2019s salesman. After each oral order was placed, the price, if any, quoted by the buyer was checked against Collins &amp; Aikman's price list, and the credit department was consulted to determine if The Carpet Mart had paid for all previous shipments. After it was found that everything was in order, Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s order department typed the information concerning .the particular order on one of its printed acknowledgment forms. Each acknowledgment form bore one of three legends: \u201cAcknowledgment,\u201d \u201cCustomer Acknowledg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>ment,\u201d or \u201cSales Contract.\u201d The following provision was printed on the face of the forms bearing the \u201cAcknowledgment\u201d legend:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-4\">\u201cThe acceptance of your order is subject to all of the terms and conditions on the face and reverse side hereof, including arbitration, all of which are accepted by <em>buyer; </em>it supersedes buyer\u2019s order form, if any. It shall become a contract either (a) when signed and delivered by buyer to seller and accepted in writing by seller, or (b) at Seller\u2019s option, when buyer shall have given to seller specification of assortments, delivery dates, shipping instructions, or instructions to bill and hold as to all or any part of the merchandise herein described, or when buyer has received delivery of the whole or any part thereof, or when buyer has otherwise assented to the terms and conditions hereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1224-6\">Similarly, on the face of the forms bearing the \u201cCustomer Acknowledgment\u201d or \u201cSales Contract\u201d legends the following provision appeared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-7\">\u201cThis order is given subject to all of the terms and conditions on the face and reverse side hereof, including the provisions for arbitration and the ex-' elusion of warranties, all of which are accepted by Buyer, supersede Buyer\u2019s order form, if any, and constitute the entire contract between Buyer and Seller. This order shall become a contract as to the entire quantity specified either (a) when signed and delivered by Buyer to Seller and accepted in writing by Seller or (b) when Buyer has received and retained this order for ten days without objection, or (c) when Buyer has accepted delivery of any part of the merchandise specified herein or has furnished to Seller specifications or assortments, delivery dates, shipping instructions, or instructions to bill and hold, or when Buyer has otherwise indicated acceptance of the terms hereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1224-12\">The small print on the reverse side of the forms provided, among other things, that all claims arising out of the contract would be submitted to arbitration in New York City. Each acknowledgment form was signed by an employee of Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s order department and mailed to The Carpet Mart on the day the telephone order was received or, at the latest, on the following day.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The carpets were thereafter shipped to The Carpet Mart, with the interval between the mailing of the acknowledgment form and shipment of the carpets varying from a brief interval to a period of several weeks or months. Absent a delay in the mails, however, The Carpet Mart always received the acknowledgment forms prior to receiving the carpets. In all cases The Carpet Mart took delivery of and paid for the carpets without objecting to any terms contained in the acknowledgment form.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-13\">In holding that no binding arbitration agreement was created between the parties through the transactions above, the District Court relied on T.C.A. \u00a7 47-2-207 [UCC \u00a7 2-207], which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-14\">\u201c(1) A definite and seasonable expression of acceptance or a written confirmation which is sent within a reasonable time operates as an acceptance even though it states terms additional to or different from those offered or agreed upon, unless acceptance is expressly made conditional on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>assent to the additional or different terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-5\">\u201c(2) The additional terms are to be construed as proposals for addition to the contract. Between merchants such terms become part of the contract unless: (a) the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer; (b) they materially alter it; or (c) notification of objection to them has already been given or is given within a reasonable time after notice of them is received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-6\">\u201c(3) Conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of a contract is sufficient to establish a contract for sale although the writings of the parties' do not otherwise establish a contract. In such case the terms of the particular contract consist of those terms on which the writings of the parties agree, together with any supplementary terms incorporated under any other provisions of chapters 1 through 9 of this title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1225-7\">The District Court found that Subsection 2-207(3) controlled the instant case, quoting the following passage from 1 W. Hawkland, A Transactional Guide to the Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 1.-090303, at 19-20 (1964):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-8\">\u201cIf the seller . . . ships the goods and the buyer accepts them, a contract is formed under subsection (3). The terms of this contract are those on which the purchase order and acknowledgment agree, and the additional terms needed for a contract are to be found throughout the U.C.C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-10\">[T]he U.C.C. does not impose an arbitration term on the parties where their contract is silent on the matter. Hence, a conflict between an arbitration and an no-arbitration clause would result in the no-arbitration clause becoming effective.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1225-11\">Under this authority alone the District Court concluded that the arbitration clause on the back of Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s sales acknowledgment had not become a binding term in the 50-odd transactions with The Carpet Mart.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-12\">In reviewing this determination by the District Court, we are aware of the problems which courts have had in interpreting Section 2-207. This section of the UCC has been described as a \u201cmurky bit of prose,\u201d Southwest Engineering Co. v. Martin Tractor Co., 205 Kan. 684, 694, 473 P.2d 18, 25 (1970), as \u201cnot too happily drafted,\" Roto-Lith Ltd. v. F. P. Bartlett &amp; Co., 297 F.2d 497, 500 (1st Cir. 1962), and as \u201cone of the most important, subtle, and difficult in the entire Code, and well it may be said that the product as it finally reads is not altogether satisfactory.\u201d Duesenberg &amp; King, Sales and Bulk Transfers under the Uniform Commercial Code, (Vol. 3, Bender\u2019s Uniform Commercial Code Service) \u00a7 3.03, at 3-12 (1969). Despite the lack of clarity in its language, Section 2-207 manifests definite objectives which are significant in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-13\">As Official Comment No. 1 indicates, UCC \u00a7 2-207 was intended to apply to two situations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-14\">\u201cThe one is where an agreement has been reached either orally or by informal correspondence between the parties and is followed by one or both of the parties sending formal acknowledgments or memoranda embodying the terms so far as agreed upon and adding terms not discussed. The other situation is one in which a wire or letter expressed and intended as the closing or confirmation of an agreement adds further minor suggestions or proposals such as \u2018ship by Tuesday,\u2019 \u2018rush,\u2019 \u2018ship draft against bill of lading inspection allowed,\u2019 or the like.\u201d T.C.A. \u00a7 47-2-207 [UCC \u00a7 2-207], Official Comment 1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1225-15\">Although Comment No. 1 is itself somewhat ambiguous, it is clear that Section 2-207, and specifically Subsection 2-207(1), was intended to. alter the \u201cribbon matching\u201d or \u201cmirror\u201d rule of common law, under which the terms of an acceptance or confirmation were required to be identical to the terms of the offer or oral agreement, respectively. 1 W. Hawkland, <em>supra, </em>at 16; R. Nords-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>trom, Handbook of the Law of Sales, Sec. 37, at 99-100 (1970). Under the common law, an acceptance or a confirmation which contained terms additional to or different from those of the offer or oral agreement constituted a rejection of the offer or agreement and thus became a counter-offer. The terms of the counter-offer were said to have been accepted by the original offeror when he proceeded to perform under the contract without objecting to the counter-offer. Thus, a buyer was deemed to have accepted the seller\u2019s counter-offer if he took receipt of the goods and paid for them without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">Under Section 2-207 the result is different. This section of the Code recognizes that in current commercial transactions, the terms of the offer and those of the acceptance will seldom be identical. Rather, under the current \u201cbattle of the forms,\u201d each party typically has a printed form drafted by his attorney and containing as many terms as could be envisioned to favor that party in his sales transactions. Whereas under common law the disparity between the fine-print terms in the parties\u2019 forms would have prevented the consummation of a contract when these forms are exchanged, Section 2-207 recognizes that in many, but not all, cases the parties do not impart such significance to the terms on the printed forms. <em>See </em>1 W. Hawkland, <em>supra; </em>\u00a7 1.0903, at 14, \u00a7 1.-090301, at 16. Subsection 2-207(1) therefore provides that \u201c[a] definite and seasonable expression of acceptance or a written confirmation . . . operates as an acceptance even though it states terms additional to or different from those offered or agreed upon, unless acceptance is expressly made conditional on assent to the additional or different terms.\u201d Thus, under Subsection (1), a contract is recognized notwithstanding the fact that an acceptance or confirmation contains terms additional to or different from those of the offer or prior agreement, provided that the offeree\u2019s intent to accept the offer is definitely expressed, <em>see </em>Sections 2-204 and 2-206, and provided that the offer-ee\u2019s acceptance is not expressly conditioned on the offeror\u2019s assent to the additional or different terms. When a contract is recognized under Subsection (1), the additional terms are treated as \u201cproposals for addition to the contract\u201d under Subsection (2), which contains special provisions under which such additional terms are deemed to have been accepted when the transaction is between merchants. Conversely, when no contract is recognized under Subsection 2-207(1) \u2014 either because no definite expression of acceptance exists or, more specifically, because the offeree\u2019s acceptance is expressly conditioned on the of-feror\u2019s assent to the additional or different terms \u2014 the entire transaction aborts at this point. If, however, the subsequent conduct of the parties \u2014 particularly, performance by both parties under what they apparently believe to be a contract \u2014 recognizes the existence of a contract, under Subsection 2-207(3) such conduct by both parties is sufficient to establish a contract, notwithstanding the fact that no contract would have been recognized on the basis of their writings alone. Subsection 2-207(3) further provides how the terms of contracts recognized thereunder shall be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-7\">With the above analysis and purposes of Section 2-207 in mind, we turn to their application in the present case. We initially observe that the affidavits and the acknowledgment forms themselves raise the question of whether Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s forms constituted acceptances or confirmations under Section 2-207. The language of some of the acknowledgment forms (\u201cThe acceptance of your order is subject to . \u201d) and the affidavit of Mr. William T. Hester, Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s marketing operations manager, suggest that the forms were the only acceptances issued in response to The Carpet Mart\u2019s oral offers. However, in his affidavit Mr. J. A. Castle, a partner in The Carpet Mart, asserted that when he personally called Collins &amp; Aikman to order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>carpets, someone from the latter\u2019s order department would agree to sell the requested carpets, or, alternatively, when Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s visiting salesman took the order, he would agree to the sale, on some occasions after he had used The Carpet Mart\u2019s telephone to call Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s order department. Absent the District Court\u2019s determination of whether Collins &amp; Aik-man\u2019s acknowledgment forms were acceptances or, alternatively, confirmations of prior oral agreements, we will consider the application of section 2-207 to both situations for the guidance of the District Court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-5\">Viewing Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s acknowledgment forms as acceptances under Subsection 2-207(1), we are initially faced with the question of whether the arbitration provision in Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s acknowledgment forms were in fact \u201cadditional to or different from\u201d the terms of The Carpet Mart\u2019s oral offers. In the typical case under Section 2-207, there exist both a written purchase order and a written acknowledgment, and this determination can be readily made by comparing the two forms. In the present case, where the only written forms were Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s sales acknowledgments, we believe that such a comparison must be made between the oral offers and the written acceptances.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the District Court apparently assumed that The Carpet Mart\u2019s oral orders did not include in their terms the arbitration provision which appeared in Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s acknowledgment forms, we believe that a specific finding on this point will be required on remand.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1227-8\">Assuming, for purposes of analysis, that the arbitration provision was an addition to the terms of The Carpet Mart\u2019s oral offers, we must next determine whether or not Collins &amp; Aikman's acceptances were \u201cexpressly made conditional on assent to the additional terms\u201d therein, within the proviso of Subsection 2-207(1). As set forth in full above, the provision appearing on the face of Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s acknowledgment forms stated that the acceptances (or orders) were \u201csubject to all of the terms and conditions on the face and reverse side hereof, including arbitration, all of which are accepted by buyer.\u201d The provision on the \u201cAcknowledgment\u201d forms further stated that Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s terms would become the basis of the contract between the parties</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa0D\">\u201ceither (a) when signed and delivered by buyer to seller and accepted in writing by seller, or (b) at Seller\u2019s option, when buyer shall have given to seller specification of assortments, delivery dates, shipping instructions, or instructions to bill and hold as to all or any part of the merchandise herein described, or when buyer has received delivery of the whole or any part thereof, or when buyer has otherwise assented to the terms and conditions hereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1227-9\">Similarly, the provision on the \u201cCustomer Acknowledgment\u201d and \u201cSales Contract\u201d forms stated that the terms therein would become the basis of the contract</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-10\">\u201ceither (a) when signed and delivered by Buyer to Seller and accepted in writing by Seller or (b) when Buyer has received and retained this order for ten days without objection, or (c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>when Buyer has accepted delivery of any part of the merchandise specified herein or has furnished to Seller specifications or assortments, delivery dates, shipping instructions to bill and hold, or when Buyer has otherwise indicated acceptance of the terms hereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">Although Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s use of the words \u201csubject to\u201d suggests that the acceptances were conditional to some extent, we do not believe the acceptances were \u201cexpressly made conditional on [the buyer\u2019s] assent to the additional or different terms,\u201d as specifically required under the Subsection 2-207(1) proviso. In order to fall within this proviso, it is not enough that an acceptance is expressly conditional on additional or different terms; rather, an acceptance must be <em>expressly </em>conditional on the offeror\u2019s <em>assent </em>to those terms. Viewing the Subsection (1) proviso within the context of the rest of that Subsection and within the policies of Section 2-207 itself, we believe that it was intended to apply only to an acceptance which clearly reveals that the offeree is unwilling to proceed with the transaction unless he is assured of the offeror\u2019s assent to the additional or different terms therein. <em>See </em>1 W. Hawkland, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1.090303, at 21. That the acceptance is predicated on the offeror\u2019s assent must be \u201cdirectly and distinctly stated or expressed rather than implied or left to inference.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary (defining \u201cexpress\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-5\">Although the UCC does not provide a definition of \u201cassent,\u201d it is significant that Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s printed acknowledgment forms specified at least seven types of action or inaction on the part of the buyer which \u2014 sometimes at Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s option \u2014 would be deemed to bind the buyer to the terms therein. These ranged from the buyer\u2019s signing and delivering the acknowledgment to the seller \u2014 which indeed could have been recognized as the buyer\u2019s assent to Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s terms \u2014 to the buyer\u2019s retention of the acknowledgment for ten days without objection\u2014 which could never have been recognized as the buyer\u2019s assent to the additional or different terms where acceptance is expressly conditional on that assent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-10\">To recognize Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s acceptances as \u201cexpressly conditional on [the buyer\u2019s] assent to the additional terms\u201d therein, within the proviso of Subsection 2-207(1), would thus require us to ignore the specific language of that provision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Such an interpretation is not justified in view of the fact that Subsection 2-207(1) is clearly designed to give legal recognition to many contracts where the variance between the offer and acceptance would have precluded such recognition at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-11\">Because Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s acceptances were not expressly conditional on the buyer\u2019s assent to the additional terms within the proviso of Subsection 2-207(1), a contract is recognized under Subsection (1), and the additional terms are treated as \u201cproposals\u201d for addition to the contract under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>Subsection 2-207(2).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Since both Collins &amp; Aikman and The Carpet Mart are clearly \u201cmerchants\u201d as that term is defined in Subsection 2-104(1), the arbitration provision will be deemed to have been accepted by The Carpet Mart under Subsection 2-207(2) unless it materially altered the terms of The Carpet Mart\u2019s oral offers. T.C.A. \u00a7 47-2-207(2) (b) [UCC \u00a7 2-207(2) (b)].<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We believe that the question of whether the arbitration provision materially altered the oral offer under Subsection 2-207(2) (b) is one which can be resolved only by the District Court on further findings of fact in the present case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If the arbitration provision did in fact materially alter The Carpet Mart\u2019s offer, it could not become a part of the contract \u201cunless expressly agreed to\u201d by The Carpet Mart. T.C.A. \u00a7 47-2-207 [UCC \u00a7 2-207], Official Comment No. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-5\">We therefore conclude that if on remand the District Court finds that Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s acknowledgments were in fact acceptances and that the arbitration provision was additional to the terms of The Carpet Mart\u2019s oral orders, contracts will be recognized under Subsection 2-207(1). The arbitration clause will then be viewed as a \u201cproposal\u201d under Subsection 2-207(2) which will be deemed to have been accepted by The Carpet Mart unless it materially altered the oral offers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-11\">If the District Court finds that Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s acknowledgment forms were not acceptances but rather were confirmations of prior oral agreements between the parties, an application of Section 2-207 similar to that above will be required. Subsection 2-207(1) will require an initial determination of whether the arbitration provision in the confirmations was \u201cadditional to or different from\u201d the terms orally agreed upon. Assuming that the District Court finds that the arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>provision was not a term of the oral agreements between the parties, the arbitration clause will be treated as a \u201cproposal\u201d for addition to the contract under Subsection 2-207(2), as was the case when Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s acknowledgments were viewed as acceptances above. The provision for arbitration will be deemed to have been accepted by The Carpet Mart unless the District Court finds that it materially altered the prior oral agreements, in which case The Carpet Mart could not become bound thereby absent an express agreement to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\">As a result of the above application of Section 2-207 to the limited facts before us in the present case, we find it necessary to remand the case to the District Court for the following findings: (1) whether oral agreements were reached between\u2019the parties prior to the sending of Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s acknowledgment forms; if there were no such oral agreements, (2) whether the arbitration provision appearing in Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s \u201cacceptances\u201d was additional to the terms of The Carpet Mart\u2019s oral offers; and, if so, (3) whether the arbitration provision materially altered the terms of The Carpet Mart\u2019s oral offers. Alternatively, if the District Court does find that oral agreements were reached between the parties before Collins &amp; Aik-man\u2019s acknowledgment forms were sent in each instance, it will be necessary for the District Court to make the following findings: (1) whether the prior oral agreements embodied the arbitration provision appearing in Collins &amp; Aik-man\u2019s \u201cconfirmations\u201d; and, if not, (2) whether the arbitration provision materially altered the prior oral agreements. Regardless of whether the District Court finds Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s acknowledgment forms to have been acceptances or confirmations, if the arbitration provision was additional to, and a material alteration of, the offers or prior oral agreements, The Carpet Mart will not be bound to that provision absent a finding that it expressly agreed to be bound thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-10\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-11\">If, on remand, the District Court finds that the arbitration provision exists as a term of the contracts recognized under this application of Section 2-207, Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s motion for a stay pending arbitration must be granted despite the fact that this is an action in fraud. In Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U.S. 395, 87 S.Ct. 1801, 18 L.Ed.2d 1270 (1967), the Supreme Court held that in passing upon a motion for a stay pending arbitration under 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 3, a federal court may not consider claims of fraud in the inducement of the overall contract when the arbitration clause is sufficiently broad to encompass claims of fraud. Rather, in such cases a federal court may consider only claims which relate to the \u201cmaking\u201d of the arbitration agreement itself. 388 U.S. at 402-404, 87 S.Ct. 1801. In the present case, the language of Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s arbitration clause is virtually identical to that of the- arbitration agreement in the <em>Prima, Paint </em>case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, although The Carpet Mart challenges the legibility of the fine-print arbitration provision on the reverse side of Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s forms (which was specifically called to the buyer\u2019s attention on the face of those forms), The Carpet Mart\u2019s claim of fraud relates only to the substitutions for Kodel polyester fibers under the overall contract and ndt to the arbitration clause itself. Therefore, upon a finding by the District Court that the arbitration clause was a term of the contracts recognized under T.C.A. \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>47-2-207 (UCC \u00a7 2-207), Collins &amp; Aik-man\u2019s motion for a stay pending arbitration must be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-4\">For the reasons set forth above, the case is remanded to the District Court for further findings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1224-9\">. The District Court found that \u201c[Collins &amp; Aikman] has not established to this point that the aforementioned acknowledgment forms were received in each instance.\u201d The affidavit of J. A. Castle, a partner in The Carpet Mart, however, states that \u201c . . .1 would receive a yellow sheet of paper which I believed to be an acknowledgment that my order was being processed and was being sent to me.\u201d And at oral arguments before this Court, counsel for The Carpet Mart did not attempt to overcome the presumption that the acknowledgments, having been mailed in each instance according to William T. Hester\u2019s affidavit, were received. <em>See W. </em>E. Richmond &amp; Co. v. Security National Bank, 16 Tenn.App. 414, 64 S.W.2d 863 (1933); Roto-Lith, Ltd. v. F. P. Bartlett &amp; Co., 297 F.2d 497, 498 (1st Cir. 1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1227-6\">. In describing the second (offer-acceptance) situation to which Section 2-207 was intended to apply, Official Comment No. 1 describes the acceptance as a \u201cwire or letter\u201d but makes no such reference to a written offer. As in the situation where there is but one written confirmation sent subsequent to an oral agreement \u2014 which is expressly referred to in Comment No. 1 \u2014 we believe the drafters anticipated cases, such as the present one, where a written acceptance would be sent in response to an oral offer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1227-12\">. It is not inconceivable that a buyer might request that all claims be submitted to arbitration, <em>see </em>Universal Oil Products v. S.C.M. Corp., 313 F.Supp, 905 (D.Conn.1970), or that a buyer might orally submit to the seller\u2019s known policy of arbitration in order to facilitate acceptance of the offer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1228-6\">. The common law has never recognized silence or inaction as a mode of acceptance. <em>See </em>1 W. Hawkland, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1.-090301, at 17. Under the counter-offer approach which Section 2-207 was designed to modify, the offeror had to take receipt of and pay for the goods without objection before he was deemed to have accepted the terms of the counter-offer. And although Subsection 2-207(2) (c) provides that certain additional terms can be accepted by the offeror\u2019s failure to object, nothing in the Code suggests that silence or inaction can be recognized as an offeror\u2019s assent in the present context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1228-12\">. We are aware that at least two Courts of Appeals have not chosen to read the Subsection 2-207 (1) proviso as strictly as we do here. <em>See </em>Roto-Lith, Ltd. v. F. P. Bartlett &amp; Co., 297 F.2d 497, 499-500 (1st Cir. 1962) ; Construction Aggregates Corp. v. Hewitt-Robins, Inc., 404 F.2d 505, 509 (5th Cir. 1969) (dictum). <em>But see </em>Matter of Doughboy Industries, Inc., and Pantasote Co., 17 A.D.2d 216, 233 N.Y.S.2d 488 (1962). AVe believe, however, that the approach adopted here is dictated by both the language of the proviso and the purpose of Subsection 2-207(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1229-6\">. Apparently believing that Collins &amp; Aik-man's acknowledgments were acceptances \u201cexpressly . . . conditional on assent to the additional or different terms\u201d under the Subsection 2-207(1) proviso, the District Court recognized contracts between the parties under Subsection 2-207(3) since the subsequent performance by both parties clearly recognized the existence of a contract. Absent our conclusion that Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s acknowledgments do not fall within the Subsection 2-207 (1) proviso, we believe that the District Court correctly applied Subsection 2-207 (3) to Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s \u201cacceptances\u201d notwithstanding the fact that some of the language of that Subsection appears to refer to the typical situation under Section 2-207 where there exist both a written offer and a written acceptance. Although we recognize the value that writings by both parties serve in sales transactions, where Subsection 2-207 (3) is otherwise applicable we do not believe the purposes of that Subsection should be abandoned simply because the offeror chose to rely on his oral offer. In such a case, we believe that the District Court\u2019s comparison of the terms of the oral offer and the written acceptance under Subsection (3) would have been correct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1229-9\">. The parties do not dispute the fact that The Carpet Mart made no objections to the terms embodied in Collins &amp; Aikman\u2019s acknowledgments. Therefore, Subsection 2-207 (2) (c) is not relevant in the present case. And although it is not inconceivable that an oral offer could \u201cexpressly [limit] acceptance to the terms of the offer\u201d under Subsection 2-207 (2) (a), The Carpet Mart has never asserted that this was the nature of its offers to Collins &amp; Aikman. We are therefore concerned with only Subsection 2-207(2) (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1229-15\">. While T.C.A. \u00a7 47-2-207 [UCC \u00a7 2-207], Official Comment Nos. 4 and 5 provide examples of terms which would and would not materially alter a contract, an arbitration clause is listed under neither. Although we recognize the rule \u201cthat the agreement to arbitrate must be direct and the intention made clear, without implication, inveiglement or subtlety,\u201d Matter of Doughboy Industries, Inc., and Pantasote Co., 17 A.D.2d 216, 218, 233 N.Y.S.2d 488, 492 (1962) (indicating in dictum that an arbitration clause would materially alter a contract under 2-207(2) (b)), we believe the question of material alteration necessarily rests on the facts of each case. <em>See </em>American Parts Co. v. American Arbitration Ass\u2019n, 8 Mich.App. 156, 171, 154 N.W.2d 5, 14 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1230-6\">.
