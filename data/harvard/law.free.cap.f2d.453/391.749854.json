The complaint alleges that the refusal to furnish the notes of testimony denied \u201cPlaintiff access to the courts\u201d (page 5). In February 1967, plaintiff wrote the Clerk requesting a transcript of the criminal proceedings. On March 17, 1967, the President Judge wrote plaintiff that when the transcript had been \u201ccompleted, a copy will be forwarded to the Institution where they will be available for inspection upon request of the Officials there.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The complaint concludes by praying for (a) \u201cdamages in excess of $75,000 for causing [plaintiff] delay in submitting his grievances to the courts . . . \u201d, (b) a court order \u201cdirecting the defendants to make available copies of Trial Transcripts and Original Papers of Arrest and enjoining them from suppressing plaintiff from constructing his Legal Petitions,\u201d and (c) a court order directing that [an alleged] racist\u2019s picture be removed\u201d from apparently the State Correctional Institution at Huntingdon (see pp. 9-10 of complaint)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-14\">After careful consideration of the complaint, we have determined that \u201cits failure to state facts in support of its conclusions,\u201d see Gaito v. Ellenbogen, 425 F.2d 845, 849 (3d Cir. 1970); Negrich v. Hohn, 379 F.2d 213, 215 (3d Cir. 1967), and the judicial immunity of the defendants, acting as judicial and quasi-judicial officials, require the conclusion that the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the complaint. See Bauers v. Heisel, 361 F.2d 581 (3d Cir. 1966), cert, denied, 386 U.S. 1021, 87 S.Ct. 1367, 18 L.Ed.2d 457 (1967), and cases there cited; Lockhart v. Hoenstine, 411 F.2d 455, 459 (3d Cir. 1969) (prothonotary is a judicial or quasi-judicial officer entitled to immunity under the Civil Rights Acts); Stewart v. Minnick, 409 F.2d 826 (9th Cir. 1969) (court reporter and court clerk are quasi-judicial officers who \u201care clothed with judicial immunity\u201d); <em>cf. </em>Gaito v. Ellenbogen, <em>supra, </em>425 F.2d at 849.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-15\">The district court order will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-12\">. The only mention of defendant Carl M. Janavitz is that defendants \u201c. confederate and conspire with Defendant Janavitz, in obstructing and suppressing Plaintiff\u2019s right to legal assistance . . . \u201d (p. 7 of Complaint), but the respondent\u2019s brief states his official position. The above-quoted language is insufficient to state a cause of action under the Civil Rights Acts. See Negrich v. Hohn, 379 F.2d 213, 215 (3d Cir. 1967); Gaito v. Ellenbogen, 425 F.2d 845, 849 (3d Cir. 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b452-5\">.

The entire letter is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\">\u201cDear Mr. Marcedes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-8\">\u201cYour Request for Notes of Testimony is returned herewith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Avs\">\u201cPlease be advised that these are in the process of being transcribed.

The complaint, dated August 1, 1969, alleges that plaintiff is confined in the State Correctional Institution, Hunt-ingdon, Pennsylvania, \u201csubsequent to being transferred from the Western Diagnostic and Classification Center . . .\u201d which is in the Western Penitentiary, Allegheny County (P. O. Box 9901, Pittsburgh, Pa. 15233).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"pA0S\">. There is no showing that plaintiff has exhausted the administrative remedies available in the Pennsylvania correctional system insofar as this claim is concerned. See Gaito v. Prasse, 312 F.2d 169, 171-173 (3d Cir. 1963); United States ex rel. Wakeley v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 247 F.Supp. 7, 9 note 2 (E.D.Pa. 1965). Furthermore, in the context of the prison situation, this allegation does not allege a violation of civil rights. See Knuckles v. Prasse, 302 F.Supp. 1036, 1047 (E.D.Pa.1969), aff\u2019d, 435 F.2d 1255, 1257 (3d Cir. 1970); Gittlemacker v. Prasse, 428 F.2d 1 (3d Cir. 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
