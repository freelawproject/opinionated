Each pertained to a separate contract by Pinel-las, also executed in 1968, to construct an apartment building for Kalmia in the State of Florida. The construction jobs were not public works.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-24\">Houdaille, a subcontractor, sued United on the bonds in Florida state court, alleging that it had furnished labor and materials to Pinellas in the construction of the three buildings and had not been paid. It is undisputed that Hou-daille did not perfect a mechanic\u2019s lien on any of the three jobs. United removed to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>Since the bonds are identical, we discuss them in the singular. It contained the following condition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-4\">[I]f Principal shall . . . complete the work . . . and keep it free of liens for labor or material furnished in connection therewith, then this obligation shall be void; otherwise it shall remain in full force and effect, subject, however, to the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-7\">4. ... No right of action shall accrue on this bond to or for the use or benefit of any person other than the named Owner and Lender.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1109-9\">These conditions would appear to prevent recovery, because the bond did not refer to payment for labor or materials but to keeping the property free of liens, and Houdaille did not allege that it had perfected or was entitled to a lien. Also the terms limited causes of action on the bond to owner and lender, and Hou-daille was neither. Houdaille amended its complaint with the allegation that the bond was intended to comply with a certain construction contract, which was incorporated into the bond and which required that a payment and performance bond be given; that it was intended to comply with the payment bond provision of the Florida Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law, F.S.A. \u00a7 713.23; and that it was intended to comply with the Florida Insurance Code, F.S.A. \u00a7 627.0905.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-10\">Each construction contract provided that \u201ca performance and payment bond will be furnished by the Contractor.\u201d And the bond provided that the construction contract \u201cis hereby referred to and made a part hereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-11\">Houdaille moved for summary judg-ent and filed affidavits establishing the furnishing of the materials and the lack of payment. United filed affidavits that the intent of the bond was to assure the physical completion of the work and to protect only Kalmia as owner and Home Federal as lender. The motion for summary judgment was granted without explanation or statement of reasons.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> United appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-15\">Decision involves a complex interplay of Florida statutes and amendments thereto and Florida case law. While not required by Rule 56, F.R.Civ.P., a statement of reasons or opinion by the experienced Florida federal District Judge would have been of great assistance to this court. <em>See </em>Mallary v. United States, 238 F.Supp. 87 (M.D.Ga. 1965); Prudential Ins. Co. of America v. Goldstein, 43 F.Supp. 767 (E.D.N.Y. 1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-16\">We commence our examination of the statutes with F.S.A. \u00a7 627.0905, found in the chapter of the Insurance Code headed \u201cRates and Contracts,\u201d Part XI, \u201cSurety Insurance Contracts,\u201d which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-17\">(1) Whenever a surety insurer becomes a surety on a contract bond or bonds for either private or public construction in this state, such bond or bonds shall be either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-18\">(a) A combination bond containing both performance and payment provisions and in an amount not less than the total or estimated contract price, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-19\">(b) Separate bonds for performance and for payment, but in such instances both bonds shall be issued and each shall be in an amount not less than fifty per cent of the total or estimated contract price.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1109-21\">Prior to amendment of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law in 1963, discussed below, the Florida courts construed \u00a7 627.0905 as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>not requiring a payment bond in the sense of obligation of the surety to pay any and all parties for labor or materials furnished in connection with the performance of the contract. In American Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Martin Marietta Corp., 171 So.2d 435 (Fla.App.1965), a pre-1963 bond bound the surety to the owner \u201cas well as to all persons who may become entitled to liens under the contract. . . . \u201d Martin Marietta did not claim to be entitled to a lien because, as a supplier to a sub-subcontractor, it was not protected under the Florida Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law as it then existed, but it asserted that \u00a7 627.0905, when read into the bond, obligated the surety to pay it for the material supplied. This the court rejected, holding that the section only mandated uniformity of contractors\u2019 bonds by requiring them to be in one or the other alternative, and fixing the amount of each, and did not write into contractors\u2019 bonds a requirement that the bond be for the use and benefit of persons not entitled to a lien. <em>Accord, </em>American Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Charles Sales Corp., 203 So.2d 670 (Fla.App.1967) (post-1963 bond given by subcontractor to contractor).</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-6\">Even for those entitled to liens, the road to recovery on the contractor\u2019s bond was not always free from insurmountable obstacles. In Johnson Electric Co. v. Columbia Cas. Co., 101 Fla. 186, 133 So. 850 (1931) a material supplier to the contractor was held to have standing to sue on the contractor\u2019s bond, despite absence of any reference to the bond\u2019s being for the benefit of material-men, where the contract between owner and contractor called for a bond \u201cfor the protection of subcontractors and those furnishing labor and/or materials and/or supplies, to the contractor on this work.\u201d <em>See also </em>American Surety Co. of New York v. Smith, 100 Fla. 1012, 130 So. 440 (1930). The <em>Johnson </em>decision was sharply limited in Aetna Ins. Co. v. Estero Mfg. and Builders Supply, Inc., 174 So.2d 747 (Fla.App.1965). Pursuant to F.S.A. \u00a7 84.05(11), in effect prior to October 1, 1963, the owners of a motel required of the contractor building an addition a surety bond conditioned on faithful performance and payment of all claims for material furnished in the prosecution of the work. The court upheld refusal to entertain an unsatisfied subcontractor\u2019s suit on the bond, stating that the bond provision limiting a right of action thereon to the owners took the subcontractor from underneath the umbrella of <em>Johnson </em>protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-10\">Section 84.05(11), the only provision in the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law for surety bonds at the time the <em>Estero </em>bond was written, stated that if a direct contract called for expenditure in excess of $3000 an owner could require a surety bond conditioned to pay all laborers, subcontractors and materialmen. The statute neither gave persons so situated a direct right of action on the bond nor prohibited provision in the bond limiting the right of action thereon to the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-11\">Were this the present state of the law, we would be compelled to reverse on the basis of <em>Estero. </em>But in 1963 the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law was amended by the addition of what, with one change in 1965 not relevant here, is now \u00a7 713.23, which we set out in full in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This materially liberalized the scope of protection of persons supplying labor or materials. United Bonding Ins. Co. v. M. D. Moody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>&amp; Sons, Inc., 213 So.2d 263 (Fla.App. 1968). That section requires a condition in \u201cthe payment bond required to exempt an owner under . . . [The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law]\u201d \u201cthat such contractor shall promptly make payments to all persons supplying him labor, material and supplies used directly or indirectly by said contractor, subcontractor or subsubeontractor in the prosecution of the work provided in said contract.\u201d No notice of the furnishing of labor or materials to the contractor himself need be given, since he will have knowledge of it, but provision is made for notice to the contractor by one supplying labor, material or supplies \u201cused directly or indirectly in the prosecution of the work to any subcontractor or sub-subcontractor.\u201d Also the class of persons who may sue is broadened: \u201cAny lienor shall have direct right of action on such bond against the surety and no such bond shall contain any provisions restricting the classes of persons protected thereby . . .\u201d \u201cLienor\u201d does not mean one who has perfected his lien but one who is entitled to the benefits of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law regardless of whether he has taken steps to perfect. F.S.A. \u00a7 713.01(10); Crane Co. v. Fine, 221 So.2d 145, 150-151 (Fla.Sup.1969). A copy of the bond must be furnished to any lienor demanding the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-8\">United makes no contention to us that these interpretations of \u00a7 713.23 are incorrect, but takes the position that a \u00a7 713.23 bond is not mandatory on private construction. We agree, to the extent that it is not mandatory for the private owner to require a bond to protect lien claimants. The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law as a whole, and especially the provision in \u00a7 713.23 that \u201cthe payment bond required to exempt an owner under . . . [the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law] . . . \u201d, indicates that a bond may be utilized to provide the protection otherwise afforded by a lien. Section 713.02, headed \u201cTypes of lienors and exemptions\u201d, provides that in any direct contract the owner may require the contractor to furnish a payment bond as provided in \u00a7 713.23 and upon receipt of such bond the owner shall be exempt from the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law. Section 713.13(1) (a) requires the filing of a notice of commencement \u201cwhether or not a project has a payment bond complying with \u00a7 713.23.\u201d Section 713.13(1) (e) requires that notice include \u201cthe name and address of the surety on the payment bond under \u00a7 713.23, if any, and the amount of such bond.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>But we reject the theory that if the private owner rather than remaining subject to the lien laws chooses the alternative of a bond which protects against liens he may employ a bond other than a \u00a7 713.23 bond. It would subvert the effect of the 1963 amendment to allow two types of bonds safeguarding against liens on private work, a statutory bond in compliance with that section protecting a broadened class of persons described therein and exempting the owner from the entire mechanics\u2019 lien procedures, and a non-statutory bond conditioned on keeping the property free of a narrower class of obligations and on which suit may be brought only by owner or lender. This would perpetuate outside of \u00a7 713.-23 the type of bond provided for prior to the amendment of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">This case demonstrates the desirability of rejecting the surety\u2019s approach. The contract requires a \u201cpayment bond.\u201d The title and subject matter of \u00a7 713.23 are \u201cpayment bond.\u201d But the surety has produced affidavits of its agents that the instant bond was intended only to assure the physical completion of the work and to protect owner and lender against loss caused by the contractor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We bear in mind that in this diversity case we stand in the stead of the Florida state court and are therefore bound to construe \u00a7 713.23 liberally \u201cso as to afford the laborers and materialmen the greatest protection compatible with justice and equity,\u201d Hendry Lumber Co. v. Bryant, 138 Fla. 485, 189 So. 710 (1939). We find it is inconsistent with the aims of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law and the statutes allowing a bond in lieu of exposure to liens that the supplier to one other than the contractor be left in doubt and uncertainty as to whether he may rely on the bond or must perfect his lien, or to be completely safe must comply with conditions precedent to protect his rights under both routes, and if he chooses only the bond route then face the risk of oral testimony that the bond was intended to have an operative scope different than he thought.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-7\">We conclude that if the surety on private construction work issues a bond that purports to protect against mechanics\u2019 liens it must be construed and applied in accordance with the conditions and provisions of \u00a7 713.23. Our conclusions is buttressed, if not required, by two other sections of the Insurance Code, \u00a7 627.0117 and \u00a7 627.0111.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-8\">627.0117 <em>Validity of noncomplying contracts</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-9\">(1) Any insurance policy, rider, or endorsement hereafter issued and otherwise valid which contains any condition or provision not in compliance with the requirements of this code, shall not be thereby rendered invalid . . . but shall be construed and applied in accordance with such conditions and provisions as would have applied had such policy, rider, or endorsement been in full compliance with this code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-12\">627.0111 <em>Standard provisions, in general</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-13\">(1) Insurance contracts shall contain such standard or uniform provisions as are required by the applicable provisions of this code pertaining to contracts of particular kinds of insurance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1112-15\">Both \u00a7\u00a7 627.0117 and 627.0111 are found in the same chapter of the Insurance Code as \u00a7 627.0905, but in a different part, Part II, entitled \u201cThe Insurance Contract.\u201d Section 627.01001 defines the scope of Part II by excluding from its application certain types of insurance. Surety insurance is not excluded. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>Lest there by any doubt, a surety bond is included within the definition of insurance. <em>See </em>\u00a7 624.0405, \u201cSurety Insurance Defined,\u201d found in the Insurance Code chapter headed \u201cAdministrative and General Provisions\u201d, Part V, \u201cKinds of Insurance; Limits of Risk; Reinsurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-4\">In American Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Martin Marietta Corp. <em>supra, </em>the Florida court said that \u00a7 627.0905 \u201cdid not purport to and does not have the effect of writing into such bonds a requirement that the bond shall be for the use and benefit of persons who are not entitled to a lien under Ch. 84, Fla.Stats., as in effect prior to October 1, 1963.\u201d The plain implication is that \u00a7 627.0905 does have such effect when the person suing is entitled to a lien. The inference we draw is strengthened when we note the care taken by the court to limit its decision to pre-1963 lien law and when we recall that <em>Martin Marietta </em>was written in light of the liberalizing amendments to the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law that already had been put into effect. The language in these circumstances conveys to us an intent to restrict the narrow construction placed by the court on \u00a7 627.0905 to the framework of law existing when the bond in question was written.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">State of Florida for Use and Benefit of Westinghouse Elec. Supply Co. v. Wesley Constr. Co., 316 F.Supp. 490 (S.D.Fla.1970), does not persuade us to reach a different result. Wesley, as prime contractor, furnished to Florida Power &amp; Light, as owner, a surety bond written by Aetna. The bond was conditioned that Wesley perform its obligations free and clear of all liens arising out of claims for labor and material and that it \u201cpay all persons who shall have furnished labor or material directly to the Principal for use in the prosecution of the aforesaid work, each of which said persons shall have a direct right of action on this instrument in his own name and for his own benefit .\u201d Westinghouse, supplier of materials to a subcontractor, sued on the bond, contending it was a bond covered by \u00a7 713.23 and that the bond restriction which prohibited it from suing the surety was invalid. The court held held against Westinghouse, concluding first that the bond was not a \u00a7 713.23 bond because it did not comply with the mandatory provision of the statute that requires such bonds to be unrestricted as to the classes of persons who are protected thereby, and secondly that even if the bond were in compliance with \u00a7 713.23 Westinghouse would have no rights thereunder because it had failed to deliver the requisite written notice to the contractor within the period allowed, which is a condition precedent to the prosecution of any action on that type bond. The first ground for the court\u2019s conclusion appears contrary to the result we have reached. <em>Wesley </em>concerned five different theories for recovery based on two contracts and two bonds, and it does not appear that the District Judge considered the complex history of statutes and cases that we have outlined. In light of the second ground which fully disposed of the Westinghouse contention, we disregard the first as unnecessary. With regard to the second ground, no similar failure of condition has been raised in this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1113-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1109-12\">. Conflict between the affidavits and the amended complaint as to the alleged purposes to be served by the bond did not require denial of the motion for summary judgment. Under tlie view we take of this dispute, these differing versions were legally immaterial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1110-7\">. <em>\"Payment bond</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1110-8\">\u201cThe payment bond required to exempt an owner under parts I and II of this chapter and chapter So shall be furnished by the contractor in at least the amount of the original contract price before commencing the construction of the improvement under such direct contract. Such bond shall be executed as surety by a surety insurer authorized to do business in Florida and shall be conditioned that such contractor shall promptly make payments to all persons supplying him labor, material and supplies used directly or indirectly by said contractor, subcontractor or subsubcontractor in the prosecution of the work provided in said contract. The owner, contractor, or surety, parties or obligees under any such bond, shall furnish a true copy at cost of reproduction thereof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>to any lienor demanding the name and if any such person fails or refuses to furnish such copy without justifiable cause, he shall be liable to the lienor demanding the copy for any damages caused to such lienor by such refusal or failure. Any person supplying labor, material or supplies used directly or indirectly in the prosecution of the work to any subcontractor or subsub-contractor and who has not received payment therefor, shall, within ninety days after performance of the labor or after complete delivery of materials and supplies, deliver to the contractor written notice of the performance of such labor or delivery of such materials and supplies and the nonpayment therefor, and no action or suit for such labor or for such materials and supplies may be instituted or prosecuted against the contractor unless such notice has been given. Xo action or suit shall be instituted or prosecuted against the contractor or against the surety on the bond required in this section after one year from the (jerformance of the labor or completion of delivery of the materials and supjdies. Any lienor shall have direct right of action on such bond against the surety and no such bond shall contain any provisions restricting the classes of per-' sons protected thereby or the venue of any suit thereon. The surety shall not be entitled to the defense of pro tanto discharge as against any lienor because of changes or modifications in the contract to which the surety is not a party; provided that the liability of the surety shall not be increased beyond the penal sum of the bond. Except claimants in privity with the contractor and except laborers, no claimant shall recover on a bond or from the contractor unless he shall have complied with the provisions of \u00a7 713.06(2).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AN8p\">F.S.A. \u00a7 713.23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">. Our decision does not rest on insufficiency of the affidavits but on their irrelevance. Nevertheless we note that neither affidavit contains any reference to the word \u201clien,\u201d or specifically to the phrase in the bond that the principal must keep the property \u201cfree and clear of liens for labor or material furnished in connection [with the work].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1113-8\">. United alleged in its answer tliat there was a failure of condition precedent in that the owner had not fulfilled its contractual obligations to the contractor, principal on the bond. Florida has held that even a default by the owner that prevented the contractor from paying a materialman, so long as it is not participated in or authorized by the mate-rialman, does not defeat the latter\u2019s right to recover against the surety on the bond.
