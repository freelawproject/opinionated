At the outset of the strike strikers were granted welfare benefits if they were otherwise found eligible, as has been the practice in New York for many years. See Lascaris v. Wyman [I], 61 Misc.2d 212, 305 N.Y.S. 2d 212 (Sup.Ct. Onondaga County 1969). Shortly thereafter, however, defendant interpreted recent amendments to Section 131 of the New York Social Services Law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as prohibiting such ben<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>efits, refused to accept new welfare applications from strikers, and terminated the benefits of those who were already-receiving them without, in most cases, any notice or opportunity for a hearing. Plaintiffs then brought this class action for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that defendant\u2019s conduct infringed on their federal rights in several respects. By memorandum of October 8 and order of October 14, 1971, the district court granted a preliminary injunction, and ordered defendant to make retroactive and future payments to all strikers without regard to whether their unemployment was caused by a strike, and without requiring security for repayment if the controversy- were eventually to be decided against the claimants\u2019 contention. When defendant refused to comply, plaintiffs moved for an order adjudging defendant in civil contempt. The district court, without granting the relief requested, modified its previous order in certain respects not significant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">The complaint alleges that the district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337 (1970) because the claim, plaintiffs say, arises under an Act of Congress regulating commerce. Plaintiffs also assert jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 claiming a right to benefits under the Federal Food Stamp Program, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2011-2025 (1970), and the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 601-610 (1970), and an amount in controversy in excess of $10,000. The federal claims were also alleged to be vindicate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 (1970). Plaintiffs asserted that the termination of benefits without a hearing violated due process of law, and that the denial of benefits to strikers violated the right to strike as guaranteed by the first amendment, denied strikers the equal protection of the laws, and deprived them of property without due process of law. As a pendent claim, plaintiffs asserted that New York law prohibited the denial of welfare benefits to an applicant solely because he was on strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">The district court held that it had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337 (1970), and, with respect to plaintiffs who were not given a pre-termination hearing, under \u00a7 1343. See Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970). The court found that it had no jurisdiction under \u00a7 1331 because no individual claim exceeded $10,000, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>aggregation of claims was impermissible in this case. Snyder v. Harris, 394 U.S. 332, 89 S.Ct. 1053, 22 L.Ed.2d 319 (1969). The district court held that state law would probably require that the relief sought be granted despite the recent amendments, and its grant of a preliminary injunction was therefore extensively based on the pendent claim. The district court expressly refused to apply the doctrine of abstention.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">We reverse the finding that the district court had jurisdiction. Jurisdiction under \u00a7 1337 does not attach on the bare assertion that a right under an act regulating commerce is infringed. Facts must be alleged to show that federal law in the particular case creates a duty or remedy. See, <em>e. g., </em>Gully v. First National Bank, 299 U.S. 109, 118, 57 S.Ct. 96, 81 L.Ed. 70 (1936); Shoshone Mining Co. v. Rutter, 177 U.S. 505, 507, 20 S.Ct. 726, 44 L.Ed. 864 (1900); T. B. Harms Co. v, Eliscu, 339 F.2d 823 (2d Cir. 1964), cert, denied, 381 U.S. 915, 85 S.Ct. 1534, 14 L.Ed.2d 435 (1965). This, of course, is the requirement, so frequently referred to, that a ease arise \u201cdirectly\u201d under federal law. Mishkin, The Federal \u201cQuestion\u201d in the District Courts, 53 Colum.L.Rev. 157, 165, 168-69 (1953). See also Cohen, The Broken Compass: The Requirement That a Case Arise \u201cDirectly\u201d Under Federal Law, 115 U. Pa.L.Rev. 890 (1967).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As Professor Weehsler has said, \u201cThough the decisions are not free from vacillation, their essential purpose is to hold the meaning of the statute limited to cases where the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, the rule of substance under which he claims the right to have a remedy, is the product of federal law.\u201d Weehsler, Federal Jurisdiction and the Revision of the Judicial Code, 13 Law &amp; Contemp. Prob. 216, 225 (1948) (footnotes omitted). In the present action there is no basis whatever for the conclusion that the National Labor Relations Act or any other federal act regulating commerce creates a cause of action for these state welfare benefits which plaintiffs claim. The cases cited by the district court, Capital Service, Inc. v. N. L. R. B., 347 U.S. 501, 74 S.Ct. 699, 98 L.Ed. 887 (1954), and Gomez v. Florida State Employment Service, 417 F.2d 569 (5th Cir. 1969), are inapposite, since they clearly involved claims arising directly under the statutes involved. The claim here is so indirect and insubstantial that it provides no ground for federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 other jurisdictional allegations are equally insufficient. We accept the district court\u2019s finding that no individual claim is sufficient to satisfy the requirement of the amount in controversy of \u00a7 1331, and that aggregation of claims is impermissible. No colorable constitutional claim is presented to justify taking jurisdiction under \u00a7 1343. The argument that denying welfare benefits to strikers infringes their first amendment rights borders on the frivolous. The equal protection claim is almost as insubstantial since the basis of classification is clearly not unreasonable. Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 485, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970). Nor does Goldberg v. Kelly,. <em>supra, </em>support the claim of some plaintiffs that they were entitled, under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment, to a hearing before their benefits were terminated. The clear purpose of <em>Goldberg </em>hearings is to give eligible recipients an opportunity to prove the facts of their eligibility before their benefits are terminated, 397 U.S. at 264-267, 90 S.Ct. 1011. A hearing would be required, for example, if some of the recipients denied that they were strikers. The dispute here is on a point of law and there was no occasion for a hearing on the point. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Connecticut State Dep\u2019t of Public Welfare v. Dept. of H. E. W., 448 F.2d 209, 212 (2d Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Even if we had no question of jurisdiction, this would be a classic case for abstention. On the day after the district court\u2019s order of October 14, a New York court interpreted the new amendments to the New York statute as prohibiting welfare benefits to strikers, Lascaris v. Wyman [II], 327 N.Y.S.2d 379 (Sup.Ct. Onondaga County 1971), thus reaching a result contrary to the district court\u2019s holding. That ease will no doubt be appealed, and the question settled by the state courts. See Reetz v. Bozanich, 397 U.S. 82, 90 S.Ct. 788, 25 L.Ed.2d 68 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">We need not reach the argument urged by appellant, and particularly by the intervenor, that <em>granting </em>welfare benefits to strikers conflicts with the national labor policy. See ITT Lamp Division v. Minter, 435 F.2d 989 (1st Cir. 1970), cert, denied, 402 U.S. 933, 91 S.Ct. 1526, 28 L.Ed.2d 868 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-11\">. 1.
