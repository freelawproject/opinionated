Appellant sought damages for breach of appellees\u2019 warranty of title to personal property and, alternatively, damages for fraud in inducing him to purchase the personalty that he alleged was worthless. The district court ruled that appellant\u2019s resale of the personalty prior to instituting suit deprived him of his status as the real party in interest and that the real party in interest was appellant\u2019s vendee, a corporation domiciled in Oregon, as were the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-25\"> Because there was no federal right in issue, the district court was required to apply the law of Oregon in ascertaining appellant\u2019s status as an appropriate party. (Peters v. Lines (9th Cir. 1960) 275 F.2d 919.) Under Oregon law, the appellant\u2019s right to maintain his action for breach of warranty in the sale of personalty is unaffected by the vendee\u2019s resale of the property prior to the institution of suit. (J. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>Latture Equipment Co. v. Gruendlar Papent C. &amp; P. Co. (1930) 133 Or. 421, 289 P. 1067.)</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Appellees argue that the order can nevertheless be affirmed because the appellant could not prevail on the merits. The district court did not purport to reach the merits, and neither do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The order is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
