United States, 339 F.2d 389 (1964), cert, denied 381 U.S. 917, 85 S.Ct. 1545, 14 L.Ed.2d 437. We held that a person released on bail was not \u201cin custody,\u201d actual or constructive, so as to satisfy 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1312-24\">Appellant Hensley urges that <em>Matysek </em>has been implicitly overruled by the recent Supreme Court cases of Walker v. Wainwright, 390 U.S. 335, 88 S.Ct. 962, 19 L.Ed.2d 1215 (1968); Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U.S. 54, 88 S.Ct. 1549, 20 L.Ed.2d 426 (1968) and Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U.S. 234, 88 S.Ct. 1556, 20 L.Ed.2d 554 (1968). These cases are dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>tinguishable because in each of them there existed actual or constructive custody. In <em>Walker </em>and <em>Rowe, </em>the petitioners were in actual custody and in <em>Carafas, </em>the petitioner was on parole. In <em>Matysek, </em>this court, while recognizing that release on parole constituted constructive custody, distinguished a bail situation holding that the attendant restrictions did not constitute custody. The Supreme Court has not, to this date, considered the express question posed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-5\">We feel, therefore, constrained to follow Matysek v. United States, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1313-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1312-16\">. Hensley has been at liberty on recognizance at all times since conviction. Initially the state court stayed execution of sentence. At the exhaustion of Hensley\u2019s state remedies the district court issued a stay of execution pending habeas proceedings therein. Both the district court and this court denied a stay of execution pending this appeal. Subsequently, the Circuit Justice granted the stay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1312-25\">. We are unable to treat this petition as one seeking coram nobis relief because Hensley seeks to challenge a state court proceeding in federal court. Coram nobis lies only to challenge errors occurring in the same court. 7 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 60.14, p. 46.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1312-26\">. The decisional rule is different in several other circuits. Capler v. Greenville, 422 F.2d 299 (5th Cir. 1970); Burris v. Ryan, 397 F.2d 553 (7th Cir. 1968); Ouletta v. Sarver, 428 F.2d 804 (8th Cir. 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
