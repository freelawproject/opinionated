The District Judge granted the motion to dismiss, D.C., 310 F.Supp. 230, basing his decision on the recent Supreme Court decision in Rodrigue v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Company, 395 U.S. 352, 89 S.Ct. 1835, 23 L.Ed.2d 360 (decided June 9, 1969), which the Trial Court held required the application of the Louisiana one-year prescriptive period thus barring this suit. The Trial Judge declined to restrict the holding in <em>Rodrigue </em>to a prospective effect as requested by appellant Guillory.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-24\"> The Supreme Court in the latest case on the subject, Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U.S. 97, 92 S.Ct. 349, 30 L.Ed.2d 296 (decided December 6, 1971), said, however, in a matter involving the identical principle of law, that \u201ca weigh<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>ing of the equities requires nonretroac-tive application of the state statute of limitations here.\u201d Id., 404 U.S. at 109, 92 S.Ct. at 356. In the present case the injuries were sustained and suit was filed prior to the decision in <em>Rodrigue. </em>Thus, according to the prospective application rule announced in <em>Huson, </em>the suit has not prescribed under the Louisiana statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is erroneous and must be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
