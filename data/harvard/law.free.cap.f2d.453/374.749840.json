It also found that the company violated \u00a7 8(a) (3) and (1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(a) (3), (1), by discharging two employees because of union activities. The Board further found that the company violated \u00a7 8(a) (5) and (1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(a) (5), (1), by refusing to recognize and bargain with the Union on the basis of a majority of authorization cards. The Board determined that the bargaining order was an appropriate remedy because the company\u2019s unfair labor practices made it unlikely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>that their coercive effects would be neutralized by conventional remedies so as to produce a fair election.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Respondent contends that there is not substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support the Board\u2019s findings of unfair labor practices and that the bargaining order is not an appropriate remedy for any unfair labor practices which may have been committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">We determine that there was sufficient evidence on the record considered as a whole to substantiate the findings of fact made by the Board and we further determine that these findings justify the legal conclusions reached and that the remedy is appropriate. <em>See </em>N. L. R. B. v. Gissel Packing, 395 U.S. 575, 89 S. Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">For these reasons, we hereby order enforcement of the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
