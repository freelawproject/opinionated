S.C. \u00a7 659 (theft of goods from an interstate shipment of freight) and with conspiring to steal goods from interstate freight in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (conspiracy). Ashton challenges the sufficiency of the evidence and the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-26\">The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Government (Glasser v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>United States (1942) 315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680), showed that a semi-trailer containing 32 rolls of carpeting was shipped by rail from Georgia to California. The trailer arrived in California on June 23, 1969, and was parked in the Southern Pacific Railroad\u2019s Piggyback Yard. The Trailer was stolen the next day, June 24. The rugs were recovered from Rushton\u2019s carpet store following a tip by informant Anderson who participated in the theft and who testified for the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">The testimony of several witnesses tied Ashton into the theft and conspiracy in the following particulars. Ashton was present at Luigi\u2019s Restaurant on the afternoon of the theft when Anderson arrived with the tractor truck used to tow the stolen trailer from the Piggyback Yard. Ashton was later seen driving around the Yard while the trailer was being removed. Ashton arrived at the carpet store before the trailer, announced the arrival of the rugs, directed their unloading, and demanded payment for the rugs from Rushton\u2019s son. In Ashton\u2019s presence, the trailer was wiped clean to destroy any incriminating fingerprints. The next day Ashton paid Anderson and his driver each $250 for their efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Ashton\u2019s theory that Anderson hired him to unload the rugs did not convince the jury. After reviewing the record, we cannot say that the jury was wrong. (See United States v. Nelson (9th Cir. 1969) 419 F.2d 1237.)</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Secondly, Ashton argues that the court erred by refusing to give a requested instruction on interpreting circumstantial evidence and on reasonable doubt. The Government contends that other instructions given by the court contained correct statements of the law on these points. We have perused the court\u2019s instructions and find no error. (See Mull v. United States (9th Cir. 1968) 402 F.2d 571, 575, cert, denied (1969) 393 U.S. 1107, 89 S,Ct. 917, 21 L.Ed.2d 804.)</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
