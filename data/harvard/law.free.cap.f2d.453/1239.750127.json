The trial court dismissed on the basis of Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135, 71 S.Ct. 153, 95 L.Ed. 152 (1950). The complaint alleges that the treatment evaluation and medical care given decedent by various army physicians and hospitals was \u201cdeficient, negligent and unwarranted, causing extreme pain, mental disorder and anguish\u201d to deceased and his wife, and that \u201cplaintiffs have suffered the loss of companionship, the loss of father\u2019s ability to produce income and support to both plaintiffs, which are calculated in the amount of $884,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-20\">Initially, we observe that the plaintiffs, in opposition to the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss, contend <em>Feres </em>does not control because plaintiffs were not members of the Armed Forces at the time of the negligent act and the injuries received by both plaintiffs did not arise out of', or in the course of, activity incident to service because both plaintiffs were civilians at the time the injuries and damages were suffered. Plaintiffs contend that as wife and child of decedent they have a separate and independent cause of action for mental suffering and anguish under the Civil Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>of Puerto Rico. 31 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 5141. See Commercial Union Insurance Company v. Gonzalez Rivera, 358 F.2d 480, 482-483. (C.A.5 1966). The mere fact that the cause of action is not derivative under local law, but is an original and distinct cause of action granted to the heirs and personal representatives to recover damages sustained by them by reason of the wrongful death of the decedent, does not remove it from the prohibition of <em>Feres. </em>Van Sickel v. United States, 285 F.2d 87 (C.A.9 1960); United States v. Lee, 400 F.2d 558 (C.A.9 1968), cert, denied, 393 U.S. 1053, 89 S.Ct. 691, 21 L.Ed.2d 695 (1969). In <em>Feres, </em>340 U.S. at p. 143, 71 S.Ct. 153, the Supreme Court made it clear that an accident of geography would not be determinative of the applicable law. The controlling rule is that the Government is not liable under the Act \u201cfor injuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service,\u201d <em>Feres </em>at p. 146, 71 S.Ct. at 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-6\">In the case at hand, the damage claim for loss of \u201ccompanionship,\u201d \u201cfather\u2019s ability to produce income and support to both plaintiffs\u201d is, under the allegations of the complaint, incident to decedent\u2019s service. On this basis the trial court was fully justified in dismissing the complaint. However, we further note that in appellant\u2019s brief and argument before this Court it is claimed that appellant wife \u201cwas present throughout the treatment and witnessed and suffered the grave consequences of the inadequate care given to her husband.\u201d Although appellants\u2019 prayer for damages refers only to \u201closs of companionship\u201d and to loss of the decedent\u2019s \u201cability to produce income,\u201d appellants also apparently raise some claim of a separate and independent tort to the wife based on mental anguish arising from her observations of the inadequate care given her deceased husband. <em>See </em>Prosser, The Law of Torts, 181 (2d ed. 1955). Even if this claim were adequately specified and damages claimed therefor, we are satisfied that this allegation would not remove the incident-to-service limitation of <em>Feres. </em>We would be unwilling to depart therefrom even if we were able to do so. <em>Cf. </em>Hall v. United States, 451 F.2d 353 (1st Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
