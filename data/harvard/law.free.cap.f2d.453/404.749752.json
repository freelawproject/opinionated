On July 29, 1971, we issued our order herein in connection with appellants\u2019 motion for an injunction pending appeal and, alternatively, for an expedited hearing, in which we denied the motion for an injunction, ordering that the District Judge\u2019s order of July 8, 1971, remain in full force and effect subject to the filing of a redistricting plan on or before December 1, 1971. We also ordered that upon approval of a legally sufficient plan by the District Court, in any event not later than May 16, 1972, that the District Court order a final election for a board of supervisors be held under the laws of the State of Mississippi in the respective districts of Issaquena County. Later, on August 24, 1971, we declined to grant appellants\u2019 motion for voluntary dismissal and remand pending disposition of this appeal on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-19\">The briefs of all parties have been received by the Court on the merits and the parties, appellants and appellees (as well as the United States as amicus curiae), request that we remand this case to the District Court with instructions to proceed in accordance with our order of July 29, 1971. We have concluded that the course of action suggested by the parties is desirable and would be an appropriate disposition of this case on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-20\">We are also requested by appellants to determine alleged ambiguities in our order of July 29, 1971, relative to whether the District Court is required to order the new election prior to May 16, 1972, or at some later date; and to determine whether \u201cfinal election\u201d referred to therein, means a general or special election.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-21\">Accordingly, we herewith remand this ease to the District Court with directions to proceed and dispose of same in accordance with our prior order of July 29, 1971. The District Court shall enter its <em>order </em>not later than May 16, 1972, requiring that a final election be held as soon as is reasonably possible thereafter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>under the laws of the State of Mississippi. We shall leave for initial consideration and determination of the District Court the question of the manner and form of the election, whether general or special, all in accordance, however, with the laws of the State of Mississippi which are appropriate under the facts and circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
