Tenney presiding, on one count of perjury in violation of 18 U.S. C. \u00a7 1621<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which arose from his allegedly false testimony before a referee in an 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 44(a) bankruptcy examination. Judge Tenney, in a thorough memorandum opinion dated April 15, 1971, 326 F.Supp. 469, denied appellant\u2019s motion for acquittal or, alternatively, a new trial, and on April 21, 1971, sentenced him to six months\u2019 probation and a $2,000 fine. We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-16\">Appellant was the president and sole owner of Samuel Bronston Productions, Inc., which between 1958 and 1964, by itself or through seventeen affiliated companies, produced a large number of motion picture spectaculars, including \u201cEl Cid,\u201d \u201cCircus World\u201d and \u201cThe Fall of the Roman Empire.\u201d With business offices scattered throughout the world, and with investment per movie as high as $17 million, the Bronston companies had accounts in numerous banks in several countries; in 1962, for instance, there were 37 accounts in five countries. As president of the principal company bearing his name, Bronston personally supervised virtually all of the transactions involving each of those accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-17\">In June 1964, following the withdrawal of support by a principal financier earlier in the year, Samuel Bronston <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>Productions, Inc., petitioned for an arrangement with its creditors pursuant to Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 et seq. A Section 21(a) hearing was held on June 10, 1966, before an appointed referee, to determine the existence and location of the company\u2019s assets for the benefit of its creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">Samuel Bronston, while under oath at the hearing, responded as follows to questions regarding bank accounts in Switzerland:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">Q. Do you have any bank accounts in Swiss banks, Mr. Bronston? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">Q. Have you ever? A. The company had an account there for about six months, in Zurich.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">Q. Have you any nominees who have bank accounts in Swiss banks? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-8\">Q. Have you ever? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABt\">It was this colloquy which formed the basis of the Government\u2019s perjury charge against appellant. At the trial the Government produced two witnesses who testified and introduced documents showing that in October 1959 Bronston had opened an account in his own name at the International Credit Bank in Geneva, Switzerland. Under Swiss law, the account was secret, although it was not a numbered account. The account was active from its opening until 1962, when it became dormant; it was closed in 1964. During its period of activity, checks drawn on the account totalled over $100,000; some of the transfers from the account were made to Samuel Bronston Productions, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">Appellant did not testify at his trial, and the thrust of his witnesses\u2019 testimony was that the account was no secret, since in 1965 Bronston had executed a waiver of secrecy for the benefit of all creditors in respect to all Swiss banks. Nevertheless, while it was never disputed that Bronston\u2019s company had had an account in Zurich for six months, the Government proved to the satisfaction of the jury that Bronston intentionally had not told the whole truth at the hearing regarding his Swiss bank accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">The questions posed by this appeal are whether an answer under oath, which is true \u2014 but only half true \u2014 can constitute perjury under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621; and whether the evidence against Bronston is sufficient to sustain his conviction. Materiality has been conceded.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">Bronston\u2019s principal arguments center on the question asked him, which was the basis of the indictment, \u201cHave you ever [had any bank accounts in Swiss banks] ?\u201d First, he contends that the word \u201cyou\u201d made the question ambiguous so that he could not understand whether the question referred to him personally or to his companies; he urges that a question of such imprecision cannot support a conviction for perjury. Second, appellant argues that, whether or not the question was ambiguous, the Government failed to prove that he remembered the account at the time of the examination, and since his response regarding the Zurich account was true, there was not a sufficient evidentiary basis for the jury\u2019s finding that Bron-ston intentionally had given false testimony in the bankruptcy proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-14\">A crucial element of the crime of perjury is the belief of the defendant concerning the verity of his sworn testimony. United States v. Winter, 348 F.2d 204, 210 (2d Cir.), cert, denied, 382 U.S. 955, 86 S.Ct. 429, 15 L.Ed.2d 360 (1965). In order to support a perjury conviction, the question asked must be of such clarity that it is capable of eliciting an answer which the defendant knows to be false; that is, it must adequately test the defendant\u2019s belief in the truthfulness of his answer. United States v. Wall, 371 F.2d 398, 400 (6th Cir. 1967). Accordingly, a defendant may not lawfully be convicted of perjury where, under oath, he gives an answer which is \u201cliterally accurate, technically responsive, or legally truthful.\u201d Blumenfeld v. United States, 306 F.2d 892, 897 (8th Cir. 1962); Smith v. United States, 169 F.2d 118, 121 (6th Cir. 1948); Hart v. United States, 131 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>59, 61 (9th Cir. 1942); United States v. Slutzky, 79 F.2d 504, 505 (3rd Cir. 1935); Galanos v. United States, 49 F.2d 898, 899 (6th Cir. 1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Here, Bronston would have us rule that the question upon which his conviction is predicated was misleading, imprecise and suggestive of various interpretations, thus making it incapable of supporting the conviction. To the contrary, we believe that the question was readily susceptible of a responsive reply and that it adequately tested the defendant\u2019s belief in the veracity of his answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The principal question was preceded by the question, \u201cDo you have any bank accounts in Swiss banks, Mr. Bron-ston?\u201d The \u201cyou\u201d in \u201cHave you ever?\u201d could in the singular refer only to Mr. Bronston, or in the plural to Mr. Bronston personally and the company, there being no plausible suggestion that in the next question the examiner had shifted from inquiring about Bronston\u2019s personal accounts to those solely of his company. By answering in reference to \u201cthe company\u201d Bronston indicated his understanding that \u201cyou\u201d included, or meant only, the personal you; otherwise, he would not have distinguished his answer by prefacing it with \u201cthe company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Thus, this is not the Wall<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> case, where the question was \u201csusceptible of two different interpretations,\u201d under one of which the answer might have been truthful. Nor is it the <em>Galanos </em><footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ease, where the question was precise and the answer similarly precise, literally true and wholly responsive to the exact inquiry. Here the question unambiguously asked Bronston simply to state whether he had ever had a Swiss bank account. Yet Bronston answered that \u201c[t]he company\u201d , had had an account in Zurich for six months. While that much of the answer was literally true, the jury was entitled to find that the an-. swer as given was intended to represent that Bronston personally did not have such an account.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">Bronston contends, however, that the truth in the half-truth response takes his answer out of the realm of perjury, citing United States v. Slutzky, <em>supra, </em>and United States v. Cobert, 227 F.Supp. 915 (S.D.Cal.1964). But under analysis, those cases do not aid him.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">In <em>Slutzky </em>the defendant was asked whether he had ever been convicted of a felony in a certain jurisdiction. His answer was a truthful and responsive \u201cno,\u201d since in that jurisdiction there was no classification of crimes into felonies and misdemeanors. <em>Cobert </em>is also unlike the present case, for there a defendant was charged with perjury for answering a question relative to a \u201clisting post\u201d when it did not appear from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>common knowledge or in the indictment that he understood the phrase \u201clisting post.\u201d The questions posed to Bronston, however, were too plain to be construed as referring solely to the company; his nonresponsive answer very clearly indicated his comprehension of what was called for by the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">For the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621, an answer containing half of the truth which also constitutes a lie by negative implication, when the answer is intentionally given in place of the responsive answer called for by a proper question, is perjury. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. Rao, 394 F.2d 354, 356-357 (2d Cir.), cert, denied, 393 U.S. 845, 89 S.Ct. 129, 21 L.Ed.2d 116 (1968). This must be so especially in the context of a Section 21(a) examination, which by its nature is a searching expedition, where the witnesses are the only parties who know the truth and are able to divulge it. \u201cThe general purpose of the statute [11 U.S.C. \u00a7 44(a)] is to provide a method for a searching inquiry into the condition of the estate of the bankrupt, to assist in discovering and collecting the assets, and to develop facts and circumstances which bear upon the question of discharge.\u201d Travis v. United States, 123 F.2d 268, 271 (10th Cir. 1941); <em>see </em>Cameron v. United States, 231 U.S. 710, 717, 34 S.Ct. 244, 58 L.Ed. 448 (1914); Sigman v. United States, 320 F.2d 176, 177-178 (9th Cir. 1963), cert denied, 375 U.S. 967, 84 S.Ct. 485, 11 L.Ed.2d 415 (1964). A half-truth containing a lie, interjected by a knowledgeable and interested witness, may result in side-tracking the person inquiring into the existence of assets known only to the bankrupt. Or it may persuade the interrogator to proceed on another line of questioning. See United States v. Stone, 429 F.2d 138, 140-141 (2d Cir. 1970). Either consequence is contrary to the \u201cwhole truth\u201d principle of the oath.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The question here was not from out of the blue or on a collateral matter. The Section 21(a) examination was for the very purpose\u2014 known to appellant \u2014 of eliciting the kind of information this question called for.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">Since we cannot say as a matter of law that Bronston\u2019s half-truth answer to the question asked will not support his conviction, his appeal must fail unless we find a lack of evidence to support the jury\u2019s determination of guilt. Upon review, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, and all permissible inferences will be drawn in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">Appellant claims that there was an insufficient showing that he remembered his personal Swiss bank account and intentionally neglected to disclose it. Specifically, he argues that the account was dormant for four years before the question and was closed two years before, that it was only a small part of a large stream of widespread banking activity, and that in 1965 his creditors had received a waiver of bank secrecy which would have permitted them to locate the International Credit Bank account, so that, in effect, that account was no secret. The Government presented contradictory or qualifying evidence in reply.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number> In short, the jury was presented with conflicting facts relative to Bronston\u2019s state of mind at the time he answered the bank account questions. While the defendant\u2019s. knowledge of the falsity of his statements at the time he gave them is essential to a perjury conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621, United States v. Sweig, 441 F.2d 114, 117 (2d Cir.), cert, denied, 403 U.S. 932, 91 S.Ct. 2256, 29 L.Ed.2d 711 (1971); United States v. Stone, 429 F.2d 138, 140 (2d Cir. 1970); La Placa v. United States, 354 F.2d 56, 58 (1st Cir. 1965), cert, denied, 383 U.S. 927, 86 S.Ct. 932, 15 L.Ed.2d 846 (1966), absent an admission by the defendant, the only way that his knowledge can be determined is through circumstantial evidence. American Communications Ass\u2019n, CIO v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 411, 70 S.Ct. 674, 94 L.Ed. 925 (1950); United States v. Sweig, <em>supra. </em>The kinds of circumstantial evidence which the jury properly may consider as reflecting the defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time of allegedly perjurious testimony are proof of the objective falsity itself, proof of a motive to lie, and other facts showing that the defendant knew more than he stated. <em>See </em>United States v. Sweig, <em>supra; </em>United States v. Rao, <em>supra; </em>United States v. Jones, 374 F.2d 414, 419 (2d Cir.), cert, denied, 389 U.S. 835, 88 S.Ct. 40, 19 L.Ed.2d 95 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Here the jury could have inferred that Bronston willfully gave false and evasive testimony from the conclusive proof of the existence of his personal Geneva bank account; from the motive that the principal officer and owner of a debtor corporation might want to conceal assets from the corporation\u2019s creditors; and from the unlikelihood that a businessman would forget a bank account that had the duration of this account, a $100,000-plus volume of transactions in it, and was of a secret nature. Thus, there having been sufficient evidence upon which the jury could have established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-11\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621 reads in pertinent part: Whoever, having taken an oath before a competent tribunal officer, or person, in any case in which a law of the United States authorizes an oath to be administered, that he will testify . truly, . . . willfully and contrary to such oath states . . . any material matter which he does not believe to be true, is guilty of perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"AHg\">Mr. Bronston was acquitted by the jury of the second of the two perjury counts charged against him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b618-7\">. United States v. Wall, 371 F.2d 398, 400 (6th Cir. 1967). There the basis of the conviction was the defendant\u2019s response to the question, \u201cHave you ever been on trips with Mr. X?\u201d On defendant\u2019s motion for a bill of particulars the Assistant United States Attorney acknowledged that \u201con a trip\u201d \u201ccan mean either one of two things: That a person accompanied somebody else travelling with, or it can mean that they were there at a particular place with, a person.\u201d The difference between <em>'Wall </em>and Bronston\u2019s interpretation of \u201cyou\u201d is apparent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b618-8\">. Galanos v. United States, 49 F.2d 898 (6th Cir. 1931). There the defendant responded truthfully to a question which was ultimately, from the Government\u2019s angle, so precise as to be imprecise. When asked whether \u201cyou [had] made arrangements yourself,\u201d defendant replied negatively. In fact, an accomplice had made the arrangements. The Sixth Circuit overturned defendant\u2019s conviction for perjury, reciting the following language which appellant would have us apply to his situation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-13\">. . . [H]is negative answer was literally true. Clearly he cannot be convicted of perjury merely because his literally accurate answer might have been somewhat modified in effect if he had been asked to state all the circumstances. Perhaps, if he had been asked specifically, he would have answered truly. 49 F.2d at 899.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-15\">Here, had further testimony as to the company\u2019s account been elicited, the creditors would still have been in the dark about Bronston\u2019s personal account.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b619-6\">. The Bankruptcy Act and the orders thereunder do not specify a particular form of oath to be administered in bankruptcy proceedings, <em>compare </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 43, 44; Bankruptcy Gen.Order 22, 28 U.S.C. Under Gen.Order 22, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \u2014 insofar as they are not inconsistent with the Act and orders \u2014 govern the examination of witnesses, but the Federal Rules themselves do not contain the form of a designated oath. The forms used in bankruptcy procedures, however, speak in terms of truth according to the person\u2019s best knowledge [Bankruptcy Form 1, 28 U.S.C.] or truth and completeness to the best of his knowledge [Bankruptcy Form 3, 28 U.S.C.]. It may be deduced from these orders and forms and the purpose of the Act that an oath given in a bankruptcy proceeding basically takes the same form, and has the same legal consequences, as an oath composed of the traditional words of \u201ctruth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.\u201d <em>See </em>6 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1818 (3d ed. 1940).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b619-12\">. The jury could have been more impressed by the facts that the purported waiver of bank secrecy referred to all banks in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>Switzerland and listed seventeen company names under which an account could have been opened (creating the proverbial needle-in-the-haystack situation) ; and that one of Bronston\u2019s own corporate officers, who had prepared appellant\u2019s tax returns for several years in the early 1960\u2019s, testified on cross-examination to the effect that he did not know about the Geneva account at the time it was active.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b620-7\">LUMBARD, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A_9\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">The majority states the issue in this case in a manner which is unacceptable to me. The issue is not \u201cwhether an answer under oath, which is true \u2014 but only half true \u2014 can constitute perjury under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621,\u201d for this phraseology intimates that Bronston\u2019s answer was somehow half false, and even the majority cannot help but recognize that \u201cit was never disputed that Bronston\u2019s company had had an account in Zurich for six months. . . . \u201d I think the issue is better stated as whether a perjury conviction can stand when the defendant\u2019s answer to a question under oath is literally truthful but unresponsive. I further think the answer is that it cannot, even if the defendant\u2019s answer is motivated by a willful attempt to conceal some material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">During a section 21(a) hearing under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act Bronston was asked by the referee, \u201cDo you have any bank accounts in Swiss banks, Mr. Bronston?\u201d He responded in the negative. The next question was \u201cHave you ever?\u201d and Bronston replied, \u201cThe company had an account there for about six months, in Zurich.\u201d For this reply he has been convicted of perjury, and the majority affirms today notwithstanding the unchallenged accuracy of Bronston\u2019s statement, unequivocal case law, and the clear words of the perjury statute requiring for conviction that a person under oath willfully state \u201cany <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>material matter which he does not believe to be true.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The majority acknowledges that \u201cA crucial element of the crime of perjury is the belief of the defendant concerning the verity of his sworn testimony [citation omitted],\u201d that \u201cIn order to support a perjury conviction, the question asked must be . capable of eliciting an answer which the defendant knows to be false [citation omitted],\u201d and that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s knowledge of the falsity of his statements at the time he gave them is essential to a perjury conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621 [citation omitted].\u201d Yet in face of these clear statements of the law and the equally clear wording of the statute the majority finds that, while Bronston\u2019s answer was truthful, \u201cthe jury was entitled to find that the answer as given was intended to represent that Bronston personally did not have such an account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">On the contrary, I believe that once testimony is found truthful there can be no perjury conviction as a matter of law, and the jury is not entitled to consider whether the defendant hoped that a truthful answer would be interpreted in any particular way. Whether Bron-ston\u2019s answer was calculated to mislead the questioner and frustrate the bankruptcy proceedings should not here concern us. We should inquire into his state of mind only to determine whether or not he believed in the truthfulness of his answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">The confusion betrayed by the majority may well result from a misperception of several cases which Bronston cites.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">In Galanos v. United States, 49 F.2d 898 (6th Cir. 1931), the defendant was asked \u201cDon\u2019t you remember that you made arrangements yourself for the making of a bond?\u201d He replied he did not, frustrating an attempt to prove his association with the party in need of a bond. His conviction for perjury was reversed, the court noting that, although he participated in negotiations leading to the making of the bond, he was entitled to consider the question as an inquiry whether he <em>himself </em>had procured the bond, and that his negative answer was consequently true.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">The nature and scope of the question was also involved in United States v. Slutzky, 79 F.2d 504 (3rd Cir. 1935). The defendant was asked whether he had ever been convicted of a felony, and his negative response was found literally accurate because New Jersey, where he had been convicted of crime, did not classify any crimes as felonies. Thus his perjury conviction was overturned.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-14\">In United States v. Wall, 371 F.2d 398 (6th Cir. 1967), an interpretation of the question also decided whether the defendant\u2019s answer was truthful. The defendant responded negatively to the question \u201cHave you ever been on trips with Mr. X?\u201d The government admitted that the question could be construed as asking either whether the defendant had ever accompanied Mr. X on a trip, or whether she had ever been on a trip at a particular place at the same time as Mr. X. Thus, although she and Mr. X had been in Florida together, the perjury conviction was reversed because there was no evidence to establish the falsity of her answer with respect to the first interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-15\">These cases have in common the fact that the truthfulness of the defendant\u2019s answer turns on the scope or interpretation of the crucial question. Bronston argues that the question he faced was also ambiguous, and that his answer was a truthful response to- one interpretation. We should not let this argument obscure the fact that his response was truthful regardless of which interpretation of the referee\u2019s question is adopted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Because I agree with the majority that the question put to Bronston was unambiguous, I likewise agree that the above cases are correctly distinguished \u2014but only insofar as they deal with ambiguous questions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Insofar as they state the law upon a finding that the defendant\u2019s testimony was truthful, they call for reversal of Bronston\u2019s conviction. Although the majority would dismiss <em>Wall </em>because there the question was found ambiguous,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Wall </em>also said that a defendant cannot lawfully be convicted of perjury when his answer is literally accurate, 371 F.2d at 400. <em>Galanos </em>cannot be distinguished because the defendant\u2019s answer was, in the majority\u2019s words, \u201cprecise, literally true and wholly responsive,\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for Bronston\u2019s answer was also literally true, and precision and responsiveness are not relevant to the crime of perjury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Galanos </em>said unequivocally that the defendant clearly \u201ccannot be convicted of perjury merely because his literally accurate answer might have been somewhat modified in effect if he had been asked to state all the circumstances.\u201d 49 F.2d at 899. <em>Slutzky </em>cannot be disregarded, as the majority would do, because the defendant\u2019s answer was \u201ctruthful and responsive\u201d and Bronston\u2019s \u201cnon-responsive.\u201d <em>Slutzky </em>said \u201cIf the defendant\u2019s answers to questions were <em>legally </em>truthful, he cannot be held for perjury.\u201d 79 F.2d at 505. A truthful answer, even if not responsive to the question asked, is not perjury under \u00a7 1621.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Suppose, in response to the question \u201cHave you ever [had any bank accounts in Swiss banks] ?\u201d Bronston had truthfully replied, \u201cMy daughter attended school in Switzerland.\u201d Had the questioning stopped there, could Bronston <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>lawfully be convicted of perjury? Could he be found willfully to have stated any material matter which he did not believe to be true?</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">That his actual answer was less obviously unrelated to the question, and therefore perhaps more likely to deceive, is irrelevant because the crime turns not upon whether he successfully deflected a more precise question but upon whether he believed in the truthfulness of his testimony. It may be that this puts a burden on the questioner to recognize when he is being led astray, but I prefer to insist upon the questioner\u2019s acuity than to distort the statute. Had the referee here noticed that Bronston\u2019s answer was unresponsive and questioned him with particularity about his personal accounts, and had Bronston thereupon answered responsively, I suspect that no one would think his original unresponsive answer perjurious. Bronston\u2019s conviction should in no degree depend on the referee\u2019s failure to notice he was being diverted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-10\">. Section 1621 reads, in pertinent part: Whoever, having taken an oath before a competent tribunal, officer, or person . . . that lie will testify truly . . . willfully and contrary to such oath states . . . any material matter which he does not believe to be true, is guilty of perjury . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b621-19\">. To the interpretation we reject (\u201cHave you, meaning the company, ever had an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>account in Swiss banks ? \u201d), Bronston\u2019s answer was truthful. To the only permissible interpretation (\u201cHave you personally ever had such an account? \u201d), his answer was also true \u2014 but not responsive to the question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b622-5\">. In these cases the issue was, as it must be under the statute, whether the defendant had told the truth. This in turn depended in large measure on a reading of the original question. If a certain interpretation was permissible, the defendant had told the truth. If not, he had lied. But here a determination of the meaning or scope of the question will not settle the issue of whether Bronston lied, since Bronston\u2019s answer was not responsive to the question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b622-6\">. In <em>Wall </em>the question put to the defendant was found by the appellate court susceptible to two interpretations, and the conviction was reversed. The contra-positive position, that in our case because the question was clear the conviction must stand, is untenable. The logic to this approach would be impeccable if indeed Bronston had <em>lied </em>to a question found capable of only one interpretation. But, however purposefully evasive Bronston may have been, his response was literally truthful. Were we to focus on cases dealing with ambiguous questions the true analogy would be to a case where a question was found susceptible to two interpretations and the defendant\u2019s answer was responsive to neither.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b622-9\">. <em>Galanos </em>required only that the defendant\u2019s answer be literally true, and never even used the words \u201cprecise\u201d and \u201cresponsive.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b622-10\">. In footnote 3 of the majority opinion, our case is apparently further distinguished from <em>Galanos </em>because \u201chad further testimony as to the company\u2019s account been elicited, the creditors would still have been in the dark about Bron-ston\u2019s personal account.\u201d As pointed out in the text <em>infra, </em>the success or failure of the defendant\u2019s effort to sidetrack a particular inquiry has no bearing on whether or not his testimony was perjurious.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b622-11\">. The majority also would distinguish United States v. Cobert, 227 F.Supp. 915 (S.D.Cal.1964) because there the question was vague. The court also said, however, that \u201cwhere it is clear from the face of the indictment that the defendant has not answered the question asked, he can hardly be held to have answered it falsely, and no assignment of perjury can be sustained.\u201d The court further noted that the defendant\u2019s answer was \u201cnonresponsive at worst, and in no way shows that he committed perjury.\u201d 227 F.Supp. at 919. That Bronston\u2019s nonresponsive answer was perhaps not a product of misunderstanding makes no difference. A deliberate failure to respond is no more culpable than a failure prompted by confusion, especially when the answer given was concededly truthful.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
