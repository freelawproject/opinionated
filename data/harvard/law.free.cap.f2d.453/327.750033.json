Byrne, Sr., United States District Judge, Central District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b388-16\">CHOY, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b388-17\">Archie Epling brought this negligence action against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act. The District Court found no negligence on the part of the government and entered judgment against Epling, who appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-18\">Epling went for a late Sunday afternoon ride on a motorcycle with a female passenger riding on the seat behind him, along Route 66, westerly of Winslow, Arizona. About 6:00 p.m. as dusk was coming on, Epling turned the motorcycle onto an access road, leading to a radar station, which the Air Force had deactivated about a year before. Epling had been there once before and knew that the abandoned radar station was government property.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-19\">Neither Epling nor his passenger saw the sign located right after the access road leaves Route 66, which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-20\">WARNING RESTRICTED AREA</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABO\">It is unlawful to enter within this area without written permission of the Commander.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-21\">Nor did they see another sign which indicated the speed limit on the road to be five miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-22\">About one-half mile up the road, a steel cable was stretched across the way attached to two 4x4 posts on either side of the road. A wooden sign hung from the middle of the cable; it read: \u201cStop \u2014Do Not Enter.\u201d Several feet behind the cable, there was a standard stop sign, mounted on a portable base.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-23\">A civilian employee of the Government was sometimes stationed at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>point in the road where the cable crossed. His primary job was maintenance. Still, about half the time, he was near the cable, when he had the duty to discourage unauthorized persons from continuing up the road. The guard had already gone home on the Sunday that Epling came driving up the access road at about 25 miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Neither Epling nor his passenger saw the cable. Epling was hit across his chest and hurled to the pavement, seriously injuring his back. His passenger was also knocked off the vehicle, but she was not injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The common law standards of landowner\u2019s liability, based upon the plaintiff\u2019s status as trespasser, licensee or invitee, have come under heavy attack in recent years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant forcefully urges that this court should jettison the old common law apparatus, riddled as it is with exceptions and inconsistencies; he would substitute a duty of reasonable care, which may be influenced but not controlled by the status of the injured party.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Whatever the merits of appellant\u2019s position are, we are required to apply the law of Arizona, where the alleged tort occurred. A person makes out a case under the Federal Tort Claims Act \u201cwhere the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the <em>law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\u201d </em>(emphasis added) 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">At trial, Epling attempted to establish that the access road was public and that the government therefore owed a duty of reasonable care. The trial judge found that the road was not pub-lie. The evidence in support of that finding is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">Alternatively, Epling\u2019s evidence was submitted on the theory that the road\u2019s appearance misled the people in the community of Winslow into believing that the road was public. If so, then the Government owed the same duty of care as would have been required for a public road. Olsen v. Macy, 86 Ariz. 72, 340 P.2d 985 (1959). This is the doctrine of the \u201cmisled invitee,\u201d an exception to the harsh standards applicable to licensees or trespassers.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">The record supports the trial judge\u2019s rejection of Epling\u2019s claim that he was a \u201cmisled invitee.\u201d The sign at the beginning of the access road gave notice to all that entrance onto the premises was allowed only with permission of \u201cthe Commander.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">Epling contends, however, that the obvious abandoned condition of the property \u2014 which was widely known in Winslow, would lead a reasonable man to believe that the reference to a Commander was no longer current and could be disregarded. Several of Epling\u2019s witnesses testified that they took pleasure trips on the access road at various times, both before and after the radar base was abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-14\">The record indicates sufficient evidence that the Government took precautions so as not to mislead the community into thinking that the road was public. The cable was constructed for that very purpose. Even some of Epling\u2019s witnesses acknowledged that the cable deterred them from proceeding up the road. Moreover, a guard was often there to inform people that the road was not open to public use. This evidence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>ample to support the district judge\u2019s rejection of Epling\u2019s \u201cmisled invitee\u201d claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">At most, Epling was a gratuitous licensee. Concerning a tort claim of one who enters onto government property which has been de-activated, there is no Arizona precedent on point. However, the Arizona Supreme Court has consistently held that the Restatement rules are the law of the state, where no case has yet been decided. Smith v. Normart, 51 Ariz. 134, 75 P.2d 38 (1938); Waddell v. White, 56 Ariz. 525, 109 P.2d 843 (1941); Reed v. Real Detective Publishing Company, 63 Ariz. 294, 162 P.2d 133 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">According to the Restatement, a landowner owes a duty to give adequate warning to frequent trespassers, the same as to licensees. Restatement of Torts, Second \u00a7 335. The government\u2019s supervising employee knew that the road from its beginning to the cable was used often enough to require a guard to be posted.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The government owed a duty to Epling as a gratuitous licensee to warn of hidden perils. Sanders v. Brown, 73 Ariz. 116, 238 P.2d 941 (1951). What is a \u201chidden peril\u201d has been delimited by the Arizona Supreme Court in Mull v. Roosevelt Irr. Dist., 77 Ariz. 344, 272 P.2d 342 (1954), wherein the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">\u201c[R]unning through the history of the principle and the decisions . . is generally the idea of deceit or camouflage, (citation omitted) It is an act or omission of the defendant which gives a dangerous instrumentality or condition an innocent appearance to the unwary licensee. Failure to provide protection against injury from its existence must be the equivalent of a willful and wanton act.\u201d 77 Ariz. at 347, 272 P.2d at 344.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">The Arizona Supreme Court emphasized the \u201chidden\u201d element of the peril in Parker\u2019s Hamburger Number One v. Fitzgerald, 88 Ariz. 276, 356 P.2d 25 (1960). Plaintiff was running across defendant\u2019s parking lot, in order to catch a bus. She tripped over a pipe that was raised five inches off the ground, seriously injuring herself. The court reversed a jury verdict for plaintiff, holding that one who does not see a plainly visible danger cannot come within the \u201chidden peril\u201d rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">The record in the instant case indicates that the cable across the roadway could be seen from a considerable distance. One of Epling\u2019s witnesses testified that he was able to stop his car before the cable, while travelling at approximately 15 miles per hour. It is significant that Epling was driving the motorcycle at a speed of 25 miles per hour, in a zone clearly marked 5 mile speed limit. These facts are sufficient evidence to support the district court's decision that the government was not negligent in constructing and maintaining the cable and the road, that Epling was contributorily negligent and that his negligence proximately caused the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-8\">. <em>See, e. g., </em>Calabresi, \u201cSome Thoughts on Risk Distribution and the Law of Torts,\u201d 70 Yale L.J. 499 (1961); Ehrenzweig, \u201cAssurance Oblige\u2014A Comparative Study,\u201d 15 Law and Contemporary Problems 445 (1950); Long, \u201cLand Occupants Liability to Invitees, Licensees and Trespassers,\u201d 31 Tenn.L.Rev. 485 (1964); Schopler, \u201cModern Status of Rules Conditioning Landowners' Liability Upon Status of Injured Party as Invitee, Licensee, or Trespasser,\u201d 32 A.L.R. 3d 508 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b389-18\">.
