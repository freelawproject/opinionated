Each pupil is specifically prohibited from distributing, while under school jurisdiction, any advertisements, pamphlets, printed material, written material, announcements or other paraphernalia without the express permission of the principal of the school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-14\">\u201c8. All students shall be subject to suspension or dismissal by the principal, who willfully and persistently violate the rules of the school, or who may be guilty of immoral or disreputable conduct, during school term or out of school term whether on school property or not, or who may be a menace to the school as by law provided.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-15\">Authority to punish under such rules was authorized under North Carolina General Statute, Sections 115-147.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-16\">On November 19, 1970, the plaintiff violated Rule 7, as quoted <em>supra, </em>by distributing in school an \u201cunderground\u201d newspaper. For such infraction, he was suspended for ten school days and placed on probation. Some two months later, on January 29, 1971, he again distributed without permission, in violation of the school rule, an \u201cunderground\u201d paper in which one of the articles concluded in large capital letters with this statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOQ\">\u201c . . . WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO FIGHT IN THE HALLS AND IN THE CLASSROOMS, OUT IN THE STREETS BECAUSE THE SCHOOLS BELONG <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>TO THE PEOPLE. IF WE HAVE TO \u2014 WE\u2019LL BURN THE BUILDINGS OF OUR SCHOOLS DOWN TO SHOW THESE PIGS THAT WE WANT AN EDUCATION THAT WON\u2019T BRAINWASH US INTO BEING RACIST. AND THAT WE WANT AN EDUCATION THAT WILL TEACH US TO KNOW THE REAL TRUTH ABOUT THINGS WE NEED TO KNOW, SO WE CAN BETTER SERVE THE PEOPLE'!!!\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">On account of this second violation, he was again suspended for ten school days.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">At this point, the plaintiff, suing both individually and as a representative of a class, began this action, seeking both a declaratory judgment that Rule 7 was violative of his First Amendment rights and a temporary and permanent injunction against the enforcement of his suspension and any other punishment for his violation of such rule, as well as damages. Following the filing of this action, he applied to the District Court for temporary injunctive relief pending the disposition of the cause. The District Court denied the application and proceeded to stay the action until there had been an exhaustion of State administrative and judicial remedies by the plaintiff. From this order, the plaintiff has appealed to this Court. Incident to such appeal, he applied to Honorable J. Braxton Craven, Jr., Circuit Judge, under Rule 8, for injunctive relief pending the appeal. Judge Craven granted such relief, but added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-6\">\u201cProvided, however, that nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent school authorities from enforcing discipline and preventing disruption of classes and other school activities, and to implement such purposes school authorities may, if so advised, prevent distribution of printed material during classes and at other times and places where such distribution is reasonably thought to be disruptive of normal school activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">We vacate the stay of proceedings entered by the District Court, grant declaratory judgment and sustain injunc-tive relief as against the application of Rule 7 as presently drafted.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">The contention that this action, primarily for a declaratory judgment of the unconstitutionality of the school rule, should be stayed pending exhaustion of State remedies is without merit. Were the issue simply a matter of discretionary school discipline, we might, recognizing that \u201cJudicial interposition in the operation of the public school system of the Nation raises problems requiring care and restraint\u201d,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appropriately defer to the \u201cexpertise\u201d of the school authorities and remand the plaintiff to his administrative remedies within the school hierarchy. Press v. Pasadena Independent School District (D.C. Tex.1971) 326 F.Supp. 550, 565. Even if the issue were whether the content of the challenged publication justified a judgment of \u201cdisruptive potential\u201d sufficient to remove First Amendment protection against prior restraint, we would be inclined to give great, though not final, weight to the opinion of the school authorities. This is so because it is not the policy of Federal Courts to \u201cintervene in the resolution of conflicts which arise in the daily operation of the school systems and which do not directly and sharply implicate basic constitutional values.\u201d Epperson v. Arkansas, <em>supra </em>(393 U.S. at p. 104, 89 S.Ct. at p. 270). Actually, Tinker v. Des Moines School Dist. (1969) 393 U.S. 503, 507, 89 S.Ct. 733, 737, 21 L.Ed.2d 731, the leading case on student constitutional rights, \u201cemphasized the need for affirming the comprehensive authority of the States and of school officials, consistent with fundamental constitutional safeguards, to prescribe and control conduct in the schools.\u201d And in prescribing general conduct within the school, the school authorities must \u201chave a wide latitude of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>discretion, subject only to the restriction of reasonableness.\u201d Davis v. Ann Arbor Public Schools (D.C.Mich.1970) 313 F.Supp. 1217, 1226; Barker v. Hardway (D.C.W.Va.1968) 283 F.Supp. 228, 235, aff. 4 Cir., 399 F.2d 638, cert. den. 394 U.S. 905, 89 S.Ct. 1009, 22 L.Ed.2d 217. But the issue posed by the plaintiff in this case as to the validity of the rule is not a simple matter of school discipline; it is not related to any question of state law; it deals \u201cdirectly\u201d and \u201csharply\u201d with a fundamental constitutional right under the First Amendment. That constitutional claim under the Federal Constitution, as Judge Craven observed in his order granting injunctive relief pending appeal, is properly justiciable in the federal courts. School administrative procedures provide no satisfactory alternative for the resolution of such federal constitutional claim, and the plaintiff\u2019s choice of a federal forum instead of the state forum in a suit filed under Section 1983, U.S.C., is to be respected. The District Court accordingly erred in staying this action and requiring an exhaustion of State remedies, preliminary to any right to vindicate federal constitutional claims in a federal court. Section 1983, 42 U.S.C.; Monroe v. Pape (1961) 365 U.S. 167, 183, 81 S. Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492; McNeese v. Board of Education (1963) 373 U.S. 668, 671-674, 83 S.Ct. 1433, 10 L.Ed.2d 622; Lewis v. Kugler (3d Cir. 1971) 446 F.2d 1343, 1346.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-13\">Though it might well be argued that the language in the publication distributed by the plaintiff on January 29, 1971, as quoted <em>supra, </em>was inflammatory and potentially disruptive,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the plaintiff was not disciplined because of the content of the publication but because he had violated the regulation prohibiting the distribution of printed material without permission.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We are, therefore, not called upon in this appeal to assess the content of the publication; we are concerned only at this point with the constitutional validity of the regulation, for violation of which the plaintiff was disciplined.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-15\">The regulation, assailed by plaintiff, is facially invalid. Its basic vice does not lie in the requirement of prior permission for the distribution of printed material, though such requirement is manifestly a form of prior restraint of censorship. Free speech under the First Amendment, though available to juveniles and high school students, as well as to adults, is not absolute and the extent of its application may properly take into consideration the age or maturity of those to whom it is addressed. Thus, publications may be protected when directed to adults but not when made available to minors,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>as Justice Stewart emphasized it in his concurring opinion in <em>Tinker, </em>First Amendment rights of children are not \u201cco-extensive with those of adults\u201d. Similarly, a difference may exist between the rights of free speech attaching to publications distributed in a secondary school and those in a college or university.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is generally held that the constitutional right to free speech of public secondary school students may be modified or curtailed by school regulations \u201creasonably designed to adjust these rights to the needs of the school environment.\u201d Antonelli v. Hammond (D.C.Mass.1970) 308 F.Supp. 1329, 1336.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Specifically, school authorities may by appropriate regulation, exercise prior restraint upon publications distributed on school premises during school hours in those special circumstances where they can \u201creasonably \u2018forecast substantial disruption of or material interference with school activities\u2019 \u201d on account of the distribution of such printed material.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If a reasonable basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>such a forecast exists, it is not necessary-that the school stay its hand in exercising a power of prior restraint \u201cuntil disruption actually occurred.\u201d Butts v. Dallas Independent School District (5th Cir. 1971) 436 F.2d 728, 731; Norton v. Discipline Committee of East Tenn. State Univ., <em>supra, </em>419 F.2d at p. 199. The school authorities are not required to \u201cwait until the potential (for disorder) is realized before acting.\u201d LeClair v. O\u2019Neil (D.C.Mass.1969) 307 F.Supp. 621, 625, aff. 401 U.S. 984, 91 S.Ct. 1219, 28 L.Ed.2d 524. And if there are substantial facts which reasonably support a forecast of likely disruption, the judgment of the school authorities in denymg permission and in exercising restraint will normally be sustained. Butts v. Dallas Independent School District, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-17\">What is lacking in the present regulation, and what renders its attempt at prior restraint invalid, is the absence both of any criteria to be followed by the school authorities in determining whether to grant or deny permission, and of any procedural safeguards in the form of \u201can expeditious review procedure\u201d of the decision of the school authorities. The order of Judge Craven, granting the plaintiff relief pending appeal from the order of suspension, added in the paragraph already quoted, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>guideline which follows broadly the ruling in <em>Tinker </em>in establishing a reasonable criterion for measuring the extent of the school\u2019s power of restraint. Such language is not as precise as that which might be required in a criminal statute; but no such exacting standard is necessary in formulating school regulations. Esteban v. Central Missouri State College (8th Cir. 1969) 415 F.2d 1077, 1089-1090, cert. den. 398 U.S. 965, 90 S. Ct. 2169, 26 L.Ed.2d 548. Even with the addition of such guideline, however, the regulation does not provide the procedural safeguards mandated by Freedman v. Maryland (1965) 380 U.S. 51, 85 S.Ct. 734, 13 L.Ed.2d 649, as modified to take into account what <em>Eisner, supra, </em>refers to as the practical problems involved in applying <em>Freedman </em>to the school environment. <em>Eisner, </em>which involved largely the same issue as is presented here, set forth the reasonable requirements for \u201can expeditious review procedure\u201d that are practical as applied in connection with the operation of a public school and that will meet the basic requirements of <em>Freedman. </em>(440 F.2d at pp. 810-811) As we have said, the regulation involved in this action includes neither such limited procedural safeguards nor any guidelines for determining the right to publish or distribute and is accordingly constitutionally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">It follows that the plaintiff was entitled to declaratory judgment that, as presently framed, the regulation is invalid and its subsequent enforcement should have been enjoined.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">The plaintiff, also, asks that his suspension be voided and expunged from his school record. Actually, the suspension was not enforced, since the order of Judge Craven restrained its imposition. The school year has now ended. The issue of the suspension itself has accordingly become moot.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Since the suspension was never enforced, it will not sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>port an award of damages but it would seem proper, in these particular circumstances, to expunge it from the plaintiff\u2019s record.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Accordingly, the Order of the District Court is vacated and the cause is remanded to the District Court for the entry of relief in accordance with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b115-11\">. \u201cG.S. \u00a7 115-147: <em>Power to suspend or dismiss pupils. </em>The principal of a school shall have authority to suspend or dismiss any pupil who wilfully and persistently violates the rules of the school or who may be guilty of immoral or disreputable conduct, or who may .be a menace to the school: Provided, any suspension or dismissal in excess of 10 school days and any suspension or dismissal denying a pupil the right to attend school during the last 10 school days of the school year shall be subject to the approval of the county or city superintendent. * <em>* * </em>Every suspension or dismissal for cause shall be reported at once to the superintendent and to the attendance counselor, who shall investigate the cause and deal with the offender in accordance with rules governing the attendance of children in school.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b116-10\">.

A number of cases, concerned with the alarming rise in school disciplinary problems, have held that a high school student may be punished for gross disobedience of school rules and gross disrespect of school authorities, without regard to the constitutionality of the rule or the action of the school official. Schwartz v. Schuker, <em>supra, </em>298 F.Supp. at p. 242; Hatter v. Los Angeles City High School District (D.C.Cal.1970) 310 F.Supp. 1309, 1311-1312; Graham v.

All the cases are reviewed and the rule in <em>Schwartz </em>approved in Haskell, Student Expression in the Public Schools: Tinker Distinguished, 59 The Georgetown L. Journal 37 (1970). The <em>Schwarfg </em>case, and those cases adopting its view, proceed on the theory that the student has a legal way to test the validity of a school regulation and there is accordingly no reason for him to disregard the school regulation or to flaunt school discipline. Recognizing the danger in insulating students from discipline for a flagrant violation of a school regulation, which has not been legally declared invalid, these cases are motivated by the real fear, expressed by Justice Black in his dissent in <em>Tinker, </em>that, under any other ruling, high school students \u201cwill be ready, able, and willing to defy their teachers on practically all orders.\u201d (393 U.S. at p. 525, 89 S.Ct. at p. 746.) It cannot be denied that to permit high school students to determine for themselves the validity of school rules, and to reward with impunity their impatience with school regulations \u2014 even those which later may be found improper \u2014 undermines school discipline and can interfere with the orderly operation of the school. Moreover, even though the school authorities might be enjoined from the exercise of a right of prior restraint over the distribution of printed material, it does not follow that the student might not be properly punished or disciplined on account of the actual distribution, if the material warrants a reasonable forecast of disruption in the school. See concurring opinion of Justice White in New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713, 91 S.Ct. 2140, 29 L.Ed.2d 822, filed June 30, 1971. In short, those who enjoy freedom from prior restraint \u201care answerable for any abuse thereof.\u201d Note, Freedom of the Press in College and High School, 35 Albany L.Rev. 161, 163 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
