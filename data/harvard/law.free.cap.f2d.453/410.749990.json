This appeal was perfected from the judgment of conviction, which followed jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-17\">Prior to trial, the parties stipulated that appellant was the person responsible for depositing the materials in question in the United States mails and that he was aware of the nature of the materials. The question presented for jury determination was whether the materials were in fact obscene within the meaning of Section 1461.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-18\">The materials which form the basis of the conviction consist of photographs, both in the form of glossy prints and photographs reproduced by publication, 8-millimeter motion picture films and a limited quantity of text material, none of which can be classified as \u201chard core pornography\u201d by whatever definition. Suffice it for present purposes to say that the most questionable of the material received in evidence is of the precise nature, although if anything less offensive (if a comparative in that regard is permissible), as that described in the partial dissent in Dykema v. Bloss, 17 Mich.App. 318, 342-343, 169 N.W.2d 367 (1969). In <em>Bloss, </em>municipal authorities sought to restrain the \u201cfurther sale, distribution and acquisition or possession for sale of certain allegedly obscene booklets or magazines,\u201d and the court of appeals sustained the issuance of the injunction, granted on the finding of the trial court that \u201call the booklets and magazines in question [are] obscene.\u201d The majority opinion, dissenting opinion and an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part combine to review applicable precedent, including Redrup v. New York, 386 U.S. 767, 87 S.Ct. 1414, 18 L.Ed.2d 515 (1967). However, on appeal the Supreme Court in a single sentence per curiam opinion granted a writ of certiorari and reversed the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>ment of the Michigan Court of Appeals in <em>Bloss, </em>citing only <em>Redrup. </em>It cannot seriously be here argued that the Government presented any stronger ease than did the plaintiff in <em>Bloss </em>and in view of the reversal thereof by the Supreme Court we conclude that we have no alternative but to reverse the judgment of the District Court and to remand with instruction to enter final judgment in favor of the defendant-appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
