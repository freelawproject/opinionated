We do not reach the third contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The Case 580 tractor has been characterized by the defendant as construction equipment. He argues that such machines are not \u201cmotor vehicles.\u201d The Dyer Act definition of \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d however, \u201c * * * includes an automobile, automobile truck, automobile wagon, motorcycle, or <em>any other self-propelled vehicle designed for running on land but not on rails.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2311. We think that the emphasized language is broad enough to include the Case 580 tractor. See, United States v. McGlamory, 441 F.2d 130 (5th Cir. 1971); United States v. Jones, 421 F.2d 175 (5th Cir. 1970). In <em>McGlamory, </em>the Court held that a bulldozer was a motor vehicle within the meaning of the Act. It reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\"><em>\u201c # </em>* * 'Motor vehicle\u2019 is after all merely a descriptive or generic term. The only qualifications placed upon this machine by the definition of \u00a7 2311 is that the motor vehicle must be capable of traveling on land but not on rails. Neither \u00a7 2311 nor [another statute not applicable here] contain the requirement that a vehicle must be used for transportation of passengers or that the motor vehicle must operate on the highways. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">441 F.2d at 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">While the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d is not wholly free of ambiguity, the inclusion of the Case 580 tractor within its ambit comports with the literal construction of the term. <em>Cf., </em>McBoyle v. United States, 283 U.S. 25, 51 S.Ct. 340, 75 L.Ed. 816 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">The defendant\u2019s contention that he was prejudiced by the improper admission of character evidence must be viewed in the light of the only factual issue in dispute at the trial. The defense position was that the defendant did not know the tractor was stolen. Evidence was produced to explain the defendant\u2019s possession of the tractor. A number of character witnesses testified to the defendant\u2019s good reputation for honesty. The government in rebuttal called a state police officer for the sole purpose of testifying about the defendant\u2019s reputation for \u201chonesty, integrity, and being a law abiding citizen.\u201d The testimony of that witness and his cross-examination were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-12\">\u201cQ. [by Mr. Strachan, U. S. Attorney] Do you know the accused in this case, the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-14\">\u201cQ. How long have you known him? A. About twelve years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-15\">\u201cQ. Are you acquainted with the people in the Farmington area that know Lester Straughan? A. Yes, Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-16\">\u201cQ. Are you acquainted with his reputation in that area and among those people who know him for integrity and honesty and being a law-abiding citizen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-18\">\u201cx x x a. Well, actually he has two reputations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-19\">\u201cQ. You say two reputations? Would you give us \u2014 we will take the aspect of one of those reputations for integrity, honesty and being a law-abiding citizen, what is that reputation ? A. Good. He is well thought of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>\u201cQ. How about the other reputation for honesty, integrity and being a law-abiding citizen? A. This I would clarify. In the community that I work in in law enforcement I would say it is bad.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">\u201cMr. Rosecan: If the Court please\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-o\">\u201cCome on up, counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">\u201c(Thereupon, the following occurred at the bench out of the hearing of the jury:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">\u201cMr. Rosecan: If the Court please, the Government has done just exactly what they objected when they thought that this is what we were doing. They said the reputation has to be confined to a man\u2019s reputation in the area in which he lived. They showed that now and he said he had a good reputation. Then he asked another question and he answered, in law enforcement circles it is bad. That is not the test of whether a reputation is good or bad or not. It is highly prejudicial and I must move for a mistrial at this time. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-10\">\u201cThe Court: The motion is overruled. Let\u2019s go.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-11\">\u201cMr. Rosecan: May I ask that the jury be instructed to disregard that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-12\">\u201cThe Court: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-14\">\u201cQ. [by Mr. Rosecan, defense counsel] What did you mean by law enforcement ? A. Different agencies <em>from out </em>of the county, people from southeast Missouri, people from St. Louis City, St. Louis County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-16\">\u201cQ. But these people who told you bad things about Lester Straughan don\u2019t come from his home county where he lived, they come from southeast Missouri and other places? A. Other communities, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-18\">\u201cQ. You mentioned southeast Missouri as the place where he is supposed not to have such a good reputation. Didn\u2019t you say \u2014 A. (Interrupting) No, sir, I didn\u2019t say his reputation had been discussed from those people. I said people in other agencies in southeast Missouri have called on me to make checks in reference to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-21\">\u201cQ. Make checks in reference to him? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-22\">\u201cQ. Were you called upon by other agencies to make checks with reference to him? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-23\">\u201cQ. And all the checks that you have made with reference to him did you find out he had committed any crime when you checked him? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-24\">\u201cQ. Did you find out he had not committed any crime when you checked him? A. I didn\u2019t find out either way. I merely made the check and forwarded the information back to the people who required it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-25\">\u201cQ. Well, you made a check on him and you found out \u2014 if you found out he had committed a crime you would know that, wouldn\u2019t you? A. It wasn\u2019t with reference \u2014 As far as I knew it wasn\u2019t with reference to a crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-26\">\u201cQ. It wasn\u2019t with reference to a crime ? What would you be checking him for ? A. Serial numbers on various pieces of equipment that were heavy construction equipment around in the Lead Belt area on construction jobs. They would ask me to go out and make a check on the serial number, which I did for the Highway Patrol in Poplar Bluff, and I have done it for a police agency up here in St. Louis County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-28\">\u201cQ. (By Mr. Rosecan) When you talked about his reputation among law enforcement people, was that as a result of your being called upon to check him out on certain things? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-29\">\u201cQ. And that is how you formulated your opinion was because you had been asked to check him out. ? A. Yes, sir. \u201cQ. I see. And you did check him out, is that right? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-31\">\u201cMr. Rosecan: If the Court please, I at this time move that the testimony of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>witness as to the reputation of Lester Straughan that he got from the law enforcement people in southeast Missouri, St. Louis and St. Louis County be stricken and the jury instructed to disregard it because there is no sufficient basis upon which to formulate an opinion concerning Lester Straughan\u2019s reputation as a good character.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\">\u201cThe Court: Overruled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-5\"> The government now concedes that \u201c[although [the defendant] had put his character in issue by introducing testimony by several witnesses as to his good reputation in the community * * *, evidence in a group other than the community where he lived or worked was not proper rebuttal.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The government argues, however, that the error in admitting this improper character evidence was harmless. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-14\">In determining whether or not this error was harmless, we are guided by the standard laid down by the Supreme Court in Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 764, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1248, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-15\">\u201cIf, when all is said and done, the conviction is sure that the error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect, the verdict and the judgment should stand * * *. But if one cannot say, with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error, it is impossible to conclude that substantial rights were not affected. * * * <em>\"</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-18\">Here, we cannot say with assurance that the jury was not substantially swayed by the admission of the improper character testimony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>The officer\u2019s improper character testimony had three effects: (1) it obviously undercut the testimony of the defendant\u2019s character witnesses; (2) it cast doubt on the testimony of the defendant\u2019s possession of the equipment was innocent; and (3) it tended to enhance the testimony of the two principal government witnesses, whose reputation for honesty and integrity was not good. The credibility of these two witnesses will be discussed in detail later.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Here, the prejudice was heightened by the fact that the source of the improper character evidence was a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Furthermore, we must point out that the government was permitted to attack the defendant\u2019s character in several ways which were proper. Yet the only evidence produced which was damaging to the defendant\u2019s reputation was the erroneously admitted improper character testimony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The government next argues that, even though the character testimony was prejudicial, the case against the defendant was so strong that the error was harmless. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Although the strength of the government\u2019s case is relevant in determining whether error is harmless,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-9\">\u201c* * * [T]he inquiry cannot be merely whether there was enough to support the result, apart from the phase affected by the error. It is rather, even so, whether the error itself had substantial influence. If so, or if one is left in grave doubt, the conviction cannot stand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-16\">Kotteakos v. United States, <em>supra </em>328 U.S. at 765, 66 S.Ct. at 1248.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-17\">Thus, while there may be sufficient evidence to support a conviction had the error not occurred and while a new trial might lead to the same result, we must reverse because we cannot say that the jury was not substantially swayed by the serious error committed here. United States v. Crawford, 438 F.2d 441, 446 (8th Cir. 1971); Echert v. United States, 188 F.2d 336, 342 (8th Cir. 1951). * * * [T]he crucial thing is the impact of the thing done wrong on the minds of other men, not on one\u2019s own.\u201d Kotteakos v. United States, <em>supra </em>328 U.S. at 764, 66 S.Ct. at 1247.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-18\">The major contention of the defense was that the defendant did not know the tractor was stolen. On this point, the evidence was in conflict. The solution to this conflict turned partially on whether the defendant\u2019s witnesses or the government\u2019s witnesses were believed.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-19\">The defendant developed considerable testimony tending to cast doubt on the credibility of the government\u2019s principal witnesses, Davis and Mitchell. The evidence showed that: (1) both Davis and Mitchell had criminal records; (2) both were testifying under grants of immu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>nity from prosecution; (3) both had recently been engaged in cheating their employer; and (4) both testified that they bore grudges against the defendant. In addition, various defense witnesses testified that Davis and Mitchell had poor reputations for honesty within the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Aside from the testimony of Mitchell and Davis, there were other circumstances developed at the trial which the jury could have concluded pointed to the guilt of the defendant. But they were not so strong as to justify that Court in saying that the improper evidence did not substantially sway the jury. Echert v. United States, <em>supra </em>at 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Finally, the government contends that any prejudice in admitting this testimony was cured on cross-examination because the police officer admitted that he had no knowledge of any arrests or convictions of the defendant. But the police officer also stated that he had been investigating the defendant in regard to other thefts of construction equipment. This clearly intensified the prejudice caused by his original testimony by relating his opinion concerning the defendant\u2019s bad character to the same type of crime for which the defendant was on trial. See, United States v. Crawford, <em>supra. </em>Thus, we simply do not agree that the cross-examination cured the prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The argument could be made that the defendant cannot complain because he elicited this additional prejudicial testimony; but we believe that, once the improper testimony was admitted over objection, the defense counsel had no choice but to attempt to show the inadequate basis for the police officer\u2019s conclusion. United States v. Acreman, 434 F.2d 338 (8th Cir. 1970) (by implication); United States v. Heffner, 420 F.2d 809 (4th Cir. 1970); United States v. King, 378 F.2d 359 (6th Cir. 1967); Dupes v. Johnson, 353 F.2d 103 (6th Cir. 1965). The government will not be heard to say that the defendant may attempt to cure the prejudice only at his peril.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">We reverse the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b483-12\">. The defendant was first indicted on four counts on June 20, 1970. On October 29, 1970, the government substituted a new five-count indictment. Counts I and II were for Dyer Act violations. Count III charged the defendant with obstructing the communication of information to the P.B.I. in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1510. Count IV charged him with endeavoring to influence testimony before a grand jury in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503, and Count V charged the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>fendant with offering a witness something of value in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 (h).</p>\n<p id=\"AlGA\">Before the trial, the government dismissed the fifth count. During the trial, it dismissed Count III. Thus, the case was submitted to the jury on Counts I, II and IV. The jury found the defendant innocent on Counts II and IV, and guilty on Count I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b486-7\">. See, Williams v. United States, 168 U.S. 382, 18 S.Ct. 92, 42 L.Ed. 509 (1897), cited with approval in Michelson v. United States, 335 U.S. 469, 480, n. 17, 69 S.Ct. 213, 93 L.Ed. 168 (1948); Burns v. State, 23 Tex.App. 641, 5 S.W. 140 (1887); People v. Markham, 64 Cal. 157, 30 P. 620 (Cal.1883). But compare, 5 Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd Ed., \u00a7 1616, n. 2. In <em>Williams </em>the Supreme Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">\u201c * * * Assuming (although the record is silent on the subject) that the accused introduced evidence of his general reputation for integrity, it is clear that evidence, on behalf of the prosecution, that among the limited number of people employed in a particular public building his character was bad, was inadmissible. The prosecution should have been restricted to such proof touching the character of the accused as indicated his general reputation in the community in which he resided, as distinguished from his reputation among a few persons in a particular building. The estimate placed upon his character by the community generally could not be shown by proof only as to the estimate placed upon him by persons in the custom house.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 168 U.S. 397, 18 S.Ct. at 97, 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-13\">Here, the improper testimony did not even have a sound basis. The law enforcement community of which the officer spoke included not only law enforcement personnel in \u201c * * * southeast Missouri but in St. Louis, St. Louis County and in other areas.\u201d Thus, the defendant\u2019s reputation in this particular law enforcement community was not based on continuous personal observation, which is indispensable as a foundation for ascertaining reputation. See, 5 Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd Ed., \u00a7 1615.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b486-23\">. We have recognized that improper testimony relating to the character of the accused is particularly likely to damage his case. United States v. Crawford, 438 F.2d 441 (8th Cir. 1971); Echert v. United States, 188 F.2d 336, 342 (8th Cir. 1951); Little v. United States, 93 F.2d 401, 408 (8th Cir. 1937), cert, denied, 303 U.S. 644, 58 S.Ct. 643, 82 L.Ed. 1105 (1938). See also, Osborne v. United States, 351 F.2d 111, 118 (8th Cir. 1965); United States v. Pennix, 313 F.2d 524 (4th Cir. 1963). Ordinaria, once the government has elicited improper character testimony, it should not \u201c * * * be heard to say that the methods which were used did not have the effect which they were obviously intended to have. * * * \u201d Salerno v. United States, 61 F.2d 419, 424 (8th Cir. 1932).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b487-11\">. The government has great latitude in cross-examining character witnesses or introducing evidence in rebuttal. As the Supreme Court pointed out in Michelson v. United States, <em>supra, </em>335 U.S. at 479, 69 S.Ct. at 220:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-13\">\u201c * * * The price a defendant must pay for attempting to prove his good name is to throw open the entire subject which the law has kept closed for his benefit and to make himself vulnerable where the law otherwise shields him. The prosecution may pursue the inquiry with contradictory witnesses to show that damaging rumors, whether or not well-grounded, were afloat \u2014 for it is not the man that he is, but the name that he has which is put in issue. Another hazard is that his own witness is subject to cross-examination as to the contents and extent of the hearsay on which he bases his conclusions, and he may be required to disclose rumors and reports that are current even if they do not affect his own conclusion. It may test the sufficiency of his knowledge by asking what stories were circulating concerning events, such as one\u2019s arrest, about which people normally comment and speculate. Thus, while the law gives defendant the option to show as a fact that his reputation reflects a life and habit incompatible with commission of the offense charged, it subjects his proof to tests of credibility designed to prevent him from profiting by a mere parade of partisans.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
