Webster. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">Petitioners assert that their post-conviction efforts following a state conviction for armed robbery have been subjected to inordinate delay, thereby denying them due process and equal protection of the law. The inaction the petitioners complain of has been resolved, their appeal to the Supreme Court of Missouri having been heard and decided Veneri v. Missouri, 474 S.W.2d 833 (1971). Furthermore, the issue of delay not having been presented for determination by the courts of Missouri and since there has been no showing that the state corrective process is inadequate to protect petitioner\u2019s rights, this Court will not interfere by habeas corpus and will leave petitioners to exhaust the remedies afforded them by Missouri for determination of their claim. See Bosler v. Swenson, 423 F.2d 257 (CA 8 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
