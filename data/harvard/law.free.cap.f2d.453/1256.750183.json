We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-8\">In July 1970 Harold Meadows, appellant\u2019s brother, was tried in United States District Court on a Dyer Act charge. James, in supplying an alibi for his brother, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-9\">\u201cQ Was your brother (Harold Meadows) working for you on March 5th and 6th?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-10\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-12\">\u201cQ All right. You would also say he (Harold Meadows) worked for you on March 4th, wouldn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-13\">\u201cA Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-14\">\u201cQ And 5th and 6th and 7th?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-15\">\u201cA Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-17\">\u201cQ How about March 4th, March 4th?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-18\">\u201cA March 4th I would say he was there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-19\">\u201cQ Do you know whether he was there or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-20\">\u201cA He was there every day.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1317-21\">Following Harold\u2019s conviction, James Meadows was indicted for perjury as a result of this testimony, the Government alleging that Harold Meadows was in fact in Atlanta or Marietta, Georgia, on March 4 and 5, 1970. The jury found him guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-23\">In considering Meadows\u2019 claim, we take that view of the evidence and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the Government. Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); United States v. Conti, 339 F.2d 10, 13 (6th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-24\">The Government\u2019s evidence at the trial of James Meadows may be summarized as follows: Jimmy Thomas, Harold\u2019s codefendant, testified that he and Harold had stayed at a Howard Johnson Motel in Marietta on March 4 and 5, and that the rooms were charged on a Mr. Fagan\u2019s credit card. A Howard Johnson official identified business records showing that two individuals, using Fagan\u2019s credit card, had checked into the Howard Johnson Motel South in Atlanta at 6:13 a. m. on March 4 and had checked out at 12:56 p. m. the same day, and had checked into the Howard Johnson Motel Northwest in Atlanta at 2:11 a. m. on March 5 and had checked out at 12:19 p. m. the same day. The room record further showed a call at 7:52 a. m. on March 5 to a Nashville telephone subsequently identified as that of James Meadows. Edwin Fagan testified that he had loaned a gasoline credit card to Harold Meadows during the time in question and identified the room invoices as charged to his card. Roscoe Mullinax, a Marietta automobile dealer, testified that Harold Meadows was in his place of business early in the evening of March 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-25\">We hold that there was ample evidence to support the verdict of the jury that James Donald Meadows was guilty of perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-26\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
