Her complaint alleged three causes of action, two based upon wrongful discharge in violation of the collective bargaining agreement between the union and employer, the third upon a breach by the union of its duty of fair representation to herself and other Spanish-speaking members of the union. The district court dismissed the wrongful discharge causes of action because appellant failed to exhaust the remedies available to her under the collective bargaining agreement.

Pacific Maritime Ass\u2019n, 384 F.2d 935, 936-937 (9th Cir. 1967). The National Labor Relations Act is an \u201cAct of Congress regulating commerce.\u201d <em>See </em>Capital Service, Inc. v. NLRB, 347 U.S. 501, 504, 74 S.Ct. 699, 98 L.Ed. 887 (1954). Suit for breach of the duty is one \u201carising under\u201d such a statute within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337.</p>\n<p id=\"AAo\">On the basis of this analysis, the courts of appeals of three circuits have held that section 1337 confers jurisdiction over suits alleging breach of the duty of fair representation. Waters v. Wisconsin Steel Works, 427 F.2d 476, 490 (7th Cir. 1970); De Arroyo v. Sindicato de Trabajadores Packinghouse, 425 F.2d 281, 283 n.1 (1st Cir. 1970); and Nedd v. United Mine Workers, 400 F.2d 103, 106 (3d Cir. 1968). This conclusion is supported by Tunstall v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, 323 U.S. 210, 213, 65 S.Ct. 235, 89 L.Ed. 187 (1945), which holds that section 1337 confers jurisdiction upon federal district courts over suits for breach of a duty of fair representation implied from \u201ccomparable provisions of the Railway Labor Act.\u201d Ford Motor Co. v. Huffman, <em>supra, </em>345 U.S. at 337, 73 S.Ct. at 686. <em>See </em>note 5 supra; International Ass\u2019n of Machinists v.

Oil Workers, International, 350 U.S. 892, 76 S.Ct. 152, 100 L.Ed. 785 (1955), which involved 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, the companion statute conferring subject matter jurisdiction in cases involving suits arising under a federal statute. <em>See </em>Machinists v. Central Airlines, <em>supra; </em>De Arroyo v. Sindicato de Traba-jadores Packing, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-11\">Although, as we have said, the district court spoke in terms of lack of jurisdiction, there is some indication that the court may have intended to dismiss the fair representation claim for failure to state a cause of action under section 9(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-12\"> The obstacles to affirmance of a dismissal on this ground are formidable. \u201c[A] complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 102, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). Dismissal for insufficiency as a pleading is proper only when the complaint affirmatively discloses \u201csome insuperable bar to relief.\u201d Wright, Federal Courts 286 (1963). <em>See </em>Harman v. Valley National Bank, 339 F.2d 564 (9th Cir. 1964), and authorities there cited. Mere vagueness or lack of detail will not justify dismissal. <em>Id. </em>at 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-13\">In Czosek v. O\u2019Mara, 397 U.S. 25, 90 S.Ct. 770, 25 L.Ed.2d 21 (1970), the Supreme Court sustained a complaint that alleged violation of the duty of fair representation only in general and conclusory terms.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court said (27, 90 S.Ct. 772):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-14\">\u201cAlthough the complaint was\" not as specific with regard to union discrimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>nation as might have been desirable, we deem the complaint against the union sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. As the Court of Appeals indicated, \u2018where the courts are called upon to fulfill their role\u2019 as the primary guardians of the duty of fair representation,\u2019 complaints should be construed to avoid dismissals and the plaintiff at the very least \u2018should be given the opportunity to file supplemental pleadings unless it appears \u201cbeyond doubt\u201d that he cannot state a good cause of action.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1083-4\">Measured by these generous standards, the allegations of the present complaint relating to breach of the union\u2019s duty of fair representation were adequate to withstand a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">Appellant alleges that she and a \u201cvery substantial\u201d number of other members of the union understand little English and are \u201calmost entirely limited for communication\u201d to Spanish. Many are recent immigrants and lack familiarity with \u201cthe customs and practices of American labor management relations.\u201d She alleges that the union violated its duty of fair representation to these members: (1) by failing to provide bilingual liaison between such members and the union; (2) by failing to provide them with a copy of the collective bargaining agreement in Spanish; (3) by failing to explain their rights and responsibilities as union members to them, including their right to have the union process a grievance on their behalf; and (4) by failing to seek the establishment through collective bargaining of a bilingual supervisorial system that could direct, advise, and assist such union members in the performance of their employment duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-13\">The district court thought the allegations insufficient because they did not \u201cconcern any provision of the collective bargaining agreement.\u201d <em>See </em>note 6. This places too narrow a construction either upon the union\u2019s duty or the allegations of the complaint, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-14\">The duty imposed upon a union is broad and demanding. It must \u201cserve the interests of all members without hostility or discrimination toward any, . . . exercise its discretion with complete good faith and honesty, and . avoid arbitrary conduct.\u201d Vaca v. Sipes, <em>supra, </em>386 U.S. at 177, 87 S.Ct. at 910.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-16\">Moreover, most of the allegations of this complaint \u201cconcern\u201d matters related to the negotiation or administration of the collective bargaining agreement. Such matters are not beyond the duty of fair representation simply because they do not involve the breach of a specific provision of the collective bargaining agreement: <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>\u201cThe bargaining representative's duty not to draw \u2018irrelevant and invidious\u2019 distinctions among those it represents does not come to an abrupt end . . . with the making of an agreement between union and employer. Collective bargaining is a continuous process. Among other things, it involves <em>day-to-day adjustments in the contract and other working rules, resolution of new problems not covered by existing agreements, </em>and the protection of employee rights already secured by the contract. The bargaining representative can no more unfairly discriminate in carrying out these functions than it can in negotiating a collective agreement.\u201d (Footnotes omitted and emphasis added). Conley v. Gibson, <em>supra, </em>355 U.S. at 46, 78 S.Ct. at 102.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">It is not difficult to conceive a set of facts that might be proven under the allegations of this complaint, in which a minority group of union members were effectively deprived of an opportunity to participate either in the negotiation of a collective bargaining contract or in the enjoyment of its benefits by a language barrier which union officials exploited, or took no steps to overcome. Such acts or omissions<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of union officials might well violate the union\u2019s duty \u201cto make an honest effort to serve the interests\u201d of <em>all </em>members of the bargaining unit. Ford Motor Co. v. Huffman, <em>supra, </em>345 U.S. at 337, 73 S.Ct. at 686. <em>See also </em>Conley v. Gibson, <em>supra, </em>355 U.S. at 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80; Wallace Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 323 U.S. 248, 255, 65 S.Ct. 238, 89 L.Ed. 216 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-9\">It is no answer to say that the complaint relates to appellee union\u2019s \u201cinternal\u201d policies and practices. The duty of fair representation \u201carises out of the union-employee relationship and pervades it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>400 F.2d at 106. Nothing could be more peculiarly an internal interest of a union than the control over admission to union membership that was held subject to the duty of fair representation in Wallace Corp. v. Labor Board, <em>supra. </em>As a practical matter, intra-union conduct could not be wholly excluded from the duty of fair representation, for as the facts of <em>Wallace Corp. </em>and the allegations of the present complaint suggest, internal union policies and practices may have a substantial impact upon the external relationships of members of the unit to their employer. This does not mean, as appellee union suggests, that the union will be exposed to harassing litigation by dissident members over every arguable decision made in the course of the day-to-day functioning of the union. Though the duty of fair representation is broad, not all union practices have a substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>impact upon members\u2019 rights in relation to the negotiation and administration of the collective bargaining agreement. Even as to those that do, it will be the unusual case in which hostile discrimination, bad faith, dishonesty, or arbitrary conduct can be alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-4\">It would be ill-advised at this early stage in the proceeding to attempt a more precise delineation of the scope of the duty of fair representation with respect to facts that are still largely undisclosed, or even to conclude that appellants have alleged a triable claim. We hold only that because it is not clear beyond doubt that appellants will be unable to prove a violation of the union\u2019s duty under the allegations of their complaint, it was error to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action. <em>See </em>Harman v. Valley National Bank, <em>supra, </em>339 F.2d at 567.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">We turn to the ground relied upon by the district court in dismissing appellant\u2019s cause of action for wrongful discharge, namely, that the complaint did not sufficiently allege the exhaustion of remedies provided by the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-7\">Appellant alleged that she \u201cundertook to exhaust all grievance procedures available to her under the aforesaid collective bargaining contract.\u201d The day following her discharge she \u201cfully reported the fact of such unlawful discharge\u201d to the union. However, \u201cdespite plaintiff\u2019s repeated insistence that the Union take immediately all appropriate action to rectify the matter of her unlawful discharge, the Union failed to process the unlawful discharge as a grievance or to advise or inform plaintiff of her right to have such a grievance processed.\u201d The union\u2019s conduct, appellant alleged, \u201cwas arbitrary, discriminatory and/or in bad faith,\u201d and \u201cin disregard of defendant Union\u2019s duty of fair representation.\u201d Appellant also alleged that during the six months prior to her discharge she \u201creported several employment grievances to defendant Union. On the occasion of each such report defendant Union failed to take any meaningful action to process the grievance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-11\">In considering the sufficiency of these allegations, we reiterate the limited role of a motion to dismiss for failure to plead a cause of action. Where, as here, the complaint seeks to allege a justifiable excuse for failure to-exhaust contract remedies, general allegations suffice, and the complaint may not be dismissed unless the court is \u201cunable to say beyond a doubt that plaintiffs\u2019 allegations . . . are insufficient to excuse their failure to exhaust the grievance provisions of their contract.\u201d Waters v. Wisconsin Steel Works, <em>supra, </em>427 F.2d at 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-14\">Under this standard, dismissal for insufficient allegations of exhaustion of contract remedies was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-15\">The general rule is that \u201cthe employee must at least attempt to exhaust exclusive grievance and arbitration procedures established by the bargaining agreement. Republic Steel Corp. v. Maddox, 379 U.S. 650, [85 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>614, 13 L.Ed.2d 580].\u201d Vaca v. Sipes, <em>supra, </em>386 U.S. at 184-185, 87 S.Ct. at 914. But there are exceptions. As the Court stated in <em>Vaca:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1086-4\">\u201c[T]he wrongfully discharged employee may bring an action against his employer in the face of a defense based upon the failure to exhaust contractual remedies, provided the employee can prove that the union as bargaining agent breached its duty of fair representation in its handling of the employee\u2019s grievance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186, 87 S.Ct. at 914.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\"><em>See </em>Czosek v. O\u2019Mara, <em>supra, </em>397 U.S. at 27-28, 90 S.Ct. 770, 25 L.Ed.2d 21; Glover v. St. Louis-S.F. R.R. Co., 393 U.S. 324, 330-331, 89 S.Ct. 548, 21 L.Ed.2d 519 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-6\">Appellee union argues that the <em>Vaca </em>exception is inapplicable because in that case the collective bargaining agreement provided that only the union could initiate a grievance, while in this case section 5(b) of the collective bargaining contract provides that the employee himself may do so.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-7\">Appellant disputes this interpretation, arguing that it appears from section 39 of the contract<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> that the union must initiate the grievance, and that all section 5(b) gives the employee is a right to appeal if the union and employer cannot agree. At the least, appellant argues, the contract is ambiguous in this respect, and national labor policy suggests that the ambiguity should be resolved in favor of exclusive union control over initiation of grievances. Cox, \u201cRights under a Labor Agreement,\u201d 69 Harv.L.Rev. 601, 657 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-11\">We need not decide whether we agree with the district court\u2019s rejection of these arguments,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> for even if the district court correctly interpreted the contract as giving an individual employee the right to initiate a discharge grievance independently of the union, appellant may be able to prove a justifiable excuse for failing to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-12\">Although the district court agreed with appellees\u2019 construction of the contract, it conceded that the contract was ambiguous. Since it is not clear from the contract that the individual employee could initiate a grievance, this alone may excuse exhaustion, particularly in view of appellant\u2019s efforts to get the union to act in her behalf. <em>Cf. </em>Glover v. St. Louis-S.F. R.R., <em>supra, </em>393 U.S. at 331, 89 S.Ct. 548, 21 L.Ed.2d 519. This conclusion is reinforced by appellant\u2019s allegation that she is unable to read English. In such exceptional circumstances, exhaustion of contractual remedies may be excused. <em>Cf. </em>Donato v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>United States, 302 F.2d 468, 470 (9th Cir. 1962); Levy, \u201cUnion Control of Employee Grievances,\u201d 118 U.Pa.L.Rev. 1036, 1045 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-4\">Moreover, as appellee union itself points out, Article IV of the union\u2019s constitution and by-laws provides that the union\u2019s business representative \u201cshall \u2018investigate all controversies arising over the loss of employment or other grievances of members\u2019 brought to the Union\u2019s attention.\u201d Appellant may be able to prove that the union failed without rational justification to discharge this obligation though asked by appellant to do so, and that this breach of the union\u2019s duty of fair representation was the operative cause of appellant\u2019s failure to exhaust the contract remedy. Or, wholly aside from Article IV, appellant\u2019s proof may show that the effective cause of appellant\u2019s failure to exhaust was the union\u2019s failure to advise appellant of her contract rights, and that this omission constituted a breach of the union\u2019s duty of fair representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-6\">The district court did not consider appellees\u2019 arguments that all of appellant\u2019s causes of action were barred by failure to allege exhaustion of certain internal remedies said to be available to members of the union under the union\u2019s constitution and by-laws. Appellee union has raised this issue on appeal as an alternate ground for affirmance.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1087-7\">Appellee union asserts that Article VIII, Section 2 of the union\u2019s international constitution and by-laws gives an individual member aggrieved by any action of his local union the right to petition the General President of the international union to review the action of the local union.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-13\">Although a copy of appellee union\u2019s local constitution and by-laws is attached to appellant\u2019s complaint, the union\u2019s international constitution and bylaws are not part of the record on appeal, and, so far as appears, were not before the trial court. The contents of the international constitution and by-laws is an unresolved question of fact. It would be improvident, even if it were permissible, for us to decide that these documents afforded appellant an adequate remedy simply by examining the excerpts quoted in appellees\u2019 briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-14\">Aside from the insufficiency of the record, we cannot say beyond doubt that appellant will not be able to prove a justifiable excuse for failure to exhaust internal union remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-15\">Appellant asserts that she was not given a copy of the international union\u2019s constitution and by-laws, and, in view of this fact, plus her inability to understand English and the union\u2019s failure to explain her rights in Spanish, she was excusably ignorant of any available remedy within the union, relying on Chew v. Manhattan Laundries, 134 N.J.Eq. 566, 36 A.2d 205, 208 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-16\"> Moreover, remedies need not be exhausted if it would be futile to do so.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This is true of \u201cany remedy administered by the union, by the company, or both, to pass on claims by the very employees whose rights they have been charged with neglecting and betraying.\u201d Glover v. St. Louis-S.F. R.R., <em>supra, </em>393 U.S. at 330-331, 89 S.Ct. at 552, 21 L.Ed.2d 519.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Proof of appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>lant\u2019s allegations that she repeatedly solicited the union\u2019s assistance without result might excuse failure to exhaust internal union remedies on the ground that she reasonably believed further efforts to invoke such remedies would be futile.

The <em>Vaca </em>opinion's repented reference to \u201carbitrary\u201d union conduct reflects a calculated broadening of the fair representation standard. Feller, \u201cVaca v. Sipes: One Year Later,\u201d in N.Y.U. Twenty-First Annual Conference on Labor 141, 167 (1969). It also represents a rejection of such cases as International Longshoremen\u2019s and Warehousemen\u2019s Union v. Kuntz, 334 F.2d 165, 171 (9th Cir. 1964), holding that \u201ca bad faith motive, an intent to hostilely discriminate\u201d is required, as distinguished from \u201carbitrary and unreasonable action.\u201d <em>Vaca </em>also rejected the thesis of Colbert v. Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, 206 F.2d 9 (9th Cir. 1953), relied upon by appellee union, that a suit for unfair representation lies only in \u201ccases wherein collective bargaining agreements containing invidious proscriptive factors that are inimical to statutory or constitutional right, such as racial discriminations, are presented to the court\u201d (13).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1083-18\">. Our contrary holding in Hayes v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., 194 F.2d 337 (9th Cir. 1950), heavily relied upon by appellee union, was expressly disapproved in Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 44 n. 4, 79 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d SO (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"ACU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>Conley v. Gibson is illustrative of many cases in wbicli union conduct that was entirely consistent with tlie express terms of the collective bargaining agreement was nonetheless held to violate the duty of fair representation. <em>See, e. g., </em>Wallace Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 323 U.S. 248, 65 S.Ct. 238, 89 L.Ed. 216 (1944).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1084-7\">. A union\u2019s obligation of fair representation is not necessarily satisfied by refraining from wrongful conduct. A union \u201cmay not,\u201d for example, \u201carbitrarily ignore a meritorious grievance or process it in perfunctory fashion.\u201d Vaca v. Sipes, <em>supra, </em>386 U.S. at 191, 87 S.Ct. at 917. <em>See also </em>Local Union No. 12, United Rubber Workers v. NLRB, 368 F.2d 12, 18 (5th Cir. 1966); De Arroyo v. Sindicato de Trabajadores Paeking-house, <em>supra, </em>425 F.2d at 284. Since a union can be sued for breach of its duty of fair representation if it fails to process a grievance, there is no apparent reason why it cannot also be sued \u201cif it fails to advise the employees to file a grievance . . . .\u201d Feller, \u201cVaca v. Sipes: One Year Later,\u201d in N.Y.U. Twenty-First Annual Conference on Labor 141, 144 (1969). Similarly, failure to compel the employer to make payments to a health and welfare fund \u201cmay well constitute a breach of the union\u2019s equitable duty as a fiduciary representative of employees to act in their interest, fairly and in good .faith, and without unreasonable discrimination throughout the area in which it has been empowered to function.\u201d Nedd v. United Mine Workers, <em>supra, </em>400 F.2d at 105.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1085-8\">. Appellee union also notes that section 9(a) applies only to \u201cappropriate\u201d bargaining- units within the scope of the Labor Management Relations Act, i. e., only to units composed of employees whose employers\u2019 operations \u201caffect commerce\u201d within the meaning of the Act. Appellee union argues that the complaint is insufficient because it does not allege that appellant is employed by employers whose operations have the requisite impact on commerce. Keeping in mind that pleadings are to be \u201cconstrued as to do substantial justice,\u201d Rule 8(f), Fed.R. Civ.P., appellant\u2019s allegation that the court had jurisdiction under section 9(a) gave adequate notice that appellant was prepared to prove the required effect on commerce. Cf. Humphrey v. Moore, 375 U.S. 335, 344 n. 6, 84 S.Ct. 363, 11 L.Ed.2d 370 (1964). It would be particularly inappropriate to affirm the dismissal because of the omission of a more particular allegation on this subject. Appellees did not raise the issue in the district court where the oversight could have been readily corrected by amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1086-8\">.
