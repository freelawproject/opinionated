Ferguson, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b453-23\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b453-24\">Several judgment creditors sought to enforce California judgments in the United States District Court in Arizona. The judgments were currently enforceable in California, which has a ten-year limitations period on judgments. C.C.P. \u00a7 337.5. However, the district court entered summary judgment for the appel-lees because of Arizona\u2019s four-year statute of limitations on foreign judgments. A.R.S. \u00a7 12-544, subsec. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-25\">1. Appellants argue that the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution compels recognition of California\u2019s longer statute of limitations. The Supreme Court has held otherwise. Wells v. Simonds Abrasive Co., 345 U.S. 514, 73 S.Ct. 856, 97 L.Ed. 1211 (1954), is one of a long line of cases authorizing the forum to apply its own statute of limitations if it so desires. <em>See also </em>Pritchard v. Norton, 106 U.S. 124, 1 S. A. 102, 27 L.Ed. 104 (1882); Hawkins v. Barney, 30 U.S. [5 Pet.] 457, 8 L.Ed. 190 (1831). The Full Faith and Credit Clause does not compel recognition of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>different period. <em>Wells, supra, </em>345 U.S. at 516-518, 73 S.Ct. 856, 97 L.Ed. 1211.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Appellants suggest, on the authority of San Manuel Copper Corp. v. Redmond, 8 Ariz.App. 214, 445 P.2d 162 (Ariz.1968), that an Arizona court would apply the longer of two conflicting statutes of limitations. But that ease dealt with two Arizona statutes, not with a conflict between forum and foreign statutes. In the latter situation, Arizona courts apply the Arizona statute of limitations. <em>See, e. g., </em>Ross v. Ross, 96 Ariz. 249, 393 P.2d 933 (Ariz.1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">2. Appellants argue that summary judgment was improperly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">They contend that appellees\u2019 affidavits do not meet the stringent requirement of Rule 56(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that they \u201cshall be made on personal knowledge . . . and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein.\u201d The claim is without merit. Mr. Watt swears to where he was and where his wife and stepson lived during the relevant periods. He evinces direct personal knowledge of these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Appellants next argue that because Mr. Watt had been previously convicted of a felony, summary judgment was automatically unavailable, citing Kasper v. Baron, 191 F.2d 737 (8th Cir. 1951). But in that ease the credibility of the affiant was challenged, the weight of his testimony attacked, and certain of his admissions were shown to be in conflict with his affidavit. <em>Id. </em>at 738. In the present case, appellants have not contradicted the facts asserted in Mr. Watt\u2019s affidavit regarding residency in Arizona. State v. Hull, 60 Ariz. 124, 132 P.2d 436 (Ariz.1942), also cited by appellants, merely holds that the credibility of the testimony of an ex-convict is a question for the jury. 60 Ariz. at 129, 132 P.2d 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">Appellants also argue that the affidavits do not establish the absence of all triable issues of fact. But the facts are uncontroverted. Appellants\u2019 affidavits were not inconsistent with those of ap-pellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">At oral argument appellants conceded that even excluding the time Mr. Watt spent in prison, he resided in Arizona for more than four years before this action commenced. The affidavits established Mrs. Watt\u2019s Arizona residency for an even longer period, without any contradiction. Appellants conceded that any liability of the third appellee, the son of the principal defendants, is wholly derivative from the alleged liability of his parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-14\">Appellants\u2019 only remaining argument, therefore, is that the statute of limitations on foreign judgments was tolled when Mr. Watt changed his name to Scott upon first entering Arizona. Appellants have cited no Arizona statute or decision to support this argument.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, it was not raised in the court below and therefore cannot be urged as ground for reversal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"apo-dedup-1\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b454-9\">. We were referred to Acton v. Morrison, 62 Ariz. 139, 155 P.2d 782 (Ariz. 1945), and Tom Reed Gold Mines Co. v. United Eastern Mining Co., 39 Ariz. 533, 8 P.2d 449 (Ariz.1932), construing A.R.S. \u00a7 12-543. But these authorities deal with the fraudulent concealment of a cause of action and obviously have no application here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b454-10\">. Appellants suggested at oral argument that the fact that a five-year period of limitations applies to domestic judgments (A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1551) and a four-year period to foreign judgments (A.R.S. \u00a7 12-544) may constitute a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See </em>Watkins v. Conway, 385 U.S. 188, 87 S.Ct. 357, 17 L.Ed. 2d 286 (1966). However, the point was not raised below (nor even in the briefs before this court) and may not be raised now.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
