We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-27\">The order denying reconsideration was filed the same day as the court's Final Order approving and adopting the School Board\u2019s Plan of Desegregation. Tilka thereafter timely filed her notice of appeal. Although a denial of intervention is not generally an appealable order with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we find that in the circumstances of this case, where the order denying intervention is filed contemporaneously with the court\u2019s Final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Order, the denial of intervention constitutes a \u201cFinal Decision\u201d within \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The court determined that it would be inappropriate to grant intervention. Under the facts presented and in view of the history of this litigation this court is of the opinion that Tilka was not entitled to intervene as a matter of right and that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying permissive intervention. The order is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-14\">. <em>See </em>United States v. Wood, 295 F.2d 772, 778 (5th Cir. 1961); Stoudenmire v.
