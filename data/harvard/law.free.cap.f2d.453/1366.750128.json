Appellant Davis\u2019 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate contained the following contentions: (1) his plea of guilty was void because it was coerced (2) his plea of guilty was void because it was tainted by incriminating statements that were illegally and unconstitutionally obtained and would be illegally inadmissible in court against him (3) the search of his automobile was illegal (4) his plea of guilty is void because it came after a failure to provide him with counsel at the time of his illegal confession and (5) his plea of guilty was not voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently made. After a full and thorough evidentiary hearing at which Davis was represented by appointed counsel, the district court rendered detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law.
