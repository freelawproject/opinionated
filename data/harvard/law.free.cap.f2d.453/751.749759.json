In these habeas proceedings, the appellant has challenged the validity of his conviction on grounds that his confession should not have been admitted in evidence because he was not fully advised of his right to counsel, nor did lie validly waive his right to counsel prior to giving the incriminating statement. He also contended that the warrant for his arrest was invalid because it was based on statements made by his allegedly common law wife, which he claims were privileged communications.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b811-36\">.
