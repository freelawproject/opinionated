True, the court did not instruct in terms concerning a \u201cmistake of fact,\u201d but it did advise the jury that intent was a material ingredient of the offense and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1333\">*1333</page-number>burden of proving the same rested upon the prosecution. Even if defendant had suggested an instruction employing the phrase \u201cmistake of fact,\u201d the trial court might have refused it because covered by the instructions given. United States v. Clancy, 276 F.2d 617 (7th Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
