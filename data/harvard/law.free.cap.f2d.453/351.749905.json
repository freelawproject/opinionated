See Isbell Enterprises, Inc. v.

We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">Jones was indicted on May 6, 1969, in the Northern District of Florida, for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 500 by passing forged money orders. On December 1, 1970 the court denied him leave to file <em>in forma pauperis </em>a civil action against the United States as the only named defendant, seeking a declaration of his rights and money damages for a conspiracy by several state and federal officials to maliciously prosecute him and also seeking a dismissal of the pending indictment. Noting that the criminal action for which Jones sought damages was still pending and had not been terminated favorable to him, the district court denied leave to file the suit <em>in forma pauperis </em>as being without merit. We find that the court did not abuse its discretion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">Thereafter on December 7, 1970, the criminal case came to trial and Jones was convicted. On December 31, 1970, he filed a motion styled \u201cPetition for Writ of Habeas Corpus\u201d which was originally considered and denied on the merits by the district court. The court modified its order on January 20, 1970 to eliminate the denial on the merits, and dismissed without prejudice because the habeas corpus petition was not ripe for consideration under the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">Jones filed another \u00a7 2255 petition on January 29, 1971, which was denied February 4, 1971. After his conviction, but prior to sentencing he also sought leave to file suit <em>in forma pauperis </em>to enjoin the district court from sentencing him under the conviction. Finding no merit in this suit, leave to file this suit <em>in forma pauperis </em>was also denied. All of these rulings of the court were the subject of a motion for reconsideration which was denied and from which this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-13\">Jones is a federal prisoner whose direct appeal of his conviction is presently pending in this court, United States v. Jones, No. 71-1263. In view of the pending direct\u201d appeal, Jones\u2019 \u00a7 2255 motions were not entitled to consideration on the merits. Welsh v. United States, 404 F.2d 333 (5th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-14\">The rulings of the district court are without error and its judgments are therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
