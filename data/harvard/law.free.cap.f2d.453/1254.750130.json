It held that petitioner had not exhausted state remedies since he had not filed a petition under the Pennsylvania Post Conviction Hearing Act, 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-5, in the Office of the Clerk of the Court for the County in which he was sentenced. Petitioner was sentenced in Allegheny County; he sought relief in the Commonwealth Court in Dauphin County.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-16\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(c),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1315-17\">An applicant shall not be deemed to have exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State, within the meaning of this section, if he has the right under the law of the State to raise, by any available procedure, the question presented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1315-18\">Petitioner has neither filed in the proper court under 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-5, nor-pursued an appeal to the highest court in the state. He has clearly not exhausted his state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-19\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1315-14\">. The constitutionality of this Section has previously been affirmed. United States ex rel. Lyle v. Maroney, 260 F.Supp. 689 (W.D.Pa.1966), cert. den. Lyle v.
