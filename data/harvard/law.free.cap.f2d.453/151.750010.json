She commenced an action for damages in New York State Supreme Court, and there moved for a general trial preference, apparently on the ground that the seriousness of her injuries warranted such a disposition of her case. The motion was denied and the case remained in its assigned position on the jury calendar. Mrs. Blanco appealed the denial of the motion, and the order was affirmed by the Appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Division. On motion for reconsideration in the Supreme Court, the motion was again denied. Mrs. Blanco then petitioned the district court for a writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>alleging that the denial of a general trial preference deprived Mrs. Blanco of the right to a jury trial, thus violating her right to due process of law under the fourteenth amendment. Basing jurisdiction on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a) (1970), petitioner requested that the district court order the New York Supreme Court to grant Mrs. Blanco a general preference. The district court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. We affirm. Mrs. Blanco was not deprived of a jury trial. The constitutional claim is frivolous.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
