Appellant is an East German national. His pleading, inartistically drawn, may be construed as an action in the nature of mandamus against the prison authorities pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 (1971). The district court entered an order denying leave to file the petition in forma pauperis on the ground that it raised an issue involving nothing more than the orderly administration of the prison system with which courts cannot interfere. The appellant petitioned this court for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. This court required the respondent to file an answer to that petition, and after considering that an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>swer denied leave to proceed in such fashion. Appellant then paid the appropriate filing fees, and an order was entered permitting the docketing of his appeal out of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">We have now been informed by the United States Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, that it has no objection to the receipt of the monthly gratuity from the East German Red Cross provided that the funds are deposited to the appellant\u2019s account at the prison, to be expended (1) at the prison commissary for purposes and in amounts permitted to all prisoners under uniform prison regulations, and (2) in excess of such amounts for the pursuit of legal remedies in connection with efforts to obtain a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">To the extent that the appellant\u2019s petition states a claim upon which relief in the nature of mandamus might have been given it is at this time by virtue of the action of the Bureau of Prisons moot. The appeal, therefore, will be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
