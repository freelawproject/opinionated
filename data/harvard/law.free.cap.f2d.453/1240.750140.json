Finley, a United States Navy enlisted man whose application for discharge as a conscientious objector had been denied by the Navy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-11\">The issues presented to the District Court were (1) whether the Navy\u2019s denial of Finley\u2019s application for a discharge was without any rational factual basis; and (2) whether the Navy\u2019s use of the psychiatric reports of Finley\u2019s privately retained civilian doctors, without affording him adequate opportunity to rebut the information contained in the reports, were in violation of procedural due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-12\">The District Court, following a hearing, entered an Order as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-13\">\u201cAND NOW, this 22nd day of July, 1970, it is hereby</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-14\">ORDERED</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-15\">that the Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus be granted; and that the execution of the Writ be stayed for a period of sixty days for the purpose of allowing the Government to seek an appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1301-16\">The Order was not accompanied by findings of fact, conclusions of law, or an opinion. Accordingly, we are not apprised of the reasons for the District Court\u2019s disposition. We deem this to be a case where findings of fact and conclusions of law are appropriate and necessary to our review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1301-17\">The cause will be remanded to the District Court with directions to file forthwith its findings of fact and conclusions of law. The District Court may file a memorandum opinion should it desire to do so. Jurisdiction will be retained.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1301-18\">. Von Moltke v.
