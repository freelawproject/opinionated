Lucas v. Finch, 322 F.Supp. 1209 (S.D.W.Va.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Furthermore, as to Lucas\u2019 claim that he has been unable to work since 1957 partially due to a \u201cback injury,\u201d we affirm the denial of benefits on the doctrine of administrative <em>res judicata </em>since his 1959 application for disability benefits based upon his 1957 spinal injury was denied initially on November 23, 1959, and Lucas took no further action, thus failing to pursue his available administrative remedies. <em>See </em>Easley v. Finch, 431 F.2d 1351 (4 Cir. 1970), for a discussion of administrative <em>res judicata </em>in social security disability cases, which decision was rendered subsequent to the district court\u2019s decision in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1316-11\">.

Gardner, without a formal order pursuant to Rule 25(d) (1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
