He contends that the TRITON was both unseaworthy and negligent in failing to provide a ladder with hooks or securing devices at its top, and that the vessel was unseaworthy in the same respects since it was under the duty to provide a means of safe ascent to Southard from the tug to the vessel in light of his employment by the vessel as its docking master. Plaintiff further contends that the Vessel was negligent in failing to provide assistance by its crew to Southard by holding the ladder as he was ascending it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>On review of the record, we are of the opinion that the District Court did not err in directing the jury to find in favor of the defendants Independent Towing Company and Tugboat Triton Company on the ground that the plaintiff had not adduced \u201cany\u201d evidence of negligence or unseaworthiness on the part of the TRITON. Plaintiff\u2019s testimony failed to afford any basis for a jury finding that the TRITON was guilty of negligence in light of the fact that it established that Southard proceeded to place and ascend the ladder without waiting for the customary assistance of the TRITON\u2019s deckhand and without notice to him or any member of the crew of the TRITON of Southard\u2019s intention to place and ascend the ladder. Further, plaintiff failed to adduce any testimony that the TRITON was unseaworthy by reason of unfitness of the ladder or operational negligence on the part of the TRITON with respect to Southard\u2019s use of the ladder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\">We are, however, of the opinion that the District Court erred in directing the jury to return a verdict in favor of the defendant vessel because of its view that the plaintiff had failed to adduce \u201cany\u201d evidence of the vessel\u2019s alleged negligence in his Jones Act claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">Applicable to this issue are these well-settled principles:</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-6\"> Issues of negligence in a Jones Act suit \u201care questions for the jury to determine\u201d,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the jury \u201cplays a preeminent role\u201d in Jones Act cases.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1178-16\">Since the standard of liability under the Jones Act is that established by Congress under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cthe test of a jury case is simply whether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion that employer negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury or death for which damages are sought.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1178-17\">In a Jones Act case, a trial court can direct a jury verdict against a plaintiff <em>\u201conly </em>in those extremely rare instances where there is a <em>zero </em>probability either of employer negligence or that any such negligence contributed to the injury of an employee.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-18\">A ship must provide a safe place to work to a seaman, or one who performs tasks traditionally performed by a ship\u2019s crew; that duty encompasses a reasonably safe means of boarding, and departing from, the vessel, and failure to discharge it constitutes negligence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1178-19\">\u201cThe jury is the tribunal under our legal system to decide that type of issue [safe place to work],\u201d and, \u201c[t]o withdraw such a question from the jury is to usurp its functions\u201d, and \u201c[t]o deprive these workers of the benefit of a jury trial in close or doubtful cases is to take away a goodly portion of the relief which Congress has afforded them.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ACPH\">The record establishes that the District Court disregarded the foregoing principles in directing the jury to return a verdict in favor of the vessel on the issue of its negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>Viewing the evidence, and all reasonable inferences therefrom, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we hold that a jury question was presented by the plaintiff\u2019s evidence as to the vessel\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s evidence established these facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-6\">The TRITON advised the vessel by radio that it was \u201ccoming-to\u201d, and when it did so, two members of the crew of the vessel actively assisted the TRITON\u2019S deckhand in securing the tugboat to the vessel; the TRITON came-to and was secured to the vessel to effect Sou-thard\u2019s transfer from the tugboat to the vessel to \u201cassist the master of the vessel * * * in the [vessel\u2019s] docking\u201d; it was customary procedure for a member, or members, of a vessel\u2019s crew to hold the top of the ladder used for a docking master\u2019s boarding of the vessel and this procedure was not followed; the top of the ladder used by Southard to ascend from the tugboat to the vessel extended two or three feet above the vessel\u2019s bulwark railing, and Southard\u2019s \u201chead was just about at the top to the side of the ship\u2019s railing,\u201d when the ladder slipped, carrying Southard down with it; two members of the crew of the vessel were standing about five feet from the top of the ladder when it fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-17\">The jury could have reasonably found from the foregoing evidence that Southard was employed by the vessel to act as its docking master and that he was in the course of his employment when he was injured. The jury could also have reasonably found that while no actual notice was given to the vessel that Southard was about to come aboard, that the vessel had constructive notice by reason of the tugboat\u2019s coming-to and securing to the vessel. The jury could also have reasonably found that it should have become apparent to the two members of the vessel\u2019s crew that someone intended to come aboard the vessel when the top of the ladder extended two or three feet above the vessel\u2019s bulwark railing. Finally, the jury could have reasonably found that the vessel was negligent in failing to hold (via members of its crew) the top of the ladder in accordance with customary procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-18\">In conclusion, we find no merit in the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the District Court erred in excluding the testimony of its expert witness Captain Ash on the ground that he had not been properly listed as a witness as required by the District Court\u2019s Standing Order for Pretrial Conferences in other than Protracted Cases.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>did not abuse its permissible discretion in excluding this testimony.

Nabob, 302 F.2d 803 (3rd Cir. 1962), cert, den., 371 U.S. 870, 83 S.Ct. 136, 9 L.Ed.2d 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">For the reasons above stated the Judgment<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of the District Court, entered pursuant to its directed verdicts, will be affirmed insofar as it pertains to the defendants Independent Towing Company and Tugboat Triton Company, and reversed insofar as it pertains to the defendant Karl Grammerstorf, and the cause will be remanded to the District Court with directions to grant a new trial limited to the plaintiff\u2019s claim alleging negligence of the defendant vessel Karl Grammerstorf, inasmuch as the majority of this panel finds no error in the District Court\u2019s determination with respect to the plaintiff\u2019s unseaworthiness claim against the defendant vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">If the facts developed on remand show that Southard was in the employ of the defendant vessel when the accident occurred the Jones Act is applicable.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Alternatively, if the facts developed on remand show that Southard was an invitee of the defendant vessel when the accident occurred, the federal maritime law is applicable.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1177-12\">. 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 688.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1178-7\">.

Section 3 of the Standing Order of the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania governing \u201cPre-trial Conferences in Other Than Protracted Cases,\u201d adopted on October 23, 195S, provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1179-10\">\u201c3. * * * Plaintiff\u2019s pre-trial memorandum shall contain the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1179-12\">\u201cC The names and addresses of all witnesses (except rebuttal) whom the plaintiff expects to call to testify at the time of trial * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1179-13\">Section 4 of the Standing Order, adopted September 28, 1965, further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1179-14\">\u201c4.

I further concur in the conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to establish unseaworthiness of the KARL GRAM-MERSTORF. I disagree, however, that sufficient evidence of negligence was presented to establish a jury question under the Jones Act claim against the vessel\u2019s owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-11\">The majority of this panel find the following to constitute a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-12\">The jury could also have reasonably found that while no actual notice was given to the vessel that Southard was about to come aboard, that the vessel had constructive notice by reason of the tugboat\u2019s coming-to and securing to the vessel. The jury could also have reasonably found that it should have become apparent to the two members of the vessel\u2019s crew that someone intended to come aboard the vessel when the top of the ladder extended two or three feet above the vessel\u2019s bulwark railing. Finally, the jury could have reasonably found that the vessel was negligent in failing to hold (via members of its .crew) the top of the ladder in accordance with customary procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1180-13\">Plaintiff\u2019s evidence discloses that the standard operating procedure prior to disembarking from the tug and embarking on the vessel was for deckhand Tul-ewicz to place a ladder against the side of the vessel to be boarded, and then hold the ladder while the pilot made his ascent. This procedure was not followed by the pilot on this fatal day. Instead, before Tulewicz had arrived at the companionway to put up the ladder, Southard, without warning to the deckhand or to his mate, Captain Baric, suddenly erected the ladder himself and began his ill-fated climb. Southard did not wait for the ladder to be held at its bottom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>by the tug\u2019s crew or at its top by the crew aboard the vessel. Implicit in our unanimous finding that under these facts there was no <em>prima facie </em>case of unseaworthiness or negligence against the tug is that the sudden, precipitous, unexpected, and unconventional action of the captain relieved other members of his crew from responsibility and the tug and its owners from liability in negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-4\">Consistency and logic demand that we apply the same rationale in evaluating a possible breach of duty owed Southard by the vessel. In establishing this duty, the critical ingredient is notice to the vessel, either actual or constructive, that Southard was coming aboard at the precise time he made his abortive attempt. That the tug was coming to and securing to the vessel is not sufficient to establish notice that the pilot was attempting to come aboard at the very instant the mooring lines were secured. It was reasonable for the vessel only to anticipate that the ladder was to be expected alongside after the lapse of a time interval represented by Tulewicz\u2019s walking from his line-securing position on the tug to that point in the companionway where the ladder was stowed. Tulewicz testified he was enroute to where the ladder was usually stowed when, after walking 20 or 25 feet, he saw the captain falling from the already erected ladder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">I cannot impose upon the vessel the duty of foreseeing that the ladder would be erected against its side simultaneously with the securing of the lines. There is no evidence that such a procedure had ever been followed before, nor is it reasonable to conclude that the vessel should have expected it on this particular day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">Similarly, evidence that there were two men on the vessel near the top of the ladder and that the ladder projected two or three feet above the railing in itself is insufficient to establish negli-</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\">gence (a) in the absence of any proof of the length of time the men had been standing there when first observed by Captain Baric and (b) in the absence of evidence of whether they were there when the ladder had been put up. There is absolutely no evidence that any of the ship\u2019s crew were there when Captain Southard first erected the ladder against the vessel\u2019s side. Without appropriate evidence of critical elements of time, I find neither actual nor constructive notice to the vessel. Without such notice I would not charge them with failure to hold the ladder fast during Captain Southard\u2019s ascent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-8\">I would affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
