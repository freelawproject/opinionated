Lukens Steel Co., 310 U.S. 113, 60 S.Ct. 869, 84 L.Ed. 1108 (1940); Scanwell Laboratories, Inc. v. Shaffer, 137 U.S.App.D.C. 371, 424 F.2d 859 (1970); M. Steinthal &amp; Co. v. Seamans, 455 F.2d 1289 (D.C.Cir. 1971). Neither do we reach the issue as to whether the granting of the injunction was a proper exercise of the discretion of the trial court. We do not reach these issues because we conclude that the District Court abused its discretion in not vacating the injunction upon the representation by the Secretary of the Army that the National welfare will be materially affected by the injunction. On the basis of the affidavits on file we find the National interest to be of such overriding importance as to render the failure to vacate the injunction an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">We have not been cited any authority in which any Court of the United States has enjoined the acquisition of munitions after a responsible officer has certified such munitions as necessary for support of troops engaged in military operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">The cause is remanded to the District Court with instructions to vacate the injunction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
