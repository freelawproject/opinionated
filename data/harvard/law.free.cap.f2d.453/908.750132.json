See Isbell Enterprises, Inc. v. Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 5th Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b969-14\">GEWIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b969-15\">Appellants Frank DeLaughter, Lee Drane and Ed Fuller were each indicted on one count charging a violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 242<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and on one count charging a conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 371. After a three day trial by jury each of the appellants was convicted on the \u00a7 242 count. The jury was unable to agree as to the conspiracy charge, and a mistrial was declared as to all appellants on that count. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-16\">Since no evidentiary questions are presented on this appeal, it is unnecessary to state the facts in detail. The procedural issues presented for review do necessitate an outline of the circumstances out of which the alleged errors arose. On various occasions during the course of the trial the judge chose to question certain of the witnesses in order to facilitate an understanding of the facts. At one point the judge referred to the \u201cinexperienced prosecutor\u201d in explanation of his questioning, but he admonished the jury not to give any more weight to his questions than to those of counsel. On at least three other occasions he gave similar cautionary instructions to the jury. In his instructions he advised the jury that they were not to infer from his questioning of witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>that he had any opinion about the guilt of the defendants. He stated that his only purpose in asking questions was to fully develop the true facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">After the jury retired to deliberate they returned to the courtroom and asked for additional instructions and clarification concerning the conspiracy count. The judge complied with the request and the jury again retired. After further deliberations the jury returned to the courtroom for the purpose of asking a question. The judge advised the foreman that he did not wish to know where they stood in their deliberations. The foreman then stated \u201cI guess we are hung then\u201d; to which the trial judge replied that he had no alternative but to declare a mistrial. At that point the government prosecutor suggested to the judge that the foreman be permitted to submit the question in writing. Over appellants\u2019 objections the question was submitted in writing to the judge. Appellants\u2019 motion for a mistrial was overruled. The judge called the attorneys for both sides to the bench to view the paper received from the jury. He then asked if the jury had reached a unanimous verdict on one count. Upon receiving an affirmative answer from the foreman, the judge sent the jury back to write out their verdict on that count. The jury retired and returned five minutes later with a verdict of guilty as to count one. After a poll of the jury, which reflected a unanimous verdict, the judge ordered that the verdict as to count one be entered as the judgment of the court and that a mistrial be declared as to count two.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">Appellants raise three issues which we state in the language used in their brief. We will discuss each specified error separately.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-10\">1. Once the trial court had declared a mistrial, the trial terminated, and it was error to permit the jury to continue its deliberations, and all ensuing verdicts were null and void.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b970-11\">When a jury should be discharged for failure to agree is within the sound discretion of the trial court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The initial response of the trial court to the foreman\u2019s statement, \u201cI guess we are hung then\u201d, did not, in our view, constitute a ruling by the court or an exercise of its discretion. The appellants contend that after the above mentioned incident occurred the jury deliberated further. We disagree. . The record reveals that the jury returned to the jury room not to deliberate, but to write out the verdict on the count upon which they had agreed. Even assuming that the jury was permitted to deliberate further, no error was committed. It is permissible for a court to direct additional deliberation after being advised of a jury\u2019s inability to agree.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is also permissible for a jury, as here, to render a partial verdict; a court may accept a jury\u2019s verdict as to one count and declare a mistrial as to another upon which no agreement has been reached.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-12\">2. It was reversible error for the Court to permit the jury to communicate with the prosecutor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b970-13\">The record bluntly refutes this argument. The foreman\u2019s statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>was submitted in writing to the judge, not to the prosecutor. Such a communication is permissible.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-5\">3. Over defense counsel\u2019s objection of the trial judge\u2019s questioning of the witnesses, the comment by the trial judge in explanation of his questioning as to \u201cinexperienced prosecution\u201d was prejudicial and reversible error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">It is true that in some circumstances a trial judge could so interfere with the conduct of a trial that a fair trial could not be had. But our study of the record in this case convinces us that this contention is without merit. The tenor of the judge\u2019s questions did not tend to benefit the prosecution only; they were equally as helpful to the appellants. The questions asked were pertinent and generally related to a valid inquiry into material facts. It is within the discretion of a trial judge to question witnesses if he deems it necessary. It is only when the judge\u2019s questions are prejudicial to the defendant that error is committed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We find no abuse of the court\u2019s discretion or prejudice to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">The judge\u2019s reference to an \u201cinexperienced prosecutor\u201d, while perhaps unwise, cannot be said to be prejudicial in view of the repeated instructions to the jury that they were the sole judges of the facts and that they were to give no more weight to the court\u2019s questions than to those of counsel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Even if we should accept appellants\u2019 contention that the court\u2019s comment was error, we are convinced that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b969-17\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-18\">Whoever, under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom, willfully subjects any inhabitant of any State, Territory, or District to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by tlie Constitution or laws of the United States, or to different punishments, pains, or penalties, on account of such inhabitant being an alien, or by reason of his color, or race, than are prescribed for the punishment of citizens, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both; and if death results shall be subject to imprisonment for any term of years or for life.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b970-5\">. <em>E. g., </em>United States v.
