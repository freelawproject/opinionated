Findings of fact and conclusions of law were thereafter entered, containing the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-23\">\u201cTestimony elicited at the eviden-tiary hearing before this Court on the instant petition yields the inescapable conclusion that petitioners counsel had sufficient time to insure an adequate defense [proceeding to recite the circumstances] .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-24\">The District Court further found the guilty pleas to have been voluntarily entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-25\">A review of the record demonstrates that these findings are not clearly erroneous and the judgment denying ha-beas relief must accordingly be</p>\n<p id=\"b948-26\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
