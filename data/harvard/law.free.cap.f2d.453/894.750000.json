Therefore, the appellant\u2019s allegations of constitutional deprivations will not be entertained in a federal forum until they have been presented to the courts of the State of Texas, either upon the appellant\u2019s direct criminal appeal, or upon a motion filed pursuant to Article 11.07, Vernon\u2019s Ann.Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. Weaver v. Texas, 5th Cir. 1971, 441 F.2d 388; Thomas v. Decker, 5th Cir. 1970, 434 F.2d 1033; Texas v. Payton, 5th Cir. 1968, 390 F.2d 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-25\">This panel recently held in Williams v. Wainwright, 452 F.2d 775 (5th Cir., 1971), in an opinion by Judge Roney and a special concurrence by Chief Judge Brown, that a judgment dismiss<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>ing a petition for the writ of habeas corpus for failure to exhaust state remedies should specify the state remedies not exhausted by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-4\">In the case at bar the record does not indicate that there had been a trial in the state court, hence no appeal and no post-trial proceedings.. The petition should have been dismissed for want of jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254(b) as it is not shown that petitioner was held pursuant to judgment of a state court. But dismissed it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
