For each of the four convictions, defendant was sentenced to fifteen years in the penitentiary with ten years suspended, conditioned upon his good behavior. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-14\">Defendant was arrested on the night of April 19, 1976, by police conducting a search of his home in Woodbridge. During the search, police seized certain controlled substances and alleged drug paraphernalia. The search warrant had been issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>earlier that day by a magistrate based upon an affidavit sworn to by Officer Bennett of the Prince William County Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-5\">Before the trial, defendant moved to suppress all the fruits of the search. Denying the motion, and admitting the evidence, the trial court commented that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-6\">\u201cthe factual allegations and the affidavit covering early April, 1976 relating to the White Crosses, plus the information that the Defendant is selling White Crosses, plus the information received in the past 24 hours constitutes sufficient factual allegations which, when added to the earlier information, are sufficient to establish probable cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1182-7\">The affidavit, upon which the search warrant was issued, is set out in the margin.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>Defendant contends that the affidavit does not contain sufficient underlying facts to establish probable cause under the test required by <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108 (1964), and <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">Before a magistrate is justified in issuing a search warrant, he must be satisfied that probable cause to search exists at.the time the warrant issues. <em>Sgro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>287 U.S. 206, 210-11 (1932); <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 67, 189 S.E.2d 353 (1972). Thus, circumstances occurring substantially before the issuance of a search warrant can justify the issuance of the warrant only if such past circumstances disclose \u201ca probable cause\u201d of continuous nature so as to support a rational conclusion that the past probable cause is still operative at the time of the issuance of the warrant. <em>Sgro </em>v. <em>United States, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1185-7\">In <em>Stovall, </em>we held that while time alone is not controlling, evidence that a person possessed an illegal drug 72 days prior to the issuance of a search warrant was insufficient by itself to establish probable cause. However, an affidavit containing this type of stale information can be used to establish probable cause if it also contains additional facts showing that the evidence of criminal conduct could still be found at the place to be searched. 213 Va. at 70-71, 189 S.E.2d at 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-8\">The affidavit in the instant case contains information about defendant\u2019s alleged criminal conduct during 1972, 1973, and on or about November 15, 1975.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The interval between these events and April 19,1976, when the warrant was issued, is considerably longer than the interval in <em>Stovall. </em>This information, standing alone, is not sufficient to support a finding of probable cause on the date the warrant was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-9\">We must, therefore, consider whether the remaining portion of the affidavit states additional facts from which the magistrate could rationally conclude that defendant\u2019s alleged criminal activity continued until April 19, 1976, when the warrant issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-10\">The only matters in the affidavit dealing with events subsequent to the November 1975 \u201ccontrolled buy\u201d can be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>(1) In early April 1976, the affiant received information from the anonymous informant that Pierceall had recently been \u201cgetting some white crosses [a controlled drug] in;\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-5\">(2) Information received by the affiant leads him to believe that Pierceall is presently selling quantities of \u201cwhite crosses;\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-6\">(3) Within the past 24 hour period, the informant told the affiant that Pierceall \u201cpresently has a large number of \u2018white crosses\u2019 at his home ... as well as a quantity of marijuana, marijuana smoking pipes and other related paraphernalia of drug use;\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-7\">(4) The informant had furnished the affiant information of illegal drug activity in the past which the affiant found to be correct as a result of an independent investigation, and that affiant believed the informant, \u201cdue to the \u2018controlled buy\u2019 situation in November 1975, was credible and his information reliable;\u201d and</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-8\">(5) Affiant\u2019s statement that defendant has been seen often in the company of known and suspected drug users and dealers; and that on the night of April 19, 1976, defendant was seen at a restaurant in the company of a convicted drug dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-9\">An affidavit for a search warrant based upon information from an informant must describe (1) some of the underlying circumstances necessary to enable a neutral and detached magistrate to judge the validity of the informant\u2019s conclusion that the evidence sought was where he claimed it was; and (2) the underlying circumstances from which the magistrate can determine that the affiant\u2019s unnamed informant was credible or his information reliable. <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, supra; Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, supra; Guzewicz </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 730, 732, 187 S.E.2d 144, 146 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-10\">The dispositive question is whether the affidavit met the first requirement of the two-pronged <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>i.e., </em>whether it described some of the underlying circumstances necessary to enable the magistrate to judge the validity of the informant\u2019s conclusion that the narcotics were in Pierceall\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-11\">A determination whether probable cause exists for the issuance of a search warrant should be \u201cbased upon a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>common-sense reading of the entire affidavit.\u201d <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>393 U.S. at 415; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca, </em>380 U.S. 102, 108 (1965). <em>See Huff v. Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 710, 717, 194 S.E.2d 690, 696 (1973). In <em>Spinelli, </em>the Supreme Court indicated that a tip, which by itself does not establish probable cause, may properly be considered by a magistrate, and other portions of the affidavit may support the tip so as to \u201cpermit the suspicions engendered by the informant\u2019s report to ripen into a judgment that a crime was probably being committed.\u201d 393 U.S. at 418. Upon a fair reading of the entire affidavit in the present case, we hold that probable cause was established.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-5\">The informant made the controlled buy of marijuana on November 15, 1975, in Pierceall\u2019s residence. He reported to the affiant-officer immediately after the transaction that there was approximately a pound of marijuana in the house and that \u201cat least 50 marijuana plants\u201d were being grown by Pierceall in a bedroom in the lower portion of the dwelling. It is apparent, from the informant\u2019s prompt admittance to the residence, his speedy consummation of the purchase, and his report to the affiant, that he enjoyed the confidence of Pierceall, was a marijuana customer of his, and was familiar with at least a part of the interior of the residence. Moreover, the supervised growth of many marijuana plants by Pierceall indicated a continuing enterprise in the production and distribution of marijuana rather than occasional or isolated incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-6\">The affiant stated that on April 19, 1976, the date on which the search warrant was issued, he observed Pierceall in the company of Joseph Rowe, a known drug user who had been convicted in 1973 of two counts of selling marijuana and who \u201cis presently known to be active in the drug scene.\u201d Defendant maintains that the reference to Rowe\u2019s present activities is a conclusory statement which, under <em>Guzewicz </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 730, 187 S.E.2d 144 (1972), must be disregarded. In <em>Guzeuricz, </em>the affidavit included a statement that the affiant, a police officer, had personal knowledge that the premises to be Searched were \u201cfrequented by persons known to him to be unlawful users of controlled drugs.\u201d Relying on <em>Spinelli, supra, </em>393 U.S. at 418-19, we accorded no probative value to the conclusory statement. We acknowledged doubt, however, in light of the diverse views expressed in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>403 U.S. 573 (1971), as to the continuing validity of this aspect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number><em>Spinelli. </em>Although <em>Spinelli </em>has not been further clarified in this regard, we believe that probative value may be accorded the officer\u2019s statement that he had observed Pierceall, on the very day that application for the warrant was made, in the company of a man known to the affiant as a drug dealer, where the statement was supported by the fact that Rowe had previously been convicted of two counts of selling marijuana. Additional information in the affidavit also established a pattern of association by Pierceall with other convicted drug traffickers over a period of years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-5\">As in <em>Huff, supra, </em>the investigation of the accused in the present case had extended over a long period of time. Pierceall had been identified with the drug traffic and with known and suspected drug users and distributors since 1972. Some of the inculpatory information comprised no more than unconfirmed rumors, but some was detailed information received from police officers and from employees of Pierceall.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-6\">In <em>Huff, </em>we held that the \u201ccommonsense conclusion\u201d to be drawn from facts establishing a pattern of criminal practice by the accused was that the pattern probably was continuing at the time of the affidavit, that it would probably continue until the warrant was executed, and that drugs would probably be found at that time at Huff\u2019s residence. 213 Va. at 717, 194 S.E.2d at 696. Here, there was an affirmative, unequivocal representation by a reliable informant within 24 hours of the execution of the affidavit that the pattern of criminal conduct was continuing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-7\">The present affidavit is distinguishable from the one found insufficient in <em>Stovall. </em>There, the affidavit contained information as to possession of controlled drugs during the period August 21 to September 9. The affidavit further stated that the affiant, a police officer, had received information from another named police officer on November 20, the date the search warrant was issued, that the suspect \u201chas a large quantity of marijuana\u201d in his residence. We held that the information as to possession of drugs in August,and September was too stale, and that the current information consisted of a mere conclusory statement without supporting facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-8\">In the present case, however, the tip in early April and the last tip received shortly before issuance of the warrant on April 19, 1976, were furnished by the same person who five months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>previously had entered defendant\u2019s residence, made the controlled buy, and observed a pound of marijuana and the growing marijuana plants. We believe it is reasonable to infer that the informant\u2019s last tip, unlike the officer\u2019s unsupported conclusory statement in <em>Stovall, </em>was based upon personal observation. We conclude that the affidavit, taken as a whole, states sufficient underlying circumstances to support the magistrate\u2019s finding of probable cause. <em>See Manley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 146, 176 S.E.2d 309 (1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>403 U.S. 936 (1971), where we upheld an affidavit based upon the personal observation of the informant, who also stated, against his penal interest, that he had been participating with the suspect in the illegal use of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-4\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the trial court will be</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1182-8\">\u201cDuring the fall of 1972, I received unconfirmed information from various informants regarding one WILLIAM PlERCEALL who was and is the owner/operator of the Dale City Sunoco (service station) at 3125 Davis Ford Road, Woodbridge, Virginia. The information given me was that PlERCEALL was trafficking in marijuana and other drugs. That is to say that PlERCEALL buys illicit controlled substances, marijuana and other drugs, for a price and then re-sells the material at a substantial profit. This information could riot be confirmed at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-9\">\u201cOn July 23, 1973, Investigator C. T. Deane, also of the Prince William County police department, told me that on July 19, 1973, he had arrested two persons, MICHAEL STEVEN JENKINS and ROGER ALLEN HURT, charging them with a burglary of the Dale City Sunoco Service Station (owned by subject PlERCEALL) on July 12, 1973. Investigator Deane told me that both had confessed to this crime after having been advised of their rights, and that MICHAEL STEVEN JENKINS told him that during the time that he (JENKINS) had worked for PlERCEALL, he (JENKINS) had seen a case placed in the office area of the station by PlERCEALL which contained two (2) wrapped kilos (1 Kilo = 2.2 lbs.) of marijuana. JENKINS told Investigator Deane that PlERCEALL had left the bag at the station that night and had telephoned him (JENKINS) to see if it was still there. JENKINS indicated that he was a user of marijuana and therefore could recognize same.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-10\">\u201cInvestigator Deane told me that subject ROGER ALLEN HURT had been interviewed separately from subject JENKINS and that HURT stated that he also had seen the two kilos of marijuana which had allegedly belonged to PlERCEALL. At that time HURT was also an employee of WILLIAM PlERCEALL at the Dale City Sunoco Service Station.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-11\">\u201cInvestigator Deane also told me that JENKINS had told him that one WILLIAM \u2018BILLY\u2019 WOOTEN at the Dale City Sunoco service station was \u2018selling marijuana for PlERCEALL\u2019. WILLIAM \u2018BILLY\u2019 WOOTEN is personally known to this investigator. He has the general reputation of a drug user and dealer in various drugs and marijuana. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>\u201cOn July 25, 1973, Officer W. P. Metheny of the Prince William County Police Department who at that time was working undercover, purchased a quantity of cocaine from KIPPY EUGENE ROGERS, an employee of WILLIAM LOUIS PlERCEALL at the Dale City Sunoco Service Station. On July 31, 1973, Officer Metheny purchased a quantity of methampethamine [sic] from subject ROGERS. Both these sales took place in a house approximately 75 yards from the Dale City Sunoco Service Station, which was rented by ROGERS and others. ROGERS was subsequently arrested, tried and convicted on these two felonies. Another resident of the house occupied by KIPPY EUGENE ROGERS during this period of time was ROGER ALLEN HURT. Both ROGERS and HURT were employed by PlERCEALL at the Dale City Sunoco Service Station.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">\u201cI have learned that on August 29, 1973, WILLIAM LOUIS PlERCEALL was arrested in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in the company of KIPPY EUGENE ROGERS and two other men all of whom were charged with possession of restricted weapons (three (3) loaded handguns), possession of narcotics (cocaine) and conspiracy. Investigators of the Metropolitan Toronto Police questioned these men and learned that PlERCEALL was involved in an unknown business transaction with a man named ARTHUR ISREAL and that ISREAL had absconded with $3,000.00. PlERCEALL had gone to Toronto on August 26, 1973 and located ISREAL in that city. PlERCEALL then returned to Virginia where he hired KIPPY EUGENE ROGERS and two (2) other men to return to Toronto, find ISREAL and \u2018work him over\u2019 until he returned the $3,000.00. ROGERS and the other men were to be paid $200.00 each for their services. The Metropolitan Toronto Police Department believed that the four men actually planned to murder subject ISREAL and further believed that the $3,000.00 ISREAL absconded with was a drug \u2018rip-off\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-6\">\u201cIt may be noted that WILLIAM LOUIS PlERCEALL, aka: \u2018BILL\u2019 PlERCEALL has been seen often in the company of known and suspected drug users and dealers in this community. A goodly portion of his associates are active in the illicit drug scene, and several have lived at PIERCEALL\u2019S house at 13401 Kingsman Road, Woodbridge, Virginia, Prince William County for various lengths of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-7\">\u201cIn November 1975,1 developed an informant who gave me additional information concerning WILLIAM LOUIS PlERCEALL. This informant desires to remain anonymous as he fears for his safety should his identity be made known. The informant stated that PlERCEALL \u2018had a gun and would use it\u2019 on him (the informant).</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-8\">\u201cThe informant agreed to make a \u2018controlled buy\u2019 of marijuana from \u2018BILL\u2019 PlERCEALL at PIERCEALL\u2019S house located at 13401 Kingsman Road, Woodbridge, Virginia on or about November 15, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-9\">\u201cI met the informant at a pre-designated location at approximately 5:15 p.m. At this time I searched the informant and his/her car and thus assured myself that there was no marijuana or other controlled substances present. In addition, I removed the informant\u2019s personal money. I then furnished the informant $35.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-10\">\u201cAt 5:30 p.m. the informant departed enroute to 13401 Kingsman Road (BILL PIERCEALL\u2019S house), and I followed in my car, observing the informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-11\">\u201cI observed the informant arrive and enter 13401 Kingsman Road at 5:44 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"AyHc\">\u201cAt 6:01 p.m. the informant was seen to exit 13401 Kingsman Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-12\">\u201cI then followed fixe informant back to a pre-designated meeting place where the informant turned over a plastic bag of marijuana to me which the informant stated had been purchased from \u2018BILL\u2019 PlERCEALL for $35.00. Subsequent chemical analysis of the material purchased on this date conducted by a chemist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>at the Bureau of Forensic Science (State laboratory) revealed the material to be in fact, marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-5\">\u201cThe informant also stated that approximately one (1) pound of marijuana was then within PIERCEALL\u2019S house, along with \u2018at least 50 marijuana plants\u2019 which were being grown by BILL PIERCEALL in one bedroom in the lower portion of the house (13401 Kingsman Road, Woodridge, Virginia).</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-6\">\u201cIn early April 1976, I received additional information from the informant regarding WILLIAM LOUIS \u2018BILL\u2019 PIERCEALL to the effect that PIERCEALL had recently been \u2018getting some white crosses in\u2019. NOTE: White Cross is a jargon term on [sic] the drug culture which refers to a type of small white pill of amphetamine and/or methamphetamine which has a scored mark in the shape of a cross on [sic] X on one side. They are also called \u2018cartwheels\u2019 and \u2018speed\u2019. \u2018Speed\u2019 refers to any preparation of a stimulent [sic] nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-7\">\u201cI base my knowledge of current drug terms, prices, appearance, etc., on the following facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-8\">\u201cI am now and have been a full time narcotics enforcement officer with four (4) years experience exclusively in narcotics enforcement and a total of 13 years in law enforcement. I have received specialized training in narcotics' enforcement through the U. S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. I am a member in good standing of the International Association of Narcotics Enforcement Officer\u2019s and have read various books, etc., on the subject as well as having completed a number of college level classes related to special enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-9\">\u201cI also maintain an informant system which allows me continuing contact with the street terms, prices, etc., of various drugs and controlled substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-10\">\u201cI have received information regarding WILLIAM LOUIS PIERCEALL which leads me to believe that he is presently selling quantities of \u2018white crosses\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-11\">\u201cWithin the past 24 hour period, I have received information from the informant as follows: The informant told me that William \u2018Bill\u2019 Pierceall presently has a large number of \u2018white crosses\u2019 at his home at 13401 Kingsman Rd. Woodbridge, Va. as well as a quantity of marijuana, marijuana smoking pipes and other related paraphernalia of drug use. I believe the information received from this person to be reliable, as the informant has provided me with information on several occasions in the past which independent investigation has proven to be true and correct. For example, the informant on one occasion told me that a certain person was dealing in a particular type of drug at a given point in time. I had, through prior investigation, determined that this information was correct, unbeknownst to the informant. The informant has provided this type of information on several occasions. In addition, I am forther [sic] inclined to believe the informant due to the \u2018controlled buy\u2019 situation in November 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-12\">\u201cOn the evening of April 19, 1976 I observed William \u2018Bill\u2019 Pierceall in the company of one Joseph Rowe at the Hardee\u2019s restaurant in the Glendale Shopping Center Woodbridge, Va. Joseph Rowe is a known drug user and is a convicted felon having been convicted in 1973 of 2 counts of sale of marijuana to Inv. D. L. Cahill of the Prince William County Police. He is presently known to be active in the drug scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-13\">\u201cI therefore believe that based on the information provided by the informant and the fact that I personally seen William \u2018Bill\u2019 Pierceall in the company of a known Drug dealer within the past 24 hours, that there is now concealed within the premises of 13401 Kingsman Rd., Woodbridge, Va. Prince William County, a quantity of contraband controlled substances possessed in violation of existing law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1185-11\"> We believe that the allegations concerning the November 1975 occurrence would have supported a finding of probable cause had the search warrant issued then.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1186-12\"> Defendant does not contend that the second prong of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test was not met.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
